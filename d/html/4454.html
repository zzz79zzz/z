However, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada considers a planned home birth with a registered midwife or appropriately trained physician in their integrated system as a reasonable choice for persons with a low degree of risk where the birth is anticipated to be uncomplicated and neither the birthing parent nor the neonate will require resources beyond the local capacity [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>Some advocates of home birth see hospital birth as the medicalization of a natural process. They acknowledge that hospitals have resources that are important for saving lives in an emergency but point out that most births are uncomplicated. When these low-risk births occur in hospitals, there is an increased chance of loss of personal control over the birth process and unnecessary medical intervention, which can lead to poorer outcomes. In addition, they view the home as a more comfortable environment for giving birth because of the familiar surroundings, relaxed milieu, and greater intimacy with the partner and other family/friends. A majority of individuals choosing home birth are multiparous with a prior hospital birth, and in some cases, their plan for home birth is in response to a past unsatisfactory experience [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss issues related to planned home birth in high-resource countries/regions where hospital birth is readily available and planned home birth is a choice rather than a necessity. Planned delivery at a birth center is reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4456.html" rel="external">"Birth centers"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PREVALENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prevalence and epidemiology of home birth for many industrialized countries are not readily available, but some information is known:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sample global statistics</strong> – In the past decade, reported prevalence of home birth was 0.1 percent in Sweden, 0.4 percent in Australia, 1.1 percent in Japan, 1.2 percent in Canada, 2.1 percent in England, 3.3 percent in New Zealand, and 14 percent in the Netherlands [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Of note, the prevalence of home birth in the Netherlands has steadily declined by approximately 1 percent per year: from approximately 75 percent in 1953 to 14 percent in 2021. This reduction has been attributed to negative publicity about the safety of home birth, a requirement that midwives counsel their patients about the high referral rates during labor, the high proportion of immigrants not familiar with home birth, and the increasing demand for epidural anesthesia [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>US statistics</strong> – Data released by the National Center for Health Statistics showed that the proportion of home births in the United States in 2022 was the highest since home births were first recorded in 1990 [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. A total of 1.47 percent of births (54,071) occurred at home in 2022 . A total of 85 percent of these were planned (a higher proportion than in past years), resulting in a planned home birth rate of 1.26 percent, which is the highest proportion since planning status has been included on the birth certificate. The states in which the rate of planned home birth exceeded 2 percent were Idaho, Montana, Vermont, Wisconsin, Utah, Pennsylvania, Maine, Wyoming, Alaska, Hawaii, Washington, and Oregon.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Planned home births were far more common among non-Hispanic White people (2.06 percent) than among non-Hispanic Black (0.47 percent), Hispanic (0.42 percent), non-Hispanic Asian (0.31 percent), or people. Individuals who had a planned home birth were also more likely to be older, multiparous, born in the United States, have a body mass index in the normal range, and live in a nonmetropolitan county  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120096" href="/d/graphic/120096.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Nationally, 76 percent of individuals who had a home birth reported paying out-of-pocket for the birth, and 2.8 percent did not report having had prenatal care . Approximately 39 percent of individuals who had a planned home birth were college graduates.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Impact of</strong> <strong>COVID-pandemic</strong> – A 2021 increase in planned home birth in some countries was likely attributable, at least in part, to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the 15 months before the COVID-19 pandemic (ie, 2019 and the first quarter of 2020), the proportion of planned home births in the US was 0.80 percent, but increased to 1.08 percent in the last nine months of 2020 and all of 2021, an increase of 35 percent during the pandemic. Planned home birth increased slightly to 1.26 percent in 2022 even though the effects of the pandemic declined. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">While there were multiple reports in the popular press documenting pregnant individuals' concerns about giving birth in hospitals struggling to care for COVID-19 patients, limited systematic research is available on the relationship between COVID-19 and home birth decisions in the US. Two studies found marked increases in the number of Google searches for home birth after the beginning of the pandemic [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. In one, the proportion of such searches increased by 239 percent after the beginning of the pandemic [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1774360491"><span class="h1">WHY DO INDIVIDUALS CHOOSE HOME BIRTH?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is little systematic research on the motivation of individuals in high-resource countries who plan home birth. Most studies report survey data from select groups of pregnant people who describe themselves as being more self-reliant, more comfortable with their own intuition than with professional advice, adverse to medical intervention and technology, and confident about the normality of childbirth and their bodies' inherent ability to give birth without interference [<a href="#rid5">5,11,12</a>]. These individuals choose to give birth at home for many reasons, including [<a href="#rid5">5,13-18</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A desire for a low-intervention birth, in particular avoidance of induction of labor, artificial rupture of membranes, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9734" href="/d/drug information/9734.html" rel="external">oxytocin</a>, continuous fetal monitoring, epidural analgesia, pharmacologic pain relief, prophylactic antibiotics, episiotomy, forceps- or vacuum-assisted vaginal birth, and cesarean birth. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A concern about iatrogenic complications of hospital birth.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fear of and dissatisfaction with hospital care from previous negative hospital experiences [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cultural or religious concerns (eg, Amish population or member of a religion that proscribes male birth attendants).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A desire to maximize freedom of choice and personal control in the birth process.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A desire to give birth in a comfortable, familiar environment surrounded by family and friends.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A desire to avoid maternal and newborn separation and exposure to practices that undermine the initiation and success of lactation (eg, encouragement of supplementation with formula and use of pacifiers).</p><p></p><p>For some individuals, however, home birth is not their preference but becomes a default option because of lack of access to transportation, lack of insurance/financial resources, lack of a local maternity facility, or lack of a local maternity facility that offers a trial of labor to patients with higher-risk clinical scenarios (eg, frank breech presentation, previous low transverse cesarean birth), thus leaving the patient with a difficult choice between a higher-risk home birth versus an unnecessary cesarean birth [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h1">IS HOME BIRTH A SAFE OPTION?</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H649103210"><span class="h2">Overview</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is no completely risk-free site for giving birth [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. The safety of planned home birth depends on selecting appropriate candidates (low-risk pregnancies in multiparous individuals) and developing a high-quality home birth program, including the training/credentials of home birth providers, access to supplies and equipment, a reliable transportation system for transfer to hospital, good communication/relationship between home and hospital clinical providers, and a clearly defined system for care after transfer [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Program organization'</a> below.)</p><p>Home birth is well integrated into the health care system in England, Iceland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, parts of Canada, and, to a lesser extent, Washington state (United States). Cohort studies from such regions have generally found that, compared with planned hospital birth, planned home birth is associated with reduced rates of cesarean birth and medical interventions and similar rates of morbidity and mortality except for higher neonatal mortality in births to primiparous individuals [<a href="#rid23">23-37</a>]. In a report by the United States National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, compared with low-risk individuals choosing hospital birth, low-risk individuals choosing home birth had lower rates of intrapartum intervention and lower rates of intervention-related maternal morbidity [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. The risk of neonatal death, while low in absolute terms, was significantly higher in home births as compared with low-risk hospital births with midwives. In Washington state, where midwifery practice in out-of-hospital settings is integrated into the overall maternity system, maternal and neonatal birth outcomes were similar for births planned at home or at a state-licensed, freestanding birth center [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Evidence'</a> below.)</p><p>However, there are significant limitations to the quality of data available for analysis and, in some cases, on the methodological quality of the studies themselves [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. For example, studies that report outcomes of individuals who actually birthed at home rather than those who planned home births (which includes hospital transfers of complicated births) favorably bias the outcome of the home birth group. Similarly, studies that do not appropriately match the planned home birth group to the planned hospital birth group in terms of medical/obstetric risk and parity are also biased if the home birth group is dominated by low-risk, multiparous individuals while the hospital group has a high proportion of high-risk, nulliparous individuals [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Ideally, studies should ascertain and describe provider training/credentialing, whether fetal demise occurred antepartum versus intrapartum, the definition of planned status, how planned home births delivered in hospital after intrapartum transfer were tracked, and serious neonatal outcomes other than death (eg, neurodevelopmental impairment).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3254001087"><span class="h2">Evidence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Representative examples of studies reporting outcomes of planned home birth are described below. These examples provide data on absolute and relative risks and provide insight about differences in study design.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H654111635"><span class="h3">Meta-analyses</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a 2019 meta-analysis of 14 cohort studies comparing the perinatal outcomes of approximately 500,000 planned home births among low-risk individuals in well-resourced countries with those of similarly low-risk individuals with planned hospital births [<a href="#rid40">40</a>], perinatal outcomes were similar in both groups:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Perinatal or neonatal mortality in nulliparous individuals:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Home-birth settings where midwives are well integrated into health services: odds ratio (OR) 1.07 (95% CI 0.70-1.65)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Home-birth settings where midwives are less integrated into health services: OR 3.17 (95% CI 0.73-13.76)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Perinatal or neonatal mortality in multiparous individuals:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Home-birth settings where midwives are well integrated into health services: OR 1.08 (95% CI 0.84-1.38)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Home-birth settings where midwives are less integrated into health services: OR 1.58 (95% CI 0.50-5.03)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Odds of neonatal intensive care unit admission, Apgar scores, and need for resuscitation were also similar.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The planned site of delivery was based on the individual's plan at the onset of labor; those who planned a home birth but had antepartum complications necessitating delivery in a hospital or who changed their mind before the onset of labor were not included in the planned home-birth cohort. Strengths of this analysis were that the highest-quality studies came from large registries in places where midwives providing home birth care were well integrated into the health care system, appropriate control groups were used (low-risk hospital births from the same region and time frame as the home births), results were stratified by parity, and planned home births that transferred to the hospital in labor were included in the analysis of the planned-home-birth group.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a 2018 meta-analysis of outcomes by planned place of birth in low-risk pregnancies in high-income countries, individuals planning a home birth had statistically significant higher odds of a normal vaginal birth, intact perineum, nonsevere perineal trauma, and avoiding severe (≥1000 mL) postpartum hemorrhage compared with those planning a hospital birth [<a href="#rid41">41</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a 2010 meta-analysis of 12 studies from Western countries evaluating outcomes associated with over 342,000 planned home births and over 207,000 planned hospital births, home birth was associated with lower rates of interventions, reductions in morbidity to the birthing individual, and comparable levels of perinatal deaths, but a higher rate of neonatal mortality [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. A large proportion of the cases came from a Dutch study that examined only perinatal mortality [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. When the authors of the Dutch study reanalyzed their data to include neonatal mortality (&gt;466,000 home births), they reported similar neonatal mortality up to 28 days after birth for planned home births and planned hospital births (nulliparous individuals: OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.70-1.34; multiparous individuals: OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.70-1.62) [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. This study had a large impact on the two more recent meta-analyses reported above.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2603058600"><span class="h3">Home birth in the United States</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The largest prospective study of home birth in the United States (excluded from the 2019 meta-analysis above) included nearly 17,000 low-risk individuals who delivered between 2004 and 2009, utilized a midwife as their primary caregiver, and planned to deliver at home [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. These individuals were healthy, mostly multiparous (78 percent), of above-average education and income, and averse to intervention. Data for the analysis were obtained from a database that included almost 200 variables recorded by professional midwives. Data from hospital births were not available for comparison. Major findings were:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Rates of medical intervention for home births were consistently low: episiotomy rate 1.4 percent, assisted vaginal birth 1.2 percent, and cesarean birth rate 5.2 percent (based on the cases transferred to the hospital).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Approximately 11 percent of patients were transferred to a hospital intrapartum, and an additional 1.5 percent were transferred postpartum.

The risk for poor neonatal outcome was higher in births to primiparous individuals compared with multiparous individuals, in breech births compared with vertex presentations, and in births to individuals with a prior cesarean birth.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A well-designed retrospective study from the United States (excluded from the 2019 meta-analysis above) used revised birth certificate data to compare outcomes of out-of-hospital births (both home and birth center births) with hospital births [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. It included 3203 individuals who planned and completed an out-of-hospital birth (1968 at home and 1235 at a birth center), 601 individuals who planned an out-of-hospital birth but delivered in the hospital after intrapartum transfer, and 75,923 individuals with full-term planned hospital births irrespective of risk factors for pregnancy complications.

The Dutch system is probably the best model of planned home birth for a resource-abundant country, given the high rate of successful home births in the Netherlands. The Netherlands is unique among such countries in its strong reliance on independent direct-entry midwives, a widespread view among families that birth is a natural process, a generalized questioning of the use of technological interventions in medicine, a view of obstetricians as specialists in high-risk births only, and a pride in the uniqueness of their status as the center for planned home birth among resource-abundant countries [<a href="#rid50">50,51</a>].</p><p>Key features of the Dutch-home-birth program include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A highly organized system of midwifery care. Dutch midwives are trained in a four-year program that prepares them to practice in the hospital or in the home and to recognize and manage some pregnancy complications. Early pregnancy care is primarily delivered by independently practicing midwives. If complications occur or threaten to occur, the midwife refers the patient to an obstetrician at the secondary or tertiary care level. At that point, the patient is no longer eligible for home birth.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Formal agreements for collaboration between professional groups (home and hospital midwives, obstetricians, pediatric providers, hospital labor and delivery units) potentially involved in home births.

The Verloskundig Vademecum (Obstetric Manual) provides a clear distinction between individuals at low risk and those at high risk of problems during pregnancy, labor, and delivery. It also includes a list of obstetric indications for referral from primary to secondary care, based on best evidence or consensus. In this system, midwives are trained to identify escalation of birthing risk when it occurs; families, midwives, and secondary providers are receptive to timely transfer to secondary care when the need arises; and the secondary team is able to respond rapidly when the patient arrives at the hospital.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Formal protocols for home-to-hospital transfer and a timely transfer system where the average distance to the hospital is relatively short. In Amsterdam, 85 percent of urgent obstetric referrals arrived in the hospital within half an hour. In addition, the midwife is able to provide some interventions herself in the patient's home, such as the administration of an intravenous infusion and provision of basic life support. The midwife for the home delivery may stay with her patient in the hospital for support but is no longer the primary provider.

In such settings, home birth providers should have a lower threshold for transferring patients to the hospital and must consider the transfer time when caring for patients in labor. For example, mild/borderline abnormalities in the fetal heart rate pattern or borderline hypertension might warrant transfer rather than observation for progression if transit time is anticipated to be significantly longer than 15 minutes. Ideally, such decisions are made in collaboration with the hospital team via telephone consultation. Individuals delivering in homes that are remote from a hospital should be informed by their home birth provider during prenatal care that, in the case of an unforeseen catastrophic complication (eg, abruption, cord prolapse), they may not be able to be transferred to the hospital in time to avoid maternal or neonatal injury or death.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">An optimum outcome is facilitated when hospital providers, including nurses, clinicians, and hospital-based midwives, communicate in a respectful manner with home birth providers and their clients during the transfer process and vice versa.

Laboring individuals are encouraged to eat and drink as they like.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1513183119"><span class="h3">Indications for hospital transfer</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Home birth providers have different thresholds for transferring patients to the hospital based on a myriad of factors including patient preference, distance to the hospital, and comfort level managing more complex labors.</p><p>Indications for intrapartum transfer include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Need for pain medication (most common reason for transfer and primarily in nulliparous patients)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Persistent abnormal fetal heart rate </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Active phase arrest/arrest of descent not responding to nonpharmacologic interventions</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fever or other evidence of intra-amniotic infection</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Meconium staining</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypertension/preeclampsia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bleeding (beyond normal "bloody show")</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An unanticipated indication for cesarean birth or hospital birth (eg, fetus "flips" from cephalic to breech presentation)</p><p></p><p>Common indications for postpartum transfer include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Postpartum hemorrhage</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Complex perineal lacerations (eg, third- or fourth-degree)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Postpartum fever</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Postpartum hypertensive condition</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Abnormal neonatal assessment</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3065908569"><span class="h1">SPECIAL ISSUES</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Group B streptococcus (GBS) colonization</strong> – GBS screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for individuals planning home birth is controversial. In the United States, based on their training, certification, and local regulations, some home birth providers are able to administer intravenous antibiotics when indicated according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for GBS-positive pregnant individuals. When intrapartum intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis is not technically possible, home birth providers have proposed a variety of alternatives; however, the effectiveness of these approaches is unproven [<a href="#rid78">78,79</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/438.html" rel="external">"Prevention of early-onset group B streptococcal disease in neonates"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Newborn care</strong> – Standards for newborn care in the home-birth setting should be consistent with state and federal regulations and consistent with standards for newborns birthed in a medical care facility [<a href="#rid61">61</a>]. For example, administration of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9771" href="/d/drug information/9771.html" rel="external">vitamin K</a> and eye prophylaxis and newborn screening should be explained and offered, but parents have a right to sign a waiver. In the United States, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that at least two individuals attend all births: one who has primary responsibility for the mother and one who has primary responsibility for the newborn. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5068.html" rel="external">"Overview of the routine management of the healthy newborn infant"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2871553993"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The Netherlands has the highest rate of planned home birth (14 percent of births) among industrialized countries. (See <a class="local">'Prevalence and epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Reasons for choosing planned home birth</strong> – Individuals who choose home birth do so for many reasons, including:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A desire for a low-intervention birth and personal control of the birth environment and process</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Fear of and dissatisfaction with hospital care</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Cultural or religious concerns</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For some individuals, home birth is not their preference but becomes a default option because of lack of access to transportation, a local maternity facility, or insurance/financial resources. (See <a class="local">'Why do individuals choose home birth?'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Candidates</strong> – Individuals who may be good candidates for an out-of-hospital birth include the following (this should not be considered a complete list) (see <a class="local">'Optimal candidates'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Preference for home birth after informed consent of risks, benefits, and alternatives</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Singleton cephalic fetus at 37+0 to 41+0 weeks of gestation with estimated weight that is appropriate for gestational age</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Absence of preexisting serious medical conditions</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Absence of serious obstetric conditions </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Absence of contraindications to vaginal birth</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Spontaneous labor</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>No prior cesarean births</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Prior vaginal birth</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Plan to deliver at a home or other site in the vicinity of the backup hospital</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Safety</strong> – The safety of planned home birth depends on the selection of appropriate candidates (eg, low-risk, multiparous individuals with repeated risk assessment throughout pregnancy) and the quality of the home birth program, including the training/credentials of home birth providers, access to supplies and equipment, a system for transfer to hospital, communication/relationship between home and hospital clinical providers, and care after transfer. An integrated plan for care of the individual planning a home birth is essential for a successful program. Seven to 33 percent of mothers/newborns are transferred to the hospital intrapartum or postpartum. (See <a class="local">'Is home birth a safe option?'</a> above and <a class="local">'Program organization'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Outcome</strong> – In systematic reviews of observational studies, compared with planned hospital delivery, planned home birth was generally associated with the following (see <a class="local">'Is home birth a safe option?'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Reductions in intrapartum interventions</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Reductions in morbidity to the birthing individual, including third-degree lacerations</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Similar or slightly higher neonatal mortality </p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Walker JJ.
