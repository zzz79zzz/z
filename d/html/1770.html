In one study, 25 percent of patients with type 1 diabetes and 30 percent with type 2 diabetes had a hospital admission during one year; patients with higher values for glycated hemoglobin (A1C) were at highest risk for admission [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The prevalence of diabetes rises with increasing age, as does the prevalence of other diseases; both factors increase the likelihood that an older person admitted to a hospital will have diabetes.</p><p>The treatment of patients with diabetes who are admitted to the general medical wards of the hospital for a procedure or intercurrent illness is reviewed here. The treatment of hyperglycemia in critically ill patients, the perioperative management of diabetes, and the treatment of complications of the diabetes itself, such as diabetic ketoacidosis, are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1600.html" rel="external">"Glycemic control in critically ill adult and pediatric patients"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1753.html" rel="external">"Perioperative management of blood glucose in adults with diabetes mellitus"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1795.html" rel="external">"Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in adults: Treatment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1805.html" rel="external">"Hypoglycemia in adults with diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">GOALS IN THE HOSPITAL SETTING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The main goals in patients with diabetes needing hospitalization are to minimize disruption of the metabolic state, prevent adverse glycemic events (especially hypoglycemia), return the patient to a stable glycemic balance as quickly as possible, and ensure a smooth transition to outpatient care. These goals are not always easy to achieve. On the one hand, the stress of the acute illness tends to raise blood glucose concentrations. On the other hand, the anorexia that often accompanies illness or the need for fasting before procedures tend to do the opposite. Because the net effect of these countervailing forces is not easily predictable in a given patient, the target blood glucose concentration should generally be higher than in the outpatient setting.</p><p>Uncertainty regarding goal blood glucose concentration is compounded by the paucity of high-quality controlled trials on the benefits and risks of "loose" or "tight" glycemic management in hospitalized patients, with the exception of patients who are critically ill. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1600.html" rel="external">"Glycemic control in critically ill adult and pediatric patients"</a>.) </p><p>In general, the goals are to:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoid hypoglycemia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoid severe hyperglycemia, volume depletion, and electrolyte losses</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ensure adequate nutrition</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assess patient educational needs and address informational deficiencies</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ensure appropriate glucose management upon discharge until patient can be seen by the clinician managing his or her diabetes as an outpatient</p><p></p><p>Critical to achieving these goals is the frequent measurement of glucose, often in capillary blood, with a method that is known to be reliable. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1781.html" rel="external">"Glucose monitoring in the ambulatory management of nonpregnant adults with diabetes mellitus", section on 'BGM systems'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Avoidance of hypoglycemia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hypoglycemia should be avoided if at all possible. Measures to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Adequate reduction in antihyperglycemic therapy when caloric intake is stopped or reduced.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoidance of standard "sliding scale" of insulin without consideration of the patient's specific circumstances.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoidance of overly aggressive attempts to provide "tight" glycemic management intraoperatively [<a href="#rid3">3</a>] or with intensive insulin therapy in critically ill patients [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1600.html" rel="external">"Glycemic control in critically ill adult and pediatric patients"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Although relatively brief and mild hypoglycemia does not usually have clinically significant sequelae, hospitalized patients are particularly vulnerable to severe, prolonged hypoglycemia since they may be unable to sense or respond to the early warning signs and symptoms of low blood glucose.</p><p>Hypoglycemia (ie, serum glucose concentration &lt;70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]) can be harmful due to the effects of counterregulatory hormones, especially catecholamines, which may possibly induce arrhythmias and other cardiac events. This is especially true in older adults and those with preexisting ischemic heart disease. If the blood glucose falls to or below 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L, termed "clinically significant hypoglycemia"), cognitive deficits may also ensue, which can lead to falls or aspiration. In a retrospective cohort study of over 2500 patients with diabetes hospitalized in the general wards, inpatient mortality was significantly higher for patients with at least one hypoglycemic (≤50 mg/dL [2.8 mmol/L]) episode [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Avoidance of hyperglycemia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Serious hyperglycemia should be avoided (see <a class="local">'Prevention and treatment of hyperglycemia'</a> below). Hyperglycemia can lead to volume and electrolyte disturbances mediated by osmotic diuresis and may also result in caloric and protein losses in under-insulinized patients.</p><p>Whether or not hyperglycemia imposes an independent risk for infection is a controversial issue. It is a longstanding clinical observation that patients with diabetes are more susceptible to infection [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Furthermore, immune and neutrophil function are impaired during marked hyperglycemia. Most of the studies addressing this question have focused on the risk of postoperative infection (and especially sternal wound infection) following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and they show mixed results. This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2739.html" rel="external">"Susceptibility to infections in persons with diabetes mellitus", section on 'Risk of infection'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Glycemic targets</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although there are adequate experimental and observational data to recommend avoidance of marked hyperglycemia in patients with or at risk for infection, the precise glycemic target or threshold for noncritically ill or critically ill patients with preexisting diabetes mellitus has not been firmly established [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>]. In the absence of data from clinical trials, the optimal blood glucose goal for hospitalized patients can only be approximate. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Noncritically ill</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most noncritically ill hospitalized patients with diabetes, we suggest a preprandial blood glucose target &lt;140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) with all random glucose values &lt;180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L). </p><p>These targets are similar to those from a consensus statement by the American Diabetes Association (ADA; 140 to 180 mg/dL) and the clinical practice guideline of the Endocrine Society [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. The ADA has not stipulated any differences in target glucose values based on the timing of the measurements, such as preprandial versus postprandial. The Endocrine Society recommends pre-meal targets &lt;140 mg/dL and "random" glucose levels &lt;180 mg/dL. More stringent goals may be appropriate for stable patients with previous good glycemic management, and the goal should be set somewhat higher for older patients and those with severe comorbidities where the heightened risk of hypoglycemia may outweigh any potential benefit.</p><p>A reasonable glycemic goal to avoid hypoglycemia is to achieve fasting blood glucose concentrations no lower than 90 to 100 mg/dL (5.0 to 5.6 mmol/L); this will usually provide an adequate "cushion" in case the concentration falls further as the patient's illness improves. In general, all glucose levels should be kept below the 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) range to avoid further escalations, which may lead to dehydration, glycosuria, caloric loss, and increased risk of infection or hyperglycemic emergencies.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Critically ill</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For the majority of critically ill patients, we agree with ADA recommendations for a blood glucose target of 140 to 180 mg/dL (7.8 to 10.0 mmol/L) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Achieving this goal will usually require an insulin infusion, which should be initiated for persistent hyperglycemia ≥180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L). The data supporting these glycemic goals are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1600.html" rel="external">"Glycemic control in critically ill adult and pediatric patients"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Acute MI</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is increasing evidence that suboptimal glycemic management in patients with diabetes (or stress-induced hyperglycemia in patients without diabetes) is associated with worse outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (MI) and that better glycemic management may be beneficial in some individuals.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h1">PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF HYPERGLYCEMIA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment of hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients depends upon the type of diabetes, the patient's current blood glucose concentrations, prior treatment, the clinically assessed severity of illness, and the expected caloric intake during the acute episode  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef72627" href="/z/d/graphic/72627.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59822" href="/z/d/graphic/59822.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1,11-13</a>].</p><p>In the absence of large controlled clinical trials regarding how best to manage the inpatient with diabetes, the management approach outlined below is based primarily upon clinical expertise.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4128025448"><span class="h2">Blood glucose monitoring</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>At the time of admission or before an outpatient procedure or treatment, blood glucose should be measured and the result known. In addition, glucose monitoring should be continued so that appropriate action may be taken.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Frequency of monitoring</strong> – The frequency of measurement depends upon the patient's status, the results of earlier measurements, and the steps taken as a result of those measurements. Importantly, in patients with diabetes (or hyperglycemia) who are eating, the blood glucose monitoring should occur just before the meal. In those who are receiving nothing by mouth, or receiving continuous tube feeds or total <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10307" href="/z/d/drug information/10307.html" rel="external">parenteral nutrition</a>, the blood glucose monitoring should occur at regular, fixed intervals, usually every six hours.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mode of monitoring</strong> – In hospitalized patients, blood glucose monitoring is typically performed through conventional capillary glucose testing with a fingerstick and glucose meter. Although continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is not generally recommended for the inpatient or critical care setting, it has been used in inpatient locations more frequently since the onset of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128127.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Issues related to diabetes mellitus in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Clinical trial data generally have shown small and perhaps not clinically meaningful glycemic benefits with CGM compared with traditional glucose monitoring [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. As an example, in a trial in 185 hospitalized adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes on general medicine and surgery services, time spent in target glucose range (70 to 180 mg/dL [3.9 to 10 mmol/L]) and mean daily glucose did not differ between participants randomly assigned to glucose monitoring with CGM and those who underwent conventional monitoring [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The same study showed a small reduction in hypoglycemia reoccurrence with CGM compared with conventional monitoring, but the overall rates were very low [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. CGM may be useful in selected inpatients, such as those for whom close contact with inpatient providers should be minimized (eg, COVID-19 or other highly transmissible infection) or possibly, in patients at high risk for hypoglycemia [<a href="#rid14">14,16</a>]. Hospitals that use these devices routinely must provide proper personnel training and resources for safe application of CGM [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">It is certainly reasonable for patients using CGM at home to continue wearing these devices while hospitalized, as long as they maintain the required dexterity, vision, and cognitive capacity to safely implement such technology [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Any concerning glycemic data should be shared with the health care team for both confirmation and potential intervention. Most hospitals, however, have policies that forbid use of a patient's personal CGM data as the sole tool for glucose monitoring or to guide glucose management strategies, such as insulin administration.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Insulin delivery</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3872627742"><span class="h3">Basal-bolus (or basal-nutritional) insulin regimens</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although most patients will have type 2 diabetes, many will require at least temporary insulin therapy during inpatient admissions. In such patients, insulin may be given subcutaneously with an intermediate-acting insulin, such as neutral protamine hagedorn (human NPH), or a long-acting (basal) insulin analog, such as glargine, detemir, or degludec combined with a pre-meal rapid-acting insulin analog (lispro, aspart, glulisine) in patients who are eating regular meals (ie, a so-called "basal-bolus" regimen)  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef72627" href="/z/d/graphic/72627.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59822" href="/z/d/graphic/59822.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). Short-acting (human regular) has fallen out of favor for meal-time dosing in the hospital, although there are no good studies comparing its efficacy or safety to the more costly rapid acting analogs.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h3">Sliding-scale insulin</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We do not endorse the routine use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9030" href="/z/d/drug information/9030.html" rel="external">regular insulin</a> "sliding scales," particularly when prolonged over the course of a hospitalization. It has no role when used alone in those with type 1 diabetes, who always require basal insulin, even when receiving nothing by mouth. In type 2 diabetes patients who are very insulin deficient (typically insulin-treated older individuals, often but not always lean, with longstanding disease and a history of labile glucoses), the same recommendations apply.</p><p>However, in the usual patient with type 2 diabetes managed with oral agents or injectable glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)-based therapies, and whose glucose management on admission appears at goal, the temporary use of a sliding scale is reasonable for just one to two days as the trajectory of the patient's glycemia becomes apparent (see <a class="local">'Correction insulin'</a> below). However, after this period of time, a decision should be made about the need for a more physiological glucose management strategy for the remainder of the hospitalization  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef72627" href="/z/d/graphic/72627.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59822" href="/z/d/graphic/59822.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p>The widespread use of sliding scales for insulin administration for hospitalized patients began during the era of urine glucose testing, and it increased after the introduction of rapid capillary blood glucose testing in the last two to three decades. However, there are few data to support its benefit and some evidence of potential harm when such treatment is applied in a rote fashion, that is, when all patients receive the same orders and, importantly, when the sole form of insulin administered is rapid-acting insulin every four to six hours without underlying provision of basal insulin.</p><p>This was illustrated in an observational study of 171 patients with diabetes who were admitted to a university hospital, 130 of whom (76 percent) were placed on a sliding-scale insulin regimen [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Sliding-scale insulin regimens when administered alone were associated with a threefold higher risk of hyperglycemic episodes as compared with no therapy (relative risk [RR] 2.85 for "aggressive" scales, beginning at blood glucose 150 mg/dL [8.3 mmol/L] and 3.25 for "conservative" scales, beginning at blood glucose 200 mg/dL [11.1 mmol/L; p&lt;0.05]). Thus, in this observational study, the use of sliding-scale insulin alone provided no benefit.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Correction insulin</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Varying doses of rapid-acting insulin can be added to usual pre-meal rapid-acting insulin in patients on basal-bolus regimens to correct pre-meal glucose excursions. In this setting, the additional insulin is referred to as "correction insulin"  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef72627" href="/z/d/graphic/72627.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59822" href="/z/d/graphic/59822.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>), which differs from a sliding scale because it is <strong>added</strong> to planned mealtime doses to correct for pre-meal hyperglycemia. Correction dosing typically starts when the pre-meal blood glucose is ≥150 mg/dL (8.3 mmol/L). The dose of correction insulin should be individualized based upon relevant patient characteristics, such as previous glycemia, previous insulin requirements, and, if possible, the carbohydrate content of meals. When administered prior to meals, the type of correction insulin (eg, short acting or rapid acting) should be the same as the usual pre-meal insulin.</p><p>Meal-time correction insulin alone is sometimes used in place of a fixed mealtime dose, usually when risk of hypoglycemia is high, dietary intake is uncertain, or other clinical circumstance that warrants a conservative approach to glycemic management. Correction insulin alone may also be used as initial insulin therapy or as a dose-finding strategy in hyperglycemic patients with type 2 diabetes previously treated at home with diet or non-insulin agents who will not be eating regularly during the hospitalization. This use of correction insulin is essentially a "sliding scale." In fasting patients, a short-acting (ie, regular) insulin is typically administered every six hours  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59822" href="/z/d/graphic/59822.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). Rapid-acting insulin analogs can also be used but may require more frequent dosing (up to every four hours) and do not have clear advantage over <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9030" href="/z/d/drug information/9030.html" rel="external">regular insulin</a> in fasting patients. Short-acting insulin can be given at bedtime in more modest doses to correct marked hyperglycemia (&gt;250 to 300 mg/dL [16.6 mmol/L]).

However, some practitioners institute intravenous insulin therapy (human <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9030" href="/z/d/drug information/9030.html" rel="external">regular insulin</a> in solution) in certain circumstances, such as those with marked hyperglycemia (blood glucose &gt;300 to 350 mg/dL [&gt;16.7 to 19.4 mmol/L]) or in type 1 diabetes, especially those undergoing long and difficult surgery or those who will be expected to have significantly curtailed oral nutritional intake for several days postoperatively. There are little data showing that intravenous insulin is superior to subcutaneous insulin. The key point is that the patient should have at least a small amount of insulin circulating at all times, which will significantly increase the likelihood of successfully managing blood glucose levels during illness.</p><p>In addition, the safe implementation of insulin infusion protocols requires frequent monitoring of blood glucose, which is not typically available on a general medical ward. Practical considerations including skill and availability of the nursing staff may impact the choice of delivery; complex intravenous regimens may be dangerous where nurses are short staffed or inexperienced. Thus, insulin infusions are typically used in critically ill intensive care unit (ICU) patients, rather than in patients on the general medical wards of the hospital.</p><p>There is a lack of consensus on how to best deliver intravenous insulin infusions, and individual patients may require different strategies. The best protocols take into account not only the prevailing blood glucose, but also its rate of change and the current insulin infusion rate. Several published insulin infusion protocols appear to be both safe and effective, with low rates of hypoglycemia, although most have been validated only in the ICU setting, where the nurse-to-patient ratio is higher than on the general medical and surgical wards [<a href="#rid13">13,19,20</a>]. There are few published reports on such protocols outside of the critical care setting. Computerized and web-based versions of several protocols are in widespread use, but they usually incur additional costs when proprietary devices/software are implemented [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>].

A reasonable regimen usually involves a continuous insulin infusion at a rate of 1 to 5 units of regular insulin per hour; within this range, the dose of insulin is increased or decreased based on frequently measured glucose concentrations, ideally through the use of an approved protocol. In patients who are not eating, concomitant glucose infusion is necessary to provide some calories, reduce protein loss, and decrease the risk of hypoglycemia; separate infusions allow for more flexible management.</p><p>When the patient receiving intravenous insulin is more stable and the intercurrent event has passed, the prior insulin regimen can be resumed, assuming that it was effective in achieving glycemic goals. Because of the short half-life of intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9030" href="/z/d/drug information/9030.html" rel="external">regular insulin</a>, the first dose of subcutaneous insulin must be given before discontinuation of the intravenous insulin infusion.

This approach stems from the fact that insulin doses can be rapidly adjusted and, therefore, can quickly correct worsening hyperglycemia. In addition, noninsulin diabetes therapies have not been widely tested in the hospital setting. However, there are some circumstances where insulin may not be necessary. As an example, in patients who are well managed on their outpatient regimen, who are eating, and in whom no change in their medical condition or nutritional intake is anticipated, oral agents may be continued, as long as new contraindications are neither present nor anticipated during the hospital admission, and as long as the medications (or similar brands) are on the hospital formulary. Of note, injectable GLP-1-based therapies are expensive and often not on hospital formularies; their use in the hospital setting is therefore uncommon.</p><p>If a patient was previously eating but is unable to eat after the evening meal in preparation for a procedure the next morning, oral antihyperglycemic drugs should be omitted on the day of a procedure (surgical or diagnostic). If procedures are arranged as early in the day as possible, antihyperglycemic therapy and food intake can simply then be shifted to later in the day.</p><p>If the illness requiring admission is more severe (eg, an infection requiring hospitalization), hyperglycemia is more likely, even when there is decreased food intake, and most acutely ill patients will need insulin. In this setting, oral agents should be discontinued. Overt hyperglycemia (≥180 mg/dL [10.0 mmol/L]) in patients previously treated with oral agents who are not eating can be treated briefly with intermittent, subcutaneous doses of regular (every six hours) or rapid-acting (every four to six hours) insulin, provided the blood glucose is not severely elevated, responds well to the insulin, and the problem lasts only a day or two at most (see <a class="local">'Correction insulin'</a> above). If eating, rapid-acting insulin is preferred, administered before meals. However, a more formal and comprehensive insulin regimen, including some form of basal insulin, is usually preferred when hyperglycemia persists  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef72627" href="/z/d/graphic/72627.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59822" href="/z/d/graphic/59822.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p>Oral agents should generally not be administered to patients who are not eating.

As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients using an insulin pump</strong> – For a patient treated with a continuous insulin infusion via a pump, the basal insulin can be continued at the usual rate, or the overnight basal rate may be reduced by 20 percent to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia the next morning. No boluses would be administered until the patient is able to eat. Since nursing staff are not always familiar or comfortable with the use of insulin pumps, patients should be alert enough to manage their pump therapy and possess sufficient vision and dexterity to safely use the device. In addition, vigilance regarding pump catheter placement is necessary. Catheters may inadvertently be dislodged during transfers in the operating room or in bed, and if the patient is not alert enough to provide self-care, the health care providers should consider changing to conventional injection therapy until the patient is able to manage pump therapy again.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients treated with multiple daily insulin injections</strong> – For a patient who usually takes 20 units of glargine every evening and rapid-acting insulin before each meal (dose based upon pre-meal blood glucose and carbohydrate content of meal), the usual dose of glargine can be continued. In patients with tightly managed glycemia, an alternative approach is to reduce the dose of glargine by 10 to 20 percent (eg, give 16 to 18 units) to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia that might require oral ingestion of calories and thereby delay the planned procedure. Short-acting insulin should not be given, unless significant hyperglycemia is noted, as described above.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For a patient who usually takes 24 units of NPH and 4 units of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9030" href="/z/d/drug information/9030.html" rel="external">regular insulin</a> in the morning, one-half to two-thirds (12 to 16 units) of the usual morning dose of NPH insulin can be given (if the morning blood glucose value is not too low, ie, is at least 120 mg/dL [6.7 mmol/L]). Short- or rapid-acting insulin should not be given, except if significant hyperglycemia (&gt;200 to 250 mg/dL [11.1 to 13.9 mmol/L]) is found in the morning. In such cases, only small doses (1 to 4 units) should be given with the goals of reducing the blood glucose level to &lt;180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L) and avoiding hypoglycemia during the ongoing fast.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Blood glucose should be measured every two to three hours until the first meal is eaten. Small amounts of short- or rapid-acting insulin can be administered every four to six hours to correct hyperglycemia (ie, glucose &gt;150 to 200 mg/dL [8.3 to 11.1 mmol/L]). Intravenous glucose (at approximately 3.75 to 5 g/hour, eg, 5 percent dextrose at 75 to 100 mL per hour) should be given to limit the metabolic changes of starvation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1804.html" rel="external">"Cases illustrating intensive insulin therapy in special situations"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19"><span class="h2">Patients receiving enteral or parenteral feedings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with diabetes who are receiving total <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10307" href="/z/d/drug information/10307.html" rel="external">parenteral nutrition</a> (TPN) or tube feeds (bolus or continuous) require special consideration.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20"><span class="h3">TPN</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients receiving total <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10307" href="/z/d/drug information/10307.html" rel="external">parenteral nutrition</a> (TPN), insulin may be administered as part of the nutritional solution, if allowed by the hospital pharmacy. To determine the correct dose of insulin to add to the TPN fluid, a separate infusion of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9030" href="/z/d/drug information/9030.html" rel="external">regular insulin</a> can be used initially. When glucoses have reached goal, the total daily dose of regular insulin provided by the insulin drip is calculated; 80 percent of this amount is added to the TPN fluid as regular insulin to be delivered over 24 hours. For example, if the intravenous insulin infusion at steady state was set at 1 unit per hour (or 24 units per day), around 80 percent of this amount (20 units) should be added to the TPN solution by the pharmacy to be given over the course of the day. The amount of insulin can then be titrated every one to two days, based upon glucose monitoring. Since more frequent adjustments are impractical and costly, the concurrent use of rapid- or short-acting insulin as correction every six hours will help to fine-tune glycemic management. (See <a class="local">'Correction insulin'</a> above.)</p><p>If TPN is interrupted, most patients with type 2 diabetes can be followed with careful glucose monitoring. Insulin should be administered if hyperglycemia occurs. In patients with type 1 diabetes, hyperglycemia will occur and can result in ketosis if all insulin is withheld. Thus, patients with type 1 diabetes require insulin when the TPN is interrupted. The amount and type of insulin depend upon the anticipated duration of the interruption. Because of the potential for inadvertent discontinuation of insulin therapy if TPN is interrupted, some clinicians recommend giving a portion of the basal insulin as an injection (eg, 50 percent) in patients with type 1 diabetes. In the example above (patient receiving 24 units of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9030" href="/z/d/drug information/9030.html" rel="external">regular insulin</a> a day, 80 percent of this amount [19 units] added to the TPN solution), approximately 10 units of regular insulin can be added to the TPN solution and 9 units of NPH, glargine, or detemir administered as a basal injection. This approach can also be used in insulin-requiring patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21"><span class="h3">Enteral feedings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients receiving continuous enteral feeds, the total daily dose of insulin could be administered as basal insulin alone (once-daily glargine, detemir, or degludec, or twice-daily detemir or NPH). However, if the enteral feeds are unexpectedly discontinued, hypoglycemia may occur. Thus, a safer approach may be to administer approximately 50 percent of the total daily insulin dose as basal insulin and 50 percent as prandial (short- or rapid-acting) insulin, which is given every four (rapid-acting insulin) to six (short-acting insulin) hours [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. A similar ratio of basal-to-prandial insulin can be used for patients receiving bolus feeds, for whom the prandial insulin would be divided equally before each bolus feed. Correction rapid- or short-acting insulin can then be administered, as needed, with the prandial insulin (same type). In those receiving cycled enteral feeding (eg, 8 to 10 hours overnight), the ideal insulin may be NPH, which has an activity profile similar to this duration, its effect waning when the feeds are stopped. Again, correction rapid- or short-acting insulin can then be administered as needed to optimize glycemic management. (See <a class="local">'Correction insulin'</a> above.)</p><p>Another approach is to use short-acting insulin alone. This approach is supported by the findings of a randomized trial of sliding-scale, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9030" href="/z/d/drug information/9030.html" rel="external">regular insulin</a> every four to six hours alone or in combination with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9023" href="/z/d/drug information/9023.html" rel="external">insulin glargine</a> in 50 noncritically ill patients with diabetes receiving enteral nutrition [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. Insulin doses were adjusted daily based upon fingerstick blood glucose measurements, and NPH insulin was added in the sliding-scale, regular insulin group when glucose levels persistently exceeded 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L). There were no differences in any glycemic measures (mean study glucose, mean peak or nadir glucose, hypoglycemia events, or total daily insulin dose) between the two groups. However, NPH insulin was required in 48 percent of subjects randomly assigned to sliding-scale, regular insulin. Thus, when sliding-scale, regular insulin alone is chosen as the initial management strategy for patients receiving enteral feeds, the addition of basal insulin is often required to maintain adequate glycemic management.</p><p>If the enteral feeds (continuous or bolus) are unexpectedly discontinued, an intravenous 10 percent dextrose solution, providing a similar number of carbohydrate calories as was being administered via the enteral feeds, should be infused in order to prevent hypoglycemia, especially if the blood glucose concentration falls below 100 mg/dL.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22"><span class="h2">Consultation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most of the time, the treatment of hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes in these stressful circumstances can be done by the patient's internist, generalist, or hospitalist. However, each clinician needs to decide whether or not the patient would benefit from additional advice; consultation with a diabetes specialist or endocrinologist may help, particularly if accompanied by a team including personnel who can provide patient education and nutritional advice. This team approach can decrease the patient's length of stay as well as decrease the total cost of care [<a href="#rid35">35,36</a>]. Using the hospitalization to enhance the patient's knowledge about the disease and to improve self-management is encouraged.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23"><span class="h2">Evaluation of overall care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A brief hospitalization is an excellent opportunity to assess or reassess overall care in patients with diabetes. If appropriate, attention should be paid to preventive measures (such as smoking cessation, hypertension management, treatment of dyslipidemia, and appropriate vaccinations) [<a href="#rid37">37</a>], glycemic management, assessment of possible complications of diabetes, and overall patient education. This assessment should lead to the formulation of a plan for future treatment after the patient is discharged. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1750.html" rel="external">"Overview of general medical care in nonpregnant adults with diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p>In type 2 diabetes, an insulin regimen may not be necessary after the illness requiring hospitalization has resolved. In addition, even when such a regimen is considered to be the ideal outpatient therapy upon discharge, the patient may not be able to comply safely with the prescribed insulin program, which requires a degree of education, commitment, and self-discipline not exhibited by all. Thus, it is important to determine both the insulin needs as well as the self-care capacities of each patient prior to discharge. Optimal regimens should be individualized for each patient.</p><p>Patients may require a significant dose adjustment after discharge from the hospital, which is why clear communication between the clinician dealing with the acute illness and the clinician who will follow the patient's diabetes care after discharge is so important. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1750.html" rel="external">"Overview of general medical care in nonpregnant adults with diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p>Patients found to be newly hyperglycemic during times of illness may actually have undiagnosed diabetes. A glycohemoglobin test (A1C) can help discriminate between acute, stress-related hyperglycemia and preexistent diabetes. At a minimum, these individuals should be retested as outpatients upon full recovery. Adequate patient education, discharge planning, and the important transition to the outpatient arena should be facilitated by the personnel dedicated to diabetes care at each institution.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1131595190"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
