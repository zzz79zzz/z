It has also been referred to as fulminant hepatic failure, acute hepatic necrosis, fulminant hepatic necrosis, and fulminant hepatitis. Untreated, the prognosis is poor, so timely recognition and management of patients with acute liver failure is crucial [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Whenever possible, patients with acute liver failure should be managed in an intensive care unit at a liver transplantation center.</p><p>This topic will review the etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of acute liver failure in adults. The prognosis and management of patients with acute liver failure is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3570.html" rel="external">"Acute liver failure in adults: Management and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p>The discussion that follows is consistent with society guidelines from The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) for the management of acute liver failure [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H73465368"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute liver failure refers to the development of severe acute liver injury with impaired synthetic function (INR of ≥1.5) and altered mental status in a patient without cirrhosis or preexisting liver disease [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. A commonly used cutoff to define acute liver failure is an illness duration of &lt;26 weeks.</p><p>Acute liver failure may also be diagnosed in patients with previously undiagnosed Wilson disease, vertically acquired or reactivation of hepatitis B virus, or autoimmune hepatitis, in whom underlying cirrhosis may be present, provided the disease has been recognized for &lt;26 weeks. On the other hand, patients with acute severe alcoholic hepatitis, even if recognized for &lt;26 weeks, are considered to have acute-on-chronic liver failure since most have a long history of heavy alcohol use. The approach to such patients is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/87052.html" rel="external">"Management and prognosis of alcoholic hepatitis"</a>.)</p><p>Acute liver failure can be subcategorized based upon how long the patient has been ill and various cutoffs have been used. We classify acute liver failure as hyperacute (&lt;7 days), acute (7 to 21 days), or subacute (&gt;21 days and &lt;26 weeks). In patients with hyperacute or acute liver failure, cerebral edema is common, whereas it is rare in subacute liver failure [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. On the other hand, renal failure and portal hypertension are more frequently observed in patients with subacute liver failure. These subcategories have been associated with prognosis, but the associations reflect the underlying causes, which are the true determinants of prognosis. As an example, patients with hyperacute liver failure tend to have a better prognosis than those with subacute liver failure. The better prognosis is related to the fact that these patients often have <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> toxicity or ischemic hepatopathy, diagnoses associated with a better prognosis than many of the disorders that may result in subacute liver failure, such as Wilson disease [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute liver failure can result from a wide variety of causes, including  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67925" data-inline-graphics="67925" href="/z/d/graphic/67925.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79913" href="/z/d/graphic/79913.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2,6</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">Acetaminophen</a> (paracetamol)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Idiosyncratic drug reactions</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Viral hepatitis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Autoimmune hepatitis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Wilson disease</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ischemic hepatopathy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Budd-Chiari syndrome</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Veno-occlusive disease</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute fatty liver of pregnancy/HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Malignant infiltration (most often breast cancer, small cell lung cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, or myeloma)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Partial hepatectomy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Toxin exposure, including mushroom poisoning</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sepsis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Heat stroke</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (primarily a disorder of children) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]</p><p></p><p>Viral and drug-induced hepatitis are the most common causes of acute liver failure in adults. Drug-induced liver injury is the most common cause of acute liver failure in Australia, Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States, whereas in Asia and Africa, viral hepatitis predominates [<a href="#rid3">3,8,9</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the United States, the US Acute Liver Failure Study Group collected data on 1147 cases of acute liver failure from 23 sites [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].

In addition, acute liver failure can be seen with herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, adenovirus, and cytomegalovirus [<a href="#rid1">1,8</a>].</p><p>Acute liver failure is estimated to develop in 0.35 percent of patients with hepatitis A and in 0.1 to 0.5 percent of patients with acute hepatitis B [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. However, the incidence of acute liver failure from hepatitis B may be underestimated. Precore or pre-S mutant hepatitis B viruses that are able to produce infection but do not produce hepatitis B e antigen (precore mutants) or surface antigen (pre-S mutants) may be difficult to diagnose by routine serology. Thus, liver failure in such patients may be erroneously attributed to cryptogenic causes [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. This was illustrated in a study in which evidence of hepatitis B infection was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 6 of 17 patients (35 percent) who underwent liver transplantation for what was initially thought to be non-A, non-B hepatitis [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2692.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis A virus infection in adults: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3627.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis B virus: Clinical manifestations and natural history", section on 'Acute hepatitis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3639.html" rel="external">"Clinical significance and molecular characteristics of common hepatitis B virus variants"</a>.)</p><p>In addition to acute hepatitis B, acute liver failure may also develop in patients who are receiving chemotherapy, immunosuppression, or biologics and have reactivation of previously inactive hepatitis B, highlighting the importance of screening these patients for prior hepatitis B exposure with hepatitis B core IgG antibodies. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3649.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis B virus reactivation associated with immunosuppressive therapy"</a>.)</p><p>Hepatitis C virus alone does not appear to be a significant cause of acute liver failure in the absence of coinfection with hepatitis B. In a study of 109 patients with acute hepatitis C, acute liver failure developed in 11 (10 percent), 9 of whom had concurrent hepatitis B infection [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3672.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and natural history of chronic hepatitis C virus infection"</a>.)</p><p>Infection with hepatitis D virus can lead to acute liver failure in patients with hepatitis B virus infection. Hepatitis D does not cause an infection without hepatitis B. A patient may either acquire both viruses at the same time (coinfection) or acquire hepatitis D in the setting of preexisting chronic hepatitis B (superinfection). The risk of acute liver failure appears to be higher among patients who are coinfected than in those with hepatitis D superinfection or with acute hepatitis B alone. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3666.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hepatitis D virus infection"</a>.)</p><p>Hepatitis E virus is a significant cause of liver failure in countries where it is endemic, such as Russia, Pakistan, Mexico, and India. Overall, the case-fatality rate for hepatitis E is 0.5 to 3 percent. However, among females who are pregnant, the mortality rate increases to 15 to 25 percent. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3677.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis E virus infection", section on 'Acute hepatitis E'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3564.html" rel="external">"Overview of coincident acute hepatobiliary disease in pregnant women", section on 'Hepatitis E virus'</a>.)</p><p>Acute liver failure is a rare complication of HSV infection. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 have been implicated as etiologic agents. Those at risk include neonates, patients taking steroids, HIV-infected patients, those with cancer or myelodysplastic syndromes, and pregnant patients. HSV hepatitis has also been reported as an early cause of death after liver transplantation with concomitant lung and gastrointestinal involvement. HSV hepatitis has also been reported rarely in immunocompetent hosts. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8334.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection", section on 'Hepatitis'</a>.)</p><p>Immunocompromised patients, such as transplant recipients and HIV-infected individuals with advanced disease, are at increased risk for developing complicated herpes zoster infections including acute liver failure. Hepatic involvement may occasionally develop in the absence of coincident rash. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8327.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of herpes zoster", section on 'Special considerations in immunocompromised hosts'</a>.)</p><p>Epstein-Barr virus can affect virtually any organ system and has been associated with hepatitis and cholestasis. While rare, fatal cases of hepatitis have been described. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8318.html" rel="external">"Infectious mononucleosis", section on 'Other'</a>.)</p><p>The more common gastrointestinal manifestation of adenovirus is an acute diarrheal illness. However, hepatitis is a well-described complication of adenovirus infection in immunocompromised hosts, especially with subgroup C type 5. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8339.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations of adenovirus infection", section on 'Gastrointestinal system'</a>.)</p><p>Liver test abnormalities are frequently encountered in patients with symptomatic cytomegalovirus infection. Subclinical transaminitis is the most common finding in immunocompetent patients, but occasionally, patients present with more significant laboratory abnormalities or signs of hepatic dysfunction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8289.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of cytomegalovirus infection in immunocompetent adults", section on 'Hepatic manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Acetaminophen and other hepatotoxins</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">Acetaminophen</a> is the most common toxin associated with acute liver failure in the United States and other developed countries  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79913" href="/z/d/graphic/79913.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. The hepatotoxicity is dose dependent and rarely occurs at therapeutic doses (up to four grams per day in a patient without preexisting liver disease). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/340.html" rel="external">"Acetaminophen (paracetamol) poisoning in adults: Pathophysiology, presentation, and evaluation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/318.html" rel="external">"Acetaminophen (paracetamol) poisoning: Management in adults and children"</a>.)</p><p>Most cases occur after ingestion of large doses in an attempt to commit suicide. In addition, some patients unknowingly take large amounts of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> when multiple acetaminophen-containing medications are taken together or if acetaminophen-containing medications are not taken as directed (a "therapeutic misadventure"). Acute liver failure can also result from normally therapeutic doses in patients who have underlying liver disease (particularly with ongoing alcohol use, which induces the cytochrome P450 system) or who are taking medications known to induce the cytochrome P450 system (particularly CYP2E1), such as anticonvulsants  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68213" href="/z/d/graphic/68213.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The dosing and safety of acetaminophen for pain management in patients with cirrhosis are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1236.html" rel="external">"Management of pain in patients with advanced chronic liver disease or cirrhosis", section on 'Acetaminophen (paracetamol)'</a>.)</p><p>Other toxins associated with acute liver failure include mushroom poisoning (most often <em>Amanita phalloides</em>) and carbon tetrachloride. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13893.html" rel="external">"Amatoxin-containing mushroom poisoning (eg, Amanita phalloides): Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6489.html" rel="external">"Acute hydrocarbon exposure: Clinical toxicity, evaluation, and diagnosis", section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H64479183"><span class="h2">Idiosyncratic drug reactions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Unlike acute liver failure due to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a>, which is dose related, acute liver failure due to idiosyncratic drug reactions is dose independent. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) usually occurs within six months of drug initiation [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Drugs commonly implicated in cases of DILI include antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and anticonvulsants  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79913" href="/z/d/graphic/79913.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Herbal medications and dietary supplements have also been associated with acute liver failure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3571.html" rel="external">"Drug-induced liver injury"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3618.html" rel="external">"Hepatotoxicity due to herbal medications and dietary supplements"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H64480066"><span class="h2">Hypoperfusion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hypoperfusion of the liver can result in ischemic hepatitis and acute liver failure. Hypoperfusion may result from systemic hypotension due to causes such as cardiac dysfunction, sepsis, or drugs.

However, prior to obtaining a CT scan, venogram, or MRI/MRV, the risk of kidney injury associated with the contrast agents should be weighed against the need for the examination, especially since patients with acute liver failure may also have kidney failure. We reserve the use of these imaging techniques for patients with a negative ultrasound in whom the suspicion for Budd-Chiari syndrome or malignancy remains high. For patients who are being evaluated for liver transplantation, contrast-enhanced, cross-sectional imaging with either a CT scan or an MRI of the liver is performed to assess for thrombosis or malignancy. The patient's hemodynamic status should be stabilized prior to obtaining advanced imaging studies. In general, a CT is preferred rather than MRI. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7241.html" rel="external">"Contrast-associated and contrast-induced acute kidney injury: Clinical features, diagnosis, and management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113082.html" rel="external">"Patient evaluation before gadolinium contrast administration for magnetic resonance imaging", section on 'Approach to preventing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis'</a>.)</p><p>An echocardiogram to look for cardiac dysfunction should be considered in patients suspected of having acute hepatic ischemia without a known cause (eg, in a patient with markedly elevated transaminases without a cause identified from the patient's history, laboratory examination, or abdominal imaging). Additionally, patients who are being considered for liver transplantation should undergo institution-specific protocols for pretransplant cardiac evaluation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4585.html" rel="external">"Liver transplantation in adults: Patient selection and pretransplantation evaluation", section on 'Cardiopulmonary evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H414607153"><span class="h3">Liver biopsy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If laboratory and imaging tests fail to identify an etiology, a liver biopsy may aid with the diagnosis, but we recommend caution given the bleeding risk associated with liver biopsy. A transjugular approach is preferred in the setting of acute liver failure to minimize the risk of bleeding. Portal pressure measurements can help determine the chronicity of the patient's underlying disease. Our practice is to obtain a liver biopsy in patients with acute liver failure of indeterminate etiology who are hemodynamically stable with low bleeding risk. However, if the patient has progressed to the point of requiring liver transplantation, histologic evaluation can instead be performed on the explanted liver. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3586.html" rel="external">"Transjugular liver biopsy"</a>.)</p><p>Prior to proceeding with a liver biopsy, we obtain contrast-enhanced, cross-sectional liver imaging (eg, CT scan) to exclude malignancy.

Patients with severe acute hepatitis have jaundice and coagulopathy but lack signs of hepatic encephalopathy. Distinguishing the two is important because patients with severe acute hepatitis generally have a good prognosis, whereas those who progress to acute liver failure have a high mortality rate and often require liver transplantation [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>Differentiating severe acute hepatitis from acute liver failure in a patient with Wilson disease may be difficult because neurologic Wilson disease may be confused with hepatic encephalopathy. Features that suggest neurologic Wilson disease rather than hepatic encephalopathy include the presence of dysarthria, dystonia, tremors, or parkinsonism. In addition, neurologic symptoms in a patient with Wilson disease may have been present prior to the onset of the hepatic manifestations. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83837.html" rel="external">"Wilson disease: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history", section on 'Neurologic involvement'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with severe acute alcoholic hepatitis may present with liver failure that appears to have developed over the course of weeks to months [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. However, patients with alcoholic hepatitis typically have a history of heavy drinking for many years and are thus thought to have acute-on-chronic liver failure [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Patients with a diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis without another cause of liver injury (ie, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> toxicity) are not eligible for priority listing for liver transplant because this is regarded as a chronic disease. Differentiating alcoholic hepatitis from acute liver failure is important because the two entities are managed differently (eg, there is a role for corticosteroids in the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis, but not in acute liver failure). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3611.html" rel="external">"Management of alcohol-associated steatosis and alcohol-associated cirrhosis"</a>.)</p><p>Alcoholic hepatitis should be considered in patients with a history of heavy alcohol use or who have an aspartate aminotransferase to alanine aminotransferase ratio of approximately 2:1. However, a history of heavy alcohol use does not exclude other causes of acute liver failure (and in the case of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> toxicity may predispose to it), so a patient presenting with acute liver failure in the setting of heavy alcohol use still requires a thorough evaluation.
