The responses to NSAIDs differ between patients, and individual patients differ in their response to different NSAIDs. The bases for these variable responses are only partially understood. In addition, the selection and safety of NSAIDs depends in substantial part upon the presence of absence of various comorbidities and other medications the patient is receiving.</p><p>This topic will review the issues surrounding the differences in response to the various NSAIDs. Clinical considerations in the use of these agents, including comorbidities and cotherapies, will also be presented here. The pharmacology, mechanisms of action, and adverse effects of NSAIDs are reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7989.html" rel="external">"NSAIDs (including aspirin): Pharmacology and mechanism of action"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7991.html" rel="external">"Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7992.html" rel="external">"Overview of COX-2 selective NSAIDs", section on 'Toxicities and possible toxicities'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">VARIABILITY OF RESPONSES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>At equipotent doses, the efficacy of the various nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patient populations is similar, although there is clear individual variation in therapeutic and adverse responses to these agents; some patients seem to respond better to one drug than to others, and responses differ between patients. The differences in the effects of the various NSAIDs have been ascribed primarily to variations in one or more of the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mechanism of action, including absolute and relative differences in cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme inhibition, different dosing intervals, and different capacities for altering non-prostaglandin-mediated biologic events (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7989.html" rel="external">"NSAIDs (including aspirin): Pharmacology and mechanism of action"</a> and <a class="local">'Prostaglandin-mediated'</a> below and <a class="local">'Nonprostaglandin-mediated'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and drug metabolism, including pharmacogenetic factors (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7989.html" rel="external">"NSAIDs (including aspirin): Pharmacology and mechanism of action", section on 'Pharmacology'</a> and <a class="local">'Pharmacologic properties and clinical effects'</a> below)</p><p></p><p>Some of the observed individual differences with specific NSAIDs are particularly evident more with respect to toxicity than efficacy [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. As an example, it is not unusual for <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8559" href="/d/drug information/8559.html" rel="external">indomethacin</a> to induce headaches after a single dose in some patients. The reason for this is unknown but may be affected by drug concentration. More commonly, individual patients have more symptoms or signs of gastrointestinal toxicity with one NSAID than another, which may be influenced both by differences in relative inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 at therapeutic levels and by differences in absorption, distribution, and metabolism [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. Other differences in the mode of action may be important as well.</p><p>While relatively little is known about how genetic variations affect responses to a given NSAID, it is likely that genetic differences, including differences in drug metabolism between different patients, also have a role in the variable responses across individuals [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2699728196"><span class="h2">Effects of mechanisms of action</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h3">Prostaglandin-mediated</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The six major chemical classes of NSAIDs all have the common property of inhibiting COX, the enzyme which catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic endoperoxides from arachidonic acid to form prostaglandins. Different NSAIDs have varying inhibitory potentials of the two known isoforms of COX, COX-1 and COX-2 [<a href="#rid5">5-10</a>]. However, for most NSAIDs, beyond some information regarding the COX-2 selective agents, there is a paucity of data correlating the degree and type of COX inhibition with antiinflammatory efficacy in individual patients [<a href="#rid11">11-13</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7989.html" rel="external">"NSAIDs (including aspirin): Pharmacology and mechanism of action"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7992.html" rel="external">"Overview of COX-2 selective NSAIDs"</a>.)</p><p>Through variable inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2, different NSAIDs appear to differentially impact atherothrombosis risk. The mechanisms underpinning these differences involve differential dosing, differential COX inhibition, and pharmacogenetics. However, these mechanisms are still incompletely understood [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>Variabilities in response to NSAIDs may also result from alterations in some prostaglandin effects that have been recognized subsequent to the initial observations regarding COX inhibition. As an example, prostaglandins have been shown to be important inhibitors of apoptosis in vitro [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. NSAID administration may reestablish the return to a more normal cell cycle via inhibition of prostaglandins, a pathway that may be significant in the downregulation of diseases driven by immunologically based functions. Additionally, many human genes are involved in COX-1 and COX-2 metabolism. In healthy volunteers, metabolism of selective COX-2 inhibitors varies significantly between individuals, suggesting further potential explanations for variability in response [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>The nonacetylated salicylates (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9876" href="/d/drug information/9876.html" rel="external">salsalate</a>) are weak inhibitors of COX, but some studies suggest that their antiinflammatory effects are similar to the non-salicylate NSAIDs, suggesting that non-prostaglandin-mediated mechanisms of action may be important for these agents [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Nonprostaglandin-mediated'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Nonprostaglandin-mediated</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several non-prostaglandin-mediated NSAID-induced mechanisms may also be important in determining a patient's responsiveness to these agents. These mechanisms are generally related to the ability of NSAIDs to insert into biological membranes and disrupt a wide range of cell function and cell-to-cell interactions.</p><p>Several but not all NSAIDs may impact the levels of important transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) and activator protein (AP)-1 [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Differences in such COX-independent mechanisms may either enhance the efficacy or diminish the toxicity of the respective compounds, in part through effects upon nitric oxide synthetase [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>]. In addition, anti-nociceptive actions of some NSAIDs, but not all, appear to involve the L-arginine-NO-cyclic GMP-potassium channel pathways [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p>As another example, NSAIDs interfere with neutrophil-endothelial cell adherence by decreasing the availability of L-selectins, thereby removing a critical step in the migration of granulocytes to sites of inflammation [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p>Further study is required to confirm and better define the role and importance of the non-prostaglandin-mediated processes in clinical inflammation and whether these potential mechanisms of action explain the variation in individual patient response to NSAIDs or the occurrence of adverse events.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H684785503"><span class="h2">Pharmacologic properties and clinical effects</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pharmacodynamics of the individual NSAIDs, including their biochemical and physiological effects and their mechanisms of action, may be very important in predicting the ultimate clinical response and drug efficacy. By comparison, pharmacokinetic differences across NSAIDs, including differences in absorption, distribution, and differential metabolism, are probably not significant in this context. The risk of adverse events also seems to vary between individual drugs and patients; these differences in adverse event risk have been ascribed to differences in pharmacokinetics, including absorption, distribution, and metabolism.</p><p>All NSAIDs appear to be absorbed completely, have negligible first pass hepatic metabolism, are tightly bound to albumin, and have small volumes of distribution. Patients with hypoalbuminemia may, therefore, have higher free serum concentrations of drug. However, it is unclear whether the blood level of a NSAID is important in assessing its mode of action or its effectiveness, since protein-binding is saturable in the normal dose range for several NSAIDs. As a result, increases in dose may not lead to increases in steady state concentration of the drug. At equipotent doses, the clinical efficacy of the various NSAIDs in patient populations is similar [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]; by contrast, individual responses are highly variable [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>Differences in measurable biologic responses may result in part from differences in drug pharmacodynamics. As an example, one older study performed with drugs not widely prescribed used a 2x2 factorial design to sequentially expose patients with either osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to two NSAIDs from two different classes: <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9781" href="/d/drug information/9781.html" rel="external">piroxicam</a> (an oxicam) and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8590" href="/d/drug information/8590.html" rel="external">ketoprofen</a> (a phenylpropionic acid derivative) [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Patients were initially treated with one of the drugs for two weeks, then switched to the other for another two-week period. A number of clinical and biochemical responses were measured, and the following conclusions were drawn:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pharmacodynamics of the individual NSAIDs, including their biochemical and physiological effects and their mechanisms of action, may be very important in predicting the ultimate response. By comparison, pharmacokinetic differences between NSAIDs in absorption, distribution, and differential metabolism appear less significant.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>No clear pattern of effect could be associated with the serum concentrations of either NSAID.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Neither changes in serum concentrations of cytokines nor the absolute serum concentrations of cytokines may be as significant as changes in tissue levels or absolute tissue concentrations.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The enantiomeric state of the drugs was unimportant in determining differences in response.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Differences in effects were not due to fluctuations in disease.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">ISSUES IN THE THERAPEUTIC USE OF NSAIDS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The safe and effective use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) depends in large part upon an understanding of several general principles as well as considerations of class and drug-specific drug-drug interactions and effects of comorbid conditions. (See <a class="local">'General principles'</a> below and <a class="local">'Drug interactions and comorbidities'</a> below.)</p><p>The discussion here is a general guide to the administration of NSAIDs. The indications for and efficacy of NSAIDs vary by patient and disease. Discussions of the use of these drugs in specific disorders are presented in the appropriate topic reviews.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4262615347"><span class="h2">General principles</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Dosing and duration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Dosing issues that affect the therapeutic response include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Dosing frequency </strong>–<strong> </strong>Drug adherence is enhanced when medications are dosed less frequently [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Studies supporting this view have frequently been performed in asymptomatic hypertensive patients. Such patients may be more likely to comply with a once- or twice-daily regimen than with a more frequent and demanding regimen. In comparison, patients in chronic discomfort may be more adherent to a regimen that alleviates their discomfort, independent of dose schedule (but within limits). If the drug is adequately analgesic, it is more likely that patients will take drugs more frequently than once daily. Unfortunately, patient preference for specific NSAID dosing regimens has not been well studied.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Drug dosing </strong>–<strong> </strong>For patients being treated for inflammatory disorders, the NSAID dose should start at the lowest effective dose but may be titrated up to the maximal antiinflammatory range  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70067" href="/d/graphic/70067.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). In patients with a history of an inadequate response to one NSAID, it is important to ascertain whether an adequate antiinflammatory dose was used.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Different doses of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> are required to achieve certain therapeutic effects due to the level of cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Low doses (eg, 75 to 81 mg/day) result in antiplatelet effects due to irreversible acetylation of COX-1, which prevents platelets from making thromboxane A2. The antiplatelet effects of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6683.html" rel="external">"Platelet biology and mechanism of anti-platelet drugs", section on 'COX inhibitors (aspirin and other NSAIDs)'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Intermediate doses (eg, 650 mg to 4 g/day) result in the analgesic and antipyretic effects due to broader COX inhibition and subsequent decrease in prostaglandin production.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Duration of drug trial and role of drug class switching </strong>–<strong> </strong>In patients who experience an inadequate response to an NSAID of one class, the substitution of an NSAID of a different class is a reasonable therapeutic option. However, this strategy has never been evaluated in a prospective well-controlled study. Each attempt to achieve a response should last for about two weeks; this duration is based upon limited data and clinical experience. As an example, in one study, the response after two weeks was predictive of the more long-term response seen at 12 weeks [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3750131236"><span class="h3">Route of administration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>NSAIDs are available in various forms, including oral, intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), and topical formulations. Oral, IV, and IM NSAIDs have systemic absorption. Oral NSAIDs are most commonly used for systemic therapy, but IV and IM formulations may be substituted when patients are unable to tolerate medications by mouth. Due to systemic absorption, these types of NSAIDs have the potential to cause drug interactions and other adverse effects. (See <a class="local">'Drug interactions and comorbidities'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7991.html" rel="external">"Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7992.html" rel="external">"Overview of COX-2 selective NSAIDs", section on 'Toxicities and possible toxicities'</a>.)</p><p>Topically applied NSAIDs penetrate local tissues in the area of application but have limited systemic absorption [<a href="#rid27">27</a>] and therefore fewer drug interactions and associated side effects [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Accumulating data demonstrate relative safety and good benefit of topical NSAIDs for localized pain compared with other analgesics, including oral NSAIDs. A systematic review and meta-analysis of topical NSAIDs used for patients with osteoarthritis (OA) demonstrated very slight increases in risk compared with placebo for most NSAID-associated toxicities [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. In addition, in a network meta-analysis evaluating NSAIDs for patients with OA, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9348" href="/d/drug information/9348.html" rel="external">diclofenac</a> gel and solution appeared at least as effective as (and possibly more effective than) several commonly used oral NSAIDs [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. The use of topical NSAIDs for patients with various conditions is discussed in separate topic reviews.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2348898420"><span class="h3">Laboratory monitoring</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients being treated chronically with daily NSAIDs, particularly with use of antiinflammatory continuous dosing, we obtain a complete blood count, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, and aspartate aminotransferase at least once yearly. In patients at increased risk of adverse effects, such as anemia, kidney disease, and drug-related liver injury, more frequent testing is usually required.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H328184140"><span class="h2">Drug interactions and comorbidities</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is greater risk of adverse effects when NSAIDs are used in patients who are at increased risk for gastrointestinal, kidney, or cardiovascular adverse reactions, although, in general, NSAIDs are relatively safe drugs. However, NSAIDs can also interact with numerous drugs. Thus, to help avoid adverse effects, it is important to take a careful history to identify comorbidities and other therapies that may interact with NSAID therapy. A good clinician evaluation will often highlight these risks, and appropriate action should then be taken to minimize the likelihood of a poor outcome. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7991.html" rel="external">"Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects"</a>.)</p><p>The choice of one NSAID over another should consider patient-specific risk factors for toxicity and the way in which the drug is metabolized. In older patients, for example, the possible benefit of increased adherence with longer-acting drugs is probably offset by the enhanced incidence of gastrointestinal toxicity associated with prominent enterohepatic circulation of active metabolites. NSAIDs with a short half-life and no enterohepatic circulation may be the best choices for older chronically ill patients, although use of nonselective NSAIDs would generally be avoided in such patients because of their potential toxicity in this population. In addition, all agents should be used at the lowest effective dose.</p><p>Many of the toxic effects of the NSAIDs are related to their main mode of action, the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. However, the relative degree of COX-1 and COX-2 enzyme inhibition affects the risk of certain adverse effects, including both gastrointestinal adverse effects, which may be reduced with the selective COX-2 inhibitors, and cardiovascular adverse effects, which were more likely with several of the COX-2 selective agents that are no longer commercially available. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7992.html" rel="external">"Overview of COX-2 selective NSAIDs"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/10.html" rel="external">"COX-2 inhibitors and gastroduodenal toxicity: Major clinical trials"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7968.html" rel="external">"NSAIDs: Adverse cardiovascular effects"</a>.)</p><p>It is, therefore, difficult to identify the "safest" NSAID. Many clinicians believe that <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8547" href="/d/drug information/8547.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a> is quite safe, which is generally true when the drug is given at the lowest possible dose. However, increasing doses of any NSAID is associated with an increased risk of a toxic event.</p><p>Switching to a different drug class upon the occurrence of an adverse effect is not necessarily applicable to patients who develop a toxic effect with one NSAID. Although some toxicities are unique to particular classes of NSAIDs, others are related to the general mode of action of inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. One such example is acute kidney failure due to renal vasoconstriction, which is mediated by decreased production of vasodilator prostaglandins and may be similar across agents.</p><p>Topical NSAIDs offer an additional option for the localized delivery of an antiinflammatory analgesic that has similar efficacy to oral NSAIDs for OA for at least the first several weeks of treatment [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].
