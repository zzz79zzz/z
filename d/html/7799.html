These patients typically have marked impairments in functioning and high rates of co-occurring medical, mental health, and social problems that need to be addressed.</p><p>With increasing recognition of the substantial patient population with a chronic SUD (addiction), the SUD-treatment model is shifting from episodic to continuing care, based on the chronic care model [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In managing patients with chronic SUDs, the patient’s clinical status and risk of relapse are monitored systematically and longitudinally. As the patient’s addiction waxes and wanes over time (ie, experiences periods of abstinence, relapse, or fluctuations in risk of relapse), the intensiveness and types of treatment are adjusted.</p><p>This topic describes the continuum of care for SUDs, and factors that influence the determination of patients’ level of care. Other aspects of continuing care for SUDs (ie, indications, features, efficacy, and implementation) are described separately. Treatment for individual SUDs are also described separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16754.html" rel="external">"Continuing care for addiction: Components and efficacy"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/89215.html" rel="external">"Continuing care for addiction: Implementation"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/323.html" rel="external">"Management of moderate and severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7801.html" rel="external">"Alcohol withdrawal: Ambulatory management"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7810.html" rel="external">"Alcohol use disorder: Psychosocial management"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7800.html" rel="external">"Alcohol use disorder: Pharmacologic management"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7808.html" rel="external">"Opioid withdrawal: Medically supervised withdrawal during treatment for opioid use disorder"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7803.html" rel="external">"Opioid use disorder: Pharmacologic management"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16750.html" rel="external">"Stimulant use disorder: Psychosocial management"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7796.html" rel="external">"Cannabis use disorder: Clinical features, screening, diagnosis, and treatment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">CONTINUUM OF CARE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The "continuum of care" model for substance use disorder (SUD) services was established initially in the United States public sector, later adopted by private systems of care, and embedded in the United States payment model for SUD care in the United States.</p><p>There is little published research on implementation of a level of care model outside the United States. Services across the continuum range in intensity from a brief, office-based intervention to around-the-clock inpatient care, with multiple tiers in between. These levels of care differ in the types and intensity of services provided (eg, the number of hours per week, the variety of clinical disciplines involved, the treatment modalities available, and the extent of patient monitoring). Individuals will often move between levels as their clinical status and treatment needs evolve. Treatment is said to be "stepped down" when a patient is transferred from a higher to lower level of care – for example, after completing a treatment course while maintaining abstinence at the earlier level. Treatment is commonly "stepped up" when the current level of care proves inadequate – for example, when a patient relapses.</p><p>There are several level of care criteria that are used to guide SUD care in public and private United States health care systems. Examples include the American Society of Addiction Medicine [ASAM], the American Association of Community Psychiatrists, and New York state’s Level of Care for Alcohol and Drug Treatment Referral. There is much agreement across these criteria.</p><p>This topic describes the ASAM’s “Treatment Criteria for Addictive Substance-related and Co-occurring Conditions” [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. These include dimensions for patient assessment, level of care criteria, and principles for matching patients to levels of care based on their clinical status, social circumstances, individual treatment needs, and preferences  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78806" href="/z/d/graphic/78806.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. ASAM categorizes levels of SUD care as follows [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Level 0.5 – Early intervention</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Level 1.0 – Outpatient services (including opioid treatment programs)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Level 2.1 – Intensive outpatient services</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Level 2.5 – Partial hospitalization services</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Level 3.1 – Clinically managed low-intensity residential services</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Level 3.3 – Clinically managed population-specific high-intensity residential services</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Level 3.5 – Clinically managed high-intensity residential services</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Level 3.7 – Medically monitored intensive inpatient services</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Level 4.0 – Medically managed intensive inpatient services</p><p></p><p>An important component of any SUD continuum is facilitation between levels of care. An analysis of continuing care for adolescents with SUDs found that more assertive approaches can improve the initiation of continued care and a more rapid rate of initiation resulted in attenuation of substance use [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">LEVELS OF CARE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2905007762"><span class="h2">ASAM level of care criteria</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Levels of substance use disorder (SUD) care based on the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) level of care criteria are described below [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H438474568"><span class="h3">Early intervention</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Individuals at risk for an SUD may be identified in routine screening in primary care, emergency departments, by Employee Assistance Programs, by health care educators, and during driving under the influence assessments and then followed by a brief intervention. Identification of patients who use drugs for nonmedical reasons or consume alcohol greater than the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism threshold for risky use – a risk factor for health consequences and progression to an SUD – may be followed by a brief intervention. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14832.html" rel="external">"Brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol and other drug use: Efficacy, adverse effects, and administration"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14843.html" rel="external">"Screening for unhealthy use of alcohol and other drugs in primary care"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H438474583"><span class="h3">Outpatient care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Individuals with an SUD who are not at risk for complicated withdrawal and who are medically and psychiatrically stable, living in a supportive recovery environment, and are approaching readiness to change are appropriate for outpatient care. Without treatment, this group of individuals would be at high risk for continued use or relapse.(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7801.html" rel="external">"Alcohol withdrawal: Ambulatory management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7808.html" rel="external">"Opioid withdrawal: Medically supervised withdrawal during treatment for opioid use disorder"</a>.)</p><p>Outpatient treatment is delivered in a variety of office, clinic, and telehealth settings. Services include individual and/or group counseling, mutual help groups, pharmacotherapy, access to laboratory and toxicology services, and medical and psychiatric consultation. Telephone emergency services should be continuously available. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16753.html" rel="external">"Substance use disorders: Psychosocial management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H438474862"><span class="h3">Intensive outpatient programs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Individuals appropriate for an intensive outpatient program (IOP) typically require close monitoring and frequent contact to reduce risk of continued use, relapse, and worsening mental health problems. Appropriate individuals should be medically stable and at minimal risk for severe withdrawal. In addition to the SUD, they may have mild psychiatric problems that need monitoring or lack a supportive recovery environment.</p><p>IOPs offer a higher level of care than a typical outpatient program. IOPs provide services in a planned format for a minimum of nine hours a week. IOPs can be located in outpatient, partial hospital, or hospital settings; their schedules often include evening and weekend sessions.</p><p>Clinical services provided include individual and/or group counseling, mutual help groups, pharmacotherapy, access to laboratory and toxicology services, medical and psychiatric consultation. Additional services available include family therapy, vocational services, and recreational therapy. Treatment goals are to attain or maintain sobriety, improve functioning, and maintain residence in the community.</p><p>Examples of IOP participants include individuals with:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A history of failed outpatient treatment</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Co-occurring, poorly controlled depression</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Limited social support such as alienated family members or living with other people with an SUD</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H438474882"><span class="h3">Partial hospital programs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Partial hospital programs (PHPs) are similar to IOPs; they share the same modalities and treatment goals, and may consist of the same programming, with PHP patients attending more frequently. PHPs provide a structured, intensive, nonresidential program with at least 20 hours of treatment per week by some definitions, including individual and group counseling, medication management, educational groups, and occupational therapy [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Medical or psychiatric consultation should be available within 8 hours by phone and 48 hours in person, either on site, via referral, or transfer to a higher level of care.</p><p>Participants in a PHP could include individuals with:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A history of failing IOP treatment</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recent residential care, stepping down to PHP</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Multiple risk factors contributing to a high risk of relapse</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Residential services</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Residential programs provide a 24-hour, drug- and alcohol-free environment, along with professional or peer support. Residential care addresses those aspects of patients' prior living environment that contribute to the potential for relapse. The decision to admit a patient to a residential program requires assessment of the patient's readiness to change. In contrast with other levels of care, these programs require a commitment to maintaining abstinence. There are a wide range of public- and private-sector residential programs for SUDs.</p><p>Residential programs have been shown to improve substance use, employment, and self-regulation outcomes. As an example, in a randomized trial, 150 patients discharged after SUD treatment were assigned to either a residential program versus treatment as usual. After 24 months, participants living in the residential program had a lower rate of relapse (46 versus 65 percent), higher monthly income, and lower incarceration rates compared with the control group [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Two types of clinically managed residential services are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinically managed, low-intensity</strong> <strong>residential services </strong>– Clinically managed, low-intensity residential services are appropriate for individuals who need time in structured sober housing to integrate recovery and coping skills. Short-term residential programs are intended to provide transitional support (eg, between inpatient care and independent living). Lengths of stay vary but are on the order of weeks to a few months. Low-intensity services can be offered on site or combined with outpatient and intensive outpatient programs. Community residential treatment facilities (CRFs) are one example of clinically managed, low-intensity residential services. CRFs provide transitional housing and treatment, often following inpatient treatment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Programs vary greatly in their staffing, the degree to which treatment is provided, the types of treatment, and their underlying philosophy. Three distinct models have been identified [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Psychosocial model – These residential programs primarily provide psychosocial services such as individual and group therapy, social skills training, and self-help groups.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Supportive rehabilitative model – In addition to psychosocial services, these programs provide work training and more specialized services such as recreational and occupational therapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Intensive treatment model – In addition to the services above, these programs provide medical and psychiatric services, including medication treatment, couples and family counseling, and nutrition counseling.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Observational studies have described the CRF resident and program characteristics that are associated with better outcomes. In an observational study of approximately 2800 residents from a nationally representative sample of 88 CRFs, greater motivation for treatment, social and personal resources, and prior involvement with self-help groups were associated with better outcomes [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. More severe SUDs and comorbid psychiatric problems were associated with worse outcomes. Additionally, a more structured approach to treatment had better retention rates and SUD outcomes than programs with a more generic approach [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinically managed, high-intensity residential services </strong>– These programs have been developed to support individuals with significant functional limitations who cannot be managed without some type of rehabilitative services. These programs have 24 hour per day nursing care, 16 hours per day counselor availability, and physician services for medical and psychiatric problems as needed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Examples of individuals requiring this care include those with a substance-induced neurocognitive disorder or a comorbid neurocognitive disorder.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Therapeutic communities traditionally provide residential care for individuals with severe SUDs, although the model has been applied to other levels of care and clinical conditions as well. The programs are highly structured, provide comprehensive services, and are based on an explicit set of principles, including a focus on the community as a means of facilitating individual change [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Treatment goals include changes in identity and lifestyle, including abstinence from substances, employment, cessation of antisocial behavior, and prosocial values. Lengths of stay are typically between 15 and 24 months. Most patients who enter therapeutic communities have extensive substance-use histories and significant psychosocial dysfunction.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H438475106"><span class="h3">Medically managed intensive inpatient services</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Inpatient care mainly provides medically supervised withdrawal for substance-dependent individuals with 24-hour patient care and daily physician visits over brief lengths of stay (eg, two to five days). Medically supervised withdrawal (previously called detoxification) consists of close monitoring and treatment of withdrawal symptoms with medication to diminish their severity. Medically supervised withdrawal takes place either in freestanding treatment centers or, for medically complicated patients, in hospitals. Inpatient programs usually include group treatment that provides education and support. Medication to prevent relapse may be started during an inpatient stay. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/323.html" rel="external">"Management of moderate and severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7808.html" rel="external">"Opioid withdrawal: Medically supervised withdrawal during treatment for opioid use disorder"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/88407.html" rel="external">"Benzodiazepine use disorder", section on 'Withdrawal'</a>.)</p><p>In the past, inpatient stays were often longer and included both medically supervised withdrawal and rehabilitation (ie, psychosocial treatment focused on preventing relapse). Clinical trials demonstrated that selected populations could be treated at lower, less resource-intensive levels of care [<a href="#rid12">12</a>], reserving inpatient treatment for more severe, medically or psychiatrically complicated cases of withdrawal. Far fewer patients receive inpatient rehabilitation today. More commonly, the rehabilitative phase of treatment that follows medically supervised withdrawal is provided at a lower level of care following inpatient discharge.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1920210672"><span class="h2">Special considerations</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2135131759"><span class="h3">Treatment integration for co-occurring conditions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The National Survey on Drug Use and Health reported that almost 4 percent of the United States adults had both a SUD and a mental disorder [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The ASAM criteria [<a href="#rid5">5</a>] emphasize the need of availability of treatment for co-occurring mental disorders and medical conditions in conjunction with SUD care. Integration of care for SUD, mental disorders, and medical conditions at each level of care is generally recommended rather than parallel treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7798.html" rel="external">"Co-occurring schizophrenia and substance use disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment and diagnosis", section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/106146.html" rel="external">"Pharmacotherapy for co-occurring schizophrenia and substance use disorder", section on 'Integrated treatment'</a>.)</p><p>SUD treatment programs vary markedly in their capacity to treat these comorbidities. A standardized assessment of 180 community addiction programs across 11 states including outpatient, intensive outpatient, and residential treatment programs found that only approximately 20 percent were capable of delivering integrated or dual-diagnosis services [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Many partial-hospital and intensive-outpatient programs provide psychiatric and/or medical treatment as an integral part of their program. A minority of systems of care have integrated programs at each level of care for treatment of dual diagnoses. Increased service capacity for the dually diagnosed is clearly needed.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1823237349"><span class="h2">Opioid use disorders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Due to the worsening opioid overdose epidemic, which has escalated further during the COVID-19 pandemic, the treatment of opioid use disorders (OUDs) requires special consideration.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Comprehensive framework of care</strong> – An OUD Cascade of Care framework has been proposed to improve treatment outcomes and reduce mortality from opioid overdoses and associated medical complications [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. The OUD Cascade of Care expands beyond the ASAM level of care to include primary prevention to increase public awareness and reduce opioid exposure as well as secondary prevention aimed at prevention and screening in at-risk populations. Following identification of an OUD, the treatment cascade includes engagement in care, initiation of medications for OUD (MOUD), retention, and remission. Treatment of OUD can span across the ASAM level of care spectrum from office-based opioid treatment including MOUD, such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9170" href="/z/d/drug information/9170.html" rel="external">buprenorphine</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9679" href="/z/d/drug information/9679.html" rel="external">naltrexone</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9623" href="/z/d/drug information/9623.html" rel="external">methadone</a> from a federally certified outpatient treatment program, to medically managed inpatient services.

Most clinicians believe this has an important role in maximizing patient outcomes. However, testing of the matching process via clinical trials is challenging and results have been mixed. Additionally, factors other than level of care criteria often influence patient placement, including insurance restrictions and the availability of individual levels of care, both of which vary widely across plans and systems of care.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1938401285"><span class="h2">Determining level of care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Determination of the patient’s initial and subsequent levels of care involves synthesis of his or her status in each dimension, the interaction among dimensions, and the types and intensity of services available at each level (see <a class="local">'Clinician assessment using ASAM dimensions'</a> above).

This tool was developed with a greater number of level of care options, allowing for a direct match to the state’s treatment system. Intermediate to good reliability was found when used by clinically trained individuals, and in a review of over 390,000 client records, the recommended level of care was overridden only 10 percent of the time, demonstrating the value of consistent standards and implementation [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) criteria – These criteria provide a structured approach to the assessment/determination  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef100475" href="/z/d/graphic/100475.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). The ASAM matrix utilizes a rating of 0 to 4 across each of the dimensions with 0 = no need for specific services and 4 = high-intensity services. The dimension with a highest risk rating identifies the need for immediate treatment. As examples:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In an individual with a risk of severe alcohol withdrawal including seizures or delirium tremens in Dimension 1, a referral for inpatient medically monitored withdrawal would be indicated.

The SUD could be addressed in enhanced addiction services or an integrated mental health/SUD program if available. Temporary supportive living may be necessary at the onset.

Serial patient assessment and monitoring is an important part of this model, with modification of patients’ level of care over time based on their phase of illness, clinical status, co-occurring conditions, and treatment needs/preferences. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Levels of care</strong> – SUD treatment is provided via a continuum of care, ie, multiple tiers of clinical services that vary by setting, types of treatment, and intensity of services.
