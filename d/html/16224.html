Its transmural nature coupled with the variability of intestinal distribution (ie, which intestinal segment is affected) and systemic, extraintestinal manifestations, gives rise to a spectrum of clinical presentations and risk for long-term sequelae. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4070.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of Crohn disease in adults"</a>.)</p><p>The primary focus of this topic is the medical management of high-risk patients with moderate to severe Crohn disease in the outpatient setting. This topic also provides an overview of the approach to the acutely ill patient with Crohn disease. Our recommendations are generally consistent with the American Gastroenterological Association and American College of Gastroenterology guidelines on medical therapy for induction and remission in inflammatory Crohn disease. (See <a class="local">'Society guideline links'</a> below.)</p><p>As a guiding principle, each treatment regimen must be individualized to meet the needs of the patient. The risks and benefits of each medical therapy must be discussed with the patient and a shared decision-making process is recommended.</p><p>The management of low-risk patients with mild Crohn disease, the management of patients who have had surgical resection, and surveillance for dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4069.html" rel="external">"Overview of the medical management of mild (low risk) Crohn disease in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4084.html" rel="external">"Management of Crohn disease after surgical resection"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4079.html" rel="external">"Surveillance and management of dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2855132514"><span class="h1">DEFINING DISEASE ACTIVITY AND SEVERITY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinical trials of Crohn disease often use formal grading systems that rely on subjective symptoms to describe disease severity. Two commonly used systems are the Crohn Disease Activity Index (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/15646.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>) and the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/15654.html" rel="external">calculator 2</a>). Details of these grading systems and the stratification of patients with Crohn disease into either a low or moderate/high risk category by assessing inflammatory status are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4069.html" rel="external">"Overview of the medical management of mild (low risk) Crohn disease in adults", section on 'Assessing disease activity, severity, and risk'</a>.)</p><p>High-risk patients with moderate to severe Crohn disease may have the following features [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diagnosis at a younger age (&lt;30 years)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of active or recent tobacco use</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Elevated C-reactive protein and/or fecal calprotectin levels</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Deep ulcers on colonoscopy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Long segments of small and/or large bowel involvement</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Perianal disease </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Extra-intestinal manifestations</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of bowel resections</p><p></p><p>High-risk patients also include patients who have not responded to glucocorticoids (ie, refractory) or who relapse after achieving clinical remission following induction therapy with glucocorticoids. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4069.html" rel="external">"Overview of the medical management of mild (low risk) Crohn disease in adults", section on 'induction of remission'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H215932566"><span class="h1">THE ACUTELY ILL PATIENT WITH CROHN DISEASE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Inpatient hospitalization is required for patients with Crohn disease who are acutely ill due to a complication such as partial small bowel obstruction, peritonitis, or a disease flare that is not responding to outpatient therapy. Management may include intravenous fluid and electrolyte replacement, intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics, nutritional assessment, and consultation with a gastrointestinal surgeon. Some patients may also require treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids or biologic therapy. </p><p>The initial evaluation and management of the acutely ill patient is guided by several factors, including the clinical presentation, severity of illness, history of prior inpatient hospitalizations for complications of Crohn disease (eg, recurrent partial small bowel obstruction), and assessment from gastroenterology and gastrointestinal surgery specialists.</p><p>The clinical features of complications or flares due to Crohn disease (eg, abdominal pain, diarrhea and inadequate oral intake) are broadly overlapping and the need for imaging depends, in part, upon the clinical presentation and prior history. For example, a young patient with Crohn disease and a history of partial small bowel obstruction who previously responded to medical management and now presents with mildly obstructive symptoms may respond to medical management without requiring advanced imaging. For other patients, an abdominal and pelvic computed tomography scan at the time of hospital admission may help to distinguish among the diagnostic possibilities. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1809890078"><span class="h2">Partial small bowel obstruction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Partial small bowel obstruction is common in longstanding Crohn disease. The symptoms most commonly associated with acute small bowel obstruction are nausea, vomiting, cramping, abdominal pain, and inability to pass flatus or stool. Small bowel obstruction may result from a stricture causing mechanical obstruction, a stenotic area with superimposed inflammation and spasm, a stenotic area in which undigested food has impacted, an enterolith or, in patients who have had prior surgery, intestinal adhesions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8037.html" rel="external">"Etiologies, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults", section on 'Clinical presentations'</a>.)</p><p>Affected patients most commonly present with partial obstruction and, except in those who have an adhesion, the mechanism is non-strangulating. Medical management with intravenous hydration, nasogastric suction, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10307" href="/d/drug information/10307.html" rel="external">parenteral nutrition</a> is often successful, with a response seen within 24 to 48 hours [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. For patients who do not have proximal small bowel dilation and who have no evidence of long strictures (&gt;10 cm) (on cross sectional imaging), we suggest initial medical management with parenteral glucocorticoids. Surgery is reserved for those patients who do not respond to medical management or who have evidence of small bowel ischemia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/86198.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of Crohn disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3844492305"><span class="h2">Localized peritonitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with small bowel Crohn disease may present with fever, chills, and right lower quadrant pain associated with leukocytosis. Patients with such presentation have often suffered a microperforation with localized peritonitis that is contained by the surrounding mesentery and bowel loops. Appendicitis is also a potential source of peritonitis, and an abdominal and pelvic computed tomography scan at the time of hospital admission may help to distinguish among the diagnostic possibilities. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96169.html" rel="external">"Acute appendicitis in adults: Diagnostic evaluation", section on 'Computed tomography'</a>.)</p><p>The management of localized peritonitis includes bowel rest and empiric antibiotic therapy  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106949" href="/d/graphic/106949.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/101694.html" rel="external">"Antimicrobial approach to intra-abdominal infections in adults", section on 'Empiric antimicrobial therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Although medical management is the initial approach, consultation with a gastrointestinal or colorectal surgeon is suggested. A response to intravenous antibiotic therapy is usually seen within three to four days. Most patients will then be transitioned to oral antibiotics, but some patients may require up to two weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy. A subsequent two- to four-week course of outpatient oral therapy with a fluoroquinolone and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9646" href="/d/drug information/9646.html" rel="external">metronidazole</a>, or equivalent broad spectrum antibiotics, is suggested. Intestinal resection should be considered in nonresponders. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/86198.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of Crohn disease", section on 'Perforation'</a>.)</p><p>There is some controversy as to the role of glucocorticoids in this setting. For patients already on glucocorticoids, a small increase in the dose may be required. However, for those not previously on glucocorticoids, we suggest withholding glucocorticoids to avoid masking any further clinical deterioration. There are, however, few data to support this concern for increased complications in patients who receive glucocorticoids; one case-control study did find an increased risk of developing an intraabdominal or pelvic abscess in patients with penetrating Crohn disease who received glucocorticoids (OR 9.0; 95% CI 2.4-34.0) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H331427493"><span class="h2">Abscess</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An intra-abdominal abscess may present acutely with fever, abdominal pain and tenderness; however, a walled-off inflammatory mass without infection may present with milder abdominal discomfort and a palpable mass on physical examination. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4070.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of Crohn disease in adults", section on 'Features of transmural inflammation'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with an intra-abdominal abscess resulting from Crohn disease should receive antibiotic treatment and either percutaneous or surgical drainage of the abscess, followed by surgical resection of the involved bowel segment. Details regarding abscess drainage and bowel resection in patients with Crohn disease are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/86198.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of Crohn disease", section on 'Abscess'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1431474092"><span class="h2">Risk of venous thromboembolism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. We recommend prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin for venous thromboembolism in all hospitalized patients with IBD [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1346.html" rel="external">"Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in acutely ill hospitalized medical adults", section on 'Our approach'</a>.)</p><p>In a cohort of over 2700 patients with at least one hospitalization related to IBD, patients receiving thromboprophylaxis had a lower risk of post-hospitalization venous thromboembolism compared with those who did not receive prophylaxis (HR 0.46, 95% CI, 0.22-0.97) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1346207089"><span class="h1">INDUCTION THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Our approach to induction of remission in high-risk patients with moderate to severe Crohn disease is generally consistent with guidelines from the American Gastroenterology Association and American College of Gastroenterology [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. These patients may have newly diagnosed moderate to severe Crohn disease, or were initially mild and progressed to more severe disease. (See <a class="local">'Defining disease activity and severity'</a> above.) </p><p>The goal of therapy is to induce and then to maintain remission. Once remission is achieved, an ileocolonoscopy is performed in 6 to 12 months.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2758628932"><span class="h2">Selecting induction therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Selecting induction therapy for patients with moderate to severe Crohn disease takes into account several factors including patient preferences, patient characteristics (eg, age), disease characteristics (eg, fistulizing or penetrating disease), and response to prior therapy for Crohn disease.</p><p>Because multiple factors inform the decision to begin a specific induction regimen, the choice is individualized and decision-making is shared with the patient. This selection process results in treatment variability among patients. For the patient with moderate to severe Crohn disease, first-line options for induction therapy include a biologic agent with or without an immunomodulator [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. For example, for patients who are naïve to biologics, anti-TNF agents (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8984" href="/d/drug information/8984.html" rel="external">infliximab</a>) are typically given as combination therapy (anti-TNF agent plus immunomodulator) to prevent immunogenicity, whereas anti-IL 12/23 or anti-integrin therapies are generally given as monotherapy. In addition, combination therapy is first-line therapy for patients with fistulizing disease (perianal or intestinal [eg, enterocutaneous fistula]). (See <a class="local">'Combination therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1906727032"><span class="h2">Combination therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most patients with fistulizing moderate to severe Crohn disease (eg, perianal or intestinal fistula), we use combination therapy consisting of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) inhibitor (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8984" href="/d/drug information/8984.html" rel="external">infliximab</a>) and an immunomodulator (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9026" href="/d/drug information/9026.html" rel="external">azathioprine</a> [AZA], <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9612" href="/d/drug information/9612.html" rel="external">6-mercaptopurine</a> [6-MP], or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a>) [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>].

High-risk patients are often young, have deep ulcers on colonoscopy, have perianal disease, and have extensive disease. They may have extra-intestinal manifestations, a history of intestinal resection, and tend to have objective markers of disease based on laboratory testing (C-reactive protein and/or fecal calprotectin) and cross sectional imaging.
