         Symptoms of hypoglycemia are nonspecific and may include anxiety, weakness, tremor, perspiration, or palpitations. With marked hypoglycemia, there can be alterations in mental status ranging from confusion to coma. In a person without diabetes who has postprandial sympathoadrenal symptoms, the probability of having a postprandial hypoglycemic disorder is very low if concurrent plasma glucose concentrations are normal, even if the symptoms resolve with eating. Similarly, the presence of a hypoglycemic disorder cannot be diagnosed with confidence solely on the basis of a low plasma glucose concentration postprandially as glucose levels &lt;50 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L) can be seen in healthy, asymptomatic people. The clinical importance of the evaluation is primarily related to the need to differentiate a true postprandial hypoglycemic disorder from postprandial syndrome.
        </p>
        <p>
         The evaluation and management of patients with symptoms that resemble those of hypoglycemia and occur predominantly in the postprandial state will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations of and diagnostic approach to hypoglycemia in general are discussed separately. (See

         Postprandial hypoglycemia describes the timing of hypoglycemia (within four hours after meals) and is not a diagnosis per se. The presence of postprandial hypoglycemia requires an investigation to determine the specific cause of hypoglycemia (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70726" href="/z/d/graphic/70726.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Some disorders can produce both fasting and postprandial hypoglycemia. Disorders that cause hypoglycemia predominantly in the postprandial state include the noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome (NIPHS), post Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) hypoglycemia, and insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia (

         The term "postprandial syndrome" is used to describe a disorder observed in patients with postprandial symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia but
         <strong>
          without concurrent biochemical evidence of hypoglycemia
         </strong>
         , usually after ingestion of a high carbohydrate meal and with resolution of symptoms after dietary modification [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The earlier term "reactive hypoglycemia" to describe this syndrome is no longer used since low glucose levels are not considered to cause the symptoms [

        </p>
        <p>
         In the past, patients with symptoms suggestive of increased sympathetic activity (anxiety, weakness, tremor, perspiration, or palpitations) occurring after meals were considered to have functional hyperinsulinism or functional hypoglycemia (ie, an exaggerated physiologic response, but not a disease), as a reaction to the ingestion of food. The diagnosis was based upon reproduction of the patient's hypoglycemia symptoms in association with a blood glucose value of &lt;50 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L) after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. However, the OGTT is not a useful test for diagnosing reactive hypoglycemia based on the following observations:

         At least 10 percent of healthy, asymptomatic individuals have nadir blood glucose concentrations less than 50 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L) during a four- to six-hour OGTT [

         Many patients with postprandial adrenergic symptoms have similar symptoms after administration of a placebo instead of glucose [

         Serum cortisol or epinephrine concentrations often do not increase when blood glucose concentrations are low or symptoms are present, suggesting that the fall in blood glucose was not sufficient to activate counterregulation and making it difficult to relate the symptoms to autonomic activation [

         In a study in which plasma glucose responses to a mixed meal were compared with those after oral glucose administration, none of the patients who had plasma glucose values less than 50 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L) after oral glucose had hypoglycemia after a mixed meal or any electroencephalography (EEG) evidence of hypoglycemia [

          11

         For patients with postprandial symptoms that resemble those of hypoglycemia, an important goal is to distinguish a true postprandial hypoglycemic disorder from postprandial syndrome.
        </p>
        <p>
         The presence of a postprandial hypoglycemic disorder cannot be diagnosed solely on the basis of postprandial symptoms (eg, anxiety, weakness, dizziness, tremor, perspiration, or palpitations). Postprandial sympathoadrenal symptoms may be highly suggestive of hypoglycemia, but they cannot be ascribed to hypoglycemia unless the glucose concentration is low (&lt;55 mg/dL [&lt;3 mmol/L]) at the same time, and the symptoms are relieved when glucose levels are raised. This cluster of findings is called Whipple's triad:

          Self-monitoring of blood glucose
         </strong>
         – Blood glucose monitoring (BGM) with fingersticks and a glucose meter may be used initially to exclude the presence of hypoglycemia coincident with typical postprandial symptoms. We advise patients to check several fingerstick glucose levels at the time of postprandial symptoms. Glucose values obtained by reflectance meters cannot reliably discriminate a low-normal fasting glucose from a value in the hypoglycemic range. Therefore, the threshold to pursue additional evaluation is set higher than the lower limit of the normal reference range. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems also have reliability issues in the hypoglycemic range and are therefore prone to error in this range. We generally do not use CGM systems for evaluating symptoms of hypoglycemia in people without diabetes. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1781.html" rel="external">

          Glucose &lt;65 mg/dL
         </strong>
         – If glucose is &lt;65 mg/dL during symptoms and symptoms improved when the plasma glucose was raised, a hypoglycemic disorder is likely. A suppressed insulin level (&lt;3 microU/mL [pmol/L]) suggests noninsulin-mediated causes of hypoglycemia (eg, alcohol, medications [other than antihyperglycemic agents], toxins, malnourishment, cortisol deficiency), whereas a nonsuppressed insulin level suggests the possibility of insulin-mediated hypoglycemia (eg, post-bariatric hypoglycemia, factitious hypoglycemia [surreptitious use of insulin, sulfonylureas, or meglitinides], insulinoma). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Determining the cause'

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Although standards for the interpretation of the mixed meal test have not been established from the study of volunteers with non-insulin-mediated postprandial hypoglycemia, it is reasonable to assume that, in individuals with an intact upper gastrointestinal tract, hypoglycemia should not occur. The interpretation of insulin in the postprandial period is more difficult than in the fasting state as concentrations represent the net sum of secretion and clearance. Insulin has a half-life of approximately 5 minutes. Therefore, elevation in insulin levels in the postprandial period may reflect their rates of clearance following the rise in response to nutrient ingestion. Nevertheless, even discounting the effect of clearance rates, if the hypoglycemia is not insulin mediated, the levels of insulin should be at suppressed levels (&lt;3 microU/mL [pmol/L]). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1798.html" rel="external">
          "Hypoglycemia in adults without diabetes mellitus: Determining the etiology", section on 'Interpretation of supervised fast results'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         If symptoms do not occur during the mixed meal test, the patient can be provided with additional laboratory requisitions for glucose and insulin (venipuncture) to be performed at the time of symptoms (see
         <a class="local">
          'Measurement of glucose during spontaneous occurrence of symptoms'
         </a>
         above). In post-RYGB patients who have been experiencing symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia but do not develop hypoglycemia during the test, dietary modification (ie, consuming foods similar to those used in the mixed meal test) may be sufficient to alleviate symptoms.

The perturbation of the usual physiology and temporal relationship of gastric emptying, absorption of nutrients in the small intestine and alterations in insulin release after vagotomies and partial vagotomies is thought to be the cause. Alimentary hypoglycemia is less common now that these procedures are performed less frequently.

The finding of circulating antibodies to insulin (and with a high binding capacity for insulin) confirms the diagnosis.

However, blood glucose concentrations have rarely been measured at the time of spontaneously occurring symptoms in these patients, and this phenomenon thus has yet to be firmly established. The presumed mechanism of early diabetes hypoglycemia would be a supranormal insulin response to a supranormal rise in plasma glucose after glucose ingestion, followed by an excessively rapid response to the insulin.

          Postprandial hypoglycemia

          Postprandial syndrome
         </strong>
         – Postprandial syndrome is used to describe a disorder observed in patients with postprandial symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia but
         <strong>
          without concurrent biochemical evidence of hypoglycemia
         </strong>
         after ingestion of a high carbohydrate meal and with resolution of symptoms after dietary modification. The term "reactive hypoglycemia" is an outmoded term that often is erroneously used to describe postprandial syndrome. (See

          Evaluation
         </strong>
         – For patients with postprandial symptoms that resemble those of hypoglycemia, the clinical importance of the evaluation is primarily related to the need to distinguish a true postprandial hypoglycemic disorder from postprandial syndrome. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Evaluation'

          Measurement of glucose during symptoms
         </strong>
         – Glucose should be measured during the occurrence of symptoms (

          algorithm 1

         ). Blood glucose monitoring (BGM) with fingersticks and a glucose meter may be used initially to exclude the presence of hypoglycemia during typical postprandial symptoms. However, glucose values obtained by reflectance meters (or continuous glucose monitoring [CGM] systems) cannot reliably discriminate a low-normal fasting glucose from a value in the hypoglycemic range. Therefore, the threshold to pursue additional evaluation is set higher than the lower limit of the normal reference range. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Measurement of glucose during spontaneous occurrence of symptoms'

         – If any glucose reading is &lt;80 mg/dL at the time of symptoms, hypoglycemia cannot be excluded as a cause of the symptoms. In this setting, measurement of plasma glucose and insulin should be obtained by venipuncture during the spontaneous occurrence of symptoms.

          Mixed meal test
         </strong>
         – For a mixed meal diagnostic test, the patient consumes a meal of solid composition that usually leads to symptoms and is then observed for symptoms of hypoglycemia. Patients who have had Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) should have a test meal that is appropriate for post-RYGB patients; they should avoid high carbohydrate intake and caloric intake in liquid form. (See
         <a class="local">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Venipuncture samples (glucose, insulin) are collected prior to ingestion of the meal and then a sample for glucose, insulin, and a sulfonylurea/meglitinide screen is collected during the occurrence of symptoms (

          Glucose ≥65 mg/dL (3.6 mmol/L)

         – A hypoglycemic disorder is unlikely if a plasma glucose concentration is ≥65 mg/dL at the time of the postprandial symptoms. Evaluate for other causes of postprandial symptoms.

          Glucose &lt;65 mg/dL
         </strong>
         – If glucose is &lt;65 mg/dL during symptoms and symptoms improve when the plasma glucose is raised, a hypoglycemic disorder is likely. A suppressed insulin level (&lt;3 microU/mL [pmol/L]) suggests non-insulin-mediated causes of hypoglycemia (eg, alcohol, medications [other than antihyperglycemic agents], toxins, malnourishment, cortisol deficiency), whereas a nonsuppressed insulin level suggests the possibility of insulin-mediated hypoglycemia (eg, post-bariatric hypoglycemia, factitious hypoglycemia [surreptitious use of insulin, sulfonylureas, or meglitinides], insulinoma).

          Determining the cause
         </strong>
         – When biochemical evidence of postprandial hypoglycemia is confirmed, the cause must be determined. There are several hypoglycemic disorders that cause predominantly postprandial symptoms (

          Postprandial syndrome
         </strong>
         – Initial treatment includes dietary and lifestyle changes, Eating frequent (every three hours) small meals or snacks, consuming foods high in fiber, avoiding foods high in sugar, and adding a regular exercise regimen. If dietary modification is not successful in reducing symptoms, a trial of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors to delay carbohydrate absorption and thereby reduce the insulin response to a meal may be helpful in some patients.
