However, CHD and acquired heart disease can present later in childhood.</p><p>The signs and symptoms that lead clinicians to suspect heart disease in infants and children and criteria referring patients to a pediatric cardiologist will be reviewed here. The approach to identifying critical CHD during the newborn period and assessing cardiac murmurs in infants and children are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5774.html" rel="external">"Identifying newborns with critical congenital heart disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/103723.html" rel="external">"Approach to the infant or child with a cardiac murmur"</a>.)</p><p>Individual cardiac conditions are also discussed separately. (See appropriate topic reviews.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">TIMING OF REFERRAL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although somewhat obvious, the urgency of referral depends on the clinical condition of the patient and the seriousness of the underlying diagnosis that is suspected. Patients with hemodynamic instability, such as those with cardiogenic shock, require immediate care in an emergency department or intensive care setting. Urgent referral or consultation with a pediatric cardiologist should occur in patients with or at imminent risk for hemodynamic compromise or death due to suspected cardiac disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6397.html" rel="external">"Shock in children in resource-abundant settings: Initial management"</a>.)</p><p>For patients who are hemodynamically stable but who have clinical findings suggestive of a cardiac condition with potential to progress (ie, cause hemodynamic compromise or even become life threatening over a period of weeks to months), referral to a pediatric cardiologist should occur within days to no longer than a week. In our center, these patients are generally seen within one week of their presentation. Signs, symptoms, and physical findings suggestive of such cardiac conditions are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Symptoms'</a> below and <a class="local">'Physical examination findings'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients with potential cardiac lesions that are unlikely to progress to hemodynamic compromise, routine nonurgent referral is appropriate and can occur over a matter of weeks. This includes asymptomatic patients with a concerning murmur (eg, mild pulmonary or aortic valve stenosis)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef105035" href="/z/d/graphic/105035.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/103723.html" rel="external">"Approach to the infant or child with a cardiac murmur", section on 'Criteria for referral'</a>.)</p><p>If there is a question about timing of referral, a pediatric cardiologist should be contacted to discuss the details of the case.</p><p>Referral considerations for some specific clinical findings include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Poor perfusion/cardiogenic shock</strong> – For infants and children who present with signs of shock, a cardiogenic etiology should be suspected if there is a history of heart disease, an abnormal cardiac examination, and/or worsening clinical condition after fluid resuscitation. Patients in cardiogenic shock often have poor perfusion (delayed capillary refill [&gt;3 seconds], cool extremities, and diminished distal pulses), respiratory distress (tachypnea and wheezing), and/or hepatomegaly. Patients presenting with poor perfusion and/or shock require emergency management as discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6396.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation of shock in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6397.html" rel="external">"Shock in children in resource-abundant settings: Initial management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Cardiac diseases that may present as shock after the neonatal period include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Left-sided obstructive lesions (eg, critical coarctation of the aorta  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103747" href="/z/d/graphic/103747.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>), critical aortic stenosis).

Patients with SVT who are hemodynamically unstable require immediate cardioversion. Ventricular arrhythmias are less common in children but can be a cause of cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5782.html" rel="external">"Management of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5758.html" rel="external">"Management and evaluation of wide QRS complex tachycardia in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cyanosis</strong> – Central cyanosis, a bluish purple discoloration of tissues (nail beds, tongue, and mucous membranes) is evident when systemic arterial concentration of deoxygenated hemoglobin in the blood exceeds 5 g/dL (3.1 mmol/L), which generally corresponds to an oxygen saturation ≤85 percent. Central cyanosis as a presenting sign of congenital heart disease (CHD) is most commonly seen during the first weeks of life in neonates with lesions dependent upon a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef103087" href="/z/d/graphic/103087.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). As discussed separately, cyanotic CHD defects can be detected with neonatal pulse oximetry screening.

Children who have had a syncopal event from which they have completely recovered and have no "red flags" for cardiac syncope  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91373" href="/z/d/graphic/91373.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) can generally be followed as outpatients. (See <a class="local">'Syncope'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6464.html" rel="external">"Emergency evaluation of syncope in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The likelihood of syncope due to cardiac disease is increased, and urgent referral to a cardiologist is warranted for the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Syncope associated with exercise or exertion</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Syncope associated with chest pain</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Syncope in a child with a history of acquired or CHD</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Syncope in a child with a family history of syncope or sudden cardiac death (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1019.html" rel="external">"Approach to sudden cardiac arrest in the absence of apparent structural heart disease", section on 'Familial SCD'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Murmur</strong> – Heart murmurs are common in pediatric patients, but only a minority of patients have a structural heart defect.

In addition, pulse oximetry, chest radiography, and electrocardiography (ECG) may be helpful in the evaluation. The roles of routine pulse oximetry and ECG as screening tools for identifying cardiac disease in asymptomatic infants and children are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/101291.html" rel="external">"Newborn screening for critical congenital heart disease using pulse oximetry"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/85989.html" rel="external">"Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in children", section on 'Primary prevention of SCD'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2412339"><span class="h2">Clinical context</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In most infants and children with serious cardiac disease, clinical manifestations present as a constellation of findings rather than one isolated finding. As an example, an infant with a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) may present with a history of poor feeding, failure to thrive (FTT), respiratory symptoms, grunting, and physical examination findings that include a loud, harsh holosystolic murmur  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104797" href="/z/d/graphic/104797.html" rel="external">movie 1</a>), tachypnea, and hepatomegaly. In contrast, patients with less severe cardiac disease may present with a single isolated finding. For example, a child with mild aortic stenosis may present with a pathologic murmur  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104800" href="/z/d/graphic/104800.html" rel="external">movie 2</a>) without any associated symptoms.</p><p>The following sections describe clinical features that are suggestive of underlying cardiac disease in a hemodynamically stable child. It is beyond the scope of this discussion to address every specific cardiac defect and the range of its clinical presentation. However, if an infant or child presents with one of these historical features or physical findings, the clinician needs to consider whether or not the underlying cause of these manifestations is likely due to cardiac disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef105035" href="/z/d/graphic/105035.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>If the primary care provider has any question regarding whether referral is appropriate or the timing of referral, they should discuss the patient with a pediatric cardiologist.</p><p>The following specific cardiac conditions are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Atrial septal defects (ASDs) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5754.html" rel="external">"Isolated atrial septal defects (ASDs) in children: Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Coarctation of the aorta (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5760.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Congenital coronary artery abnormalities (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1536.html" rel="external">"Congenital and pediatric coronary artery abnormalities"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dilated cardiomyopathy (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3516.html" rel="external">"Causes of dilated cardiomyopathy"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Heart failure (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14373.html" rel="external">"Heart failure in children: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4951.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14370.html" rel="external">"Hypoplastic left heart syndrome: Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Long QT syndrome (LQTS) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1053.html" rel="external">"Congenital long QT syndrome: Diagnosis"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Myocarditis (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5755.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in children"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1421.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in term infants, children, and adults"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Tetralogy of Fallot (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5769.html" rel="external">"Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF): Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>D-transposition of the great arteries (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14374.html" rel="external">"D-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA): Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Valvar, subvalvar, and supravalvar aortic stenosis (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5775.html" rel="external">"Valvar aortic stenosis in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5776.html" rel="external">"Subvalvar aortic stenosis (subaortic stenosis)"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>VSDs (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5787.html" rel="external">"Isolated ventricular septal defects (VSDs) in infants and children: Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Symptoms</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Symptoms in infants</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Lethargy, irritability, respiratory symptoms (eg, increased rate and work of breathing), and sweating are nonspecific symptoms that are common findings in infants with clinically significant cardiac disease.

LAD is also an additional criterion used in the ECG diagnosis of LV hypertrophy in older children and adults. In a retrospective chart review of 158 children without previously known heart disease who had LAD on ECG, 15 percent were found to have heart disease on echocardiogram [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Heart disease was more likely in patients with abnormal cardiac examination findings and/or ECG chamber enlargement, hypertrophy, or a QRS axis ≤-42°. The most common diagnoses were secundum ASD, partial AV canal defect, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Right axis deviation and right atrial enlargement are suggestive of a secundum ASD that is often accompanied by a widely split second heart sound and a pulmonary flow murmur.

Similarly, premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are often benign, but referral is generally warranted in pediatric patients with frequent PVCs.

(See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Common presenting symptoms</strong> – Infants and children with cardiac disease often present with nonspecific symptoms. (See <a class="local">'Symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Infants</strong> – Common presenting symptoms in infancy include lethargy, irritability, tachypnea, sweating, poor feeding, and poor weight gain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Older children</strong> – Symptoms of cardiac disease in older children may include lethargy, exercise intolerance, and respiratory distress. Chest pain and syncope are common reasons for referral to a pediatric cardiologist; however, these symptoms are infrequently associated with cardiac disease in children.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – In hemodynamically stable patients, the clinical evaluation to assess the likelihood of cardiac disease includes the following (see <a class="local">'Evaluation of stable patients'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Personal and family history</strong> – The history includes details of the child's past medical history and presenting symptoms. A thorough family history should be part of the evaluation since some forms of structural CHD have familial patterns  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef103088" href="/z/d/graphic/103088.html" rel="external">table 8</a>). In addition, certain types of cardiomyopathy and channelopathies have a strong autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. (See <a class="local">'Family history'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Physical examination</strong> – Key physical examination findings that are suggestive of underlying childhood cardiac disease include poor weight gain, poor peripheral perfusion, respiratory abnormalities (tachypnea, retractions, wheezes), and cardiac auscultatory abnormalities (pathologic heart murmur, abnormal second heart sound, gallop, rub). (See <a class="local">'Physical examination findings'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/103723.html" rel="external">"Approach to the infant or child with a cardiac murmur", section on 'Cardiovascular examination'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Initial tests</strong> – Chest radiography and ECG are often obtained in the initial evaluation of suspected cardiac disease in children. While these tests are usually not diagnostic, they may be helpful in differentiating cardiac disease from pulmonary disease and identifying children who warrant further evaluation. (See <a class="local">'Initial tests'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Timing of referral</strong> – The urgency of referral depends on the clinical condition of the patient and the seriousness of the suspected underlying diagnosis. Patients with cardiogenic shock require immediate care in an emergency department or intensive care setting. Urgent referral or consultation with a pediatric cardiologist should occur in patients with or at imminent risk for life-threatening cardiac disease. For an asymptomatic child with a concerning murmur, routine nonurgent referral is generally appropriate. If there is a question about timing of referral, a pediatric cardiologist should be contacted to discuss the details of the case.
