         On physical examination, splenomegaly is generally defined as a palpable splenic edge felt &gt;2 cm below the left costal margin. A palpable spleen tip may be a normal finding in up to 30 percent of neonates; the frequency drops to approximately 10 percent in healthy school-age children and &lt;3 percent in young adults. (See

         The spleen has immune and hematopoietic functions. It also serves to remove senescent or abnormal red blood cells (RBCs) from the circulation.

         <strong>
          The spleen as a hematopoietic organ
         </strong>
         – At various times during gestation and/or extrauterine life, the spleen is capable of supporting elements of the erythroid, myeloid, megakaryocytic, lymphoid, and monocyte-macrophage (ie, reticuloendothelial) systems. In certain disease states (eg, beta thalassemia major, primary myelofibrosis), it may become the site of extramedullary hematopoiesis and contain developing erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic precursors. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7116.html" rel="external">
          "Diagnosis of thalassemia (adults and children)"
         </a>

         <strong>
          White pulp
         </strong>
         – The white pulp of the spleen is a major part (up to 25 percent) of the lymphoid tissue in the body. Like lymph nodes, it has germinal centers where early B-lymphocytes predominate, along with plasma cells. T-lymphocytes are the major population around periarteriolar sheaths. When foreign antigens are present in the circulation, the spleen plays a key role in providing a milieu for the immunologic response. Thus, in the absence of the spleen, antibody production may be significantly diminished. As an example, when pneumococcal vaccine is given intramuscularly to asplenic individuals, the immunoglobulin G and M (IgG and IgM) antibody titers are lower than noted in normal individuals [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Likewise, the titers of pneumococcal antibodies decline more rapidly in asplenic patients [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].

         <strong>
          Red pulp
         </strong>
         – The largest component of the spleen is the red pulp. It consists of the RBCs surrounding endothelial cords of Billroth and interdigitating splenic sinusoids, which are lined with macrophages. Because of the anatomic arrangement of blood vessels, RBCs are relatively concentrated in the terminal splenic arteries, as plasma with potentially antigenic material is shunted to the white pulp. In patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), a consequence of the high RBC concentration in these arterioles and sinusoids is that relatively mild degrees of hypoxia can cause the irreversible RBC sickling, leading to splenic infarction (autosplenectomy). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7119.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Sinusoids
         </strong>
         – In the splenic sinusoids, which course through white and red pulp, macrophages line the vascular spaces. These macrophages are important parts of the immune system in presenting antigens to lymphocytes in the white pulp, as well as in destroying antibody-coated bacteria or hematopoietic cells. When red cells squeeze through these sinusoids, the surrounding macrophages are able to remove senescent red cells, destroy or reform erythrocytes with abnormal membranes, and remove red cell inclusions such as nuclear remnants, like Howell-Jolly bodies. As a result, when the spleen is absent, many of these abnormal red cells may circulate, along with red cells containing nuclear remnants (ie, Howell-Jolly bodies)  (

         <strong>
          Platelet reservoir
         </strong>
         – The spleen acts as a reservoir for platelets; one-third of the circulating platelet mass is temporarily sequestered within a normal-sized spleen, and up to 90 percent may be found within a markedly enlarged spleen. When the spleen is removed, this reservoir function is also removed. Following splenectomy, it is common for the platelet count to temporarily exceed 1 × 10

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Splenomegaly may be caused by a process that increases normal splenic function (eg, hemolysis) or may be due to infiltrative, infectious, or vascular disorders. Similarly, removal of a spleen may alleviate disease by more than one mechanism. As an example, thrombocytopenia may be alleviated in immune thrombocytopenia through the loss of a large number of antiplatelet antibody-producing lymphocytes, as well as through the removal of splenic macrophages capable of destroying antibody-coated platelets.

         The most common causes of splenomegaly in children include infection (eg, Epstein-Barr virus [EBV] or cytomegalovirus [CMV], though many infectious agents can cause splenomegaly), malignancy, disorders of immune regulation (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, common variable immunodeficiency), and hemolytic anemia (eg, sickle cell disease [SCD] and other hereditary and acquired hemolytic anemias) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. Other important considerations include portal hypertension, storage diseases, and space-occupying lesions (eg, hemangioma, cyst, hamartoma)  (

         ).

        <p>
         In a case series of &gt;1400 hospitalized patients with splenomegaly, one-quarter of whom were &lt;18 years old, the most common disease categories were hematologic (67 percent, including leukemia, lymphoma, and hemolytic anemia), infectious (8 percent), hepatic (11 percent), and congestive or inflammatory (9 percent) [

Splenomegaly is a clinical feature of SCD in early childhood, but, by late childhood or adulthood, the spleen is typically small and atrophic due to repeated splenic infarction. The natural history of splenic involvement depends to some degree on the type of SCD. This is discussed in greater detail separately. (See

         The history may provide valuable clues as to the possible cause of splenomegaly  (

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         A history of recent febrile illness, pharyngitis, and fatigue suggests a viral etiology (eg, Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], cytomegalovirus [CMV], viral hepatitis). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8318.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         If more pronounced constitutional symptoms are noted (eg, persistent fevers, night sweats, weight loss, decreased activity level), systemic diseases such as leukemia, lymphoma, systemic lupus erythematosus, malaria, or tuberculosis should be considered.
        </p>
        <p>
         In some cases, the presence of an underlying condition is already known and the spleen may revert to normal size when the underlying disease is brought under control with appropriate therapy.

          Palpation method
         </strong>
         – Proper examination of the spleen requires relaxation of both the abdominal musculature of the patient and the examiner's hand(s). The examiner should begin palpating low in the abdomen/pelvis and advance upward. Effectiveness in palpating the spleen can be maximized by the following:
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         With the child supine, allow the child to feel the examining hand on the abdomen and to become adjusted to its presence before pressing down. Do not suddenly increase pressure during palpation, as an enlarged spleen may be quite tender (particularly if it has enlarged quickly) and the child may be reluctant to allow the examination to continue.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         The examiner should be seated comfortably in a chair alongside the patient's bed or examining table, with the examiner on the patient's right side, the right hand doing the palpation and the left hand underneath and supporting the patient's left lower rib cage.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         Make sure that the child is relaxed, with arms at the sides of the abdomen. If the arms are raised, this may stiffen the abdominal musculature and make examination more difficult. Having the child slightly flex his/her the legs and neck may also help relax the abdominal musculature.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         If examining the child in the supine position is difficult, placing the child in the right lateral decubitus position with knees and neck flexed can improve the ability to palpate the spleen. This maneuver helps relax the abdominal musculature and rotates the spleen from its usual posterior position to a more anterior position.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>

         </span>
         With greater degrees of enlargement, the spleen rotates to a more anterior and rightward position and may extend downward into the pelvis. Under these circumstances, the lower pole of the spleen may not be felt easily, because it is well below the left costal margin. In such cases, splenomegaly is appreciated either by palpating at successively lower levels on the left side of the abdomen or by palpating the medial edge of the spleen. The presence of a notch or indentation on the medial splenic edge is a further indication that the mass is spleen and not the left kidney or a pancreatic pseudocyst.

          Interpretation
         </strong>
         – A palpable spleen may represent a normal finding, splenomegaly, or massive splenomegaly:

         <strong>
          Normal finding
         </strong>
         – The spleen is palpable in nearly one-third of healthy neonates, 10 percent of healthy children, and approximately 3 percent of healthy adolescents and young adults [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. A nontender spleen that is normal or only minimally enlarged will be quite movable with respiration and may be palpable only at the end of inspiration. Using a light touch, with the skin depressed under the left costal margin, one can feel a minimally enlarged spleen as a rounded edge with the consistency of normal liver, which slips under the examiner's fingers at the end of inspiration and back on expiration. A normal spleen is soft and nontender.

          Splenomegaly
         </strong>
         – A splenic edge felt &gt;2 cm below the left costal margin is an abnormal finding. An abnormal spleen often feels hard, unlike the soft sensation of palpating a minimally enlarged spleen in a healthy child. Tenderness to palpation also suggests an abnormal finding.

         <strong>
          Massive splenomegaly
         </strong>
         – A spleen is considered to be massively enlarged if its lower pole is within the pelvis or if it crosses the midline. In extreme cases, the enlarged spleen may even be palpable in the right upper quadrant. Exquisite splenic tenderness suggests infarction or perisplenitis in such massively enlarged spleens.

Ultrasound is an important adjunct to the physical examination in that it more accurately determines spleen size and identifies focal or diffuse pathologic changes. The spleen normally appears homogeneous on ultrasound; it is slightly more echogenic than the kidney and iso- to slightly more echogenic than the liver  (

         However, ultrasonography lacks specificity in characterizing spleen pathology and, therefore, focal lesions on ultrasound should generally be further evaluated with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging [

         </a>
         ]. Other imaging modalities include nuclear medicine liver-spleen colloid study and positron emission tomography. These imaging techniques may reveal accessory spleens (found in 30 percent of autopsies) and polysplenia associated with congenital heart disease, biliary atresia, or situs inversus. A "wandering spleen" resulting from a lack of ligamentous attachment can be found anywhere in the abdomen. (See

         Causes of splenomegaly that may be elucidated by imaging techniques include portal hypertension (eg, due to cirrhosis or portal vein thrombosis [PVT]), isolated cysts, hemangioma, lymphangioma, or hamartomas. Focal abnormalities can result from trauma to the spleen (eg, subcapsular hematoma, splenic rupture), abscess, granulomas, lymphoproliferative disease, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, Gaucher disease, Niemann-Pick disease, or sarcoidosis.

         The complete blood count should be interpreted in the context of other clinical findings. Cytopenias (neutropenia, anemia, and/or thrombocytopenia) are common in children with splenomegaly and represent a nonspecific finding.

         The cytopenias seen with hypersplenism are not associated with morphologically abnormal circulating white or red blood cell (RBC) forms. Only a minimally predictable relationship exists between the degree of splenomegaly and the presence or degree of these cytopenias [

          Suspected liver disease and/or portal hypertension

         – Liver disease is suggested by findings of jaundice, hepatomegaly, firm liver edge, ascites, and/or spider angiomata. Abnormal liver function tests and abnormal findings on abdominal imaging help to identify liver disease as the cause of splenomegaly. Further testing is warranted to identify the cause of liver disease; liver biopsy may be warranted in some cases.

         – A splenic edge felt &gt;2 cm below the left costal margin is an abnormal finding. A spleen is considered to be massively enlarged if its lower pole is within the pelvis or if it crosses the midline. (See

         <strong>
          Causes
         </strong>
         – The most common causes of splenomegaly in children include infection (eg, Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], cytomegalovirus [CMV], or others), malignancy, hemolytic anemias, and disorders of immune regulation (eg, autoimmune disease or primary immunodeficiency). Other important considerations include portal hypertension, heart failure, storage diseases, and space-occupying lesions (eg, hemangioma, cyst, hamartoma)  (

          History
         </strong>
         – The history may provide valuable clues as to the possible cause of splenomegaly  (

          table 1

         ). A history of recent febrile illness, pharyngitis, and fatigue suggests a viral etiology (eg, infectious mononucleosis, CMV, hepatitis). More pronounced constitutional symptoms (eg, persistent fevers, night sweats, weight loss, decreased activity level) suggest systemic diseases such as leukemia, lymphoma, systemic lupus erythematosus, malaria, or tuberculosis.

          Imaging
         </strong>
         – Ultrasonography (including Doppler imaging to evaluate splenic and portal blood flow) is usually the initial imaging test to evaluate a child with unexplained splenomegaly. It accurately defines spleen size and volume and identifies focal or diffuse pathologic changes. A finding of slow or reversed portal blood flow suggests portal hypertension. Focal lesions identified on ultrasound should generally be further evaluated with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. (See

         – For most children who present with unexplained splenomegaly, a likely diagnosis (or diagnostic category) can be arrived at based upon the history, physical examination, and initial imaging and laboratory findings. In most cases, additional testing is needed to establish the specific diagnosis  (
