         Acute pelvic pain is generally defined as lower abdominal or pelvic pain that has lasted less than three months. Over one-third of reproductive-aged women will experience nonmenstrual pelvic pain at some point. While most acute pelvic pain is caused by reproductive, urinary, or gastrointestinal tract disorders, abnormalities of musculoskeletal, vascular, and neurologic processes can contribute as well. Excluding pregnancy is a critical step, as the causes and management of pelvic pain in pregnant women differ significantly; women diagnosed with pregnancy are referred for immediate evaluation. Pelvic pain frequently occurs with abdominal pain and can be a challenging complaint because of the need to consider a wide array of possible conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic presents a framework for the evaluation of nonpregnant adult women with acute pelvic pain, with an emphasis on gynecologic conditions.

         Acute pelvic pain is a nonspecific symptom that is generally defined as pain of the low abdomen or pelvis that has lasted less than three months. The pain may be diffuse or focal and, in some cases, includes musculoskeletal and low back pain. The pain can be sharp or dull, focal or diffuse, and sporadic or constant. Most commonly, the cause is some pelvic pathology, including disease of the gynecologic, gastrointestinal, and urologic systems. A patient can simultaneously have pain both in the pelvis and abdomen or have pain that starts in one location and radiates to another. Importantly, a patient with chronic pelvic pain, of known or unknown etiology, can present with an acute process arising de novo or a pain exacerbation that is related to the chronic condition. (See

        </p>

         Pain that is exclusive to the mid or upper abdomen, low back, and external urogenital tissue (eg, vulva, rectum) is not considered pelvic pain. Information on these topics is presented separately:

         ].
         <strong>
         </strong>
         Ectopic pregnancy and ovarian cysts can result in uncontrolled intraperitoneal hemorrhage should rupture occur. Ovarian torsion needs to be diagnosed and corrected quickly to preserve ovarian function [

        <p>
         Pain may result from infection and/or inflammation; organ ischemia or distention; or leakage of pus, blood, feces, or other material into the pelvis. Visceral pain afferents innervating the reproductive organs arise from spinal segments that share innervation with other pelvic viscera including the appendix, lower ileum, colon, bladder, and ureters. Similarly, neural cross-talk happens between the visceral (organs) and somatic (muscles/fascia) systems such that pain from myofascial structures is referred to viscera and vice versa. These physiologic factors make the accurate clinical diagnosis of adult women presenting with acute pelvic pain challenging. Because multiple organ systems contribute to and are contained within the pelvis, a broad differential is initially developed for these patients. (See

          Assess for pregnancy
         </strong>
         – We perform a pregnancy test on any patient who has the potential to be pregnant. As both the patient’s age and hormonal status can be difficult to assess in an emergency setting, we perform pregnancy testing on most patients except those who are clearly currently pregnant, prepubertal, or who are known to have no uterus. Determining pregnancy status is a critical first step in the management of women of reproductive age to enable expeditious diagnosis of conditions that warrant rapid assessment and triage. For example, among women with pelvic pain or vaginal bleeding (or both) visiting the emergency department in the first trimester of pregnancy, as many as 18 percent will have an ectopic pregnancy [

          Perform abbreviated physical examination
         </strong>
         – We perform an abdominal examination to assess for peritoneal signs, location of pain, and palpable masses. Transabdominal palpation of the uterine fundus can identify advanced pregnancy, which can be especially useful in settings where pregnancy testing is not available  (

          figure 5
         </a>
         ). Next, we perform a pelvic examination that includes visual inspection of external genitalia, speculum examination of the vagina and cervix, and bimanual examination of the uterus and adnexal structures. However, for women who could be pregnant and are hemodynamically stable, we defer intravaginal digital examination until pregnancy has been definitely excluded or ultrasound has provided information about the pregnancy such as the location of the placenta (eg, to exclude placenta and vasa previa). For women with hemodynamic instability or a suspected critical condition, such as intraperitoneal bleeding from any etiology, physical examination may be deferred in favor of immediate imaging, typically with rapid assessment ultrasound (see the bullet below).

          Perform rapid assessment ultrasound

          7,8
         </a>
         ]. Individuals trained in ultrasound technique may also evaluate for intrauterine pregnancy and adnexal mass. More detailed assessment of the uterus and adnexa often requires a transvaginal approach. While trace-free pelvic fluid can result from ovulation, larger volumes of fluid are generally not caused by ovulation and warrant consideration of type and source of fluid (eg, blood, urine, pus).

For patients who have profound bleeding or are hemodynamically unstable from any cause (eg, sepsis, trauma), we order a fibrinogen level and bleeding panels to assess for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). For patients with suspected sepsis who have signs of hemodynamic instability and infection, we request CBC with differential, chemistries, liver function tests, coagulation studies including D-dimer level, and peripheral blood cultures.

         The goal of the routine evaluation is to determine the most likely source(s) of the symptom. This process is often challenging since there are many organ systems that can cause pelvic pain, the differential diagnosis is impacted by the patient's age and reproductive status, common diseases may manifest in uncommon ways, more than one disease may be present, or a particular finding may not entirely explain the patient's presentation. As examples, pyuria may occur in appendicitis
         <strong>

         not all ovarian cysts are symptomatic [

        </p>
        <p>
         Initially, we evaluate for both gynecologic and intraabdominal causes of pain in parallel, especially if the initial history and physical examination do not provide clear guidance  (

         The general physical examination includes evaluation of vital signs, a general assessment, and abdominal examination. Tachycardia, hypotension, or evidence of an acute abdomen with rebound or guarding on abdominal examination can indicate a surgical emergency, such as intraabdominal bleeding, ectopic pregnancy, appendicitis, or ovarian torsion, and necessitates immediate referral. If there is no evidence of an acute abdomen and vital signs are unremarkable, evaluation of the patient's chest, back, and extremities is the next step. Once these assessments are completed, the pelvic examination is performed. (See

          Patients with a negative pregnancy test
         </strong>
         – Patients with a negative pregnancy test are evaluated for nongynecologic as well as gynecologic causes. Patients with history and physical examination findings suggestive of small bowel obstruction, appendicitis, nephrolithiasis, or diverticulitis, or patients with equivocal ultrasound findings, generally proceed with computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis. A detailed discussion of the evaluation for each of these entities is presented in separate topic reviews.

         Women in whom a likely etiology is identified are treated accordingly. If the pain resolves with the intervention, then no further evaluation or treatment is indicated.

         For all patients, regularly scheduled follow-up evaluation is advised. Periodic evaluation is repeated, as needed, until the pain is adequately addressed. For some women, no clear etiology of pain is identified. This small subgroup of women may continue with pain that persists for more than three to six months and, by definition, becomes chronic pelvic pain. The continued evaluation and management of these women is presented in separate discussions.

         We find laparoscopic evaluation of the abdomen and pelvis helpful to confirm, and potentially treat, findings seen on imaging studies and potentially identify pathology that may not have appeared on the imaging studies, particularly for patients with continued significant symptoms despite treatments.
        </p>
        <p>
         Surgical evaluation and treatment are indicated for women diagnosed with a potential surgical process (eg, ovarian torsion, ruptured ectopic pregnancy). The role of surgery is less clear for women presenting with acute pelvic pain without an identified or suspected etiology. Shared decision making is undertaken. We discuss with the patient that the risks of surgical exploration, typically with laparoscopy, must be balanced against the risks of potentially missing a diagnosis and presumed opportunity for treatment. As an example, approximately 2 percent of patients with clinical appendicitis will have an underlying appendiceal neoplasm [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. While medical management of appendicitis with antibiotics may be a medically appropriate option, malignancy can only be diagnosed and treated if surgery is performed. The decision is further complicated in women with chronic pain related to endometriosis because long-term medical management of endometriosis, rather than multiple surgeries, is the preferred approach [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20,21

          Definition
         </strong>
         – Acute pelvic pain is a nonspecific symptom that is generally defined as pain of the low abdomen or pelvis that has lasted less than three months. The pain may be diffuse or focal and, in some cases, includes low back pain. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Definition'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Causes
         </strong>
         – Most commonly, the causes of acute pelvic pain in women include disease of the gynecologic, gastrointestinal, and urologic systems, although musculoskeletal, vascular, and neurologic diseases can occur as well. Processes can be life-threatening  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120879" href="/z/d/graphic/120879.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ), common  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120867" href="/z/d/graphic/120867.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ), and less common or rare  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120870" href="/z/d/graphic/120870.html" rel="external">
          table 5
         </a>
         ). Because multiple organ systems contribute to and are contained within the pelvis, a broad differential is initially developed in these patients. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Causes'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Exclude life-threatening processes
         </strong>
         – The goal of the preliminary assessment is to identify patients who need emergency or urgent treatment for their likely source(s) of pain  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120879" href="/z/d/graphic/120879.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). We simultaneously develop a general overall impression, identify any vital sign abnormalities, obtain a focused clinical history, and perform a limited physical examination  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef121250" href="/z/d/graphic/121250.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Concerning physical examination findings include unstable vital signs, peritoneal signs, or suspected life-threatening pathology (eg, ectopic pregnancy, bowel perforation). (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Exclude pregnancy
         </strong>
         – Determining pregnancy status is a critical first step in the management of women of reproductive age to enable expeditious diagnosis of pregnancy-related conditions that warrant rapid assessment and triage. (See

          Initial evaluation for common conditions

          History
         </strong>
         – We inquire about the pain location, characteristics, associated symptoms (eg, fever and vaginal bleeding), and general medical issues in an attempt to identify the likely cause(s) of the patient's symptoms  (

          Physical examination
         </strong>
         – The general physical examination includes evaluation of vital signs, a general assessment, and abdominal examination. The pelvic examination includes visual inspection of external genitalia, speculum examination of the vagina and cervix, bimanual examination of the uterus and adnexa, and rectal examination. Choice of laboratory test is guided by the findings from the patient's history and physical examination. Most women undergo a pelvic ultrasound. (See

          No improvement
         </strong>
         – Women who do not improve with initial treatment are reevaluated for emergency or life-threatening diagnoses  (

          table 1

         ). Some findings, such as evidence of peritonitis, may not be present at the initial evaluation but can develop over time. Once emergency conditions are excluded, we assess for an atypical presentation of a common condition  (

          Role of surgical evaluation
         </strong>
         – The role of surgery is less clear for women in whom pain persists without an identified or suspected etiology. Shared decision making is undertaken; information is shared with the patient about the risks of surgical exploration, typically with laparoscopy, balanced against the risks of potentially missing a diagnosis, and presumed opportunity for treatment.
