         Symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) refers to any of a number of symptoms (eg, abdominal pain, limb ischemia) that can be attributed to the aneurysm. The presence of symptoms increases the risk for AAA rupture, and thus, for most patients with symptomatic AAA, repair should be performed. AAA rupture can also occur in the absence of associated symptoms. In the United States, rupture of an AAA occurs in approximately 4000 patients per year [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Without repair, ruptured AAA is nearly always fatal. In spite of significant advances in intensive care unit management and surgical techniques, mortality following repair of ruptured AAA remains high [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Surgical outcomes may be improved using endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR
        </p>
        <p>
         ), but aortic endografting under emergency circumstances presents many challenges. Increasing numbers of institutions have initiated protocols for endovascular repair of ruptured AAA with promising results in small series, but not all institutions are equipped to treat ruptured AAAs using minimally invasive technology.

         An abdominal aorta with a maximal diameter &gt;3.0 cm is aneurysmal in most adult patients. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) most often affects the segment of aorta below the renal arteries (

          figure 1

          figure 2

         The initial management of the patient with symptomatic (non-ruptured) or ruptured AAA is guided by the hemodynamic status. Hemodynamically unstable patients who are candidates for repair are generally transferred directly from the emergency department to the operating room. Most patients with symptomatic (non-ruptured) AAA are hemodynamically stable but will require admission to determine whether the AAA is the source of the symptoms. Until the AAA can be excluded as a source of symptoms, the patient should be observed in a monitored setting. For patients determined to have a symptomatic AAA, but for whom repair will be delayed to optimize associated medical conditions, we admit the patient to the hospital to be observed in a monitored setting (eg, intensive care unit or monitored high acuity unit). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Emergency versus delayed repair of symptomatic aneurysm'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Two large-bore peripheral intravenous catheters should be placed in all patients (symptomatic non-ruptured or ruptured AAA) for medication and fluid administration. In hemodynamically unstable patients with ruptured AAA, indirect evidence from the trauma population and observational studies in patients with AAA suggest that limiting fluid infusion and allowing a relatively low systolic blood pressure of 80 to 100 mmHg (permissive hypotension) may prevent further tearing of the aorta and limit blood loss [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-7
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1607.html" rel="external">
          "Treatment of severe hypovolemia or hypovolemic shock in adults"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Pain control is an important part of management. It is important to keep the patient comfortable, but consciousness should be maintained. In patients who remain severely hypertensive despite adequate pain control, short-acting intravenous beta-blockers (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9420" href="/z/d/drug information/9420.html" rel="external">
          esmolol
         </a>
         ) can be used to titrate the blood pressure to normal values. (See

          "Pain control in the critically ill adult patient"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Laboratory studies including complete blood count, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, liver function tests, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and a type and cross-match should be obtained. If AAA repair will be undertaken at the hospital to which the patient presented, packed red blood cells should be placed on hold for possible transfusion in the operating room. In patients with ruptured AAA, the patient should have at least 10 units of packed red blood cells available for transfusion, and the blood bank should be alerted to the potential need for Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) or similar products (eg, PF24), or massive transfusion. Similar to trauma patients with severe ongoing hemorrhage, patients with ruptured AAA requiring massive transfusion may require transfusion of unmatched blood, and may benefit from packed red blood cell: FFP ratios ≤2:1 rather than higher ratios.

          APPROACH TO AAA ASSOCIATED WITH SYMPTOMS

         Symptoms associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) may or may not be due to AAA rupture. A presumptive diagnosis of ruptured AAA, which is a surgical emergency, can be made in patients known to have AAA or those with a newly diagnosed AAA who have hypotension and abdominal, flank, or back pain. Although most patients with symptomatic (non-ruptured) AAA will require AAA repair, the timing of and approach to repair differs depending upon the presenting symptoms, which may be due to instability of the aneurysm (impending rupture, thromboembolism), rapid expansion of the aneurysm causing abdominal discomfort, or related to inflammatory or infected AAA causing systemic manifestations. The clinical and diagnostic features that distinguish these are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15229.html" rel="external">

          —
         </span>
         Although there are rare reports of patient survival following a contained rupture of AAA, in general, without repair, ruptured AAA is uniformly fatal, with death occurring usually within hours and certainly within a week of rupture [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Thus, when ruptured AAA is identified, emergency repair should be undertaken to give the patient the best chance for survival [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,9
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Initial management'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although AAA repair should be offered to most patients with ruptured AAA, some patients may be at such high risk due to underlying comorbidities that comfort care is appropriate. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Decision for comfort care'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Hemodynamically unstable patients with known AAA who present with classic symptoms/signs of rupture (hypotension, flank/back pain, pulsatile mass) should be taken to the operating room for immediate control of hemorrhage and emergency repair of the aneurysm. Efforts to obtain proximal aortic control in the operating room (eg, aortic occlusion balloon placement) should not be delayed waiting for type-specific blood components. For patients not previously known to have AAA, time may permit a focused ultrasound exam to confirm that an aneurysm is present prior to abdominal exploration, but this is not absolutely required in patients with the appropriate history and clinical findings (

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         For hemodynamically stable patients suspected of having a ruptured AAA, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen confirms the rupture but is also important for evaluating whether an endovascular repair is feasible [

         Some patients without overt rupture on imaging studies have clinical symptoms or other features on CT scan that may indicate that the aneurysm is rapidly changing in configuration (rapid expansion), or at risk for "impending" rupture. Good risk surgical candidates should generally be repaired in an urgent manner. Clinical features are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         Abdominal pain or other symptoms occurring in a patient known to have or newly diagnosed with AAA can present a clinical dilemma. In surgical series, between 5 and 22 percent of AAA are symptomatic [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,11-16
         </a>
         ]. Symptoms that may be related to AAA include abdominal pain or back pain, signs of acute thromboembolism, and fever. In the absence of rupture, pain or other symptoms attributable to AAA may indicate rapid expansion causing compression of adjacent structures, or an inflammatory or infected AAA [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,15,17-19
         </a>
         ]. In the absence of overt or impending rupture, the symptomatic patient should be assessed to determine whether their symptoms are related to the aneurysm, and although not well studied, when no other cause is apparent, we agree with major society guidelines that suggest urgent repair, provided the patient does not have comorbidities that preclude repair [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. The presence of very large AAA (&gt;6.0 cm) may warrant admission even if the aneurysm is not felt to be the source of symptoms. (See

         Patients presenting with abdominal/back/flank pain in association with AAA should be admitted for further evaluation and monitoring. If an alternative diagnosis cannot be definitively established, symptoms should be presumed to be due to the AAA and a vascular surgical consultation should be obtained. The nature of the presenting symptoms should help determine whether the AAA is the source of the symptoms or simply an incidental finding during workup of another disease process.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients identified with another obvious source (eg, urinary calculi) for their symptoms should undergo treatment of the other acute disease process, and the AAA should be managed electively as an asymptomatic AAA. An inpatient vascular surgical consultation should nevertheless be obtained to confirm that the symptoms are not related to the AAA and to evaluate the need for and timing of AAA repair depending upon the resolution of the acute process. The determination of whether to proceed with elective repair depends upon the rupture risk, which is primarily determined by aortic diameter. (See

If thromboembolism is associated with abdominal pain, for which there is no other conceivable source, the embolus may have originated from a tear in the aortic wall and may be a sign of overt or impending aortic rupture. In the event of AAA rupture, thrombectomy can be performed concurrently with AAA repair.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the presence of AAA, a full evaluation should be performed to determine the source of the thromboemboli and should include an electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, contrast-enhanced CT of the aorta from the aortic valve to the femoral arteries, and peripheral duplex ultrasound since distal embolization can also be related to concurrent large vessel aneurysm (eg, popliteal artery aneurysm). If the clinical evaluation does not identify an alternative source for thromboembolism, the AAA should be presumed to be the source.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the absence of AAA rupture, acute ischemic symptoms due to lower extremity thromboembolism from the AAA should be managed with anticoagulation, and thrombectomy (or lysis) as needed. If a lower extremity revascularization procedure is needed, consideration should be given to concurrent AAA repair. Under some circumstances AAA repair can be delayed; however, the risk of recurrent thromboembolism remains until the AAA is repaired.

         A triad of chronic abdominal pain, weight loss, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate in a patient with an AAA is highly suggestive of an inflammatory aneurysm.

         ] or ruptured AAA may also be reduced [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,8,28-33
         </a>
         ]. A systematic review identified 23 observational studies with 7040 urgent or emergency open (n = 6300) or endovascular (n = 740) AAA repairs in patients with symptomatic (non-ruptured) or ruptured AAA [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. Emergency EVAR was associated with a significantly reduced perioperative (30 day) mortality risk relative to open repair (pooled odds ratio [OR] 0.62, 95% CI 0.52-0.75).
        </p>
        <p>
         To perform emergency endovascular AAA repair, the patient's aneurysm must meet anatomic criteria for EVAR and the institution must have a defined program for emergency endovascular surgery. Abdominal CT, which is obtained in hemodynamically stable patients, will determine whether the patient with symptomatic (non-ruptured) or ruptured AAA is anatomically suited to EVAR. Although up to 70 percent of patients may be candidates for EVAR, ruptured AAA is more often repaired with open surgical techniques, due to the limited number of centers available to perform emergency EVAR. Transfer to a vascular center is appropriate for hemodynamically stable patients who are anatomically suited to EVAR, particularly if the risk for open repair is high. (See

         The general assessment of perioperative risk for urgent/emergency repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm is similar to that of elective AAA repair; however, the urgency of the clinical situation often precludes a comprehensive evaluation. (See

         There have been many attempts to quantify the mortality risk associated with ruptured AAA. Various prediction models are available, but, unfortunately, no one system or variable has proven to be reliable in predicting mortality with certainty nor to reliably support the decision to withhold intervention [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34-39
         </a>
         ]. Factors that are associated with increased mortality following
         <strong>
          open
         </strong>
         repair of ruptured AAA include hypotension with a systolic blood pressure &lt;80 mmHg, advanced age (&gt;80 years), cardiac arrest, loss of consciousness, creatinine &gt;1.3 on admission, ischemic heart disease, female sex, and hemoglobin &lt;9.0 on admission [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,40-50
         </a>
         ]. Advanced age should not be used as the sole reason for deciding against repair of AAA [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48,51,52
         </a>
         ]. In a review of over 1000 patients older than 80 years of age who underwent repair of ruptured AAA, overall perioperative mortality was high, but comparable with the general population of ruptured AAA [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. Open repair had a significantly higher perioperative mortality compared with EVAR (47 versus 33 percent). Incorporating measures of frailty (eg, physical functioning, nutritional status, cognitive function) may help stratify those likely to do poorly [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         There are no equivalent studies assessing preoperative risk factors and endovascular aneurysm repair of ruptured AAA. One risk prediction model based upon a population of United States Medicare beneficiaries (ie, &gt;65 years of age) found that mortality following elective AAA repair is predicted by comorbidities, sex, and age with no differential predictors between open or endovascular repair [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with several prognostic factors for poor outcome, the incidence of serious morbidity, such as dialysis dependence, colonic ischemia, and myocardial infarction, is high and the need for surgery related to a complication is also high. The presence of &gt;3 prognostic factors increases the likelihood that the patient will require extended care. For the patient who is older than 80, with renal dysfunction, loss of consciousness, and hemoglobin &lt;9, the chance of survival following open repair of ruptured AAA is almost zero [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. The presence of multiple risk factors for poor outcome in a patient of advanced age, especially those with a "Do Not Resuscitate" advanced directive or a history of AAA repair refusal, should lead to consideration for comfort care. (See

         The timing of AAA repair for hemodynamically stable patients with symptomatic (non-ruptured) AAA remains a clinical challenge. Some patients may benefit from optimization of their medical status prior to repair; however, a definitive recommendation that would suit every clinical situation is not possible. If such an approach is undertaken, the patient should be admitted to the hospital and observed in a monitored setting (eg, intensive care unit or monitored high acuity unit) until operative repair is completed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Several retrospective case series have found significantly higher overall rates of perioperative morbidity and mortality for emergency compared with urgent repair (overall 18 to 26 percent versus 4 to 5 percent) [

          9,55-57

         The mortality associated with ruptured AAA may be as high as 90 percent when patients who die at home or upon arrival to the hospital are taken into account. In spite of obvious improvements in prehospital care, cardiovascular anesthesia, and critical care, surgical mortality following open repair of ruptured AAA has changed very little, remaining at approximately 30 to 50 percent [

         Patients with AAA who require emergency or urgent aortic surgery for ruptured or symptomatic (non-ruptured) AAA should be treated at a facility where surgical expertise and/or the perioperative resources necessary for major aortic surgery are available (eg, operating room personnel, an appropriately trained surgeon, perioperative intensive care) [
         <a href="#rid61">
          61-63
         </a>
         ]. For patients who present to a facility where these are not available, transfer to a vascular center with higher levels of hospital resources (such as number of physicians, nurses, and critical care beds) is appropriate and may result in lower mortality [
         <a href="#rid64">
          64
         </a>
         ]. In a study of 35,367 patients in England and the United States, the lowest mortality for ruptured AAA was seen in teaching hospitals with larger bed capacities and doing a greater proportion of cases with endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) [
         <a href="#rid65">
          65

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Improved outcomes for open surgical repair of ruptured AAA are correlated with surgeon experience with a higher annual caseload of open aneurysm repair per year (non-ruptured and ruptured) [
         <a href="#rid66">
          66
         </a>
         ]. The shift toward endovascular therapies has reduced the exposure of the surgeon-in-training to open surgical repair of AAA. As a result, the number of qualified surgeons in the community experienced with open repair of ruptured AAA is declining [
         <a href="#rid67">
          67
         </a>
         ]. If an appropriate level of surgical care is not available at the institution to which the patient initially presented, the patient should be transferred [
         <a href="#rid62">
          62
         </a>
         ]. If transfer is chosen, the patient and their family or other caretakers should be informed of the potential risk of deterioration during transfer, and the transfer should be accomplished as quickly as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         While there are limited studies benchmarking time to intervention for a ruptured AAA, the Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines suggest a "door-to-intervention" time of less than 90 minutes [
         <a href="#rid61">
          61
         </a>
         ]. This is modeled after the guidelines established by the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association for management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. A framework of 30-30-30 minutes was suggested to include three periods. The first period includes the time from first medical contact for the patient to diagnosis and decision to transfer, the second period represents rapid transport to the accepting facility, and the final period includes evaluation by the receiving vascular team to arterial access and vascular control by aortic occlusion. The importance of having an established transfer protocol was highlighted in a review of over 30,000 patients. Patients treated at the transfer hospital experienced lower adjusted mortality compared with patients treated at the index hospital [
         <a href="#rid68">
          68
         </a>

        <p>
         Patients who have a high risk for open AAA repair may be candidates for endovascular repair. However, for endovascular repair to be undertaken, in addition to having appropriate hospital personnel in place, the institution must have systems in place to support the endeavor. Resources that are needed include:

         Some patients may refuse repair of a ruptured AAA or are such poor candidates for repair that they are not likely to survive or have a meaningful quality of life even if they recover from the procedure. Although it remains disputed whether endovascular repair decreases mortality in patients with ruptured AAA, patients with factors associated with a poor prognosis for open AAA repair may have lower rates of morbidity and mortality following endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for ruptured AAA, when repair is chosen. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         A decision must be made according to the wishes of the patient (if known) and family or other caretakers whether to proceed with repair or provide comfort measures. Patients who will not undergo repair are kept pain-free and allowed to expire. In one study of 21 patients, the average time to death following ruptured AAA without repair was seven hours [

          69

          Abdominal aortic aneurysm
         </strong>
         – Symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) refers to any of a number of symptoms (eg, abdominal/back/flank pain, limb ischemia) that can be attributed to the aneurysm. In the absence of overt rupture (defined as aortic wall disruption leading to escape of blood outside the confines of the aorta), the presence of symptoms increases the risk for AAA rupture. AAA rupture can also occur in the absence of any intervening symptoms. Without repair, ruptured AAA is nearly uniformly fatal. Of the 50 percent of patients with ruptured AAA who reach the hospital for treatment, between 30 and 50 percent will die in the hospital in spite of significant advances in intensive care unit management and surgical techniques.

         <strong>
          Initial management
         </strong>
         – Initial management of patients with symptomatic (non-ruptured) or ruptured AAA includes the placement of large-bore peripheral intravenous catheters for medication and fluid administration, pain management, and preparation for surgery. For patients with ruptured AAA, we suggest maintaining the systolic blood pressure between 80 and 100 mmHg (permissive hypotension) rather than at higher levels prior to repair (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Permissive hypotension may minimize further tearing of the aorta and reduce blood loss. (See

          Risk assessment and

         <strong>
          outcome prediction
         </strong>
         – Although many factors are associated with poor outcomes following repair of ruptured AAA, no scoring system or variable has proven reliable in predicting mortality of ruptured AAA with certainty. Factors on admission that are associated with increased mortality following open repair of ruptured AAA include hypotension, elevated creatinine, low hematocrit, advanced age, and cardiac arrest. For older patients (&gt;80 years) with multiple risk factors and in whom EVAR is not feasible, comfort care may be discussed with the patient and family or other caretakers as a possible care option.

          Ruptured AAA
         </strong>
         – Although there are rare reports of patient survival following ruptured AAA without repair, in general, expectant management of ruptured AAA is nearly uniformly fatal. Thus, when ruptured AAA is identified (eg, imaging) or strongly suspected (known AAA with classic symptoms/signs of rupture), emergency repair should be undertaken to control hemorrhage and repair of the aneurysm to give the patient the best chance for survival. Efforts to obtain proximal aortic control in the operating room should not be delayed waiting for type-specific blood components (

          Symptomatic, non-ruptured AAA
         </strong>
         – For patients with symptomatic, non-ruptured AAA of any size or configuration who do not have a prohibitive risk for repair, we agree with major society guidelines that suggest urgent AAA repair (open or endovascular), rather than no repair (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). In the absence of rupture, symptoms may indicate that the aneurysm is rapidly changing, increasing the risk of rupture. Symptoms may include abdominal/back/flank pain, signs of thromboembolism, or systemic symptoms related to infected or inflammatory aneurysm. (See
         <a class="local">

         For patients with ruptured AAA, where appropriate facilities, personnel, equipment, and expertise are available for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), we suggest EVAR rather than open AAA repair, provided it is anatomically feasible (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). In appropriately selected patients, endovascular repair of ruptured AAA appears to be associated with lower perioperative (30 day) morbidity and mortality. For patients with symptomatic but non-ruptured AAA who have multiple risk factors for poor prognosis, we also suggest EVAR rather than open repair (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). (See

         Where endovascular aneurysm repair for emergency AAA repair is not an option (eg, not anatomically feasible, lack of facilities or expertise, excessive time for transfer), open repair at the initial facility by a surgeon experienced with aortic surgery is appropriate. If no such surgeon is available, or the patient is a poor candidate for open repair, transfer to a vascular center is appropriate. (See
