         Increasing age is the most prevalent, primary risk factor for breast cancer. Of the approximately 250,000 new cases of female breast cancer diagnosed annually in the United States, almost one-half arise in older women (typically defined as age ≥65 years, though this varies in studies).
        </p>
        <p>
         A practical challenge to developing guidance for treatment of older women with breast cancer is that there is a wide spectrum of women in the "older" population, defined both by biological age and by functional status. A healthy, vigorous 68-year-old with a life expectancy of &gt;20 years should receive essentially the same treatment as a 58-year-old with the same breast cancer. By contrast, an ill 88-year-old would not. These patients are often grouped together in studies of older adult patients with cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another challenge, as is broadly true in oncology, is that older patients are under-represented in clinical trials, partially due to eligibility criteria that have excluded them on the basis of age or comorbidities, and also because they have tended to be treated in centers where clinical trials were not available. As a result, there is a relative lack of evidence-based guidelines to inform the treatment of breast cancer in this population. Nevertheless, there have been clinical trials specifically for older breast cancer patients and subset analyses of trials open to all breast cancer patients, regardless of age. These results have yielded important information for treatment of older breast cancer patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will review the available data regarding the treatment of early-stage and locally advanced breast cancer in older women [

         From epidemiologic data, it appears that, following a new diagnosis of breast cancer, older women often receive less aggressive treatment or less often receive guideline therapy compared with younger women worldwide [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-8
         </a>
         ]. For instance, in the largest of these studies, which included over 120,000 women, increasing age was associated with decreased rates of breast surgery, axillary surgery, and radiotherapy [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. On the other hand, older persons more often receive upfront mastectomy and primary endocrine therapy [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Adjuvant chemotherapy is used less commonly in older individuals. In a population-based study of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database of almost 50,000 breast cancer patients, the rate of chemotherapy use for stage I or II, hormone receptor-negative, node-positive breast cancer ranged from approximately 80 percent for ages 67 to 69, down to &lt;10 percent for those above 85 [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ].

         Several factors govern treatment considerations in older women. First, most Western societies with screening programs for early detection of breast cancer focus on women from age 50 (or 40, in the United States) until around age 70 (or when life expectancy is less than 10 years). As a consequence, older women are less likely to have screen-detected breast cancers. Secondly, breast cancers arising in older women are more often estrogen receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative, and lower grade. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pathologic features of the tumor'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         As such, tumor characteristics might also contribute to the lesser use of chemotherapy in older women compared with younger women.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, there is a marked selection bias among treatment of older women that affects the interpretation of practice patterns in older patients. Thus, for instance, the group of older women in whom an Oncotype DX Recurrence Score test is ordered would be a highly select group, in which the decision on whether to recommend chemotherapy is still being made. In practical terms, that rarely includes women over age 75.

         </span>
         Although a breast cancer diagnosis (particularly if early stage) may not affect the life expectancy for an older woman, population studies show that outcomes among older women with breast cancer tend to be worse than those of younger women with breast cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, in a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database analysis of almost 50,000 women with stage I to II breast cancer aged ≥67 years, those aged 85 to 89 years had an increased risk of dying due to breast cancer compared with those aged 67 to 69 years (hazard ratio [HR] 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.7) [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Similar findings were observed in a Dutch substudy based on the TEAM trial (adjuvant
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8920" href="/z/d/drug information/8920.html" rel="external">
          exemestane
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. These observations may be associated with the fact that older age was also associated with less therapy (less surgery, less radiotherapy, less chemotherapy), and those tumors also were less likely to be detected through screening mammography, which often stops in women over age 70 or 75.
        </p>
        <p>
         An early-stage breast cancer may not affect the life expectancy of older patients. The impact of a breast cancer diagnosis on life expectancy in older adult women was addressed in a SEER-Medicare dataset that compared the survival of two groups: 66,000 women aged ≥67 years with breast cancer, and non-breast cancer controls matched for age, comorbidity, prior mammography use, and social demographics [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11

         ].

         Women diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or stage I invasive breast cancer had a lower risk of death compared with controls (HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.7-0.7 for DCIS; HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.8-0.8 for stage I breast cancer). This may be because healthier women were still undergoing mammographic breast cancer screening. Cardiovascular disease was the most common cause of death in these women.

         Women diagnosed with stage II disease or higher had an increased risk of death compared with controls (HR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.2), regardless of age. However, among women aged ≥80 years diagnosed with stage II breast cancer, cardiovascular disease was still the most common cause of death.

        </p>
        <p>
         In a separate study of women with breast cancer and median follow-up of 4.7 years, the proportion of deaths from breast cancer decreased as age increased. Of all deaths, the percentage of breast cancer deaths was 70 percent among women aged 50 to 69 years; 57 percent among those aged 70 to 74 years; 47 percent among those aged 75 to 79 years, and 39 percent for those aged ≥80 years [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12

         Comorbidity is characterized as the number and effect of an individual's other physical and psychological diseases in addition to the condition for which he or she is seeking treatment [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. The presence of comorbidity is independently associated with decreased life expectancy and plays a major role in determining survival in older patients with cancer. For women with breast cancer, life expectancy is almost halved in the presence of comorbidity, such as a prior myocardial infarction [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Comorbid conditions that impose functional limitations are associated with higher mortality (from both breast cancer and non-breast-cancer causes), particularly if they are expected to worsen over time (eg, diabetes with end-organ damage, steroid- or oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or dementia) [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15-17
         </a>
         ]. In one study of over 64,000 women with breast cancer (median age 75), the adjusted HR of death (from all causes) increased as the severity of comorbidity increased (measured using the Charlson Comorbidity Index Score [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,19
         </a>
         ]); compared with patients with no comorbidity, the risk of death increased with increasing comorbidity level [
         <a href="#rid15">

        </p>
        <p>
         These data emphasize the importance of comorbidity on overall prognosis among older women with breast cancer. The presence and severity of comorbidity must be considered in weighing the risks and benefits of what we do to treat breast cancer in these patients. Among women who are older and have a severe comorbidity, the threshold risk for treatment may be higher.
        </p>
        <p>
         The impact of comorbidity was evaluated in two large retrospective studies. In one study [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ], the benefit of chemotherapy was absent in cases of significant comorbidity [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ], but still present in another similar study [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. This type of retrospective, nonrandomized analyses are however prone to selection bias, making strong conclusions on the impact of frailty on chemotherapy uncertain.

         Treatment considerations should be individualized based on general prognostic tumor-related markers (biology and extent of disease), global health status (providing information on life expectancy and treatment tolerance), and patient preference, but not on chronological age per se. Care must be taken to avoid "overtreating" older patients with adjuvant therapies if they are more likely to die from other causes prior to a possible breast cancer recurrence. (See

         Patients over age 70 with breast cancer may be screened for geriatric syndromes using a brief tool. (See

         Based on the results of the screening, a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) may help clinicians develop a coordinated plan for breast cancer treatment. CGA involves the assessment of important age-related domains such as functionality, cognition, depression, nutrition, comorbidity, polypharmacy, and social situation. Guidelines recommend that CGA be included in baseline assessment of all older patients with cancer [

         The optimal approach to the older patient with breast cancer depends on the tumor extent (stage) and subtype. In general, breast cancers that occur in older women are more often in an advanced stage, more likely to be hormone receptor positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative, and have more indolent features compared with those that arise in younger women [
         <a href="#rid25">

         The typical treatment approach to healthy older women with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer includes surgery for removal of the cancer from the breast. However, decisions on axillary assessment, radiation, and systemic therapy may be altered in older versus younger women, based on tumor biology, extent of disease, general health status, and patients' wishes. A comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) can help assess general health status and should be included to guide treatment decisions in the older adult patient. (See

         In medically fit older women, standard breast cancer surgery options should be offered, given morbidity and mortality benefits. One study of perioperative outcomes among older cancer patients, about one-half of which were women with breast cancer, confirmed particularly low postsurgical complication rates (18.9 percent) and average hospital stays (median, three days) for older breast cancer patients [

         Patients with tumors that cannot be treated by breast-conserving surgery (eg, cT4, multifocal tumors, etc) are best treated by mastectomy. Although mastectomy is also appropriate for patients with large, unifocal cancers deemed unsuitable for breast-conserving surgery, preoperative (neoadjuvant) systemic therapy can be offered to some patients, especially if they are interested in breast-conserving therapy [

         We favor surgery rather than primary endocrine therapy for women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer because surgical resection reduces the risk of a local recurrence and its associated morbidity. Moreover, breast surgery is well tolerated in older women and, in cases where general anesthesia is contraindicated, it can even be done under local anesthesia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our preference for surgery as the primary treatment is supported by multiple trials and a 2006 meta-analysis, which compared surgery (alone or followed by

         There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival (OS) for surgery alone (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.74-1.30); however, there was a trend toward an improvement in OS with surgery plus

         However, two trials with extended follow-up not included in the 2006 meta-analysis, as well as an epidemiologic study, did not confirm the positive impact of surgery on OS [

          21,38,39
         </a>
         ]. In conclusion, we recommend upfront surgery, which has low rates of morbidity, for management of local breast cancer in fit, older patients. Surgery may be delayed for specific individual reasons, where women are pursuing primary endocrine therapy in order to downsize the tumor and allow for less extensive surgery.

         Data suggest that older adult women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy can experience a survival benefit from treatment [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41-43
         </a>

Patients with triple-negative or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive tumors, or those with more advanced disease, will derive greater benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy than patients with hormone-sensitive, HER2-negative breast cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
         Evaluation of general health status through comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) allows clinicians to estimate residual life expectancy (independent of the cancer) and to predict potential chemotherapy toxicity. Also, patients' wishes, after being informed on the pros and cons of chemotherapy, are very important to take into account. (See

         As an example of observed benefits, in a study of patients ≥70 years with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, node-positive breast cancer, and comorbidities, among 592 patients included in a matched analysis, receipt of chemotherapy was associated with improved survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% CI 0.48-0.98), after adjustment for potential confounding factors [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ]. Separately, in a study from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registries including over 5000 women age 65 and older with hormone receptor-negative, non-metastatic breast cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a mortality reduction of approximately 15 percent on multivariate analysis [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ]. The most pronounced benefits were experienced by those with involved lymph nodes or other high-risk features, including poor differentiation or larger tumor size. Finally, in a retrospective study discussed above, chemotherapy did not benefit those with significant comorbidity [

         While in general, healthy older women can tolerate standard breast cancer treatments, they may be at increased risk for toxicity including short-term (eg, drug-induced) mortality when using the same chemotherapy regimens as younger women [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44-46
         </a>
         ]. For instance, a large Medicare study demonstrated that patients aged &gt;65 years have more than double the risk of being hospitalized for chemotherapy-related reasons compared with the younger ones, despite frequent use of prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF), as well as a small, short-term mortality risk [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>

          45

Even in a clinical trial setting, in which various adjuvant chemotherapy regimens were evaluated, the incidence of treatment-related mortality was higher with increasing age: 0.2 percent for age 50 years or less, 0.7 percent for age 51 to 64 years, and 1.5 percent for age 65 years or older (p &lt;0.001) [

        <p>
         PREDICT was developed using a cohort of women with early breast cancer in the United Kingdom (UK), with 32 percent of the exploratory cohort being &gt;65 years old. The model was validated with another UK cohort that included 32 percent older women as well. The model incorporates mode of detection, HER2 status, and Ki67 level. PREDICT calculates OS at 5, 10, and 15 years. A Dutch study assessed the validity of PREDICT by testing the FOCUS cohort of the Netherlands. Information related to 2012 patients with a median age of 75 years was entered into the model, and survival outcomes were compared with outcomes available in their municipal population registries. The study revealed that PREDICT estimated 5-year OS adequately (1.7 percent prediction difference), while the 10-year OS prediction was overestimated (4.5 percent difference) [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47,48
         </a>
         ]. One weakness of this model is the lack of input regarding comorbidity. When PREDICT was evaluated factoring in comorbidities of women in the FOCUS cohort, PREDICT underestimated 5-year OS in women without comorbidity (-3.7 percent), while overestimating survival in women with ≥4 comorbidities (11.8 percent) [

         <a href="#rid55">
          55

         ]. Specifically, the three-year relapse-free survival (RFS) with capecitabine versus standard chemotherapy was 68 versus 85 percent (HR 2.09, 95% CI 1.38-3.17), and the OS rate was 86 versus 91 percent (HR 1.85, 95% CI 1.11-3.08). At 10 years, rates of RFS continued to be inferior with capecitabine (50 versus 56 percent with chemotherapy), as were OS rates (56 and 62 percent, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56
         </a>
         ]. Of the patients who received capecitabine, 34 percent had at least one grade 3 or 4 adverse event, versus 60 percent of those receiving AC and 70 percent of patients receiving CMF. Most of the severe toxicities in the standard chemotherapy arms were hematologic. A nonhematologic grade 3 or 4 adverse event occurred in 33 percent of patients who received capecitabine, 25 percent of those who received AC, and 41 percent of those who received CMF. The most common of these were fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms, which occurred more frequently with CMF than the other regimens. Despite these toxicities, 80 percent of patients receiving capecitabine, 92 percent of those receiving AC, and 62 percent of those receiving CMF received all planned cycles of treatment. Further discussion on anthracycline-containing regimens, as well as CMF, is found below. (See

         ]. In this trial, 1380 women aged 65 years or older with node-positive or high-risk, node-negative breast cancer were randomly assigned to ibandronate with or without capecitabine. All subjects were considered to be unsuitable candidates for standard chemotherapy. Subjects with hormone-sensitive disease also received endocrine therapy. At three years, there was no statistical difference for the primary endpoint of disease-free survival (DFS) with the addition of capecitabine (85 versus 84 percent) or at five years (79 versus 75 percent).

         In a separate large, prospective, randomized trial (n = 601), weekly

          docetaxel

         , the nonstandard treatment arm, was compared with standard CMF in older patients and found to be not superior to CMF while having more toxicity [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]. Specifically, differences in DFS and OS for docetaxel versus CMF were not statistically significant. Hematologic toxicity, mucositis, and nausea were worse with CMF; quality of life (QOL) and specific adverse events including allergy, fatigue, hair loss, onychopathy, dysgeusia, diarrhea, abdominal pain, neuropathy, and cardiac and skin toxicity were worse with docetaxel.
        </p>
        <p>
         Together, these data suggest that standard combination regimens are efficacious in older adult patients, with acceptable toxicity for many such patients.

         For fit, older adult patients with normal baseline cardiac function (by echocardiogram or equivalent) and no serious underlying cardiovascular disease, with high-risk breast cancers (eg, node-positive tumors, larger tumors, triple negative tumors &gt;1 cm), we typically use a regimen such as dose-dense

         <a href="#rid59">
          59,60
         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
         Classical anthracycline-taxane regimens can be used for medically fit older patients, but the benefit of treatment must be balanced by the increased risks of (anthracycline-based) chemotherapy, including increased hematologic toxicity, heart damage [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44,62,63
         </a>
         ], and short-term (eg, drug-induced) mortality, that are found in older patients. (See

         Results from the CALGB 40101 trial serve as an example of both the benefits and risks of anthracycline-based treatment. In this CALGB trial, four or six cycles of either

         (T), administered weekly or biweekly, versus AC were compared in approximately 3800 lower-risk patients of all ages [
         <a href="#rid64">
          64
         </a>
         ]. T performed worse than AC (HR for OS of 1.27, favoring AC), but noninferiority was not demonstrated. The estimated absolute advantage of AC at five years was 3 percent for recurrence-free survival (91 versus 88 percent) and 1 percent for OS (95 versus 94 percent). As expected, the incidence of any grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicity was higher among those receiving AC than T (eg, grade ≥3 neutropenia occurred in 26 to 33 percent in the AC arms, versus 3 percent in the T arms). By contrast, neuropathy was more common in the T than the AC arms (approximately 6 to 13 versus &lt;1 percent), though older age was not an independent risk factor [
         <a href="#rid65">
          65
         </a>
         ]. Cardiac toxicity was infrequent in both groups, although two cardiac deaths occurred among patients receiving AC. Seven patients, all receiving AC, developed acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome.
        </p>
        <p>
         Risks of anthracyclines in older patients were also evaluated in a study using the SEER-Medicare database that included 43,338 women aged 66 to 80 with stage I to III breast cancer with no history of pre-existing heart failure [
         <a href="#rid62">
          62
         </a>
         ]. Over 4700 women received an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen, while almost 4000 received a non-anthracycline-containing regimen; 34,705 women received no chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 56 months, the following heart failure rates for women aged 66 to 70 years were reported at 5 and 10 years:

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Analyses indicated an interaction between age and adjuvant anthracycline treatment, and suggested that anthracycline increases the risk of heart failure as far out as 10 years later. The absolute numbers of heart failure are quite high in this study, probably related to the administrative coding system in the United States, but the relative increase in the anthracycline arm likely reflects a relevant long-term risk.
        </p>
        <p>
         For women aged 71 to 80 years, there were no statistically significant differences between the three groups in rates of congestive heart failure.
        </p>
        <p>
         Besides age, other baseline characteristics associated with the development of heart failure included hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and being a Black person. Recommended maximum doses based upon the presence of risk factors have been described [

         For lower-risk cancers (eg, those with node-negative, hormone receptor-positive tumors; or node-negative, triple-negative tumors, particularly those &gt;1 cm), or for patients in whom the oncologist/patient wants to avoid the risks associated with anthracyclines, TC is an appropriate regimen.
        </p>
        <p>
         Preference for TC is based on one randomized trial showing that four cycles of TC result in a higher DFS and OS compared with AC among women with stage I to III breast cancer (16 percent of whom were 65 years or older) [
         <a href="#rid67">
          67
         </a>
         ]. In this study, there was a marked DFS and OS benefit for TC compared with AC, and benefit was also seen in the ≥65-year-old population, while toxicity was acceptable (though prophylactic G-CSF is necessary because of high rates of febrile neutropenia with this regimen when used without G-CSF [
         <a href="#rid68">
          68
         </a>
         ]).
        </p>
        <p>
         There have been subsequent studies on TC specifically in the older population, with acceptable toxicity rates, and &gt;90 percent being able to complete the four cycles [
         <a href="#rid69">
          69,70
         </a>
         ]. When the impact of TC on QOL and geriatric assessment was measured consecutively, clinical frailty and QOL seemed to decline somewhat at three months, but fully recovered at one year [
         <a href="#rid70">
          70
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsequent clinical trials have compared TC versus anthracycline-taxane regimens. For example, joint analysis of the ABC Trials compared TC chemotherapy versus an anthracycline-, cyclophosphamide-, and taxane-based regimen in over 4000 women receiving adjuvant therapy for HER2-negative breast cancer, approximately 30 percent of whom were ≥60 years [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71
         </a>
         ]. Although overall, TC was inferior to the anthracycline- and taxane-based regimen in regards to four-year invasive DFS, anthracycline-based therapy did not meaningfully improve outcomes in ER-positive breast cancers or in triple-negative, lymph node-negative patients  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114669" href="/z/d/graphic/114669.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Given the risk-benefit ratio of adjuvant chemotherapy, we recommend four cycles of TC in older women needing adjuvant chemotherapy, but six cycles of TC can also be considered in cases of high-risk features and acceptable tolerance. Further discussion of the ABC trials is found elsewhere. (See

         In general, if adjuvant chemotherapy is given to older patients, classical regimens (like docetaxel-cyclophosphamide, or in selected patients, a sequential anthracycline-taxane regimen with optimal supportive care) are generally preferred, while other regimens such as CMF might be reserved for specific situations. For the patient who is unlikely to tolerate concurrent multiagent chemotherapy, it is reasonable to offer a sequential single-agent therapy (eg,

         can be a reasonable option in patients with contraindication for anthracyclines and taxanes (eg, a patient with cardiac risk factors who is intolerant of steroids due to poorly controlled diabetes or other reasons). CMF with oral

          cyclophosphamide

         <a href="#rid73">
          73
         </a>
         ], but the intravenous (IV) formulation is often more practical (eg, because the patient does not tolerate pills or because low blood counts and treatment delays require use of growth factors). If the IV regimen is used, every-three-week administration with peg-filgrastim for hematologic support is an appropriate option, reducing clinic visits compared with other IV schedules. CMF is, however, associated with a higher risk of serious (grade 3) toxicity, including hematologic and mucosal toxicity in women aged ≥65 years compared with younger women [
         <a href="#rid74">
          74,75
         </a>
         ]. Moreover, CMF has been replaced by anthracyclines and/or taxane regimens because of superior efficacy in the general population. Data regarding CMF, AC, and single-agent

        <p>
         Support for sequential single-agent dosing of standard chemotherapy regimens comes from CALGB 9741, a trial of approximately 2000 patients randomly assigned to receive adjuvant chemotherapy with ACT in one of four ways: as sequential single agents (A then T then C) given every three weeks; sequential single agents given every two weeks with growth factor support; concurrent AC followed by T, given every three weeks; or concurrent AC followed by T given every two weeks, with growth factor support [
         <a href="#rid72">
          72
         </a>
         ]. In this trial, dose density improved disease-free recurrence, but there was no difference in either DFS or OS between the concurrent and sequential schedules. Grade 3 or greater emesis was more common for the concurrent regimens than for the sequential regimens (7 versus 3 percent). Severe neutropenia was less frequent in patients who received the dose-dense regimens.

In a systematic review of prospective randomized trials with available data on the use of adjuvant trastuzumab in patients aged &gt;60 years, a 47 percent relative risk reduction was observed in older adult patients receiving trastuzumab compared with chemotherapy alone (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.36-0.77). Cardiac events occurred in 5 percent of older patients receiving trastuzumab.

         For higher-risk fit patients (eg, those with involved nodes, or larger tumors) who are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy, an anthracycline-taxane regimen can be offered, but the same issues of increased toxicity as described above are present for the majority of older patients. Cardiac toxicity is a particular issue since both anthracyclines and

         The neoadjuvant approach has been less frequently used in older women with HER2-positive early breast cancer in the past because of concerns of toxicity. However, there is an increasing trend to use neoadjuvant systemic therapy in this setting since the adjuvant systemic part can be escalated or de-escalated depending on the response at surgery. The main difficulty is to select a chemotherapy partner for the neoadjuvant systemic therapy part. There are no prospective trials specifically available for the older population, so our approach is to extrapolate the data from the adjuvant setting, as discussed above. (See

However, T-DM1 is associated with increased toxicities (eg, thrombocytopenia, peripheral neuropathy, fatigue) and treatment discontinuation relative to trastuzumab, and fewer than 10 percent of women evaluated in the KATHERINE trial were ≥65 years old. We therefore offer T-DM1 to fit, older women with appropriate indications, but toxicity needs to be monitored. These data are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         According to guidelines, adjuvant endocrine therapy should be offered to all women with ER-positive breast tumors &gt;0.5 cm, regardless of age, provided they are candidates for medical therapy. We prefer to administer an aromatase inhibitor (AI) in older women because of its benefits in the adjuvant setting compared with

         , as well as avoidance of the thromboembolic risks and endometrial thickening/bleeding associated with tamoxifen. However, for women at risk for cardiovascular complications or bone loss, and those unable to tolerate an AI due to toxicity, tamoxifen is a reasonable alternative. (See

         <a href="#rid89">
          89
         </a>
         ]. Treatment with an AI for five years resulted in trends toward reduced recurrences compared with tamoxifen in women aged 60 to 69 years (12 versus 14 percent; relative risk [RR] 0.80) and in women aged 70 years or older (14 versus 17 percent; RR 0.78). Thus, compared with tamoxifen, AIs are slightly superior for reducing relapse risk in older women.

         As in younger women, the optimal duration of endocrine therapy use is not clear. A minimum duration of five years of endocrine therapy should be prescribed for most older women. However, longer durations up to 10 years might be appropriate in selected patients, especially those with higher-risk tumor features (eg, nodal involvement, higher tumor grade). The issue of duration of treatment is discussed separately. (See

         There is growing interest in the use of bisphosphonates in the adjuvant setting with two aims: reducing the relapse risk, and decreasing the risk of therapy-induced osteoporotic fractures (with age being the most important risk factor for osteoporosis). Decision making regarding adjuvant bisphosphonates follows the same approach in older women with breast cancer as for younger women. As renal function declines with age, and the dose of

          90

         <a href="#rid91">
          91,92
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, some older women may prefer to avoid adjuvant RT, particularly those with small, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and no evidence of nodal disease who agree to take endocrine therapy. Large, randomized trials (eg, Cancer and Leukemia Group B [CALGB] 9343 and PRIME-II) have suggested that omission of RT in this subset is an acceptable strategy [
         <a href="#rid93">

         Patients who prefer not to proceed with adjuvant RT should be counseled that they may have a slightly higher risk of an in-breast cancer recurrence compared with those who undergo RT. Similar to the adjuvant chemotherapy discussion, general life expectancy also plays a role in the true benefit of adjuvant RT; in frail patients with higher-risk tumors, adjuvant RT will provide little, if any, benefit.

         Breast cancer is a major health concern in the older population. Older women often are treated less aggressively than younger women, which may contribute to inferior outcomes seen in this population. On the other hand, overtreatment should be avoided if a patient is more likely to die from other causes prior to a possible breast cancer recurrence. (See

         Treatment considerations should be individualized based on general prognostic tumor-related markers (biology and extent of disease), global health status (providing information on life expectancy and treatment tolerance), and patient preference, but not on chronological age per se. Patients over age 70 with breast cancer may be screened for geriatric syndromes using a brief tool. Based on the results of the screening, a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) may help clinicians develop a coordinated plan for breast cancer treatment. (See

         For most women ≥65 years old with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer who have undergone surgery, we recommend adjuvant

         Regarding choice of chemotherapy with the anti-HER2 therapy, for most such patients, we suggest a non-anthracycline-based regimen over an anthracycline-based regimen (

          Grade 2C

However, for fit patients with higher-risk disease (eg, node-positive disease, T3 tumors, or hormone receptor-negative tumors &gt;1 cm), an anthracycline- and taxane-based regimen may be preferred.
