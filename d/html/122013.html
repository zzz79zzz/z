         Genetic testing may complement a clinical evaluation for atherosclerotic disease risk that includes family history, personal history, physical examination, and laboratory testing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Testing involves two steps: determining the genotype (presence or absence of variants in one or more genes) and interpreting the pathogenicity of the variant(s).

         Genotyping may include complete gene sequencing or evaluation for a subset of known variants. The likelihood of finding a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in an FH gene correlates with family history and clinical findings including premature cardiovascular disease, physical features (tendon xanthomas), and lipid profile. Any testing performed for research or through a direct-to-consumer service that would affect management (positive testing, negative testing in an individual with a suspected genetic disorder) should be repeated in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified or other nationally certified laboratory with verified patient identification.

         The testing laboratory uses information from clinical and basic science research to classify variants into one of five categories of pathogenicity  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122646" href="/z/d/graphic/122646.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         ) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The classification may be revised over time, especially for a variant of uncertain significance (VUS). The uncertainty reflects the available research, not the accuracy of sequencing or the likelihood of disease. A VUS should be reevaluated periodically to determine if additional information about its pathogenicity has become available, especially for individuals for whom the information would impact their management or counseling and testing of their at-risk relatives.

         Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) are cholesterol-rich particles that are essential for normal physiology (production of steroid hormones and bile acids, integrity of cell membranes). Elevated levels of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) are associated with increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral arterial disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         FH is a hereditary condition in which LDL catabolism is impaired and LDL-C is increased [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. FH gene variants represent rare causes of hyperlipidemia in which a single variant in one gene has a large impact on phenotype; this contrasts with polygenic hypercholesterolemia, a complex trait in which many common variants each have a small impact on phenotype [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Pathogenic variants in three genes account for the vast majority of FH  (

         – Encodes apolipoprotein B (previously called apoB100), the major protein component of LDL. It is responsible for LDL binding to (and uptake by) the LDL receptor. The full length protein is called apoB100; truncated forms are referred to by their percentage of the full-length molecule (apoB48 is 48 percent of apoB100). Comprises approximately 5 to 10 percent of genetically-identified FH cases.

         – Encodes proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9, a secreted protein that binds the LDL receptor and causes its lysosomal proteolysis, preventing it from recycling back to the cell (hepatocyte) surface. Loss-of-function variants in
         <em>
          PCSK9
         </em>
         lower the LDL-C and do not cause FH. Gain-of-function variants are uncommon and can cause a severe FH phenotype that comprises &lt;1 percent of genetically-identified FH cases.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In all individuals with FH, cardiovascular disease risk increases with age, which correlates with increasing lifetime exposure to high LDL-C. Risk also depends on how the variant affects protein function (receptor defective versus receptor null), other genetic factors, other comorbidities such as diabetes and obesity, and environmental contributors such as tobacco and diet [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,6
         </a>
         ]. At any given LDL-C, cardiovascular risk appears greater for those with FH than those without, possibly because elevated LDL-C has been present from birth [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Negative genetic testing does not exclude the diagnosis of FH if the individual meets clinical criteria (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/107507.html" rel="external">
          "Familial hypercholesterolemia in adults: Overview", section on 'Definition'
         </a>
         ). These individuals may have a variant that was not included in the genetic testing panel, a variant in another gene such as
         <em>
          APOE
         </em>
         (encodes apolipoprotein E) or
         <em>
          LDLRAP1
         </em>
         , a variant in an as-yet undiscovered gene, or another form of hypercholesterolemia such as polygenic hypercholesterolemia [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Other hereditary lipid disorders are summarized in the table  (

          table 5

         FH is autosomal dominant. Inheritance of a pathogenic variant in an FH gene from one parent is sufficient to increase disease risk. Some experts use the term autosomal codominant because disease risk is intermediate in heterozygotes and more severe in homozygotes and compound heterozygotes.
        </p>
        <p>
         This contrasts with polygenic hypercholesterolemia, a complex trait that does not follow typical Mendelian inheritance patterns. (See

         FH is diagnosed using a combination of clinical criteria (family history, personal history of premature cardiovascular or other atherosclerotic disease, physical examination findings such as tendon xanthomas, xanthelasmas, or corneal arcus, and LDL-C) and/or by genetic testing [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Experts believe that a large proportion of people with FH remain undiagnosed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinical findings may be scored using a system such as that from the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef88939" href="/z/d/graphic/88939.html" rel="external">
          table 6

          table 7
         </a>
         ), or the American Heart Association. These systems help to assign a diagnosis of definite, probable, or possible FH. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/107507.html" rel="external">
          "Familial hypercholesterolemia in adults: Overview", section on 'Definition'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         FH is further classified according to clinical severity, which correlates with whether one or both alleles of the implicated gene are involved:

         <span class="glyph">
          ●

         Homozygous FH is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in FH genes (homozygosity or compound heterozygosity, typically in
         <em>
          LDLR
         </em>
         ). It is associated with elevated LDL-C at birth and risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease onset in childhood (life-threatening if untreated). The untreated LDL-C is generally &gt;500 mg/dL (&gt;13 mmol/L). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/121831.html" rel="external">

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Heterozygous FH is caused by a pathogenic variant at one allele of an FH gene. It is associated with elevated LDL-C in childhood (generally ≥160 mg/dL) and with an increased risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in early middle age. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/107507.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinical findings overlap in heterozygous and homozygous FH because other factors may influence LDL-C and atherosclerotic disease risk. Genetic testing provides additional precision in distinguishing between them.

         Aggressive lipid-lowering treatment is indicated to reduce the risk of early mortality from premature atherosclerotic disease. Statin therapy is initiated as early as infancy in homozygous FH and as early as 8 to 10 years with heterozygous FH. (See

         Those with positive genetic testing should generally have more intensive monitoring (eg, annual lipid panel; acknowledging lack of evidence-based recommendations) and more intensive screening and interventions for other cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, hypertension, diabetes), with details individualized according to their personal risk assessment.

         At-risk generally refers to first-degree relatives (children, siblings, parents), with cascade testing recommended for their first-degree relatives. In cases in which a first-degree relative is unavailable for testing, a second-degree relative (aunt, uncle, grandparent, grandchild) may also be included. The best initial test may be a lipid panel.
        </p>

         Testing of children should involve shared decision-making with the parent(s). The algorithm summarizes an approach to the timing of testing in at-risk children  (
