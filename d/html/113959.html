Key components of CMAM programs are provision of a therapeutic food that is of high nutritional quality and has minimal spoilage, known as ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF), and regular follow-up at home or in decentralized health centers, ideally in proximity to where children live by trained community-based health workers. Using this strategy, more than 90 percent of children with SAM can be treated as outpatients, provided that the child has a good appetite and no obvious acute infection or other medical complications [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Children with anorexia or complications are initially treated in inpatient programs but are transferred to outpatient care as soon as possible [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Over the past two decades, an increasing number of countries and relief agencies have adopted CMAM with remarkable success [<a href="#rid4">4</a>], leading to widespread acceptance and dissemination of this approach worldwide. Where CMAM is available, nutritional recovery rates can be expected to regularly exceed 80 percent and case fatality rates can be expected in the 5 to 10 percent range, or even better in particularly well-functioning programs. Effective CMAM requires the presence of trained staff, reliable supply chains for RUTF and medications, and the possibility of referral for inpatient care if needed, and can generally be accomplished by appropriately trained and resourced community health workers [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Because of the increasing availability of RUTF, CMAM has mostly replaced the historical system of universal inpatient management, which was plagued by limited access, poor outcomes, and high costs. There certainly remains an important role for hospitalization for children with complicated SAM. However, CMAM allows most acutely malnourished children to "skip" the inpatient phase of treatment and allows for an orderly transition of care once children with complicated SAM have recovered sufficiently.</p><p>Treatment of children with <strong>uncomplicated</strong> SAM using CMAM is described in this topic review. Treatment of <strong>complicated</strong> SAM and other related content are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5901.html" rel="external">"Management of complicated severe acute malnutrition in children in resource-limited settings"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5883.html" rel="external">"Malnutrition in children in resource-limited settings: Clinical assessment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/117772.html" rel="external">"Management of moderate acute malnutrition in children in resource-limited settings"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5360.html" rel="external">"Micronutrient deficiencies associated with protein-energy malnutrition in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2851516763"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial evaluation of a child at a feeding center is described in detail separately.

(See <a class="local">'Indications for community-based management'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complicated SAM</strong> – SAM is complicated if there are associated medical complications such as sepsis, diarrhea with severe dehydration, significant skin breakdown with open ulceration, and/or a poor appetite. Such children generally require hospital admission for initial stabilization and management. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5901.html" rel="external">"Management of complicated severe acute malnutrition in children in resource-limited settings"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>For infants &lt;6 months of age, slightly different anthropometric measures are used to define SAM (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5901.html" rel="external">"Management of complicated severe acute malnutrition in children in resource-limited settings", section on 'Infants &lt;6 months'</a>). The threshold for admitting these young infants to inpatient care is necessarily lower than for older children.

For older children, it is reasonable to use the same protocols as an extension of established practice. However, for these older children, it is particularly important to do a thorough evaluation for underlying diseases that may have triggered the malnutrition, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis, or malignancy, since isolated SAM is less common in this age group.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Appetite</strong> – Passes an "appetite test," which assesses whether the child is able to consume approximately 30 grams of ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) in a supervised, calm setting under the direct observation of clinical staff.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Uncomplicated</strong> – Has no signs or symptoms suggesting acute complications, such as sepsis or pneumonia.

To identify children with untreated HIV, it is highly advisable to perform routine HIV testing for all malnourished children at the initial evaluation. However, if routine HIV testing seems to present an obstacle to accessing care for malnutrition due to local culture and stigma, then it is reasonable to reserve testing only for those children who are not recovering appropriately.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Home environment</strong> – Has a reliable caretaker who can provide frequent, closely supervised feedings at home.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Access to follow-up</strong> – Is able to return to the feeding center for regular follow-up where progress can be monitored, medical complications addressed, counselling and major health messages reinforced, and additional RUTF provided. Follow-up should generally occur every one to two weeks but may be extended to every four weeks in exceptional circumstances [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Follow-up and monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>In most settings, more than 90 percent of children with SAM will qualify for outpatient therapy at the time of initial evaluation. Additionally, most children with complicated SAM who begin therapy as inpatients can complete therapy as outpatients using the identical protocol; therapeutic feeding programs should be prepared to accept transfers of these patients into the outpatient feeding program [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5901.html" rel="external">"Management of complicated severe acute malnutrition in children in resource-limited settings", section on 'Transfer to outpatient care'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3762614515"><span class="h3">Indications for inpatient care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Malnourished children who have acute complications or who fail the appetite test should be hospitalized and given specific therapies for their acute illness while nutritional rehabilitation is initiated. Other indications for hospitalization include (but are not limited to) children who have not recovered after a trial of outpatient therapy, those with challenging social situations that preclude effective outpatient management, and untreated HIV or tuberculosis infection [<a href="#rid3">3,8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2479484972"><span class="h3">Infants &lt;6 months</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most infants six months and younger with SAM should be managed initially as inpatients, especially if the inpatient center can offer intensive counseling and assistance in resuming exclusive breastfeeding [<a href="#rid8">8</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5901.html" rel="external">"Management of complicated severe acute malnutrition in children in resource-limited settings", section on 'Infants &lt;6 months'</a>). Although suboptimal, it is sometimes necessary to treat these young infants as outpatients due to resource and logistical limitations (on both the part of the health system and families). (See <a class="local">'Feeding protocol'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4288277979"><span class="h1">COMMUNITY-BASED MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE MALNUTRITION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>International consensus guidelines now recommend community-based care for children with <strong>uncomplicated</strong> severe acute malnutrition (SAM), as outlined above (see <a class="local">'Indications for community-based management'</a> above) [<a href="#rid3">3,7,8</a>]. Community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) is safe and effective for most of these children, increases access to care by avoiding travel and reducing costs, decreases the risk of nosocomial infection, and decreases the likelihood that the caretaker will take the child home (or even abandon the child) against medical advice before therapy is complete.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2805715412"><span class="h2">Overview</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CMAM emphasizes a decentralized and low-cost model of care that is able to reach far more malnourished children and is able to achieve better outcomes than most inpatient care settings.

RUTF is of high nutritional quality, is easily transportable, does not require cooking or other preparation, and has minimal spoilage. It provides all of the micronutrients and macronutrients needed for nutritional rehabilitation. RUTF is available commercially from a number of manufacturers and international agencies, such as the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), or often can be produced locally.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3437079758"><span class="h3">Formulations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most commonly available RUTF consists of a mixture of peanuts, sugar, oil, and powdered milk, supplemented with a vitamin and mineral mixture. It is a soft, semisolid paste that is readily consumed by most children six months and older. This formulation was initially developed during the 1990s and has become the de facto standard of care, although no specific formulation of RUTF is universally endorsed as long as all nutritional and safety standards are met. The most widely available commercial source of RUTF is marketed under the name Plumpy'Nut (manufactured by Nutriset in Malaunay, France) but is also increasingly produced locally in over a dozen countries.</p><p>One of the major advantages of the peanut-based formulation of RUTF is that the energy density is fourfold higher than that of F-100  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82277" href="/z/d/graphic/82277.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), allowing malnourished children to eat smaller quantities of food at more frequent intervals on demand. Because of low water content, RUTF can be kept unrefrigerated for up to two years and is thus ideal for outpatient use. It provides all of the macronutrients, vitamins, and minerals needed for nutritional rehabilitation, including sufficient iron, phosphorus, zinc, and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12883" href="/z/d/drug information/12883.html" rel="external">vitamin A</a> to treat these common deficiencies. Additional vitamin supplements are needed only rarely under select circumstances, such as symptomatic vitamin A deficiency or beriberi. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5901.html" rel="external">"Management of complicated severe acute malnutrition in children in resource-limited settings", section on 'Vitamin and mineral supplementation'</a>.)</p><p>RUTF can also be prepared from locally available foods with the addition of powdered milk and a commercially available vitamin and mineral mixture [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. A number of newer formulations substitute locally available sources of protein (eg, sesame paste) and grain (rice, maize, sorghum, or barley) in an effort to improve palatability and lower the cost of RUTF [<a href="#rid12">12-23</a>]. Although none of these formulations have been used on a wide scale yet, this is likely to be a significant area for study and further development in the upcoming years. While much of the motivation for new RUTF recipes is to lower cost by decreasing the milk content, the World Health Organization reaffirmed the recommendation that at least 50 percent of the protein content of RUTF come from dairy products [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>].</p><p>Other modifications of the standard peanut-based RUTF recipe have been attempted with varying degrees of success:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Adjunct mesalazine – A pilot trial of including mesalazine as part of CMAM care demonstrated some benefit in decreasing intestinal inflammation [<a href="#rid26">26</a>], but the benefit of this approach in improving nutritional recovery or decreasing mortality was not established by this small pilot study. Improvements in the fatty acid profile of RUTF to include higher levels of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have been proposed, especially since this may contribute to improved cognitive development in young children [<a href="#rid27">27-30</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Wheat-based RUTF – A promising formulation of RUTF, known as BP-100 [<a href="#rid31">31</a>], is wheat-based (rather than peanut-based) and comes in the form of a biscuit/bar that is especially well suited to older patients if they do not like the taste or texture of standard peanut-based RUTF. This biscuit can also be crumbled into clean water to make a porridge. Both formulations of BP-100 meet the World Health Organization standards for RUTF, and while clinical efficacy studies in malnourished children are lacking, there is no reason to believe that it should be less effective than peanut-based RUTF.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Microbiota-directed therapies – Preclinical and early clinical studies have evaluated modified therapeutic foods designed to normalize gut microbiota [<a href="#rid32">32,33</a>]. A small trial in Bangladeshi children 12 to 18 months of age with moderate acute malnutrition compared supplemental feeding with a microbiota-directed complementary food (MDCF) with standard RUTF for three months [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. The MDCF supplement improved some anthropometric outcomes and plasma biomarkers of nutritional recovery (eg, markers for bone growth and neurodevelopment), despite lower energy content than RUTF. By contrast, an earlier trial of a different MDCF did not alter the frequency or speed of nutritional cure, frequency of diarrhea or other clinical symptoms, or cumulative mortality [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2259779475"><span class="h3">Efficacy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CMAM and RUTF have become the de facto standards of care for uncomplicated SAM, based primarily on successful outcomes with extensive clinical experience [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. No large-scale randomized controlled trials have compared this protocol with inpatient hospitalization and traditional milk-based formula feedings for all severely malnourished children. In a small randomized trial in severely malnourished children in Senegal, children treated with RUTF recovered more quickly than children treated with F-100 [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. A systematic review concluded that RUTF or other specially formulated food increased the recovery rate by 29 percent for children with moderate acute malnutrition compared with standard care [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. In addition, RUTF was slightly superior to blended food supplements in improving weight gain and other anthropometric measurements and significantly better in decreasing non-recovery rates (relative risk 0.53, 95% CI 0.40-0.69). Other studies have shown RUTF to be superior to standard corn-soy blends for the recovery from SAM [<a href="#rid38">38,39</a>].</p><p>Given the widespread acceptance of CMAM and markedly better outcomes compared with historical recovery rates for traditional inpatient management, it is unlikely that further randomized trials that compare inpatient with outpatient care will be performed, both for practical and ethical reasons [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, innovations in the delivery of outpatient care continue to be explored, with adjuncts such as point-of-care water treatment at the household and community level for children under care for SAM showing higher recovery rates [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. Additionally, evidence suggests that higher amounts of vitamin D3 and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12833" href="/z/d/drug information/12833.html" rel="external">thiamine</a> in RUTF may lead to higher recovery rates [<a href="#rid42">42,43</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3595028780"><span class="h2">Feeding protocol</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children who are treated as outpatients are prescribed RUTF at a dose of approximately 175 kcal (733 J)/kg/day.

RUTF should only be provided for the severely malnourished patient and not for others in the family; exceptions should be made for twins in which only one is malnourished, or for other children in the household with very similar ages, since sharing can be assumed.</p><p>There may be situations in the field where severely malnourished infants under six months of age cannot be hospitalized, although every effort should be made to admit them to the hospital for management (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5901.html" rel="external">"Management of complicated severe acute malnutrition in children in resource-limited settings", section on 'Infants &lt;6 months'</a>). If an infant must be treated at home, very close follow-up is warranted, ideally with clinical assessments and weight checks daily or as frequently as feasible. Nutritional therapy should focus on reestablishing exclusive breastfeeding if possible. If this is not possible, commercial infant formula or diluted F-100 (prepared by diluting F-100 with an additional 30 percent water) may be used, although with the caveats that these can be quite expensive and the use of unclean water in their preparation puts the child at high risk for diarrheal diseases; the need to prepare these milks at least once or twice a day also makes this challenging. In some field settings, RUTF has been used for infants as young as four to five months of age by softening the paste with a small amount of water and feeding it by spoon, but the safety and efficacy of this approach has not been tested.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1954291640"><span class="h2">Counseling</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A number of counseling and education messages should be provided to the caretaker at the start of therapy and should be reemphasized at each return visit:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>RUTF should be fed in frequent, small feedings throughout the day, as driven by the child's appetite (on-demand feeding).

Children with SAM have high rates of underlying bacterial infection [<a href="#rid44">44</a>], infection is an important contributor to mortality, and overt signs of infection are often lacking.</p><p>The practice of empiric antibiotic treatment is supported by two randomized trials: one conducted in Malawi in 2767 children with both kwashiorkor and marasmus [<a href="#rid45">45</a>] and the other conducted in Niger in 2412 children with marasmus [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. In a meta-analysis of both trials, the rate of nutritional recovery was higher in children treated with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12631" href="/z/d/drug information/12631.html" rel="external">amoxicillin</a> plus standard care (including RUTF) compared with placebo plus standard care (75.8 versus 72.4 percent; risk ratio [RR] 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.06) [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. Nutritional recovery was generally defined as resolution of edema and adequate weight gain (ie, weight-for-height Z-score ≥-2). The findings regarding mortality benefit were conflicting in the two trials. In the Malawi trial, mortality was lower in the antibiotic-treated group compared with placebo (4.4 versus 7.4 percent; RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44-0.82). In the Niger trial, mortality rates were considerably lower than in the Malawi trial and there was no difference in mortality between treatment groups (0.6 percent in the amoxicillin group and 0.5 percent in the placebo group) [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. The meta-analysis did not include a pooled estimate for the effect on mortality. The difference in the mortality rates in the two trials is likely accounted for by the different settings in which the trials were conducted. The Malawi trial was conducted in a "real-world" community setting without easy access to a hospital, whereas the Niger trial was conducted at health centers with ready access to inpatient care and children who weren't recovering well were quickly admitted to the hospital. Thus, in the Malawi trial, &lt;3 percent of children received inpatient care, whereas one-quarter of those in the Niger trial received inpatient care. Of note, in the Niger trial, children in the amoxicillin group were less likely to be transferred to inpatient care compared with those in the placebo group (26.4 versus 30.7 percent; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76-0.98) [<a href="#rid46">46</a>].</p><p>The efficacy of empiric antibiotics is also supported by retrospective studies, which found that children who received <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12631" href="/z/d/drug information/12631.html" rel="external">amoxicillin</a> as part of outpatient management of SAM were 1.5 to 2 times more likely to achieve nutritional recovery compared with children who did not receive antibiotics [<a href="#rid48">48,49</a>]. Although empiric use of antibiotics may increase the prevalence of antibiotic resistance, the nutritional and mortality benefits generally still justify this practice [<a href="#rid50">50</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3176906666"><span class="h2">Follow-up and monitoring</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children should return for follow-up every one to two weeks, depending on local practices and balancing the burden that frequent visits places on caretakers and health care providers. If necessary, the follow-up interval can likely be extended to every four weeks without significant adverse effect (eg, in particularly remote settings where health center attendance is especially challenging) [<a href="#rid10">10,51</a>]. At each follow-up visit, weight and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) are measured and edema is rechecked. Careful records for each child should be kept and response to therapy closely assessed. Children who are losing weight (other than water weight from decreasing edema) or who are not making steady progress over two to three weeks should have a careful clinical and social assessment performed to identify confounding illnesses and any barriers to recovery.</p><p>Most children recover within six to eight weeks, where recovery is defined as reaching objective anthropometric targets  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79197" href="/z/d/graphic/79197.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) (see <a class="local">'Discharge from treatment'</a> below). Children who are not making progress within two to three weeks, or who do not achieve their anthropometric goals within 12 weeks, should be reevaluated to determine the cause. In most cases, these children should be admitted to a hospital to provide more intensive, supervised care and to address any underlying infectious or other medical issues (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5901.html" rel="external">"Management of complicated severe acute malnutrition in children in resource-limited settings"</a>). Children with both marasmus and kwashiorkor (known as marasmic kwashiorkor) are particularly vulnerable to mortality and are more likely to need more intensive therapy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1725553874"><span class="h2">Discharge from treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children 6 to 59 months of age may be discharged from treatment when they meet <strong>either</strong> of the following anthropometric criteria [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Weight-for-height Z-score ≥-2 and no edema for at least one to two weeks, or</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>MUAC ≥12.5 cm and no edema for at least one to two weeks</p><p></p><p>In general, the anthropometric criterion used for discharge should be the one that was used for admission to the treatment program. Percentage weight gain is no longer recommended as a criterion for discharge. Other discharge criteria are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79197" href="/z/d/graphic/79197.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). The mother or caregiver should be able to care for the child after discharge. She/he should be able to provide food and recognize when diarrhea, fever, respiratory distress, and other common symptoms warrant medical follow-up. Ideally, a health worker should be available in the community to provide follow-up of the child and support for the mother [<a href="#rid52">52</a>].</p><p>Relapse after discharge from the treatment program is common in many settings, with rates as high as 37 percent [<a href="#rid53">53-55</a>]. Higher weight-for-height Z-score and MUAC are associated with a lower risk of relapse in moderately malnourished children, but it is unknown if this applies to severely malnourished children as well [<a href="#rid56">56,57</a>]. Empiric antibiotic therapy generally should not be continued after discharge, since it does not appear to decrease the risk of relapse [<a href="#rid58">58</a>].</p><p>An innovation in early identification of severe wasting among children in high-risk populations is to provide caretakers with MUAC tapes and teach them how to identify when their child (or children in their community) has moderate or severe wasting [<a href="#rid59">59</a>] and is known as the "Mothers Understand And Can do it" method. Since the tapes are generally color coded, measuring MUAC is a straightforward activity that does not require the caretaker to have any numerical or verbal literacy. Initial field experience has already shown that this program is effective in early identification of malnutrition, so that children are identified and brought for care when their malnutrition is less severe [<a href="#rid60">60,61</a>]. This method can be adapted to post-discharge monitoring by providing MUAC tapes and education to caretakers of children being discharged from a CMAM program. This strategy likely facilitates early detection of relapses and re-enrollment in the treatment program, but its efficacy has not been formally evaluated.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1304435641"><span class="h1">COMMUNITY-BASED PREVENTIVE CARE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Effective preventive care requires recognition of children at risk for severe malnutrition and implementation of interventions to arrest progression to the severely malnourished state.

In many cases, acute malnutrition might be preventable by recognizing and treating the acute illness early. By contrast, in resource-abundant settings, severe malnutrition is usually caused by an underlying chronic illness.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4152612974"><span class="h3">Diarrheal illness</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Chronic or prolonged diarrhea is a common risk factor for the development of severe malnutrition. An isolated acute diarrheal illness (duration &lt;14 days) usually causes only transient slowing of growth [<a href="#rid62">62</a>]. However, in the setting of preexisting and concomitant undernutrition, the intestinal mucosa does not efficiently regenerate. Repeated environmental and infectious insults contribute to the development of environmental enteric dysfunction, which further stunts child growth, leads to cognitive stunting, and places children at elevated risk for developing acute malnutrition [<a href="#rid63">63</a>]. Children with persistent diarrhea or repeated bouts of diarrhea are at particularly high risk for severe malnutrition due to malabsorption [<a href="#rid64">64</a>]. Thus, the prevention and treatment of diarrheal illnesses through standard sanitary measures becomes an essential foundation for local efforts to prevent malnutrition.

The immunologic compromise caused by HIV infection accelerates comorbid infections (such as tuberculosis, malaria, or chronic diarrhea) that increase metabolic demands, which increases the risk for malnutrition. In patients with HIV infection, prompt treatment with appropriate antiretroviral drugs and treatment or prevention of opportunistic infections are essential steps to prevent or treat malnutrition [<a href="#rid66">66,67</a>]. In addition, children with HIV infection require added nutritional supplementation to meet their increased metabolic needs.

Although helpful as a first-line strategy during a crisis, GFD schemes usually fail to prevent significant amounts of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) because they do not target the highest-risk groups within a population who would benefit most from nutrition support.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1707912451"><span class="h3">Targeted supplementation strategies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Because of the poor efficacy of GFD schemes, the World Health Organization now endorses supplementation strategies that target at-risk subgroups as the best strategy for preventing malnutrition within a population experiencing food insecurity.</p><p>Targeted supplemental feeding programs directly supplement those populations and age groups at the greatest risk for malnutrition, usually nursing mothers and children younger than 60 months. More current recommendations emphasize protein- and lipid-rich food items, such as ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) [<a href="#rid7">7,68</a>], in contrast with previous strategies that relied on grain-based foods. RUTF is readily transportable and sanitary, with a long shelf life without refrigeration, allowing for prepositioning of stocks in areas vulnerable to acute food crises. Multiple studies have established the efficacy of RUTF as a therapeutic strategy for children with moderate to severe malnutrition, as outlined above (see <a class="local">'Ready-to-use therapeutic food'</a> above). Additional interest has been focused on whether use of RUTF in children who are already exhibiting stunting may prevent progression to more severe forms of malnutrition. Unfortunately, no cost-effective implementation strategy using RUTF or other lipid-nutrient spreads has been found to decrease the risk of developing severe malnutrition. In a study of supplemental legumes that were given to high-risk infants and young children as part of a randomized trial to improve gut health, those subjects receiving the supplements still experienced a high rate of progression to acute malnutrition [<a href="#rid69">69</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2906863729"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Children who are not making progress within two to three weeks, or who do not achieve their anthropometric goals within 12 weeks, should be reevaluated to determine the cause.
