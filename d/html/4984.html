         A newborn should have a thorough evaluation performed within 24 hours of birth to identify any abnormality that would alter the normal newborn course or identify a medical condition that should be addressed (eg, anomalies, birth injuries, jaundice, or cardiopulmonary disorders) [
         <a href="#rid1">

         </a>
         ]. This assessment includes review of the maternal, family, and prenatal history and a complete examination. Depending upon the length of stay, another examination should be performed within 24 hours before discharge from the hospital.

         Review of the mother's and father's medical and genetic history. In particular, maternal illnesses prior to and during pregnancy, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or pregnancy complications, such as gestational diabetes or preeclampsia, may affect fetal growth or lead to other complications. A review of maternal medications should be performed, as some maternal medications may have intrauterine effects or be excreted in breast milk. (See

         In developed countries and some developing countries, prenatal screening tests are routinely performed. The results of these screening tests should be reviewed, as an abnormal finding may be indicative of a medical condition that warrants further evaluation. The following section is a summary of available prenatal testing. A more complete discussion of prenatal screening and care is presented separately. (See

         At the first prenatal visit, a standard panel of laboratory tests is obtained and usually includes the following:

         The clinician performing the initial newborn examination should be familiar with the events surrounding delivery. The duration of labor, duration of rupture of membranes, mode of delivery, the newborn's condition at delivery, and resuscitation, if any, should be reviewed. Infants who require resuscitation are at risk of developing postresuscitative complications, such as hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and central nervous system complications. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5015.html" rel="external">
          "Neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room", section on 'Postresuscitation'

        </p>

         It is important to determine the gestational age (GA) of the infant. Preterm infants (GA below 37 weeks), including those born late preterm (GA 34 0/7 to 36 6/7 weeks), are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality compared with term infants (GA 39 to 42 weeks). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5061.html" rel="external">
          "Postnatal assessment of gestational age"
         </a>

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Of note, infants who are born between 37 0/7 and 38 6/7 weeks of age (defined as early term) have a higher morbidity rate than term infants born between 39 and 42 weeks of gestation [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Early term infants have a higher risk for hypoglycemia, need for respiratory support, including intubation and mechanical ventilation, need for administration of intravenous (IV) fluids, hyperbilirubinemia, and/or need for treatment with IV antibiotics compared with more mature infants.

         The examination should be conducted in a systematic manner, as a consistent approach ensures that all aspects are evaluated. Although the exact order is not important, the examination is optimized by initially observing the infant's general appearance followed by auscultation of the lungs and heart while the infant is lying quietly. The examination usually proceeds from head to foot as outlined in the following sections. Examination of the hips and spine, which is apt to disturb the infant, usually is performed last. The hips are examined while the infant is supine, then the infant is turned prone to examine the back.
        </p>
        <p>
         The date and time of the examination should be recorded. Findings considered normal close to delivery (eg, a transitional heart murmur) may be abnormal on the second or third day after birth. The examination should include assessment of gestational age (GA). Knowledge of the level of maturity may be important in the interpretation of physical findings. (See

         ‒ Paradoxical breathing movements, in which the abdomen moves outward and the chest wall moves inward in inspiration, are normal. Signs of respiratory distress are abnormal and suggest pulmonary disease. They include rapid breathing, nasal flaring, use of accessory muscles (eg, significant subcostal, intercostal, supraclavicular, or suprasternal retractions), and grunting. The respiratory count should be conducted over a full minute to account for the variable breathing rate in the neonate.

          Position and movement
         </strong>
         ‒ The newborn's posture at rest usually reflects the intrauterine position. Term newborns who have been positioned in a vertex presentation typically lie with the hips, knees, and ankles flexed. Infants who were in a breech position often have extended legs. A frank breech presentation may result in markedly abducted and externally rotated legs, which may lead to lower extremity deformations. A normal infant moves all extremities symmetrically. Deviation of posture or abnormal movement may be an indication of birth injury or deformation due to intrauterine positioning. (See

          Color assessment

         ‒ A normal infant appears pink. Acrocyanosis, a bluish appearance of the hands, feet, and perioral area, is common in the first few days after delivery. However, central cyanosis, which is seen best on the tongue and mucous membranes of the mouth, suggests hypoxemia. Bruising also may result in a bluish discoloration.

         Pallor may indicate anemia, caused by acute blood loss at or shortly before delivery or a chronic intrauterine process. A ruddy or plethoric infant may have polycythemia.

         Craniotabes – Craniotabes is a soft area of skull bone, usually in the parietal region, that gives a sensation of a ping-pong ball when depressed.

          Face

         Facial palsies – Risk factors for facial palsy include delivery with the assistance of forceps and prolonged delivery in mothers with a prominent sacral promontory. Typically, only the mandibular branch of the facial nerve is affected and the infant will have diminished movement on the affected side of the face. The facial palsy is characterized by the loss of the nasolabial fold, partial closing of the eye, and the inability to contract the lower facial muscles on the affected side, leading to the appearance of a "drooping" mouth. When crying, the mouth is drawn over to the unaffected side.

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Similar to facial palsies, the muscles controlling movement of one side of the mouth are affected, thus there is asymmetry of the face upon crying. Unlike facial palsies, the muscles controlling movement of the upper face are normal; thus, the nasolabial folds are normal, and when the infant cries, the forehead wrinkles and both eyes close normally. This is typically a benign condition and becomes less noticeable as the child gets older.

         ‒ Pupils should be assessed for their shape and reaction to light. Normal pupils are round and constrict in response to a bright light. Pupillary reaction occurs consistently after 32 weeks GA, but may be apparent in some infants as early as 28 weeks gestation [

          Red reflex
         </strong>
         ‒ All neonates require an ophthalmoscopic examination to document the presence (or absence) of a red reflex [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,20
         </a>
         ]. A normal red reflex is seen if the lens and underlying structures are clear. The red reflex test is performed observing both eyes of the infant through an ophthalmoscope with the ophthalmoscope lens power set at "0" at a distance approximately 18 inches away from the infant. A normal red reflex emanates from both eyes and is symmetric in character without evidence of opacities or white spots  (

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Dark spots in the red reflex, a markedly diminished reflex, presence of a white reflex, or asymmetry of the reflex are indications for referral to an ophthalmologist. Abnormalities of the lens (eg, cataract), vitreous (eg, persistent fetal vasculature), or retina (eg, retinoblastoma) produce a white pupil (leukocoria). (See

         External ear abnormalities ‒ The ears should be inspected for branchial cleft cysts (which may be located in the preauricular area and along the line anterior to the sternocleidomastoid in the neck), sinuses, preauricular skin tags or pits, or dysplastic features. External ear abnormalities increase the risk of additional anomalies of the middle and inner ear, which are associated with hearing loss [

         Nares ‒ Patency of the nares should be established because infants are predominantly nose breathers. This can be accomplished by noting the movement of a piece of cotton or thread placed in front of each naris. Obstruction may be caused by edema related to vigorous suctioning after birth, or be due to anatomical causes, such as choanal atresia. The latter can be tested by passage of a feeding tube or suction catheter through the nose. (See

         Chest wall movement — The ribs and sternum are incompletely ossified in the newborn, resulting in a highly compliant chest wall. Breathing in normal infants may be paradoxical, in which the rib cage moves inward and the abdomen moves outward during inspiration. In respiratory disorders, the high intrathoracic pressures generated to inflate poorly compliant lungs may cause retractions that are intercostal, subcostal, or subxiphoid (substernal).

         Widely spaced nipples occur in some genetic syndromes (eg, Turner syndrome). If the nipples appear to be widely spaced, measurement of the distance between the nipples should be compared with available normative data [

          Observation

         ‒ The infant's breathing rate and pattern should be observed. These may fluctuate depending upon the state of wakefulness, and whether the infant is active or crying. The respiratory rate should be counted for a full minute to account for variations in rate and rhythm. A normal rate is 40 to 60 breaths per minute.

          Auscultation

         — Auscultation of the lungs should be performed with the infant as quiet as possible. In general, this is best accomplished early in the assessment prior to palpation of the abdomen, head, and neck.

         Normal breath sounds are bronchovesicular and are heard equally on both sides of the chest. The breath sounds should be clear, although some infants may have scattered rales for a few hours after delivery. Abnormal breath sounds are unusual in the absence of tachypnea or signs of respiratory distress. In infants with respiratory disease, grunting sometimes is audible only with a stethoscope.

         Auscultation should be performed with a warmed stethoscope while the infant lies quietly. Thorough evaluation necessitates auscultation of all areas of the precordium, as well as the back and axillary areas. The process includes noting the rate and rhythm, listening carefully for the first and second heart sounds, and the presence of a murmur. The heart rate is normally 120 to 160 beats per minute, but may decrease to 85 to 90 beats per minute in some term infants during sleep.

         The abdomen should be examined when the infant is quiet. The size and overall appearance should be assessed. The normal abdomen is slightly protuberant. Distension is abnormal and may indicate conditions such as intestinal obstruction, organomegaly, or ascites. The abdomen may be scaphoid in the presence of a diaphragmatic hernia. Many normal infants have diastasis recti, resulting from the nonunion of the two rectus muscles, which may result in an umbilical hernia  (

         Palpation of the abdomen should begin superficially and proceed more deeply, but remain gentle to avoid causing discomfort, which results in the infant crying. Holding the infant's legs in a flexed position and having the infant suck on a pacifier or the examiner's gloved finger may facilitate relaxation of the abdominal wall muscles.
        </p>
        <p>
         The liver edge normally is palpated 1 to 3 cm below the right costal margin. The liver should be soft with a smooth edge. The spleen usually is not palpable, although some normal infants may have a palpable spleen tip.
        </p>
        <p>
         The kidneys may be palpated through the anterior abdominal wall. One approach to facilitate palpation of the lower poles of the kidneys is to place the fingertips above and below the lower quadrants and apply moderate pressure; this maneuver traps the kidneys between the fingertips. The left kidney is more easily palpable than the right.
        </p>
        <p>
         Any other palpable abdominal mass is abnormal and requires further investigation. Most abdominal masses in newborns are enlarged kidneys caused by hydronephrosis or cystic renal disease. Masses may also result from tumors, such as neuroblastomas or teratomas.

         In the female infant, the size and location of the labia, clitoris, meatus, and vaginal opening are assessed. The appearance of the genitalia varies with GA. The labia minora and clitoris are prominent in preterm infants, while the labia majora becomes larger as the infant approaches term. The genitalia in growth-restricted females may appear immature due to decreased deposition of fat in the labia majora. (See

Hydroceles are fluid collections around the testes, and usually resolve spontaneously. They can be distinguished from hernias by transillumination of the scrotum.

         Hypospadias ‒ Hypospadias is a congenital anomaly of the male urethra that results in abnormal ventral placement of the urethral opening. The location of the displaced urethral meatus may range anywhere within the glans, the shaft of penis, the scrotum, or perineum  (

         ). Circumcision is usually not recommended, because either the preputial skin may be necessary for hypospadias repair or the lack of ventral skin makes circumcision difficult. A pediatric urologist should be consulted in the nursery if there is a question regarding performance of circumcision. The evaluation and management of hypospadias is discussed in greater detail separately. (See

         Physical findings of ambiguous genitalia in a phenotypic female include an enlarged clitoris, fused labial folds, or palpable gonads; and in a phenotypic male, bifid scrotum, severe hypospadias, micropenis, or cryptorchidism. Ambiguous genitalia may signal an intersex disorder. These conditions also may be caused by abnormalities of sexual differentiation or congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).

        <p>
         Infants with a suspected disorder of sexual differentiation (DSD) should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team, including an endocrinologist, urologist, geneticist, and pediatrician/neonatologist. Because of the risk of adrenal crisis in infants with the salt-wasting form of CAH, evaluation should occur as soon as feasible after birth. (See

         The hips should be examined to detect developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). The examination for hip instability must be performed gently and with the infant quiet and relaxed. Techniques to detect hip instability (eg, Ortolani and Barlow maneuvers) use adduction and posterior pressure to feel for dislocation, and abduction and elevation to feel for reduction. The sensation of dislocation or reduction is distinct and best described as a "jerk" or "clunk" and differs from that of benign joint popping or tendon snapping. Risk factors for DDH include female gender, in utero breech position, and a positive family history.

          Physical examination
         </strong>
         ‒ The physical examination can be performed in the nursery or the mother's room. The area should be warm and quiet and should have good lighting. It should be conducted in a systematic and consistent manner as a consistent approach ensures that all aspects are evaluated. The date and time of the examination should be recorded. Findings considered normal close to delivery (eg, a transitional heart murmur) may be abnormal on the second or third day after birth. The examination should include assessment of gestational age (GA). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Overview'
         </a>
         above.)

         Although the exact order is not important, the examination is optimized by initially observing the infant's general appearance followed by auscultation of the lungs and heart while the infant is lying quietly. (See
         <a class="local">

         The assessment then proceeds with measurements of body parts (ie, weight, length, and head circumference) and vital signs and examination of individual body parts and organs from head to toes. Examination of the hips and spine, which is apt to disturb the infant, usually is performed last. (See
