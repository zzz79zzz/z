Bone metastases represent a prominent source of morbidity [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. Skeletal-related events (SREs) that are due to bone metastases can include pain, pathologic fracture, hypercalcemia, and spinal cord compression. Across a wide variety of tumors involving bone, the frequency of SREs can be reduced through the use of osteoclast inhibitors, such as bisphosphonates or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="15575" href="/z/d/drug information/15575.html" rel="external">denosumab</a>.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of therapeutic options for management of adult patients with bone metastases from tumors other than multiple myeloma. An overview of the incidence, distribution, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of bone metastases is presented elsewhere, as are more detailed discussions of analgesic approaches for patients with pain related to bone metastases; the use of radiation therapy, bone-targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy, image-guided thermal ablation for bone metastases; management of pathologic and impending pathologic fractures; and the use of osteoclast inhibitors to prevent SREs in a wide variety of tumors associated with bone involvement. Specific issues related to bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer, multiple myeloma, and primary lymphoma of bone (PLB) are also discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91912.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of bone metastasis in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2814.html" rel="external">"Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2815.html" rel="external">"Cancer pain management: Role of adjuvant analgesics (coanalgesics)", section on 'Patients with bone pain'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2805.html" rel="external">"Radiation therapy for the management of painful bone metastases"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/17128.html" rel="external">"Bone metastases in advanced prostate cancer: Management", section on 'Bone-targeted radioisotopes'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83808.html" rel="external">"Image-guided ablation of skeletal metastases"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83811.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and evaluation of complete and impending pathologic fractures in patients with metastatic bone disease, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2801.html" rel="external">"Osteoclast inhibitors for patients with bone metastases from breast, prostate, and other solid tumors"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H475111773"><span class="h1">GENERAL APPROACH TO THE PATIENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goals of management for patients with bone metastases include maximizing pain or symptom control, preserving and restoring function, minimizing the risk for skeletal-related events (SREs), stabilizing the skeleton (if needed), and enhancing local tumor control. Therapeutic options include pain management/analgesia, which may be administered in parallel with osteoclast inhibitors (bone modifying agents), systemic anticancer therapy, radiation therapy (external beam radiation therapy [EBRT], stereotactic body radiation therapy [SBRT] in one to five fractions), bone-targeting radiopharmaceuticals, surgery (which is generally reserved for patients with a complete or impending pathologic fracture), and image-guided thermal ablation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83811.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and evaluation of complete and impending pathologic fractures in patients with metastatic bone disease, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H736596770"><span class="h2">Factors influencing the choice of treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Factors influencing the choice of treatment for a patient with bone metastases include symptoms, impact of bone metastases on quality of life, performance status, estimated life expectancy, goals of treatment, and preferences for care. Other factors include the clinical disease status (eg, whether an individual has an uncontrolled primary cancer with diffuse, visceral metastases versus a controlled primary with just a few sites of metastasis, termed oligometastatic disease, as well as the length of the disease-free interval if the site represents progression of disease at a follow-up time point) and whether or not there is an impending or existing fracture in the affected bone.</p><p>For patients with vertebral bone metastases, the specific approach also depends on whether or not the spinal cord or cauda equina are at risk due to epidural tumor extension. Decision-making about surgical versus nonsurgical treatment in these patients can be difficult. A decision framework that is based on neurologic (extent of cord compression, presence or absence of myelopathy), oncologic (radiosensitivity of the malignancy, prior irradiation), mechanical (is there spinal instability), and systemic factors (able to tolerate surgery) has been developed to assist in the decision-making process [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2820.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prognosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression", section on 'Baseline assessment'</a>.)</p><p>Optimal treatment of bone metastasis may be complex and require multimodality treatment strategies to achieve optimal outcomes. Treatment recommendations must be individualized to each patient's specific symptoms, clinical presentation, histologic tumor type, performance status, and his or her goals and preferences. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Observation may be recommended for asymptomatic bone metastasis with no significant risk of pathologic fracture or spinal instability, especially if life expectancy is limited.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Evaluating the extent of disease, both local bony and systemic, as well as the natural history of the underlying primary malignancy, is important to establish the goals of treatment. For example, patients with a few focal, isolated bone metastases and a primary radioresistant histology, such as renal cell carcinoma, may be candidates for aggressive local surgical or radioablative management. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2963.html" rel="external">"Role of surgery in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma", section on 'Isolated bone metastases'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83808.html" rel="external">"Image-guided ablation of skeletal metastases"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The efficacy of systemic anticancer therapy based on primary tumor type is also a factor. As an example, systemic therapy plays a major role in treatment for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer with symptomatic bone metastases. (See <a class="local">'Systemic anticancer therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Moribund or severely medically ill patients who are not expected to survive the procedure (let alone the hospitalization) should not be offered operative intervention, even if they have a complete or impending pathologic fracture. In such cases, nonsurgical stabilization (eg, bracing a limb or wearing a neck collar for stabilization) with adequate analgesia and/or other nonsurgical palliative therapy may be a more appropriate option. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/132146.html" rel="external">"Management of complete and impending pathologic fractures in patients with metastatic bone disease, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma", section on 'Palliation to exceed expected survival'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3287065400"><span class="h3">Predicting prognosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Models to predict prognosis in patients with bone metastases that are based on the number of skeletal metastases, presence and extent of organ metastases, primary site, hemoglobin level, and performance status  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57945" href="/z/d/graphic/57945.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) have been developed, several of which are specific to spine metastases [<a href="#rid5">5-9</a>]. However, all are limited in their ability to accurately predict overall survival, and it is not clear that any one is more reliable than the others.</p><p class="bulletIndent1">These issues and additional tools for estimating survival in patients with advanced cancer are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/132146.html" rel="external">"Management of complete and impending pathologic fractures in patients with metastatic bone disease, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma", section on 'Palliation to exceed expected survival'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2206.html" rel="external">"Survival estimates in advanced terminal cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3109762413"><span class="h2">Supportive care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with bone metastases, supportive care should include adequate analgesia, if pain is present, and the use of osteoclast inhibitors to reduce the risk of SREs (including bone pain, pathologic fracture, hypercalcemia, and spinal cord compression) and to enhance analgesia.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3609911654"><span class="h3">Analgesia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The majority of patients who develop bone metastases will suffer from significant bone pain at some point.<strong> </strong>Initially, nonopioid analgesic drugs, such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), may be used alone for mild to moderate pain. When pain is not adequately relieved, these nonopioid analgesic drugs may be used in combination with an opioid. Although there are several products available that combine an opioid and acetaminophen, hepatic toxicity from acetaminophen is a major concern, and the therapeutic dose of the combination is limited by the amount of acetaminophen. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2798.html" rel="external">"Cancer pain management: Use of acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs", section on 'Hepatic toxicity'</a>.)</p><p>For moderate or severe cancer pain, opioids are the most common medical therapy because they are effective for all types of cancer pain. The majority of patients with pain from metastatic bone disease obtain adequate pain relief with opioid therapy [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. Optimal pain control usually requires titration, the addition of long-acting opioids, and effective management of breakthrough pain. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2814.html" rel="external">"Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2814.html" rel="external">"Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia", section on 'Pure mu agonists rarely used for cancer pain'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2814.html" rel="external">"Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia", section on 'Dose titration'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2814.html" rel="external">"Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia", section on 'Management of breakthrough pain'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with multifocal bone pain usually are managed with an NSAID, with or without opioids, unless they have a specific contraindication to use of these agents in conjunction with an opioid. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2814.html" rel="external">"Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2815.html" rel="external">"Cancer pain management: Role of adjuvant analgesics (coanalgesics)", section on 'Patients with bone pain'</a>.)</p><p>Glucocorticoids may be helpful for patients with somatic pain from bone metastases whose pain is incompletely resolved with opioids with or without NSAIDs or for whom side effects are limiting. Consultation with a palliative care specialist should be considered for patients whose pain is refractory to initial attempts at analgesic therapy or who develop significant side effects from the agents initially chosen. Other adjuncts include antidepressants and antiepileptics such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8483" href="/z/d/drug information/8483.html" rel="external">gabapentin</a>, which may be effective for tingling and burning pain. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2815.html" rel="external">"Cancer pain management: Role of adjuvant analgesics (coanalgesics)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14240.html" rel="external">"Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care"</a>.)</p><p>Consultation with an anesthesia pain specialist can be considered for integration of interventional procedures (eg, nerve block, spinal cord stimulator, epidural port-a-cath, or implanted pain pump that delivers local analgesia or a combination of low-dose opioid and local analgesia to prevent the side effects and quality of life decrement with high-dose, systemically administered opioids). Chest wall and rib metastasis, for example, may respond significantly to a local pain block. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14240.html" rel="external">"Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care", section on 'Rationale for palliative care'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14248.html" rel="external">"Interventional therapies for chronic pain"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3716904470"><span class="h3">Osteoclast inhibitors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Osteoclast inhibitors (including bisphosphonates and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="15575" href="/z/d/drug information/15575.html" rel="external">denosumab</a>) are indicated for the management of metastatic bone disease for most patients with solid tumors. However:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The vast majority of the data regarding the benefits of osteoclast inhibitors for prostate cancer were generated in the castration-resistant state; hence, for men with bone metastases from prostate cancer, the use of osteoclast inhibitors is generally restricted to those with castration-resistant disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/17128.html" rel="external">"Bone metastases in advanced prostate cancer: Management", section on 'Castration-resistant disease'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients in whom SREs are unlikely (eg, those with minimal bone tumor burden) and those with a limited expected survival (eg, in the setting of widespread and progressive, visceral metastases), treatment with osteoclast inhibitors should be considered on a case-by-case basis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2801.html" rel="external">"Osteoclast inhibitors for patients with bone metastases from breast, prostate, and other solid tumors", section on 'Indications for osteoclast inhibitor therapy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Osteoclast inhibitors slow or reverse the progression of skeletal metastases and reduce the likelihood of SREs. In addition, they also have some analgesic benefit, although it is modest. In several trials, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="15575" href="/z/d/drug information/15575.html" rel="external">denosumab</a> has proven modestly superior to bisphosphonates for prevention of SREs and in analgesic efficacy. However, the analgesic efficacy of all of these agents is limited, and they are not recommended as first-line agents to treat painful bone metastases. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2801.html" rel="external">"Osteoclast inhibitors for patients with bone metastases from breast, prostate, and other solid tumors", section on 'Efficacy and dosing considerations for individual agents'</a>.)</p><p>The modest benefits of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="15575" href="/z/d/drug information/15575.html" rel="external">denosumab</a> over <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9902" href="/z/d/drug information/9902.html" rel="external">zoledronic acid</a> for patients with skeletal metastases come at a higher direct cost. Moreover, there are sufficient data in breast cancer and castration-resistant prostate cancer to support a 12-week, rather than four-week, dosing interval for zoledronic acid, which improves indirect costs. As a result, for many patients, zoledronic acid is the preferred agent. This subject is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2801.html" rel="external">"Osteoclast inhibitors for patients with bone metastases from breast, prostate, and other solid tumors", section on 'Overview of the approach to osteoclast inhibition'</a>.)</p><p>Although generally well tolerated, the bisphosphonates and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="15575" href="/z/d/drug information/15575.html" rel="external">denosumab</a> are associated with side effects, some of which (jaw osteonecrosis, hypocalcemia [especially in vitamin D-deficient patients]) are shared. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2806.html" rel="external">"Risks of therapy with bone antiresorptive agents in patients with advanced malignancy", section on 'Risks shared by both classes of drugs'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/96863.html" rel="external">"Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients with cancer"</a>.)</p><p>Risks specific to bisphosphonates in patients with malignancy include impaired renal function, a temporary flu-like syndrome with fever and body aches, and a significantly increased risk of atrial fibrillation/flutter and stroke. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2806.html" rel="external">"Risks of therapy with bone antiresorptive agents in patients with advanced malignancy", section on 'Risks specific to bisphosphonates'</a>.)</p><p>Risks specific to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="15575" href="/z/d/drug information/15575.html" rel="external">denosumab</a> include an increased risk of infection.

(See <a class="local">'General approach to the patient'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Supportive care for symptomatic patients should include adequate analgesia (typically opioids, with or without an analgesic adjuvant), and osteoclast inhibitors to enhance analgesia and reduce the risk of SREs (ie, bone pain, pathologic fracture, hypercalcemia, and spinal cord compression). Interventional procedures such as nerve blocks may help when opioid analgesics are maximized. (See <a class="local">'Supportive care'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If consistent with the goals of care, individuals with bone metastases should be supported and encouraged to engage in regular physical activity. Perceived risks of skeletal complications must be weighed against the potential health benefits, in consultation with the patient, the health care team, and the exercise professional. (See <a class="local">'Exercise'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Choice of local treatment</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Factors influencing the choice of local treatment include symptoms, impact of bone metastases on quality of life, performance status, estimated life expectancy, goals preferences for care, clinical disease extent, whether or not there is an impending or existing fracture in the affected bone, and, for patients with vertebral bone metastases, whether epidural tumor extension is present. (See <a class="local">'Factors influencing the choice of treatment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The choice of a specific approach must be individualized. Management algorithms for local treatment of vertebral and nonvertebral bone metastases are provided  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96056" href="/z/d/graphic/96056.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96694" href="/z/d/graphic/96694.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">In general:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Asymptomatic patients with widespread metastasis, no risk of impending fracture, and a limited life expectancy may not require any intervention.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is a standard approach for symptomatic skeletal metastases. For uncomplicated bone metastases, a single fraction of 8 Gy to the involved area is effective and more convenient than fractionated regimens, although retreatment is needed more often. (See <a class="local">'External beam radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is generally reserved for recurrent vertebral metastases that require reirradiation for symptomatic control, or SBRT may be preferred over EBRT for definitive treatment of symptomatic bone metastases from relatively radioresistant neoplasms (eg, renal cell cancer, melanoma, sarcoma), especially in patients with vertebral metastases and epidural extension but no high-grade epidural spinal cord compression (ESCC). Another setting in which SBRT may be preferred is for patients with oligometastatic disease. (See <a class="local">'Stereotactic body radiation therapy'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2820.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prognosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression", section on 'Stereotactic body radiotherapy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="89425" href="/z/d/drug information/89425.html" rel="external">Radium-223</a> is a reasonable option for men with castration-resistant prostate cancer, multifocal symptomatic osteoblastic bone metastases, and no visceral metastases. For other histologies, bone-targeted radiopharmaceuticals are reserved for persistent or recurrent multifocal bone pain from osteoblastic metastases after EBRT and/or other forms of therapy. In this setting, samarium-153 is a reasonable option, but we would not use radium-223. (See <a class="local">'Bone-targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Surgical management of bone metastases is typically reserved for lesions with a complete or impending pathologic fracture if surgical intervention is consistent with the goals of care. Surgery may also be needed for spine metastases that are causing mechanical instability or ESCC. (See <a class="local">'Indications for surgical consultation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3">For highly selected patients with advanced cancer who present with or develop a bone lesion as the only focus of cancer beyond the primary site, en bloc resection of the metastasis may optimize local tumor control, provide durable pain relief, and possibly, prolong patient survival. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2963.html" rel="external">"Role of surgery in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma", section on 'Isolated bone metastases'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are generally reserved for patients with symptomatic osteolytic spinal metastases causing vertebral compression fracture, without epidural disease or retropulsion of bone fragments into the spinal cord. (See <a class="local">'Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>For patients with persistent or recurrent pain from one or a few skeletal sites after palliative RT and who are not surgical candidates, local thermal ablation (radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, and focused ultrasound) is an important therapeutic option. (See <a class="local">'Local ablation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1217316127"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges Thomas F DeLaney, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Mundy GR.
