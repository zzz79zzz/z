         Chikungunya virus is an arthropod-borne alphavirus transmitted by mosquitoes that causes acute febrile polyarthralgia and inflammatory arthritis, as well as cutaneous eruptions and other systemic manifestations [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Further, many patients develop chronic joint involvement. In these patients, treatment with immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive drugs may achieve disease control. The name chikungunya is derived from an African language and means "that which bends up" or "stooped walk" because of the incapacitating joint involvement that may complicate the disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         The treatment and prevention of chikungunya fever are discussed here. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of chikungunya infection are discussed separately. (See

         Treatment is influenced by the phase and duration of the illness and the response to therapy. Acute disease, including both articular and nonarticular disease, is typically treated symptomatically and if needed, with supportive measures. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Acute disease'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Following the acute phase, most patients who remain symptomatic have joint disease; chronic joint disease may benefit from medications commonly employed in other forms of chronic inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), including disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Post-acute and chronic arthritis'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Inflammatory arthritis evident on physical examination and chronic arthralgia without physical findings are treated similarly; the latter is also presumed to be due to ongoing inflammatory synovitis, although this is based upon limited evidence.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most descriptions of disease and their sequelae rely upon data from large outbreaks. Persistent and sometimes severe polyarthralgia is the most prominent feature, often without objective signs of inflammation on examination, such as swelling and erythema. These patients typically have prolonged morning stiffness and may respond to conventional DMARDs, suggesting that post-infectious, inflammatory arthritis may be the underlying cause.
        </p>
        <p>
         Moreover, a few ultrasound studies have demonstrated inflammatory synovitis during the acute phase of infection [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ], as well as in patients with both post-acute and chronic joint pain [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. However, studies of these populations with synovial fluid analysis or histology are lacking, as are studies that explore whether acute arthritis should be treated differently than chronic arthralgia and chronic arthritis. (See

         Treatment during the acute phase of disease consists of supportive care with rest and fluids. It may include
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">
          acetaminophen
         </a>
         , followed as needed by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). There is no specific antiviral therapy for acute chikungunya virus infection [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The acute illness typically lasts approximately 7 to 10 days, but acute disease requiring treatment may persist up to a month. In patients with clinical manifestations of acute chikungunya infection (eg, acute pain, fever, and arthralgia), we suggest
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">
          acetaminophen
         </a>
         (paracetamol; up to 500 to 1000 mg three times daily) or, once dengue is excluded and if acetaminophen is inadequate for symptom relief, NSAIDs (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9682" href="/z/d/drug information/9682.html" rel="external">
          naproxen
         </a>
         375 to 500 mg twice daily,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8547" href="/z/d/drug information/8547.html" rel="external">
          ibuprofen
         </a>
         400 to 800 mg three times daily, or another NSAID); any NSAID may be used.
        </p>
        <p>
         Typically, an NSAID should be tried for two weeks, and if it is ineffective, patients should be switched to a different NSAID. Both
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">
          acetaminophen
         </a>
         and NSAIDs should be used in the lowest dose and for the shortest duration necessary and avoided in patients with contraindications including known liver disease or elevated aminotransferases. There is no evidence that any one NSAID is superior to another or that in chikungunya infection, any specific NSAIDs should be avoided. Contraindications to NSAIDs and adverse effects of these agents (including renal, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular disease) are discussed in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7991.html" rel="external">
          "Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects"

          "Overview of COX-2 selective NSAIDs", section on 'Toxicities and possible toxicities'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In a patient who could have dengue virus infection,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">
          aspirin
         </a>
         and other NSAIDs should not be used until dengue has been excluded or until 14 days after symptom onset, with the patient afebrile ≥48 hours and no warning signs for severe dengue (severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, mucosal bleeding, pleural effusion or ascites, lethargy, enlarged liver, and increased hematocrit with decrease in platelet count). This is important given the risk of bleeding complications associated with dengue infection, which could be worsened by aspirin or other NSAIDs, and because of the potential risk of Reye syndrome in children treated with salicylates. Coinfection with dengue and chikungunya viruses can occur, so acute dengue infection needs to be excluded even if diagnosis of chikungunya infection is confirmed. The diagnosis of dengue fever, chikungunya fever, and related diagnoses are described separately. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with acute disease and severe pain who are unable to take
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">
          acetaminophen
         </a>
         and NSAIDs, or who do not respond adequately to these agents, we selectively use opioid analgesics (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10010" href="/z/d/drug information/10010.html" rel="external">
          tramadol
         </a>
         or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9729" href="/z/d/drug information/9729.html" rel="external">
          oxycodone
         </a>
         ) in the lowest dose for the shortest duration necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
         In general, systemic glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive medications should be avoided during acute infection. The safety of immunosuppression during acute infection is not well established, and there is concern that use of these agents may exacerbate the infection, especially during the viremic phase, which lasts approximately nine days [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with acute chikungunya fever, the rash resolves spontaneously and does not require treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most patients experience improvement in their symptoms within a month, regardless of therapy. Hospitalization is required infrequently, typically in infants, older adults, or immunocompromised patients with organ-threatening disease or severe complications related to an underlying medical condition.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our treatment approach is based upon reports from case series [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>

          6,7

         Treatment with daily NSAIDs and glucocorticoids (beginning in the second week of acute illness) has been associated with some symptomatic benefit during the first six weeks of illness. In one trial involving 120 patients with acute chikungunya fever and arthritis, patients randomly assigned to treatment for six weeks with either aceclofenac (an NSAID) monotherapy (200 mg daily), aceclofenac plus
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8541" href="/z/d/drug information/8541.html" rel="external">
          hydroxychloroquine

          prednisolone

         (10 mg daily), or aceclofenac plus HCQ plus

          prednisone
         </a>
         , all groups had showed benefit from therapy and had increased difficulty performing activities of daily living upon discontinuation of medications at week 6 [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Greater pain relief was observed among the patients who received prednisolone compared with the patients who did not receive prednisolone (an approximate reduction in pain scores from baseline of 75 versus 30 to 40 percent).

         Management of persistent or relapsed manifestations, particularly joint disease, depends upon the duration of the symptoms. Symptomatic control of articular manifestations with antiinflammatory drugs and analgesics is appropriate in the several months immediately following the acute phase of disease. More chronic disease (beyond three months after onset of infection) may require the use of DMARD therapy, such as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/z/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">
          methotrexate

         (MTX).
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients who present with severe post-acute or chronic symptoms, it is important to confirm chikungunya virus infection by establishing that patients are seropositive (positive anti-chikungunya virus immunoglobulin G [IgG]). Furthermore, other types of arthritis must be excluded (eg, seronegative spondyloarthritis [SpA], RA, or crystalline arthritis) before attributing symptoms to chikungunya virus. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3024.html" rel="external">

         In patients with joint symptoms persisting into the post-acute phase (between one month and up to the end of the third month after onset of infection), we suggest continued analgesia (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">
          acetaminophen

          'Acute disease'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         As in patients with acute symptoms, the minimal necessary dose and duration of medications is used. Periodically, an effort should be made to reduce and discontinue medications. Joint symptoms may gradually resolve over several months, and ongoing treatment may no longer be required.
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients whose symptoms are refractory to two to three two-week courses of different NSAIDs and who exhibit arthralgia or arthritis, tendinitis, or bursitis, especially those with evidence of severe synovitis and joint swelling and persistent elevation of inflammatory markers, we suggest systemic glucocorticoids (
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">
          prednisone
         </a>
         10 to 20 mg daily for five days, depending upon severity, tapered over 10 days). We give the lowest effective glucocorticoid dose possible with a short trial, which is sometimes sufficient; however, the individual response to therapy varies substantially; more severely affected patients may require higher doses (0.5 mg/kg daily) [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6

For patients on NSAIDs or glucocorticoids, periodic attempts (eg, monthly) should be made to taper therapy, given the natural history of gradual improvement over months in chronic chikungunya arthritis. Similarly, we discontinue MTX (or other DMARDs) within several months after patients respond. (See

         The dosing and absorption of MTX should be optimized, as in RA, by use of parenteral therapy or split oral doses (two doses 8 to 12 hours apart once weekly) in patients who do not respond to more than 15 mg once weekly by mouth. (See

This approach is based upon clinical experience and indirect evidence from the use of TNF inhibitors for the treatment of axial SpA, and patients should be closely monitored given the very limited safety data for the use of biologic DMARDs in the setting of this viral infection.

         (VLA1553, or Ixchiq) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2023. Approval was based on a double-blind, randomized trial based in the United States in which 4128 healthy adults (age ≥18 years) were randomly assigned to a single dose of vaccine or placebo [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27

         ]. Among the 266 patients who were assessed for immunogenicity, a seroprotective neutralizing antibody response occurred in 99 percent by 28 days after vaccination and persisted in 96 percent at 180 days. None of the placebo recipients developed a neutralizing antibody response. Response rates were similar among participants aged 18 to 64 years and those 65 years and older. Two serious adverse effects were attributed to the vaccine (myalgia and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion), both of which resolved. The most common adverse effects reported by all trial participants receiving the vaccine included headache (32 percent), fatigue (29 percent), myalgia (24 percent), arthralgia (18 percent), and fever (14 percent). Ongoing studies include assessing immunogenicity over five years and a double-blind, randomized trial among adolescents aged 12 to 18 in Brazil.

          Refractory arthritis
         </strong>
         – For patients not responsive to two to three two-week courses of NSAIDs who exhibit musculoskeletal symptoms, particularly patients with severe synovitis, joint swelling, or persistent elevation of inflammatory markers, we suggest systemic glucocorticoids (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). A typical initial dose is
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">
          prednisone
         </a>
         10 to 20 mg daily for five days, depending upon severity, then tapered off over the next 10 days. More severely affected patients may require higher doses (eg, prednisone 0.5 mg/kg daily), and some patients require up to one to two months of glucocorticoid therapy. We use the lowest effective dose possible. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Post-acute arthritis'

          Chronic arthritis

         – For patients with chronic arthritis (&gt;3 months after initial infection) who are unable to taper
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">
          prednisone
         </a>
         without recurrence of symptoms, we suggest treatment with a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD; eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/z/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">
          methotrexate

          sulfasalazine

          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). The choice of DMARD may be guided by the pattern of joint involvement. We generally use the same approach to dosing and monitoring these medications as in RA but make an effort to taper medications after four to six months once patients have been asymptomatic for at least six months.

          Polyarthritis resembling rheumatoid arthritis

          Axial arthritis

          Grade 2C
         </a>
