         Classic dermatomyositis (DM) is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy that most commonly presents with progressive, symmetric, proximal muscle weakness and a group of characteristic cutaneous findings. The cutaneous manifestations may also develop in the absence of detectable muscle disease and can persist after the successful treatment of DM-associated myositis.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to pathognomonic findings, such as Gottron's papules and the heliotrope eruption, DM often presents with intensely pruritic areas of confluent, violaceous erythema on the scalp, face, upper trunk, and upper extremities  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56879 graphicRef68649 graphicRef54230 graphicRef77822" href="/z/d/graphic/56879.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         ). The pruritus can be disabling.
        </p>
        <p>
         Skin lesions of DM are often resistant to photoprotection and topical therapies alone, necessitating the initiation of antimalarial drugs and/or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/z/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">
          methotrexate
         </a>
         . Patients who fail to respond to these interventions may require more aggressive immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies.
        </p>
        <p>
         The initial management of the cutaneous manifestations of DM will be discussed here  (

         ). The treatment of refractory cutaneous DM, as well as the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of the noncutaneous manifestations of DM and juvenile DM, are reviewed elsewhere.

         Skin changes associated with dermatomyositis (DM) include pathognomonic findings, such as Gottron's papules (pink-violaceous papules overlying interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints), Gottron's sign (macular, pink-violaceous erythema overlying other joints, such as the elbows or knees), and the heliotrope eruption (pink-violaceous erythema, with or without edema, involving the periorbital skin)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63383 graphicRef89229 graphicRef89230 graphicRef50909" href="/z/d/graphic/63383.html" rel="external">
          picture 2A-D
         </a>
         ). Pink-violaceous erythema of the scalp, V of the neck, shoulders, extensor surfaces of the upper extremities, upper chest, and upper back are additional characteristic findings  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56879 graphicRef68649 graphicRef54230 graphicRef77822" href="/z/d/graphic/56879.html" rel="external">
          picture 1A-D
         </a>
         ). Scale may or may not be present but is typically prominent on the scalp, where it may be accompanied by diffuse alopecia  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64903" href="/z/d/graphic/64903.html" rel="external">
          picture 1E
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with darker skin types, cutaneous lesions often exhibit a more violaceous hue and may also exhibit prominent hyperpigmentation  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79924" href="/z/d/graphic/79924.html" rel="external">
          picture 3
         </a>
         ). In patients with lighter skin types, cutaneous lesions tend to appear pink to red, although some will also demonstrate the characteristic violaceous hue. Additional examples of cutaneous manifestations of DM include poikiloderma, calcinosis cutis, prominent periungual telangiectasias, and cuticular hypertrophy. Panniculitis presenting as erythematous, tender, subcutaneous nodules on the lower or upper extremities is a rare manifestation [
         <a href="#rid1">

         The distribution of cutaneous lesions in DM suggests that photosensitivity may contribute to the development of skin lesions. Similar to findings in lupus erythematosus, significantly reduced minimal erythema doses (MEDs; the minimal irradiation dose required to elicit cutaneous erythema) to ultraviolet B (UVB) light have been detected in patients with DM [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. In one study in which 19 patients with DM were irradiated with UVB light, 9 (47 percent) exhibited reduced MEDs [

         Most patients with dermatomyositis (DM) exhibit both cutaneous disease and muscle weakness (classic DM). However, a subset of patients develops characteristic skin findings of DM in the absence of muscle symptoms. This group is often referred to as clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis (CADM) and consists of both patients who lack clinical findings of myositis, but have evidence for myositis on laboratory, radiologic, or electrophysiologic studies (hypomyopathic DM), and patients in whom all signs of muscle involvement are absent (amyopathic DM) [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. It is estimated that 9 to 13 percent of patients with CADM for more than six months eventually develop classic disease [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. Descriptions of the various presentations of cutaneous DM are reviewed below.

         Most patients with DM present with simultaneous cutaneous and muscle involvement, evidenced by proximal muscle weakness and diagnostic testing that reveals the presence of myositis. However, the onset of cutaneous disease can precede the appearance of myositis by up to several months in 30 percent of patients with classic DM and follows shortly after muscle involvement in 10 percent [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. The term "premyopathic dermatomyositis" is used to describe patients who have no clinical evidence for muscle disease but have had cutaneous manifestations of DM for less than six months.

         Historically, amyopathic DM was known as "dermatomyositis sine myositis." This variant is considered a distinct form of DM, rather than classic DM in which the onset of muscle involvement is delayed for a prolonged period. Amyopathic DM is diagnosed in patients who lack muscle weakness and have no laboratory or radiologic signs of myositis despite the presence of cutaneous findings consistent with DM for at least six months [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Of note, the use of immunosuppressive drugs for cutaneous DM for two consecutive months or longer within the first six months of skin disease may prevent the development of clinically significant myositis [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. In addition, the presence of drug-induced, DM-like cutaneous changes, such as can occur with

         , must be excluded.
        </p>
        <p>
         Approximately 10 to 20 percent of patients with DM seen in academic health centers have amyopathic disease [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. The proportion may be higher among patients referred to dermatologists; in one dermatology referral center, approximately 40 percent of patients with DM had the amyopathic variant [

         Similar to amyopathic DM, hypomyopathic DM presents with cutaneous findings consistent with DM and the absence of clinically appreciable muscle weakness for at least six months after the appearance of skin lesions [

          5

        </p>
        <p>
         Hypomyopathic DM is less common than amyopathic DM; among 281 patients with CADM in a systematic review, 37 (13 percent) had hypomyopathic disease and 197 (70 percent) had amyopathic DM.

         A diagnosis of cutaneous dermatomyositis (DM) is suggested by the constellation of characteristic cutaneous findings, muscle weakness, and laboratory evidence of myositis. However, in patients who present with ambiguous cutaneous findings or cutaneous findings that are suggestive of DM in the absence of clinical signs of muscle disease, a skin biopsy should be performed.
        </p>
        <p>
         The histopathologic findings in DM are variable but typically include an interface dermatitis characterized by vacuolization of basal keratinocytes, a lymphocytic infiltrate in the superficial dermis, and dermal mucin. The biopsy is useful for ruling out other disorders that may resemble DM, including seborrheic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, polymorphous light eruption, and papulosquamous disorders (such as lichen planus or psoriasis).

         The greatest challenge in the diagnosis of DM involves the distinction between amyopathic DM and acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (ACLE) or subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE), which, like DM, can present with photodistributed erythema and elevated antinuclear antibodies. The histopathologic findings of DM are indistinguishable from those of ACLE and SCLE. Of note, the intense pruritus often associated with DM usually does not occur in patients with ACLE or SCLE. In addition, the malar rash of ACLE traditionally spares the nasolabial folds, while the midfacial erythema of DM often involves these areas. (See

         In the patient who presents with cutaneous features that are consistent with DM, investigation for concomitant muscle disease should be performed. Due to the possibility of subsequent development of muscle disease, patients without myositis should be evaluated with a muscle examination and serum creatinine kinase and aldolase levels every two to three months [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8

         As in classic DM, adults with clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis (CADM) have an increased risk for pulmonary disease and internal malignancy. Thus, patients should be evaluated and followed for the presence of these disorders. In a systematic review that analyzed 291 adult patients with CADM, 36 (13 percent) developed interstitial lung disease, and 41 cases (14 percent) were found to be associated with internal malignancy [
         <a href="#rid5">

         The management of cutaneous manifestations of dermatomyositis (DM) can be challenging. Cutaneous manifestations are often more resistant to therapy than concomitant muscle involvement.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, the best therapeutic approach for the cutaneous manifestations of DM remains unclear. Data on therapies are limited and primarily restricted to case reports and retrospective studies, although randomized clinical trials are emerging in DM [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9-11
         </a>
         ]. Interpretation of the available literature is difficult because many studies have included patients with different variants of DM (eg, DM, polymyositis, and antisynthetase syndrome; both adult and juvenile DM; or both classic and amyopathic DM) or patients who are also receiving systemic glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive therapies for muscle disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         Moreover, the historical lack of standardized measures to assess responses to therapy has compromised the systematic interpretation of published literature. The consistent use of validated, objective measures of response to therapy, such as the Cutaneous Dermatomyositis Disease Area and Severity Index (CDASI), will be useful for interpreting the results of future studies [

        <p>
         Year-round daily photoprotection with a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 is recommended, and reapplication should occur every three to four hours [

         The relative safety of topical anti-inflammatory agents, including topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors, favors the use of these drugs in DM. However, most patients require combination therapy with a systemic agent. (See

         Topical corticosteroids are generally the preferred initial topical therapies for involvement on the scalp, trunk, and extremities. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are more expensive than most topical corticosteroids and are typically reserved for patients who do not improve with topical corticosteroids or for long-term topical therapy in areas prone to corticosteroid-induced cutaneous atrophy, such as the face.

         Clinical experience supports the use of topical corticosteroids for reducing the erythema and pruritus associated with DM [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. In general, topical corticosteroids are considered adjunctive as most patients will require systemic therapy to adequately treat their DM skin disease. High-potency (eg, group 1) topical corticosteroids are often used to treat the hands, extensor surfaces, and scalp, where the risk of corticosteroid-induced cutaneous atrophy is low, while lower-potency agents (eg, groups 6 to 7) are used for disease in areas that are more prone to atrophy, such as facial erythema and the heliotrope eruption  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402" href="/z/d/graphic/62402.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Application with occlusion (ie, coverage of the site of application by a bandage, gloves, or other dressing) increases the penetration and potency of topical corticosteroids, and the use of high-potency topical corticosteroids under occlusion may be beneficial for refractory, hyperkeratotic lesions, particularly those on the dorsal hands [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Topical corticosteroids are generally applied once daily when occlusion is used and twice daily in the absence of occlusion. Foam, spray, gel, oil, shampoo, or solution formulations may facilitate application on hairy areas, such as the scalp. Some experts have found topical
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9276" href="/z/d/drug information/9276.html" rel="external">
          clobetasol

        </p>
        <p>
         Improvement in erythema and pruritus from topical corticosteroid therapy is usually evident within two weeks, but continued treatment is often necessary to maintain the response. Upon achievement of a satisfactory response, the application frequency and potency of the topical corticosteroid can be gradually reduced, as tolerated. The inclusion of treatment-free periods (eg, two weeks on, two weeks off therapy) is suggested to reduce the risk of local and systemic adverse effects. When long-term, continuous use of a topical corticosteroid appears necessary, a topical calcineurin inhibitor can be initiated as a corticosteroid-sparing therapy. (See
         <a class="local">

         Intralesional corticosteroid therapy is occasionally used for refractory lesions or for scalp disease; however, intralesional therapy is often impractical given the extent of cutaneous disease [

         Topical corticosteroids can induce local cutaneous atrophy, particularly in the setting of long-term use of high-potency agents. In addition, systemic absorption can lead to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, particularly when used in patients with widespread disease. (See

         Most patients require systemic therapy to achieve satisfactory suppression of cutaneous disease. The goals of systemic treatment are to achieve resolution of pruritus and skin changes or to achieve a level of improvement in which mild, residual disease can be successfully managed with topical therapy. The clinical presentation influences the approach to treatment  (

         Improvement in skin disease may occur during treatment for extracutaneous manifestations of DM, such as during treatment with systemic glucocorticoids or

          methotrexate
         </a>
         , common initial treatments for muscle disease. Thus, in this population, the need for systemic therapy specifically for skin disease usually occurs when there is persistent activity of cutaneous DM despite adequate control of extracutaneous DM (eg, postmyopathic DM) and appropriate use of photoprotection and skin-directed therapies. The approach to the treatment of cutaneous manifestations in this population is similar to the approach for patients without extracutaneous DM. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5160.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         The type of extracutaneous involvement present may also influence treatment selection. For example,

          methotrexate

         Of note, continuation of systemic glucocorticoid therapy is not advised for the treatment of cutaneous DM when systemic glucocorticoids are no longer required for other manifestations of DM.

         Mild cutaneous DM is generally considered skin disease that involves a limited body surface area and/or causes minimal pruritus. With the exception of patients with very mild cutaneous DM, photoprotection, antipruritic agents, topical corticosteroids, and topical calcineurin inhibitors alone are generally insufficient for achieving adequate improvement in cutaneous DM; therefore, we typically begin systemic therapy immediately  (

Some experts increase the weekly dose by 2 to 5 mg per week (depending on the patient's age and health status) every one to two weeks until the target dose is reached, checking laboratory tests every two weeks.

          General principles
         </strong>
         – Dermatomyositis (DM) is an idiopathic inflammatory disorder for which cutaneous findings are a prominent feature. Inflammatory myopathy also frequently occurs in DM but may precede, follow, or remain absent in patients with cutaneous manifestations of the disease. In some patients, cutaneous findings may persist after the successful treatment of myositis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Overview of clinical features'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">
          'Classification of cutaneous dermatomyositis'

         <strong>
          Clinical features
         </strong>
         – Patients with DM often present with a pruritic, pink-violaceous, macular, and papular eruption that primarily affects the upper body  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77822 graphicRef64903" href="/z/d/graphic/77822.html" rel="external">
          picture 1D-E
         </a>
         ). Pruritus can be intense and may have significant effects on patient quality of life. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Overview of clinical features'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Management
         </strong>
         – Data on treatment options for the cutaneous manifestations of DM are limited. Photoprotection, management of pruritus, and topical therapy are important components of management for all patients. Most patients also require systemic therapy to achieve control of cutaneous DM  (

         ) (see

          Skin-directed therapy
         </strong>
         – For patients with cutaneous manifestations of DM, we suggest topical corticosteroids for initial topical therapy (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Topical calcineurin inhibitors are an additional option that may be useful for long-term treatment in skin areas at greatest risk for corticosteroid-induced skin atrophy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Skin-directed therapy'

          Associated extracutaneous involvement
         </strong>
         – Cutaneous DM may improve during treatment of other manifestations of DM, such as myositis. The need for systemic treatment specifically for cutaneous disease typically arises when active skin disease persists despite adequate control of other manifestations. (See
