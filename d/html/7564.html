         Breast cancer is the most frequent type of non-skin cancer and the most frequent cause of cancer death in women worldwide, and it is the second most frequent cause of cancer death in United States women. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/744.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         The majority of breast cancers in the United States are diagnosed as a result of an abnormal screening study, although a significant number are first brought to attention by the patient. Findings suggest that screening mammography both reduces the odds of dying of breast cancer and facilitates the use of early treatment. Breast cancer mortality has dropped dramatically since the 1980s, and both earlier detection through screening and improvements in breast cancer treatment are responsible for this reduction in mortality [

         Screening is of greatest value for individuals who are most likely to develop breast cancer and for whom early treatment is more effective than later treatment in reducing mortality. Thus, it is important to determine a person’s risk of developing breast cancer and use that information both to recommend the modality and frequency of screening and also to determine whether referrals are needed for genetic testing and for consideration of chemoprevention and/or prophylactic surgery. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/753.html" rel="external">

         The first step in determining a risk category is to assess for major risk factors to identify women at average risk, which is the category for most women, and to identify the smaller number of women at moderate or high risk of developing breast cancer. The risk categories are delineated according to the lifetime risk of being
         <strong>
          diagnosed
         </strong>
         with breast cancer (not the risk of dying due to breast cancer). Although there is no standardization or consensus about the exact percentages of lifetime risk of developing breast cancer within each risk category, generally they are as follows: average (less than 15 percent), moderate (approximately 15 to 20 percent), or high (greater than 20 percent) lifetime risk.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most women can be categorized based on history alone; for others, risk prediction models are available for use if needed. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical use of risk prediction models'

         Women who have none of these risk factors are usually considered at average risk [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. Most women are in this average-risk category, with an average lifetime risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer estimated at 12.4 percent. It is important to remind patients that this is the risk of being
         <strong>
          diagnosed
         </strong>
         with breast cancer,
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         of
         <strong>
          dying
         </strong>
         from breast cancer [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. The approach to screening for average-risk women is discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Average risk: Screening'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Risk prediction tools are available to stratify the patient’s risk (see
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical use of risk prediction models'
         </a>
         below). These risk tools take into account multiple concurrent risk factors (eg, family history of cancer, breast density, prior breast biopsy of atypical hyperplasia) and can help assess whether the patient has an elevated risk of breast cancer to determine if referral for more detailed risk analysis is appropriate. Certain tools may be more appropriate than others depending on the strength of the family history. Use of these tools can estimate the risk of developing breast cancer, which can then be used to categorize the risk as average, moderate, or high, as above. Many women who have a family history of breast cancer still have an average risk. Screening recommendations are in part dependent on this categorization. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Average risk: Screening'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="local">
          'Moderate risk: Screening'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="local">
          'High risk: Screening'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Women who have a confirmed or suspected genetic mutation known to increase the risk of breast cancer (eg,
         <em>
          BRCA1
         </em>
         or
         <em>
          BRCA2, PTEN, TP53
         </em>
         ), or a history of previous radiotherapy to the chest between 10 and 30 years of age are at high risk. As an example, women with a
         <em>
          BRCA1
         </em>
         mutation have a nearly 60 percent absolute risk of developing a breast cancer by the time they are 70 years old [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. However, because a
         <em>
          BRCA1
         </em>
         or
         <em>
          2
         </em>
         mutation is relatively rare in the general population (1 in 300 to 500),
         <em>
          BRCA1
         </em>
         or
         <em>
          BRCA2
         </em>
         mutation carriers account for only between 5 to 10 percent of all breast cancer cases [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. Information about hereditary breast cancer and indications for testing for genetic mutations are discussed elsewhere. (See

         Although there are other factors associated with an increased risk for developing breast cancer, such as use of exogenous estrogen, such features are not necessarily incorporated into the initial risk assessment to determine the appropriate screening approach. These and other risk factors for breast cancer are discussed in detail elsewhere  (

         There are multiple breast cancer risk models for more specific categorization of breast cancer risk; some models also calculate the risk of being a carrier of
         <em>

         and
         <em>

The models discussed below are available online and are easy to use in general office practice. Other models are not readily available to practicing clinicians.

         Clinical judgment must be factored in with the model-based predictions to determine when to refer for genetic counseling, when to refer for consideration of prophylactic therapies including chemoprevention or surgery, and what screening to recommend [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. This is because the accuracy of risk assessment tools at predicting whether an individual woman will develop breast cancer is only modest, partly because not all important risk factors have been identified, and partly because accurate stratification requires that risk factors be strongly predictive, whereas most risk factors for breast cancer are not very strong risk factors. Risk models are further limited by the fact that they have been created and validated using mostly White individuals. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/753.html" rel="external">
          "Genetic testing and management of individuals at risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes", section on 'Pretest genetic counseling'

        <p>
         In addition, risk estimates for other than White and Black individuals may not be as accurate using the risk models, because fewer data have been available and analyzed.
        </p>
        <p>
         The predictive value of the risk models is limited for an individual woman. For example, the sensitivity of the Gail model to identify women who will develop breast cancer is relatively low, reported as 28 to 44 percent [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27,28
         </a>
         ], using a five-year risk of 1.67 percent as the cut point between "high" and "low" risk. The specificity of the Gail model is also modest, reported as 66 to 88 percent [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27,28
         </a>
         ]. A figure showing the Gail model’s estimated risk of developing breast cancer for each of 80,000 women illustrates the limited ability of the Gail model to separate women into groups who will and will not develop breast cancer  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54619" href="/z/d/graphic/54619.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). In the figure, the curve showing the percent of women at each estimated-risk point who did develop breast cancer overlaps substantially with the curve showing the percent who did not develop breast cancer, and there is no point along the estimated-risk continuum that appears to be predictive to separate women who developed breast cancer from those who did not [

         The majority of women are at average risk (less than 15 percent lifetime risk) of developing breast cancer. In these women, age is the most important factor in the decision about when to be screened, because breast cancer incidence rises with age. Breast cancer incidence is quite low under the age of 40 years and then begins to rise as women age. The sensitivity and specificity of mammography are also age-dependent, being higher in older women than in younger women [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31,32
         </a>
         ]. Thus, in younger women, the risk of developing breast cancer over the succeeding 10 years is quite low, and the benefits of screening may not outweigh the costs, inconvenience, emotional stress, occasional direct physical harm, and potential for overtreatment as a result of screening [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         When counseling women on screening, we discuss the potential benefits and harms of breast cancer screening and encourage them to consider their own values and preferences. We support women in making a decision that is best for them. We tailor this discussion based on age. (See
         <a class="local">

         A number of expert groups have developed recommendations related to age to initiate screening  (

         <a href="#rid7">

         No screening guidelines recommend routine screening for average-risk women who are under 40 years of age. Among women younger than 40, the incidence of breast cancer is low, there are no randomized trials of breast cancer screening, and the performance characteristics of mammography are poor. In a review of results of 73,335 initial screening mammograms in women aged 35 to 39 years, the positive predictive value was only 1.3 percent [

         Many expert groups encourage shared decision-making for women in their 40s because of trade-offs between benefits and harms  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53551" href="/z/d/graphic/53551.html" rel="external">
          table 3

          figure 2
         </a>
         ); although, the United States Preventive Services Task Force revised preliminary 2023 recommendations suggest starting routine screening at age 40 (with final official recommendations currently pending) [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44,45
         </a>
         ] while both the American Cancer Society and European screening guidelines recommend starting screening at age 45 years [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,46
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         For average-risk women in their 40s, we raise the topic of screening for breast cancer to answer any questions the women might have. Raising the topic is different from strongly "recommending" screening; we engage in shared decision-making to encourage women to individualize the decision based on the benefits and harms of screening and their personal values and preferences (see
         <a class="local">
          'Shared medical decision-making'
         </a>
         below). For women who decide to initiate screening in their 40s, we typically suggest screening mammography every one to two years. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Frequency of screening with mammography'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Decisions on screening in this age group are highly dependent on a patient’s values and preferences. As an example, shared decision-making may result in a 40-year-old woman at average risk choosing to be screened if she has substantial concerns about breast cancer and is willing to accept the possibility of either a false-positive result or overdiagnosis and the resulting evaluation and treatment. On the other hand, a different 40-year-old woman may find that the information gathered during shared decision-making, including the frequency of false positives and overdiagnosis, provides her with a compelling reason to decide to defer mammography screening.
        </p>
        <p>
         The net benefits of breast cancer screening are less clear for women in their 40s. Although the benefits of screening women in their 40s appear favorable when considering the number of years of life potentially saved [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,37
         </a>
         ], for the individual average-risk woman, the absolute benefits of screening, when measured by number of breast cancer deaths prevented, are relatively low. A systematic review and meta-analysis of nine randomized trials showed a trend suggesting that for 10,000 women screened over 10 years, three deaths from breast cancer could be prevented [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. There was an 8 percent relative reduction of breast cancer mortality in women ages 39 to 49 years who were randomly assigned to mammographic screening, which did not achieve statistical significance (relative risk [RR] 0.92, 95% CI 0.75-1.02). Furthermore, in an analysis of the pooled results of four included trials, screening in women aged 39 to 49 years did not impact the risk of advanced breast cancer (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.74-1.37) [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. Similarly, the Age Trial in the United Kingdom suggested that breast cancer mortality at a mean follow-up of 10.7 years was decreased in the group of women who were invited for mammographic screening at age 40 years, compared with a usual care group, although the difference was not significant (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66-1.04) [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. Risk reduction for breast cancer mortality was greater, though still not statistically significant, when only those women who actually attended the first screening were compared with the control group (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.51-1.01). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Benefits'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Mammography is less sensitive in younger than older women. As an example, mammography is estimated to detect about 73 percent of breast cancers in women in their early 40s compared with 85 percent of breast cancers in women in their early 60s [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Given the modest benefits of screening in the 40- to 49-year-old age group, the harms can be relatively more consequential. In particular, false positives are more common in younger than older women. The harms of screening are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/87311.html" rel="external">
          "Screening for breast cancer: Evidence for effectiveness and harms", section on 'Harms from screening'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Expert guidelines vary in their recommendations about when to initiate screening and how frequently to screen average-risk women in the 40- to 49-year-old age group  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53551" href="/z/d/graphic/53551.html" rel="external">

          figure 2
         </a>
         ). For example, the American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends that routine mammography screening start at age 45 years based on the finding that the absolute risks of breast cancer occurrence and death for women ages 45 to 49 years are more similar to those for women ages 50 to 54 years than ages 40 to 44 years [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,33,50,51
         </a>
         ]. The ACS concluded that this similarity in risks of occurrence and mortality outweighs the higher false-positive mammography rates in women under age 50 years. The ACS recommends continuing annual screening until age 55 years, then decreasing to every two years [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51

         We suggest breast cancer screening with mammography for average-risk women aged 50 to 74 years, consistent with all major United States and international groups  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53551" href="/z/d/graphic/53551.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). We typically screen every one to two years depending on an individual woman’s risk factors and preference. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Frequency of screening with mammography'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Systematic reviews of multiple randomized trials over the past 50 years found that mammographic screening for women aged 50 to 70 years decreases the risk of breast cancer mortality; however, these results largely reflect trials that used older mammography imaging techniques and did not involve current breast cancer treatment protocols, a factor which may limit the predictive value of the results. Subsequently, a 2016 systematic review of screening mammography found fair-quality evidence that mammography decreases the RR for breast cancer mortality for women 50 to 59 years (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68-0.97, seven trials), with a more significant reduction for women 60 to 69 years (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54-0.83, five trials) [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. Screening mammography also reduced the risk of advanced breast cancer in women aged 50 years and older (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46-0.83). These benefits are generally thought to outweigh the harms of screening for average-risk women in this age group. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Benefits and harms of screening'
         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
         Most expert groups recommend routine screening with mammography for women at average risk who are age 50 or older, and most agree to continue screening through age 74 years (at least)  (

         We suggest that women age 75 years and older be offered screening only if their life expectancy is at least 10 years. For women in this age group who elect to be screened, mammography screening every two years is appropriate. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Frequency of screening with mammography'
         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
         There is not a clear upper age limit or ideal frequency for screening in healthy women, since the incidence of breast cancer remains high into the 80s, but the number of life-years saved will decrease with age [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. A framework that includes life expectancy, risk of dying of cancer, and the number of persons needed to screen over the remaining lifetime to prevent cancer death  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61593" href="/z/d/graphic/61593.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ) can be useful for guiding decision-making about screening older women for breast and other cancers [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55
         </a>
         ]. It is important to ensure that shared decision-making occurs, with information about both the potential harms and benefits of screening. Providing decision aids to women 75 years and older prior to their preventive visits may help them make more informed decisions [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56
         </a>
         ]. Most potential harms of screening occur relatively soon, whereas a potential benefit may occur up to 10 years later [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57
         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
         Screening mammography may be less beneficial in women age 75 years and older, although data from randomized trials for this age group are limited. In three observational studies, screening mammography was associated with a reduction in mortality due to breast cancer up to age 75 years but not among older women [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58-60
         </a>
         ]. Similarly, a cohort study of 2011 women 80 years and older found no difference in breast cancer rate, stage, or death between women who did and did not undergo screening mammography after age 80 years [
         <a href="#rid61">
          61
         </a>
         ]. However, observational studies may be biased, because older women who participate in screening are likely to be healthier at baseline than those who do not. Furthermore, while screening mammography in older women may result in lower-stage cancer at diagnosis, this may not lead to a decrease in mortality [
         <a href="#rid62">
          62-64
         </a>
         ]. This reflects several factors: a shorter life expectancy decreases the potential that screening will prolong life; the incidence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) increases with age, but it is not clear that treatment of DCIS affects mortality; and screening-detected cancers are usually lower-stage cancers than those detected clinically, due to lead-time bias [

         Several expert group recommendations do not explicitly state at what age breast cancer screening should stop. Some groups take into consideration life expectancy and consider stopping if life expectancy is under 5 or 10 years. Some groups use age 75 years as an age to consider whether or not to continue screening  (

         Mammography (digital 2D, digital breast tomosynthesis [3D], or film) is the primary modality for breast cancer screening in average-risk women. Other radiologic techniques, including ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are reserved for further evaluation of findings on mammography or for screening of women at a higher risk for breast cancer. Breast examination by the clinician or by the patient is not recommended as the only screening method, and it is controversial as to whether clinician breast examination (CBE) or patient breast self-examination (BSE) are beneficial as an adjunct to mammography. It is important to educate women about breast awareness and to encourage women to report any breast concerns.

         Among a variety of imaging modalities developed for breast cancer screening, mammography is the best-studied and the only imaging technique that has been shown to decrease breast cancer mortality as demonstrated in multiple randomized trials. However, it is important to know that, even in the best circumstances, mammography may miss up to 20 percent of underlying breast cancers [

        <p>
         Mammography is available as screen-film mammography, digital mammography, and digital breast tomosynthesis (3D mammography). The choice between them generally depends upon availability. The vast majority of locations in the United States and Europe use digital mammography, but digital breast tomosynthesis is rapidly replacing it as a primary screening modality [
         <a href="#rid66">
          66
         </a>
         ]. For women with dense breasts, digital mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis, if available, is preferred because of higher sensitivity; the sensitivity of mammography is inversely correlated with breast density, especially with older film techniques [
         <a href="#rid67">
          67

         Prior to the mammogram, it is helpful for women to know that compression of the breasts is transient but important to reduce motion artifact, improve image quality, and reduce the amount of radiation required. Individuals should also provide access to their prior mammograms for comparison if they go to a different mammography facility than they used previously.

         Screening ultrasound is not recommended for screening average-risk women. Ultrasound has not been evaluated as a screening strategy to reduce breast cancer mortality in the average-risk population, including among women with dense breasts. However, in the United States, some states mandate that ultrasound be mentioned to patients as a potential adjunct to mammography in women with increased breast density [

         We suggest that average-risk women

         perform BSE. Several studies have shown a lack of benefit and a higher rate of breast biopsies that showed benign disease with routine BSE. (See

         Women who nonetheless choose to perform BSE should receive careful instruction to differentiate normal tissue from suspicious lumps and understand that BSE is an adjunct, but not a substitute, for mammography. Women should be encouraged to bring abnormal breast findings promptly to the attention of their clinician.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although many expert groups do not encourage BSE, many do encourage educating women about breast self-awareness, general breast health, and the benefits and the limitations of BSE, as well as advising women to seek medical attention soon if they note concerning breast abnormalities [

         For average-risk women who wish to undergo screening, screening mammography can be performed every one to two years based on patient preference. Although data are limited and mixed on the optimal frequency for performing mammography, annual screening is associated with more harms and costs than screening every two years, and the difference in absolute benefits between annual and biennial screening is small [
         <a href="#rid78">
          78
         </a>
         ]. While some data suggest benefit for annual screening for some women (eg, premenopausal), this benefit needs to be weighed against the increased risk of false-positive mammographic findings and overdiagnosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Expert group recommendations for frequency of mammography screening vary between annual and every two years screening, depending mostly upon the patient’s age. Specific groups’ recommendations are summarized in the attached table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53551" href="/z/d/graphic/53551.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Randomized trials have found that screening every two years achieves reduction in breast cancer mortality. In a systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2016 update of breast cancer screening recommendations [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ], observational studies found that the 10-year cumulative false-positive mammography rates and biopsy rates were more favorable with biennial screening (42 and 5 percent, respectively) than with annual screening (61 and 7 percent, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid79">
          79
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The relative benefits of annual versus biennial screening may differ based on a woman’s hormonal status (eg, whether they are premenopausal or use menopausal hormone therapy); however, the evidence varies. A 2015 study from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium, which sampled United States mammography registries, evaluated the effectiveness of varied frequencies of screening among women who were later diagnosed with breast cancer [
         <a href="#rid80">
          80
         </a>
         ]. Among premenopausal women and postmenopausal women who used menopausal hormone therapy, biennial screening was associated with higher proportions of cancers that were less favorable (stage IIB or higher) compared with annual screening. However, in postmenopausal women who did not use menopausal hormone replacement therapy, tumor characteristics were similar for those screened annually or biennially. By contrast, an earlier (2013) Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium study, using age to stratify women, found that hormonal status did not alter the relative benefit of mammography: screening biennially versus annually for women aged 50 to 74 years did not increase the risk of tumors with advanced stage or large size, regardless of the women's breast density or hormone therapy use [
         <a href="#rid81">
          81
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Breast density may also be associated with benefits that vary with different screening frequencies. As an example, in the same Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium study, among women 50 to 74 years of age with scattered fibroglandular or fatty breasts, biennial or triennial mammography screening lowered false-positive results compared with annual screening [
         <a href="#rid81">
          81
         </a>
         ]. However, for younger women with dense breasts, frequency of mammography screening did impact the risk of advanced-stage cancer, which was increased for women aged 40 to 49 years with dense breasts who had biennial, compared with annual, mammograms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Intervals of more than two years between screenings might be appropriate in certain age groups. A 2016 modeling study suggests that annual screening for higher-risk women with high breast density may be indicated, and triennial screening may be the preferred approach for patients aged 50 years and older with average risk for breast cancer and low breast density [
         <a href="#rid82">
          82

         For women with moderate risk (ie, approximately 15 to 20 percent lifetime risk of breast cancer), including most women who have a family history of breast cancer in a first-degree relative but do not have a known genetic syndrome, we suggest that the same screening approach, including the age to begin mammography screening, and frequency of screening be used as for women at average risk. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         While some have suggested that screening be initiated at an earlier age if a first-degree relative had premenopausal breast cancer, there are few high-quality data supporting this approach in the absence of a known genetic syndrome. As an example, in a case-control study of breast cancer screening among United States women aged 40 to 65 years, there was only a non-statistical trend towards greater protection in women at moderately increased compared with average breast cancer risk [

        <p>
         Many experts suggest that in women at moderate risk, the decision to undergo supplemental screening (with either magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or ultrasound in addition to mammography) should be determined after a discussion with the patient regarding personal preferences for known risks versus possible benefits, availability, and insurance coverage. Supplemental screening ultrasound may be more widely accessible and less expensive than supplemental MRI; however, neither modality is routinely covered by insurance for this risk category in most US states. We do not routinely suggest these adjunctive modalities for women at moderate risk, but if women are interested in them, we encourage them to engage in a shared decision-making discussion with their clinician. (See
         <a class="local">

         High-risk patients consist of those who have known

         or other susceptibility genes, those with a history of chest radiation prior to the age of 30, those with certain breast conditions such as atypical hyperplasia, and those with a calculated lifetime risk of developing breast cancer of greater than 20 percent. The approach to those with a known breast cancer susceptibility gene, prior chest radiation is discussed, or atypical hyperplasia is elsewhere (See

        <p>
         For those with a calculated lifetime risk of breast cancer exceeding 20 percent, we suggest supplemental screening with MRI in addition to mammography, consistent with guidelines from major groups [
         <a href="#rid73">
          73,85
         </a>
         ]. A common approach is to perform each modality annually, staggered by six months  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54270" href="/z/d/graphic/54270.html" rel="external">
          table 5
         </a>
         ), although the optimal screening interval is not determined and other centers may perform both examinations simultaneously. We also refer such patients for genetic counseling, if not already done, and to a high-risk clinic for consideration of risk reduction treatment (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/756.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The rationale for supplemental MRI is its higher sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer in high-risk populations than mammography or ultrasound; therefore, it is used for screening women who are at significantly high risk for the development of breast cancer  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82565" href="/z/d/graphic/82565.html" rel="external">

         ) [
         <a href="#rid86">
          86-96
         </a>
         ]. However, despite evidence that MRI can detect smaller cancers and more node-negative malignancies in high-risk women than other imaging modalities, there is no evidence for a reduction in mortality or improved disease-free survival from screening with MRI [
         <a href="#rid92">
          92
         </a>
         ]. Another drawback of supplemental MRI screening is potential false-positives.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a randomized trial of 1355 women with a cumulative lifetime breast cancer risk of at least 20 percent due to familial predisposition, none of whom had a personal history of breast cancer or a mutation in
         <em>
          BRCA 1/2
         </em>
         or tumor protein p53 (
         <em>
          TP53
         </em>
         ), more breast cancers were detected with annual MRI plus every-two-years mammography than with annual mammography (5.9 versus 2.2 percent, at a median follow-up of 5.2 years) [
         <a href="#rid97">
          97
         </a>
         ]. Invasive cancers were smaller and less frequently node positive in the MRI group. However, the incidence of false positives was also higher in the MRI group (16 versus 9 percent, with mammography only). Given the balance of risks and benefits with supplemental MRI, we offer it those at high risk for breast cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the role of mammography in patients undergoing MRI screening has been questioned [
         <a href="#rid94">
          94,95
         </a>
         ], mammography may detect microcalcifications that are not seen MRI [
         <a href="#rid98">

         Patients who have had breast tissue augmentation with implants for benign reasons warrant routine screening mammography to evaluate the native breast tissue; indications and frequency for screening are the same as in women without implants. However, the implant contents are radiopaque and can obscure small lesions. In addition, the presence of the implant makes it harder to evaluate all parts of the breast and may make compression challenging [
         <a href="#rid99">
          99

         ]. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Standard imaging technique in women with breast implants involves four views, rather than the usual two views per breast. Positioning is important to include as much breast tissue as possible by pushing the implant out of view. Standard craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) projections of each breast are obtained with the implant included  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58154" href="/z/d/graphic/58154.html" rel="external">
          image 2
         </a>
         ). These views permit evaluation of the implant as well as the deep breast tissues adjacent to the implant. The two views are repeated after the implant is displaced back against the chest wall and the breast tissue is pulled forward [
         <a href="#rid100">
          100
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The type of implant, as well as its location (prepectoral or retroglandular versus retropectoral or subpectoral) plays a role in the ease of imaging; breasts with implants placed behind the pectoralis muscle (retropectoral or subpectoral) are easier to position.

         Physical examination is the method of choice in monitoring myocutaneous (eg, transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous [TRAM] or deep inferior epigastric perforator [DIEP] flap) breast reconstructions. However, it can be difficult to distinguish a palpable area of fat necrosis from recurrent cancer, and diagnostic mammography may be indicated for palpable findings in women with TRAM or DIEP reconstructions [

         Breast biopsies are performed in approximately 1 to 2 percent of mammographic screenings in the United States [
         <a href="#rid104">
          104

         <a href="#rid105">
          105
         </a>
         ]. A history of a prior breast biopsy for benign disease was associated with reduced specificity (odds ratio [OR] 0.75, 95% CI 0.79-0.92) and a lower positive predictive value for a referral for breast biopsy (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79-0.92) in subsequent screening mammograms, compared with women who had no prior biopsy history. This may reflect characteristics of the breast tissue (eg, more fibrocystic) that led to the initial biopsy, tissue effects of the biopsy itself, or differing thresholds for mammographic interpretation when a prior biopsy history is provided.

         Dense breasts are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer and can decrease the sensitivity of mammography for small lesions. Nevertheless, we do not alter our general approach to age- and risk-based screening based on breast density. However, for women with dense breasts, we do prefer digital mammography over film mammography, due to greater sensitivity [
         <a href="#rid108">
          108

        </p>
        <p>
         We suggest that most women with dense breasts and no additional risk factors for breast cancer
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         undergo supplemental screening with other imaging modalities given insufficient evidence demonstrating benefit [

          8,109
         </a>
         ]. Nevertheless, some women with dense breasts may reasonably opt to have supplemental screening. For average-risk women who choose to undergo supplemental screening, ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are options but will likely require out-of-pocket payments (as insurance usually does not cover supplemental screening for average-risk women).

         <a href="#rid119">
          119
         </a>
         ], new research suggests that there should be no delay in scheduling routine screening based on COVID-19 vaccine timing given the very low risk of malignant findings in asymptomatic patients with unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy following recent COVID-19 vaccination and the potential negative effects of delayed screening on breast cancer morbidity and mortality [
         <a href="#rid120">
          120,121
         </a>
         ]. Instead, axillary adenopathy, if detected on screening, will be interpreted by radiologists in the context of patient risk factors. The European Society of Breast Imaging recommends that radiologists classify imaging-detected unilateral lymphadenopathy on the same side as recent COVID-19 vaccination (within 12 weeks) in patients without a breast cancer history and no suspicious breast findings as a benign finding (BI-RADS 2) with no further work-up to be recommended [

         The primary benefit of screening with mammography is a decrease in breast cancer mortality. In a 2015 systematic review and a 2012 meta-analysis that each included multiple randomized trials that involved over 600,000 women from several countries [
         <a href="#rid122">
          122-129
         </a>
         ], screening mammography was estimated to reduce the odds of dying of breast cancer by approximately 20 percent [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33,130
         </a>
         ]. (See

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The absolute benefit of screening depends on the patient’s age and is lower in younger women because they have a lower baseline risk of cancer. A 2016 systematic review analyzed risk reduction by age: with at least 11 years of follow-up, the pooled relative risk for breast cancer mortality was 0.92 (95% CI 0.75-1.02) for women 39 to 49 years of age, 0.86 (0.68-0.97) for women 50 to 59 years of age, and 0.67 (0.54-0.83) for women 60 to 69 years of age [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. Risk reduction by age is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Age 40 to 49 years'
         </a>

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Confidence in the magnitude of the breast cancer mortality reduction based on these aggregated trial results is reduced for several reasons: the trials were performed in the setting of older cancer therapies, so the value of screening to find and treat lesions earlier may be reduced, due to the greater efficacy of currently available treatment; some trials did not blind outcome assessors, and thus results may have been biased in favor of screening; and most trials predated advances in breast imaging that would improve the sensitivity of screening. Nevertheless, observational studies continue to support a risk reduction in breast cancer mortality with screening mammography. These studies are discussed elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/87311.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Data are limited as to how much of the reduction in mortality seen over time is attributable to advances in imaging techniques for screening and how much is due to improved effectiveness of therapy. In one study of simulation models, about one-third of the decrease in breast cancer mortality in 2012 was attributable to screening mammography, with the balance attributed to treatment [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The contribution of screening mammography to mortality reduction varied among different molecular subtypes of breast cancer.

          Overdiagnosis
         </strong>
         – Overdiagnosis occurs when screening leads to identification of breast cancer that would not have caused clinical consequences in a woman's lifetime had it not been detected. Estimates for overdiagnosis in breast cancer range from 10 percent or less to over 50 percent of all women diagnosed with breast cancer. Variation in these estimates is likely related to differences in definition (eg, whether ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS] is included and what age group is studied) and approaches used for study design, measurement, and estimation [
         <a href="#rid132">
          132-134
         </a>
         ]. In the United States, based on Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) population-based data, about one in seven cases of screen-detected cancers is overdiagnosed [
         <a href="#rid135">
          135
         </a>
         ]. (See

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Several studies have suggested that many cancers, especially those confined to the mammary ducts (ie, DCIS), are biologically insignificant and would never become clinically evident in the patient's lifetime [
         <a href="#rid136">
          136-138
         </a>
         ]. It is not possible using imaging to distinguish biologically insignificant cancers from those that will proceed to grow, metastasize, and lead to the patient's death at this time. Thus, almost all patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer after abnormal imaging, regardless of its stage, receive some sort of local therapy (eg, surgery, with or without radiation therapy) and potentially systemic therapy as well. Thus, the overdiagnosis of what may be biologically insignificant cancers leads to substantial treatment that is potentially unnecessary.

          False-positive mammogram result
         </strong>
         – For each woman whose life is saved by mammography, many women will experience false-positive mammograms. The estimated risk of a false positive varies based on a number of factors, including the woman’s age and breast density  (

         <a href="#rid83">
          83
         </a>
         ]. Factors that increase the possibility of a false-positive mammogram include young age, increased breast density, family or personal history of breast cancer, prior breast biopsies, current estrogen use, three years between screenings, lack of comparison to prior mammograms, and an individual radiologist’s tendency to over-read [
         <a href="#rid139">
          139-141
         </a>

         <a href="#rid142">
          142
         </a>
         ], and after a decade of annual screening about 50 percent of women have experienced a false positive. The false-positive rate is much lower in other countries [

         – There are some screening mammography examinations that are interpreted as negative, but a cancer was present; these cancers (also called interval cancers) may present clinically after that screening examination but prior to the next scheduled screening. These cancers were either missed by the radiologist or were not mammographically visible even on retrospective review [

          Radiation
         </strong>
         – Although radiation can increase the risk of breast cancer, radiation from screening mammography is low enough that, for average-risk women over age 40 years, the benefits of screening outweigh the risks of radiation from mammography. (See

         A woman may, by choosing to be screened, avert death from breast cancer or gain quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). However, gains in QALY from screening are small compared with the larger declines in QALY experienced by all women as they age [

          Screening strategies for breast cancer based on risk
         </strong>
         – Screening is of greatest value for those patients most likely to develop breast cancer and for whom early treatment is more effective than later treatment in reducing mortality. Thus, screening strategies differ based on the estimated risk of breast cancer. (See

          Assessment of risk
         </strong>
         – The vast majority of women are at average risk (less than 15 percent lifetime risk) of developing breast cancer. Even women who have some risk factors for breast cancer are still likely to be at average risk, although an established risk assessment tool can be helpful to estimate risk and inform the need for additional testing. Women who have a personal history of breast, ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer, certain genetic mutations (eg,
         <em>
          BRCA1
         </em>
         or
         <em>
          BRCA2, TP53
         </em>
         ), or a history of previous radiotherapy to the chest between ages 10 and 30 years are at high risk for developing breast cancer. (See

          Age-based approach for average-risk women

         – In average-risk women, age is the most important factor in deciding when to be screened, because breast cancer incidence rises with age  (

         For women under age 40 years, screening mammography is not warranted since the incidence of breast cancer is low and the performance characteristics of mammography are lower. (See

         For women aged 40 to 49 years, we raise the topic of screening and individualize the decision based on patient preferences and values. A woman may opt for screening if she has substantial concerns about breast cancer risk and accepts the possibility of a false-positive result or overdiagnosis and the resulting evaluation and treatment. Another woman may find that the frequency of false positives and overdiagnosis provides a compelling reason to defer screening. Although screening in the 40s is favorable when considering the number of years of life potentially saved, for an average-risk woman, the number of breast cancer deaths prevented is relatively low.

          Mammography every one to two years recommended
         </strong>
         – For average-risk women who decide to be screened, we recommend screening with mammography rather than other modalities (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">
          Grade 1B
         </a>
         ). While ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are useful for diagnostic evaluation of abnormal findings noted on screening mammography, we do not use these modalities to screen average-risk women. We suggest a mammography screening interval of every one to two years based upon the preference of the woman (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Although data are limited and evidence mixed on the optimal frequency for performing screening mammography, annual screening is associated with more harms and costs than screening every two years, and the difference in absolute benefits between annual and biennial screening is small. (See
         <a class="local">

          Limited value of a screening clinical breast examination (CBE) or breast self-examination (BSE) in average-risk women

         </a>
         ) as part of screening of average-risk women. Trials evaluating CBE (with or without mammography) and BSE have not demonstrated efficacy in early cancer detection or improved outcomes. Screening CBE may be helpful, however, in resource-limited settings where there is limited imaging availability. Women should be educated about breast health awareness. (See

          Screening approach for moderate-risk women
         </strong>
         – Moderate-risk women (approximately 15 to 20 percent lifetime breast cancer risk) include most women with breast cancer in a first-degree relative but without a known genetic syndrome. For women with moderate risk, we suggest the same screening approach as for average-risk women (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Some practitioners screen earlier if the first-degree relative had premenopausal breast cancer, although there are no data showing a mortality benefit for these women. For women who wish supplemental screening with ultrasound or MRI, for which data are inconclusive, we counsel that harms may outweigh benefits of supplemental screening and that there will likely be out-of-pocket costs, as insurance usually does not cover these tests for moderate-risk women.

         COVID-19 vaccination with mRNA vaccines may cause transient axillary lymphadenopathy, impacting the interpretation of mammography. Although initial recommendations suggested scheduling screening mammography prior to a dose of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, or four to six weeks after a dose, newer research suggests that there should be no delay based on COVID vaccine timing. Instead, axillary adenopathy, if detected on screening, will be interpreted by radiologists in the context of patient risk factors. (See

          Shared decision-making
         </strong>
         – Shared decision-making should be used in discussing breast cancer screening. Decision aids can be helpful when discussing the patient’s risk of developing breast cancer, the potential benefits and harms of screening, and the patient’s preferences and values. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Benefits and harms of screening'

         The benefit of screening with mammography is a decrease in breast cancer mortality. However, the absolute benefit is lower in younger women who have a lower baseline risk of cancer.

         Harms associated with breast cancer screening include the potential for false-negative and false-positive findings, patient anxiety, overdiagnosis, and unnecessary treatment and its associated risks.
