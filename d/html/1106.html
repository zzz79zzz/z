         The location most frequently affected by carotid atherosclerosis is the carotid bifurcation, often with extension into the proximal internal carotid artery (ie, the origin). Atherosclerosis of the internal carotid artery at the bifurcation accounts for 10 to 12 percent of all ischemic strokes [

         Symptomatic extracranial carotid atherosclerotic disease is defined as neurologic symptoms that are sudden in onset and referable to the appropriate internal carotid artery distribution (ipsilateral to significant carotid atherosclerotic pathology), including one or more transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) characterized by focal neurologic dysfunction or transient monocular blindness, or one or more ischemic strokes [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The definition is contingent on the occurrence of carotid symptoms within the previous six months [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. Remote carotid symptoms should not be considered as indicative of "symptomatic" carotid disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         Vertigo and syncope are not generally caused by unilateral carotid stenosis. Therefore, patients with these symptoms in isolation should be considered as asymptomatic with regard to carotid disease even if they are found to have carotid artery stenosis.

         Progression of atheromatous plaque at the carotid bifurcation results in luminal narrowing, often accompanied by ulceration. This process can lead to ischemic stroke or TIA from embolization, thrombosis, or reduced brain perfusion (more likely in the setting of bilateral disease).

          Location
         </strong>
         – In nearly all cases, symptomatic atherosclerosis of the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) occurs at its origin or just distal to the bifurcation of the common carotid artery  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63286" href="/z/d/graphic/63286.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ) and typically involves the carotid bulb. The benefit of carotid endarterectomy and carotid stenting for this type of ICA stenosis was established by the randomized trials described below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Patients appropriate for CEA'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="local">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Common carotid artery stenosis located proximal to the carotid bulb is a less frequent cause of stroke or TIA and is less well studied. Atherosclerosis of the common carotid most often occurs at the origin of the artery. Common carotid artery lesions that do not involve the origin can occur as a late complication of radiation treatment. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Common carotid artery lesions'

         <strong>
          Lesion severity
         </strong>
         – The benefit of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for patients with symptomatic carotid disease was established by clinical trials designed in the 1980s that used conventional contrast arteriography to determine the degree of internal carotid stenosis. Lesion severity is generally graded as mild (&lt;50 percent), moderate (50 to 69 percent), severe (70 to 99 percent), near occlusion (eg, with severe long segment luminal narrowing from bifurcation to skull base, which is sometimes referred to as a "string sign" on angiographic imaging), and occlusion. Estimates of percent stenosis differ depending upon the definition used and imaging modality.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Comparison of the two major trials of endarterectomy, the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST), requires an understanding of how carotid artery stenosis was measured since these studies used different methodologies  (

          NASCET
         </strong>
         measured the residual lumen diameter at the most stenotic portion of the vessel and compared this with the lumen diameter in the unaffected internal carotid artery segment distal to the stenosis [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         <strong>
          ECST
         </strong>
         measured the lumen diameter at the most stenotic portion of the vessel, but compared this with the estimated diameter at the carotid bulb [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The maximum stenosis is generally in the carotid bulb, a wider portion of the artery than the distal segment. As a result, a given stenosis would be more severe using the ECST method compared with that of NASCET. ECST methodology also requires an estimation of the true bulb diameter, which increases the risk of interobserver variability. Despite these differences, the results of different methods have a nearly linear relationship to each other and provide data of similar prognostic value. A 50 percent stenosis with the NASCET method is equivalent to a 65 percent stenosis for the ECST method, while a 70 percent stenosis with the NASCET method is equivalent to an 82 percent stenosis for the ECST method.

          Imaging modality
         </strong>
         – Catheter-based contrast digital subtraction arteriography (DSA) has been considered the gold standard for measuring the severity of internal carotid artery stenosis. However, noninvasive vascular imaging studies including carotid duplex ultrasound (CDUS), magnetic resonance (MR) angiography, and computed tomographic (CT) angiography are preferred in clinical practice because DSA is invasive and associated with a risk of stroke and other complications. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1085.html" rel="external">
          "Neuroimaging of acute stroke", section on 'Digital subtraction angiography'

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Duplex ultrasound, CT angiography, and MR angiography can all be used to identify symptomatic carotid stenosis in patients who could benefit from carotid revascularization with CEA or carotid artery stenting (CAS). Some experts note that MR angiography is less accurate for evaluating a moderate stenosis, particularly when performed without contrast [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Additionally, CT and MR angiography may provide additional anatomic data that could be useful for surgical planning. For patients who undergo CAS, DSA will necessarily be performed as a part of the procedure. Comparisons of the various imaging studies for the evaluation of carotid stenosis are discussed separately.

         At the time when most of the major carotid endarterectomy (CEA) trials were underway (the late 1980s to mid-1990s), the best medical therapy for carotid disease was generally considered to be antiplatelet treatment with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">
          aspirin
         </a>
         . Since the completion of these trials, medical regimens emerged that reduced the risk of stroke. These therapies include aggressive treatment with statins, antiplatelet agents, and antihypertensive agents.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is unknown if medical therapies that were introduced after the major trials would change the relative risk reduction afforded by CEA for carotid disease, but they might increase the number of patients needed to treat to prevent one stroke.

         Treatment of symptomatic extracranial carotid atherosclerotic disease includes medical management and may or may not include carotid revascularization. A decision to offer carotid revascularization for extracranial internal carotid artery stenosis weighs the baseline risk of stroke (see

          'Baseline risk of stroke'

         In general, for patients with severe (70 to 99 percent) or moderate (50 to 69 percent) symptomatic internal carotid stenosis, the benefits of carotid revascularization for stroke risk reduction outweigh the risks, particularly when performed within two weeks of the presenting event. However, the benefit varies based upon the degree of stenosis. The benefit for females may be less than for males.

         – For patients with recently symptomatic carotid stenosis of 50 to 69 percent who have a life expectancy of at least three years, we suggest carotid revascularization in addition to medical management, when revascularization can be done within two weeks of symptom onset. Beyond two weeks from symptom onset, the benefit is less certain overall, and females, in particular, may not benefit from revascularization beyond two weeks from symptom onset.

         Carotid revascularization options include carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS). CEA is established as safe and effective by randomized controlled trials for reducing the risk of ischemic stroke in symptomatic patients with carotid artery atherosclerosis. CAS may be useful in selected patients but with risks that differ depending on the technique selected. The choice between CEA and CAS also depends upon the patient's medical comorbidities and the anatomic characteristics of the symptomatic carotid.
        </p>
        <p>
         Regardless of technique, the perioperative risk of stroke and death for the surgeon or center should be &lt;6 percent to provide an overall benefit to the patient. Combined morbidity and mortality that exceeds 6 percent for patients with symptomatic stenosis could eliminate the benefit gained from CEA or CAS [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16-18
         </a>
         ]. Thus, it is important for individual surgeons and stroke centers to track their outcomes and to be transparent about this information.

         CEA is performed through a neck incision. An arteriotomy is performed at the carotid bifurcation (longitudinal or transverse depending on the technique), and the carotid plaque is then freed and removed and the arteriotomy closed either primarily (direct suture repair) or using a carotid patch. CEA can be performed using local/regional anesthesia or general anesthesia. The choice of anesthesia is generally determined by surgeon and anesthesiologist skill and preference, as well as patient characteristics and preference. The preoperative evaluation, surgical technique, and complications of CEA are reviewed in detail separately. (See

          Transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR)
         </strong>
         – TCAR uses a hybrid surgical approach that accesses the carotid artery through a small transverse neck incision, which avoids passing wire/catheters across the aortic arch. (See

        <p>
         In data drawn largely from registries and case series, subgroups suggested to have tolerated CAS with relative safety included patients with prior neck irradiation, high cervical carotid bifurcations, and those with complete occlusion of the contralateral internal carotid artery. For high-risk patients (anatomic and physiologic), TCAR may be preferable to TF-CAS and CEA [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20,21
         </a>
         ].
         <strong>
         </strong>
         Further evidence from large controlled clinical trials is needed before drawing firm conclusions about the safety and effectiveness of CAS in these various subgroups. Factors that may affect periprocedural outcomes of CAS are discussed elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1104.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of carotid artery stenting", section on 'Risk assessment'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In the absence of the conditions listed above, CEA remains the preferred treatment for most patients with symptomatic internal carotid atherosclerosis (see
         <a class="local">
          'Patients appropriate for CEA'
         </a>
         above). This preference for CEA is in general agreement with major society guidelines [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,20
         </a>
         ]. If CAS is considered, the periprocedural risk of stroke and death with CAS for the operator or center should be &lt;6 percent. Note that older patients have worse outcomes with transfemoral CAS compared with CEA (see
         <a class="local">
          'Older age and worse outcomes with CAS'
         </a>
         below). For patients age 70 years and older in all these subgroups, the benefit-to-risk ratio of CAS is unknown.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients undergoing CAS are generally treated with a dual antiplatelet regimen (

        <p>
         In a pooled analysis of patient-level data from the ECST, NASCET, and VA trials, CEA was beneficial for patients with 70 to 99 percent symptomatic stenosis (but not near occlusion) [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,25
         </a>
         ]. Prerandomization carotid angiograms from ECST were reassessed by the NASCET method, and outcomes were standardized to achieve comparability among the trials. To prevent one event at five years for ipsilateral carotid territory ischemic stroke and operative stroke or death, the number needed to treat (NNT) was 6 (95% CI 5-9) and the absolute risk reduction (ARR) was approximately 17 percent; to prevent one event at five years for disabling or fatal ipsilateral ischemic or operative stroke and operative death, the NNT was 14 (95% CI 8-35) and the ARR was approximately 7 percent.

        <p>
         CEA was also beneficial for patients with 50 to 69 percent symptomatic stenosis. The NNT to prevent any stroke or operative death at five years was 13 (95% CI 8-28, ARR approximately 7.7 percent), while the NNT to prevent any ipsilateral carotid territory ischemic stroke or operative stroke or death at five years was 22 (95% CI 12-80, ARR approximately 4.5 percent) [

          14,25
         </a>

          4

         Data from randomized controlled trials suggest that CAS and CEA achieve similar long-term benefit for patients with symptomatic carotid occlusive disease. However, the periprocedural (30-day) stroke or death rate is greater with TF-CAS than with CEA, and while the risks of CAS and CEA are similar in the postprocedural period, the combined periprocedural and postprocedural risks still favor CEA. Note that CAS trials have involved predominantly transfemoral carotid artery stenting (TF-CAS). Whether TCAR reduces the risk of complications is unknown. Comparisons of the approaches to CAS are discussed separately. (See

         Recommendations for treating symptomatic carotid stenosis are largely based upon findings of major randomized trials (eg, the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial [NASCET], the European Carotid Surgery Trial [ECST]), but remain predicated on carotid endarterectomy (CEA) providing a greater benefit to the patient in terms of stroke reduction compared with the risk of performing the procedure. The baseline risk of stroke in symptomatic patients is reviewed above. (See

         In addition to the perioperative complication rate and the timing of surgery (see

          'Timing of revascularization'
         </a>
         below), a number of additional factors appear to impact benefit and risk of CEA in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis. These include age, sex, retinal versus hemispheric ischemia, and the presence of contralateral carotid stenosis or occlusion.

         Since any benefit of carotid revascularization (ie, endarterectomy and stenting) is dependent upon the absolute risk of adverse outcome with or without treatment, it is useful to systematically consider the risks and benefits of revascularization based on individual patient characteristics whenever possible [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. A risk model for patients with recently symptomatic carotid stenosis was derived from the ECST trial data and validated by showing that the predicted stroke risk for patients assigned to medical treatment in the NASCET trial was close to the observed risk [

        </p>

         While the model does not account for the risk and benefit of surgery, it may be useful for assessment of baseline stroke risk and patient selection for carotid revascularization.

         The baseline ipsilateral stroke risk for patients with recently symptomatic extracranial carotid atherosclerotic disease is calculated based upon the following factors [

However, if the same patient presents with a cerebral (hemispheric) TIA and time less than two weeks since the last symptomatic event, the predicted absolute five-year stroke risk increases to 35 to 40 percent.

         Older adult patients have worse outcomes with transfemoral carotid artery stenting (TF-CAS) compared with CEA, even though older age was originally proposed to be associated with high risk for surgery and therefore a potential indication for CAS rather than CEA.
        </p>
        <p>
         This point is illustrated by the findings of a 2016 meta-analysis that evaluated pooled patient-level data from subjects with symptomatic carotid disease in the EVA-3S, SPACE, ICSS, and CREST trials [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. For patients assigned to TF-CAS, the overall periprocedural risk of stroke and death increased with age. Compared with patients aged &lt;60 years, the risk was higher for patients aged 65 to 69 years (hazard ratio [HR] 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-4.1), 70 to 74 years (HR 4, 95% CI 2.2-7.3), 75 to 79 years (HR 3.9, 95% CI 2.1-7.3), and ≥80 years (HR 4.2, 95% CI 2.2-7.8). For patients assigned to CEA, the periprocedural risk was similar for these age groups. Compared with CEA, the periprocedural risk of stroke and death with TF-CAS was increased for patients aged 70 to 74 years (HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.3), 75 to 79 years (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-3.0), and ≥80 years (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.4-4.4). Similar findings were reported in other meta-analyses of randomized trials [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26,33
         </a>
         ]. The risk of stroke associated with TF-CAS appears to increase linearly with patient age [

        <p>
         For patients ≥70 years of age with stroke or TIA being considered for carotid revascularization, 2021 guidelines from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) stated that it is reasonable to select CEA over CAS to reduce the periprocedural stroke rate [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. These guidelines noted that the usefulness of TCAR for prevention of recurrent stroke and TIA is uncertain. By contrast, the 2021 Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines noted that, based on the available evidence (predominantly observational data from 2017 onward), TCAR appears to be equivalent to CEA, there are no differences in outcomes with TCAR relative to older age, and the periprocedural risk of stroke may be lower with TCAR compared with TF-CAS [

        <p>
         Nevertheless, CEA was beneficial for both males and females with 70 to 99 percent symptomatic carotid stenosis, with similar five-year absolute risk reduction in stroke for males and females (17.3 and 15.1 percent, respectively). Surgical benefit in females was confined to those who had CEA within two weeks after their last event.
        </p>
        <p>
         As discussed above, for females with 50 to 69 percent symptomatic carotid stenosis, the benefit of carotid revascularization is also less certain. However, an analysis that incorporates time from ischemic event has suggested a similar benefit for males and females with moderate stenosis if CEA is performed within two weeks of symptom onset (five-year ARR in males of 15.2 percent and in females 13.8 percent) [

After a two-year follow-up, medically treated patients with an occluded contralateral carotid were twice as likely to have an ipsilateral stroke compared with those with severe or mild to moderate contralateral carotid stenosis (HR 2.36 and 2.65, respectively). Among surgically treated patients, the perioperative risk of stroke and death was higher in those with a totally occluded or mild to moderately stenotic contralateral vessel (4 and 5 percent, respectively) compared with those without contralateral disease. Despite this increased risk, patients who had CEA still had better outcomes compared with patients treated medically.

         The NASCET study examined rates of perioperative stroke and death at 30 days, stroke severity at 90 days, variables that influenced perioperative risk, and the durability of CEA [

         For patients with carotid stenosis and a nondisabling stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), we suggest that carotid revascularization with carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS) be performed within two weeks of the last symptomatic event rather than a later time; for patients with ischemic stroke, an exception is that very early CEA (within the first two days after stroke onset) may be associated with increased operative risk. However, the optimal timing of revascularization in patients with symptomatic carotid atherosclerosis has been the subject of considerable debate. No high-quality prospective, randomized trials have specifically evaluated outcomes related to the timing of CEA after a recent stroke or TIA [
         <a href="#rid41">

         Timing of revascularization has been better studied for CEA than for CAS. Below we provide the evidence and recommendations for CEA, which can generally be extrapolated to timing of CAS. However, available data show that early CAS (TF-CAS, TCAR) is associated with worse outcomes after an index event compared with CEA.

For CEA performed within 48 hours of the index event of stroke, the pooled periprocedural risk of stroke and death was 8.4 percent (95% CI 5.0-12.7); for the index event of TIA, the corresponding risk was 2.8 percent (95% CI 0.4-7.2).

         A 2009 systematic review identified 18 nonrandomized studies of CEA for recently symptomatic carotid stenosis that reported data on time from presenting event to CEA and further stratified CEA into emergency (stroke-in-evolution or crescendo TIA) and nonemergency indications. The rate of perioperative stroke or death was significantly higher with emergency CEA (14 percent, versus 4 percent for nonemergency CEA, pooled relative odds 4.6, 95% CI 3.4-63) [

          After moderate to severe stroke
         </strong>
         – Intervention is often not indicated in the setting of very large infarcts with severe neurologic disability. In moderate infarcts, decision-making should be individualized, accounting for the size and severity of the index stroke, the potential for meaningful neurologic deterioration if another stroke were to occur, and the operative risk.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The benefit of CEA for patients with moderate to severe ischemic stroke has not been evaluated in randomized clinical trials, as patients who had disabling strokes were not eligible for NASCET or ECST. Given that there have been no prospective trials addressing the question of timing of surgery, it is difficult to generalize observations from the NASCET and ECST trials to all patients undergoing CEA. In particular, patients who have a large infarction with brain swelling and/or significant hemorrhagic transformation have long been thought to have high perioperative risk with early CEA [

          44-46

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         A number of retrospective studies have evaluated the timing of CEA after moderate to severe ischemic stroke, and a 1997 review noted that patients undergoing CEA who have fixed neurologic deficits after a stroke probably represent a heterogeneous group whose risks vary according to clinical and radiological features [

          Higher risk with urgent CAS and TCAR compared with CEA
         </strong>
         – Early CAS and TCAR are associated with worse 30-day outcomes after an index event compared with CEA. CAS and TCAR performed within the first two days after carotid symptom onset are associated with an increased risk of stroke/death compared with CEA. The safety of CAS and TCAR compared with CEA from three to seven days after symptom onset is not entirely clear, but most data suggest a higher risk with CAS and TCAR [

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In a 2017 pooled analysis of individual patient data from four randomized controlled trials comparing CEA and CAS that included 513 patients treated within seven days of symptom onset, the risk of stroke or death was higher for CAS compared with CEA (8.3 versus 1.3 percent, risk ratio 6.7, 95% CI 2.1-21.9) [

         ]. A 2022 systematic review of 71 studies (mainly retrospective) with over 200,000 patients found that CAS within two days of symptom onset was associated with higher 30-day stroke and mortality rates compared with CEA [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56
         </a>
         ]. CAS from 3 to 14 days was associated with a similar 30-day stroke rate but higher mortality (odds ratio 2.76, 95% CI 1.39–5.50) compared with CEA. Nearly all of the CAS procedures were performed via the transfemoral route.

         The data for TCAR are more limited. In a retrospective review of 2608 symptomatic patients treated with TCAR, the procedure was performed after symptom onset within 48 hours (5.5 percent), from days 3 through 14 (35.6 percent), and 14 days or more (58.9 percent) [

         There is controversy about the appropriate management for patients who develop restenosis of the carotid artery following carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS). Restenosis due to intimal hyperplasia is usually benign. For patients who develop

          symptomatic

          Patients unlikely to benefit from revascularization

         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         It is important to exclude those who are unlikely to benefit from carotid revascularization. This includes patients with severe comorbidity due to other surgical or medical illness, who may have unacceptably high risk for carotid revascularization, patients with stroke who have persistent, severe neurologic deficits and disability that precludes preservation of useful function, patients with less than 50 percent carotid stenosis, and patients with carotid occlusion or near occlusion. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Patients unlikely to benefit'
         </a>
         above.)

         For patients with carotid stenosis that is 30 to 49 percent, we suggest against CEA or CAS (

         For patients with near occlusion of the symptomatic ipsilateral internal carotid artery, there was no benefit of CEA in clinical trials, but there were few patients and events in this category. Note that distinguishing between a very high-grade stenosis and near occlusion is not necessarily straightforward; the management of such patients should be individualized along with expert guidance.

          Conditions favoring CAS rather than CEA
         </strong>
         – For most patients, CEA is preferred over CAS because of a higher periprocedural stroke risk associated with CAS. Important exceptions include (see
         <a class="local">
          'Patients appropriate for CAS'

         For these patients, CAS may be preferred and may be the only option. The approach to CAS, whether transfemoral carotid artery stenting (TF-CAS) or transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR), is influenced by a variety of factors. For patients age 70 years and older with symptomatic carotid disease, outcomes are worse for TF-CAS compared with CEA; for TCAR, an age-related effect on outcomes has not been seen, but data are limited. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Older age and worse outcomes with CAS'
