It is a common finding on chest radiography, particularly in the inpatient setting. Although it is abnormal, reflecting a pathophysiologic process, it is often asymptomatic and requires no specific intervention. However, patients with risk factors for clinically significant atelectasis may require specific interventions to prevent or treat atelectasis. These include patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery or those with underlying pulmonary or neuromuscular disease.</p><p>The common causes, radiographic appearance, and management of atelectasis in children will be discussed below. Other aspects of atelectasis are discussed in separate topic reviews:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6983.html" rel="external">"Radiologic patterns of lobar atelectasis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6978.html" rel="external">"Atelectasis: Types and pathogenesis in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H605080669"><span class="h2">Mechanisms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Atelectasis may be caused by:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Obstruction</strong> – Atelectasis is often a consequence of an airway obstruction, which may be within the airway (intraluminal), extrinsic to the airway, or within the airway wall. If the obstruction is complete, the air distal to the obstruction is reabsorbed (particularly if 100% oxygen is administered), causing atelectasis. By contrast, partial obstruction can lead to air trapping and hyperinflation distal to the obstruction ("ball-valve effect"). Hence, patients with areas of complete and partial airway obstruction (eg, with multiple mucus plugs) may lead to both atelectasis and hyperinflation in the same radiograph.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inability to reexpand the lung</strong> – Atelectasis also may be caused or exacerbated by disorders that interfere with reexpansion of the lung, such as parenchymal compression, neuromuscular disease, or severe scoliosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Increased surface tension</strong> – Diseases in which surfactant is reduced/absent (eg, extreme prematurity) or inactivated (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome or pneumonia) are often complicated by atelectasis; this form is sometimes called adhesive atelectasis. Surfactant reduces surface tension and is essential to prevent the collapse of small alveoli. Alveoli are more prone to collapse than larger airways because the air pressure inside a bubble is inversely proportional to its radius (Laplace relationship).</p><p></p><p>These and other mechanisms of atelectasis are discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6978.html" rel="external">"Atelectasis: Types and pathogenesis in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1705519594"><span class="h2">Functional consequences</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Consequences of atelectasis may include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Increased work of breathing</strong> – Most commonly, there is no change in work of breathing. However, extensive atelectasis produces restrictive mechanical changes and may contribute to work of breathing, particularly in the setting of underlying chronic lung disease (eg, in bronchopulmonary dysplasia). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4987.html" rel="external">"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD): Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gas exchange abnormalities</strong> – Hypoxemia due to atelectasis is uncommon due to local hypoxic vasoconstriction in atelectatic areas, which redirects blood flow to better-ventilated areas of the lung, partially compensating for the under-ventilated area. This compensatory mechanism becomes less effective when &gt;50 percent of the lung is collapsed. It is also less effective in patients with underlying diffuse parenchymal lung diseases leading to hypoxemia (eg, cystic fibrosis, asthma) or pulmonary hypertension (eg, bronchopulmonary dysplasia).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H342444735"><span class="h2">Natural history</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The natural course of atelectasis depends upon its cause. Treatment of the underlying problem often leads to resolution of the atelectasis.</p><p>Persistence of atelectasis suggests that there is a fixed obstruction (eg, foreign body) and/or other factors that promote atelectasis, including inadequate respiratory muscle strength, anatomic factors, and/or reduced surfactant. As an example, persistent left lower lobe atelectasis in Duchenne muscular dystrophy may be triggered by pneumonia but is propagated by a combination of cardiomegaly compressing lung parenchyma and the left main bronchus and diaphragm weakness. Similarly, patients with neuromuscular disease or neurocognitive disability often have chronic or recurrent atelectasis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H533391069"><span class="h1">CAUSES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Common causes of clinically significant atelectasis in children and their mechanism(s) are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef138338" href="/z/d/graphic/138338.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Several of these causes involve multiple mechanisms.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2168355477"><span class="h1">CHEST EXAMINATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Examination findings suggesting atelectasis are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diminished breath sounds</strong> – Focal reduction of breath sounds is the most specific physical sign of atelectasis. However, this finding is generally apparent only when large areas of the lung are atelectatic, particularly when the lower lobes are affected. In some cases, the reduction in breath sounds may be appreciated only by comparing the affected side with the unaffected side.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Dullness to percussion</strong> – Dullness to percussion also may be noted over an area of extensive atelectasis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tracheal deviation</strong> – Tracheal deviation may occur with complete atelectasis of one lung, accompanied by greatly diminished or absent breath sounds in the affected hemithorax. This is unusual in children  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73236" href="/z/d/graphic/73236.html" rel="external">image 1</a>).</p><p></p><p>Most other findings are related to an underlying cause of the atelectasis rather than the atelectasis itself. As an example, in patients with asthma and compressive right middle lobe atelectasis, the predominant findings may be wheezes or a combination of wheezes and crackles; changes in breath sounds may not be apparent, because the upper and lower lobes fill the space occupied by the collapsed lobe. Similarly, longstanding airway obstruction (eg, due to an airway foreign body or mucus plug) may be associated with postobstructive atelectasis, pneumonia and localized bronchiectasis. If the obstruction is partial (permitting some airflow), there may be inspiratory (and occasional expiratory) crackles. A more specific sign of partial airway obstruction is phase delay, in which air entry and exit are delayed on the affected side; this is detectable only with a double-headed stethoscope. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6382.html" rel="external">"Airway foreign bodies in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2860.html" rel="external">"The pediatric physical examination: Chest and abdomen", section on 'Lungs'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h1">IMAGING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Atelectasis is generally diagnosed based on the radiographic findings, typically consisting of pulmonary opacification with or without associated adjacent compensatory signs.

Inspiratory and expiratory radiographs also may be helpful, particularly if foreign body aspiration is suspected.</p><p>Atelectasis may appear as (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6983.html" rel="external">"Radiologic patterns of lobar atelectasis"</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nonspecific small areas of opacity ("patchy" atelectasis), either unilateral or bilateral</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Subsegmental opacities with linear ("plate-like") or angular margins</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lobar opacities (right upper, middle, or lower lobe; left upper or lower lobes)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unilateral whole-lung opacity with signs of compensatory hyperinflation, pulmonary fissural shift, mediastinal shift</p><p></p><p>When interpreting the radiograph, look for:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Signs of foreign body aspiration</strong> – This is an especially important consideration in a young child with focal atelectasis and/or those with a history of choking, even if the episode occurred days or weeks before presentation. Most airway foreign bodies are radiolucent and will not be apparent on the radiograph. The key signs consistent with foreign body aspiration may include (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6382.html" rel="external">"Airway foreign bodies in children", section on 'Imaging'</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hyperinflated lung – Greater lucency of the lung distal to the obstruction  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55279 graphicRef76951" href="/z/d/graphic/55279.html" rel="external">image 2A-B</a>) due to air trapping and hyperinflation distal to a partial obstruction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Atelectasis – A foreign body causes atelectasis only if the obstruction is complete and the aspiration was not very recent since the distal air is resorbed over time.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Mediastinal shift – The mediastinum tends to shift away from the lung field containing the foreign body due to unilateral air trapping distal to the obstruction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Focal pneumonia – Infection often develops distal to an obstructed airway.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Foreign bodies may cause little or no radiographic changes, however, so a high suspicion and careful history are important.

Obstruction of a main bronchus may cause atelectasis of the entire lung  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef135062" href="/z/d/graphic/135062.html" rel="external">image 7</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Diffuse or patchy multilobar atelectasis can be seen in generalized lung disease, such as cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, bronchiolitis, and asthma.

The finding of upper lobe atelectasis in an infant should prompt consideration of diagnostic testing for cystic fibrosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53555" href="/z/d/graphic/53555.html" rel="external">image 3A</a>). Right upper lobe atelectasis also raises the possibility of aspiration because this lobe is vulnerable in the supine position  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef135063" href="/z/d/graphic/135063.html" rel="external">image 8</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Migrating or shifting atelectasis (in which the location of the atelectasis changes over time) suggests impaired airway clearance, which is common in patients with severe neurocognitive disability (cerebral palsy with high cough threshold) or neuromuscular disease with ineffective cough clearance.

The intervention depends upon the patient's risk factors and the clinical setting:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acute care setting</strong> – All hospitalized patients should be assessed for risk factors for atelectasis and encouraged to do some form of preventive measures. Low-risk patients should be encouraged to ambulate.</p><p></p><p>Postoperative patients and those who are on bedrest should be encouraged to perform incentive spirometry several times a day. Patients who have thoracic, spinal, or abdominal surgeries are particularly at risk; management should include judicious pain control to permit deep inspiration and coughing. (See <a class="local">'Preventive or general measures'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with neuromuscular disease who are acutely hospitalized for a respiratory illness or surgical intervention often benefit from more intensive preventive measures (chest physiotherapy, performed manually, via airway oscillation device, or with a high-frequency chest compression vest, and/or mechanical insufflation-exsufflation [MIE; "cough assist"] device).

In the postoperative setting, early ambulation also helps to reexpand the lungs. The efficacy of these measures is marginal, as discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6970.html" rel="external">"Strategies to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications in adults", section on 'Lung expansion'</a>.)</p><p>Older children usually can use an incentive spirometry device, which is essentially an inspiratory flow meter. For young children, incentive spirometry typically consists of blowing bubbles or pinwheels and other play-based techniques. The goal is to fully inflate the lungs. Protocols for incentive spirometry vary but generally involve repeat inhalations (typically 10) with a breath hold, with three to four sessions daily [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2357154760"><span class="h2">Advanced measures</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4251981003"><span class="h3">Airway clearance techniques</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chest physiotherapy</strong> – Chest physiotherapy refers to percussion and drainage, administered manually, or various forms of high-frequency chest wall compression therapy, administered with a vest or device. These techniques are commonly used and likely of value despite the lack of an evidence base for this modality. Much of the experience with chest physiotherapy comes from patients with cystic fibrosis.

This therapy may be delivered via face mask, mouthpiece, or artificial airway, and some devices also provide oscillation of the air column to aid in secretion mobilization. It may be done in the acute setting (eg, to prevent or treat postoperative atelectasis in high-risk patients) or as a chronic intervention (eg, patients with respiratory muscle weakness). It is usually administered then twice daily, with more frequent use during respiratory illnesses. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5124.html" rel="external">"Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Management", section on 'Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The most robust evidence for use of MIE is for patients with Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy; MIE is recommended for those with impaired cough, in addition to other respiratory interventions (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6181.html" rel="external">"Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy: Management and prognosis", section on 'Respiratory management'</a>). A retrospective study in children with other neuromuscular diseases (primarily spinal muscular atrophy) found that chronic outpatient use of MIE was associated with reduced hospital admissions over a three-year period (decreased from 3.7 to 0.9 admissions) and total hospital days (decreased from median 33.6 days to 2.7 days) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intrapulmonary percussive ventilation</strong> – Intrapulmonary percussive ventilation is another approach to mobilize secretions. It consists of a pneumatic device that can be connected to a face mask, mouthpiece, or artificial airway that intermittently delivers small tidal volumes at high frequencies (100 to 300 cycles per minute), creating percussions inside the lung.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Data describing efficacy in all age groups are limited, and most data are from retrospective case series [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Small randomized trials in children with atelectasis (various causes) found that intrapulmonary percussive ventilation increased secretion clearance [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], improved radiographic manifestations of atelectasis [<a href="#rid6">6</a>], and reduced the need for antibiotics [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].

This is a second-line approach, used if an MIE device is not available.

This may be applied in the acute setting (eg, postoperative or during a respiratory illness) or as a chronic measure. This approach is often used for children with neuromuscular disease who have chronic difficulties with atelectasis (ie, associated with significant hypoventilation [CO<sub>2</sub> retention] and/or recurrent pneumonia). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5124.html" rel="external">"Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Management", section on 'Noninvasive ventilation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intubated patients</strong> – For patients on a ventilator, clinically significant atelectasis (eg, with associated hypoxemia) can be addressed by:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Adjusting ventilator settings to improve lung expansion.

Using a manual resuscitator bag with face mask or artificial airway, the therapist administers a deep breath to inflate the lungs to total lung capacity, followed by a breath hold for one to two seconds. Evidence supporting manual hyperinflation is limited, and clinical benefit has not been demonstrated [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Stacked breathing</strong> – Alternatively, for cooperative patients with normal respiratory muscle strength, a breath stacking/dynamic hyperinflation technique can be used.

Bronchoscopic/endotracheal instillation of DNase has been reported in case reports of ventilated neonates, asthma, or non-cystic fibrosis-associated bronchiectasis [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Although some institutions routinely use DNase for treating atelectasis unrelated to cystic fibrosis in the pediatric intensive care unit, there are no controlled trials to support this practice [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. In a small comparison trial of nebulized DNase versus hypertonic <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12796" href="/z/d/drug information/12796.html" rel="external">saline</a> versus normal saline in the treatment of atelectasis in the intensive care setting, there were no differences among these three treatments [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Clinical trials in adults with non-cystic fibrosis-related bronchiectasis showed no benefit of DNase.

These agents are effective for managing these issues. However, for patients experiencing difficulties with mucus plugging, and especially those with tracheostomies, anticholinergic agents should be avoided or reduced because they tend to worsen the problem rather than ameliorate it. Use of anticholinergic agents in children with cerebral palsy is discussed separately.

It is a common finding on chest radiography, particularly in the inpatient setting. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Causes</strong> – Common causes of clinically significant atelectasis in children and their mechanism(s) are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef138338" href="/z/d/graphic/138338.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Multiple mechanisms may be involved in the same patient. Atelectasis is often a consequence of an airway obstruction (eg, mucus plug or airway foreign body). Complete obstruction leads to distal atelectasis, while partial obstruction leads to hyperinflation. (See <a class="local">'Causes'</a> above and <a class="local">'Mechanisms'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Physical findings</strong> – Focal reduction of breath sounds is the most specific physical sign of atelectasis and is often accompanied by dullness to percussion. However, these findings are not apparent in many cases, especially if obscured by other findings related to an underlying cause of the atelectasis, such as wheezing or crackles. Tracheal deviation may occur if the atelectasis involves an entire lung. (See <a class="local">'Chest examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Imaging</strong> – Atelectasis is best evaluated with conventional chest radiographs, with two views (anteroposterior and lateral). Inspiratory and expiratory radiographs also may be helpful. The radiograph may provide clues to the cause of the atelectasis (eg, foreign body aspiration), help to distinguish atelectasis from pneumonia, and evaluate any underlying lung disease.

Treatment is focused on managing the underlying process (eg, asthma, bronchiolitis, or foreign body). Hospitalized patients sometimes require interventions that help with the atelectasis, such as chest physiotherapy, positioning, or respiratory support with lung expansion strategies. (See <a class="local">'Atelectasis in acute respiratory illnesses'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Postoperative</strong> – Atelectasis is common in the postoperative setting due to the effects of anesthesia, splinting from pain, and/or use of opioids. Whether intervention is needed depends on the patient's underlying risk factors and extent of the atelectasis (eg, chronic lung disease, postoperative pain, or respiratory muscle weakness). (See <a class="local">'Postoperative atelectasis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Neuromuscular disease</strong> – Patients with neuromuscular disease are at risk for acute or chronic atelectasis. Acute exacerbations may be triggered by surgery, acute respiratory illness, or immobilization/hospitalization for any reason.
