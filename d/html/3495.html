         Although the majority of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) respond to optimal medical therapy, some patients do not improve or experience rapid and repetitive recurrences of symptoms. These patients have symptoms at rest or on minimal exertion and often require repeated prolonged hospitalizations for intensive management. Patients with chronic HF with severe symptoms despite maximum guideline-directed medical therapy are classified by the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association as having stage D HF [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Specialized strategies for patients with refractory HFrEF include intravenous vasodilator and inotropic therapy, ultrafiltration, mechanical circulatory support, surgery including cardiac transplantation, and palliative care.
        </p>
        <p>
         An overview of therapies used to treat refractory HFrEF is presented here. General treatment strategies for HFrEF and treatment of HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) are discussed separately. (See

         The general management of patients with refractory HFrEF includes optimizing all standard evidence-based drug and device therapy as well as volume management. Referral to a program with expertise in the management of refractory HF and advanced therapies is recommended. Monitoring is indicated to assess patient status as well as the effects of therapy. Palliative care has a role across the stages of HF and promotes careful discussion of goals of care and patient preferences to guide decision making in refractory HF.

         The first step in managing suspected refractory HFrEF is to confirm that all conventional evidence-based strategies (including pharmacologic therapy and device therapy such as cardiac resynchronization therapy and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) have been optimally employed and that contributing conditions have been recognized and treated. Recommendations for patients with other stages of HF are also appropriate for patients with end-stage (stage D) HF. (See

         Intravenous loop diuretics are the cornerstone of diuretic therapy in patients hospitalized with acute decompensated (including refractory) HF. The approach to refractory volume overload is discussed below. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3512.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         As discussed separately, limited evidence is available on the impact of fluid and sodium restriction in patients with HFrEF.

         </span>
         Consistent with the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) HF guidelines, we suggest restricting fluid intake to 2L/day in patients with HFrEF who are not diuretic resistant or significantly hyponatremic. In patients with HFrEF who are refractory to diuretic therapy or hyponatremic, we suggest fluid restriction to 1.5 to 2.0 L/day.

         Based upon clinical experience, we advise our patients with HF to restrict sodium intake to 2 to 3 g per day, although the optimum level of sodium intake has not been established. The 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines suggested some degree (eg, &lt;3 g/day) of sodium restriction in patients with symptomatic HF.

        <p>
         For patients with HF with volume overload with persistent severe hyponatremia (ie, serum sodium ≤120 mEq/L) despite water restriction and maintenance of guideline-directed medical therapy, short-term use of a vasopressin receptor antagonist (either a V

          2
         </a>
         ]. While the use of vasopressin antagonists in patients hospitalized with HF may improve symptoms and increase serum sodium concentration, they have no effect on mortality or hospitalization risk [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4

         Referral of patients with refractory HFrEF to a program with expertise in the management of refractory HF and advanced treatment strategies is suggested. Hospitalization rates for patients with HF may be reduced by approximately 20 to 30 percent through the implementation of comprehensive outpatient and inpatient support programs. However, less intensive strategies have been found to be ineffective in improving patient outcomes. (See

         Patients with refractory HF who may be candidates for heart transplant and/or mechanical circulatory support should undergo evaluation at a program offering these therapies. Limited data suggest that patient outcomes may be better at programs with higher annual heart transplant [

         Monitoring in hospitalized patients with refractory HF generally includes frequent assessment of arterial blood pressure and pulse, pulse oximetry, and cardiac telemetry. Refractory HF not responsive to diuretic therapy is an indication for pulmonary artery catheterization, particularly when accompanied by hypotension or worsening renal function or when considering inotrope therapy, Response to diuretic therapy can be assessed by monitoring of fluid intake and output and daily measurement of patient weight.

         Based upon the available evidence (including the ESCAPE trial described below), the routine use of pulmonary artery catheter monitoring in HF patients is not recommended. However, the management of a subset of advanced HF patients may still be improved by invasive monitoring and tailored therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Flow-directed pulmonary artery catheters (Swan-Ganz catheters) can be used for determination of central venous, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, as well as for measurement of mixed venous oxygen saturation, cardiac output, and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. All of these measures may be helpful in the management of patients with HF, particularly those with refractory HF and repeated hospital admissions. Although small uncontrolled studies have suggested that hemodynamic guidance may be of benefit [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ], these findings were not supported in a randomized trial. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1593.html" rel="external">
          "Pulmonary artery catheterization: Indications, contraindications, and complications in adults"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The ESCAPE trial included 433 patients with decompensated HF at 26 sites who were randomly assigned to receive therapy guided by clinical assessment and invasive monitoring or by clinical assessment alone [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. After six months of follow-up, there was no difference between the two groups in the primary end point of days alive out of the hospital. There was also no significant difference in mortality. Patients in both groups improved with therapy to reduce volume overload.
        </p>
        <p>
         Concern has risen regarding a possible increase in mortality in patients who undergo pulmonary artery catheterization. An observational study evaluated the effect of this technique within the first 24 hours of admission to the intensive care unit on patient survival [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. A statistical tool, called a propensity score, was used to adjust for treatment selection bias. Patients who underwent right heart catheterization had increased 30-day mortality (odds ratio 1.24) compared with those who did not undergo the procedure. However, the ESCAPE trial did not support the concern that pulmonary artery catheterization, per se, leads to an increase in mortality. Due to the limitations of observational data and the challenges inherent in randomized trials of critically ill patients, the interpretation of these results has been debated and remains controversial [
         <a href="#rid12">

        </p>
        <p>
         We concur with the recommendation in the 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association HF guideline that pulmonary artery catheter placement should be performed in patients with respiratory distress or impaired systemic perfusion when clinical assessment is inadequate [

         A careful discussion of goals of care and patient preference is important to guide decision making in refractory HF, especially when considering cardiac transplantation and mechanical circulatory support interventions. Palliative care is a multidisciplinary approach to care that focuses on communication, shared decision making, and advance care planning; it prioritizes relief from pain and other distressing symptoms; it integrates psychological and spiritual aspects of care; and it offers a support system to help caregivers cope during illness and bereavement. Palliative care has a role across the stages of HF, starting early in the course of illness, intensifying in end-stage disease, and extending into caregiver bereavement. Palliative care for patients with HF is discussed separately. (See

         At 48 hours, patients assigned to ultrafiltration had a significantly greater fluid loss (4.6 versus 3.3 liters with standard care). This difference may in part reflect the relatively modest level of diuretic therapy used in the standard care arm.

         The rates of adverse events were similar in the two groups, although there was a higher incidence of bleeding in the standard care arm. There was no difference in serum creatinine, as was also found in a smaller trial with detailed assessment of renal hemodynamics [

         , and selective use of inotrope or vasodilator therapy. The primary end point was the bivariate change in the serum creatinine level and body weight from baseline to 96 hours after enrollment. Ultrafiltration was inferior to pharmacologic therapy with respect to the primary end point due to increase in serum creatinine in the ultrafiltration group in contrast to a fall in mean serum creatinine in the pharmacologic therapy group (+0.23±0.70 mg/dL [+20.3±61.0 micromol/L] versus -0.04±0.53 mg/dL [-3.5±46.9 micromol/L]). There was no significant difference in weight loss at 96 hours between the ultrafiltration and pharmacologic therapy groups (5.7±3.9 kg [12.6±8.5 lb] and 5.5±5.1 kg [12.1±11.3] lb]). A higher percentage of patients in the ultrafiltration group had serious adverse events (eg, HF, renal failure, anemia or thrombocytopenia, electrolyte disorder, hemorrhage, pneumonia, sepsis; 72 versus 57 percent).
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, while ultrafiltration was an effective method for fluid volume removal, providing similar amounts of weight loss to stepped pharmacologic therapy, it was inferior to stepped pharmacologic therapy for preservation of renal function at 96 hours and was associated with a higher rate of adverse events.

         Intravenous vasodilator therapy is suggested in patients with refractory HF who require reduction in afterload, preload or both. The use of these agents should be reserved for patients in whom improved hemodynamic function is likely to lead to clinically useful improvements in oxygenation and/or organ perfusion, and may be most effective when their use is guided by hemodynamic monitoring. However, routine use of intravenous vasodilators does not improve acute HF outcomes, and thus their routine use should be avoided.

         Use of intravenous inotropes can be helpful in patients hospitalized with acute decompensated HF with low cardiac output and evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion or hypotension. Given lack of evidence of a survival benefit and concerns about risk of increased mortality and side effects with their use, intravenous inotropes should not be used in the routine inpatient management of acute decompensated HF in the absence of hypotension or organ hypoperfusion.

        <p>
         Similarly, in the absence of a specific indication, continuous inotropic agent infusion should not be used in the outpatient setting due to the risk of harm. Selected patients who cannot be weaned from intravenous therapy in the hospital may be candidates for chronic outpatient inotrope infusion. This requires placement of an indwelling line to permit the continuous infusion of vasoactive and/or inotropic drugs. This is a commonly used short-term strategy in patients who are awaiting cardiac transplantation or mechanical circulatory support. In patients with refractory end-stage HF who are ineligible for advanced HF therapies, continuous outpatient intravenous inotropic agent infusion may be considered to palliate symptoms. (See

         , in patients with baseline hypotension or chronic renal insufficiency. Dobutamine is a beta receptor agonist. As such, the inotropic response to dobutamine may be reduced in patients treated with a beta blocker. In general, beta blockers should be discontinued with dobutamine use. In settings in which continuation of beta blockers is preferred, we recommend use of milrinone rather than dobutamine. Most patients will experience an increase in heart rate and blood pressure with use of dobutamine, though response can vary [

         at an initial dose of 2 to 5 mcg/kg/min based on the severity of HF. The dose can be increased or decreased by 2 mcg/kg/min every two hours (or more frequently with close monitoring) until an optimal clinical and hemodynamic response is achieved. The half-life of dobutamine is two minutes, and a steady-state is quickly reached after dose adjustments. The usual maintenance dose of dobutamine is 2 to 10 mcg/kg/min (maximum 20 mcg/kg/min).

         The IABP is the most commonly used mechanical support device. It is inserted easily and rapidly, is the least expensive of all the devices, and does not require constant monitoring by technical support personnel. However, it is limited in that it is capable of generating only modest hemodynamic support. As such, the IABP is best suited for short-term use (eg, when rapid improvement in the underlying pathology is expected), and evidence for the use of IABP to treat refractory HF is scant. IABPs are often utilized for preoperative optimization for one to three days prior to durable LVAD placement. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1482.html" rel="external">
          "Intraaortic balloon pump counterpulsation"

        </p>
        <p>
         Percutaneous circulatory assist devices (eg, Tandem Heart, Impella) are continuous flow pumps that can provide greater hemodynamic support than an IABP. They can be placed by an experienced operator in a cardiac catheterization laboratory. The Impella is an axial flow pump that is placed across the aortic valve and pumps blood from the left ventricle to the aorta. The Tandem Heart is a percutaneous left atrial to aorta assist device with a venous catheter inserted into the left atrium by transseptal puncture and an arterial cannula inserted into the iliofemoral arterial system. Both types of percutaneous assist devices can be used in patients with cardiogenic shock as a bridge to surgery (such as LVAD or heart transplantation) or recovery and in patients undergoing high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention, though very little outcome evidence exists for their use. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1492.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) is a cardiopulmonary support system that, in addition to helping move blood forward, removes carbon dioxide from and adds oxygen to venous blood using an artificial membrane lung. ECMO systems can be placed via percutaneous (in the cardiac catheterization laboratory) or central (in the operating room) cannulation. In percutaneous (peripheral) cannulation, most often a cannula is inserted into the right atrium via the femoral vein (drainage), with an arterial cannula in the femoral artery (infusion). Central VA ECMO is usually deployed via a median sternotomy with the venous cannula in the right atrium and the arterial cannula in the ascending aorta. Alternate cannulation sites that allow patients to be ambulatory are used in rare circumstances. VA ECMO is most often utilized in patients who require both cardiac and pulmonary support in the setting of cardiogenic shock. (See

         Long-term mechanical circulatory support devices can be utilized in patients awaiting cardiac transplantation (bridge to transplantation) or as permanent mechanical assistance (destination therapy) in selected patients who are not eligible for cardiac transplantation. Indications and guidelines for use of these devices are discussed separately. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The vast majority of long-term mechanical circulatory support devices implanted are LVADs. In rare settings, biventricular support with either biventricular assist devices or a total artificial heart can be utilized in patients who are awaiting cardiac transplantation. Durable LVADs are implanted in patients who have failed all other pharmacologic therapies for severe HF. An important consideration is that the device be implanted before there is irreversible end-organ damage. Among patients with refractory HF who are not eligible for transplantation, a long-term LVAD can improve survival compared with optimal medical therapy. (See

          Use of a pulmonary artery catheter
         </strong>
         – For patients with refractory HF, we recommend against routine pulmonary artery catheter monitoring. However, pulmonary artery catheter placement may be useful to guide therapy in selected patients with refractory HF when clinical assessment is inadequate to guide hemodynamic management. (See

          Approach to volume overload
         </strong>
         – Patients with refractory volume overload are treated with intensified medical management, including optimized loop diuretic dosing with possible addition of a thiazide-type diuretic or a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (eg,

         </strong>
         – For patients with refractory HF and low cardiac output with evidence of hypoperfusion, therapy includes vasodilators and inotropes. Patients with refractory HFrEF despite optimum pharmacologic and device therapy should be evaluated for candidacy for mechanical circulatory support and cardiac transplantation. (See
