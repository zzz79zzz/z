(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1572.html" rel="external">"Long-term antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery stenting in stable patients"</a>.)</p><p>Such therapy improves outcomes of cardiac mortality and myocardial infarction (MI). Some of the improvement is attributable to a reduction in the incidence of stent thrombosis, a complication often associated with MI and death. However, DAPT is associated with an increased risk of major bleeding. For patients undergoing PCI who are identified as being at high risk of bleeding, shorter durations of DAPT reduce bleeding risk; however, the optimal management strategy is not known. This topic will discuss this issue in detail. </p><p>Other relevant topics include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/86233.html" rel="external">"Noncardiac surgery after percutaneous coronary intervention"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1535.html" rel="external">"Coronary artery disease patients requiring combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/101552.html" rel="external">"Periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy in patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulation and undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13605.html" rel="external">"Gastrointestinal bleeding in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1573.html" rel="external">"Periprocedural bleeding in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H338427783"><span class="h1">BACKGROUND AND DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H355774210"><span class="h2">Definition of high bleeding risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We use the definition for high bleeding risk (HBR) established in 2019 by the Academic Research Consortium for High Bleeding Risk (ARC-HBR) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The definition states that HBR is present if one major or two minor criteria (risk factors) for major bleeding are present. Major bleeding is defined by the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC). A patient is felt to be at HBR if the risk of BARC 3 or BARC 5 bleeding  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77838" href="/d/graphic/77838.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) is predicted to occur at a rate of ≥4 percent at one year or the risk of an intracranial hemorrhage of ≥1 percent at one year is present.</p><p>The ARC specifies 20 clinical criteria that predict major bleeding. The ARC points out that as the number of risk factors increases, so does the risk. However, they felt the data were not strong enough to allow for point-based care that would account for the relative weight of HBR criterion. These criteria are presented in a table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122147" href="/d/graphic/122147.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). </p><p>The ACR-HBR clinical and biochemical criteria have been validated in two studies of 16,580 "real-world" patients who underwent PCI [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. In both studies, there was a stepwise (significant) increase in bleeding risk with the number of criteria present.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1012031961"><span class="h2">Incidence of bleeding after PCI</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The incidence of bleeding after PCI in the broad population of patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy has been relatively well studied [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The following studies are representative: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the 8582 individuals in the ADAPT-DES study, post-discharge bleeding occurred in 535 (6.2 percent) at a median time of 300 days after discharge [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GI) was the most frequent source (62 percent). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16946.html" rel="external">"Nonresponse and resistance to aspirin", section on 'Observations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the EDUCATE registry of 2159 patients who underwent stenting with a second-generation drug-eluting stents (DES), the rate of bleeding by six months was approximately 2 percent [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Prognosis after bleeding'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a registry study of 8137 patients who underwent stenting with first-generation DES, 4.8 percent had bleeding-related hospitalization after discharge, and the highest incidence occurred within 30 days of discharge [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].

While there is prognostic value to assessing bleeding risk, such an evaluation does not dictate a particular treatment algorithm. Treatment needs to be individualized based on consideration of both bleeding and ischemic risks.</p><p>The PRECISE-DAPT score is a five-item risk score that provides a tool for the prediction of out-of-hospital bleeding during DAPT. The score is calculated from age, creatinine clearance, hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and previous spontaneous bleeding and has moderate ability to predict out-of-hospital TIMI major or minor bleeding (c-index 0.73 derivation cohort, 0.66 to 0.70 validation cohorts). Using a cutoff score of 25 or higher, patients at increased risk of bleeding on longer durations of DAPT are identified [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. A web-based calculator is available [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>The HAS-BLED score  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75259" href="/d/graphic/75259.html" rel="external">table 3</a>), which was developed to assess bleeding risk in atrial fibrillation patients, is a commonly-referred-to bleeding risk score. With HAS-BLED, a value of ≥3 is considered high. It has not been validated in patients receiving DAPT, and it is not used in clinical practice to evaluate bleeding risk in patients undergoing PCI.</p><p>Some studies suggest that as many as 44 percent of patients who undergo PCI with current-generation stents are at high bleeding risk [<a href="#rid2">2,13</a>]. Risk prediction models that incorporate identified risk factors  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122147" href="/d/graphic/122147.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) are available [<a href="#rid8">8-10</a>]. When applied to an individual patient, differences from model to model in the risk of high bleeding risk (HBR) appear. This is likely attributable to the fact that the scores reflect heterogeneity in the patient populations studied, the variables assessed, and the bleeding definitions used in the development cohorts. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1660042132"><span class="h1">PROGNOSIS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H436719656"><span class="h2">Prognosis after percutaneous coronary intervention</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>High-bleeding-risk patients have worse outcomes after PCI compared with non-high-bleeding-risk patients.

Approximately one-third of patients were identified as high bleeding risk if they had one or more of the following risk predictors: age ≥75 years, history of major bleeding, history of stroke, chronic oral anticoagulant use, chronic kidney disease, anemia, or thrombocytopenia. Compared with non-high-bleeding-risk patients, those at high bleeding risk had more comorbidities, higher lesion complexity, and a higher risk of mortality at four years (15.7 versus 3.8 percent; hazard ratio 4.38, 95% CI 3.76-5.11). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H48657504"><span class="h2">Prognosis after bleeding</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Any bleeding, and particularly major bleeding, after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a risk factor for death and myocardial infarction (MI).

Development of a major bleeding event was the only independent correlate of nonadherence during the first six months (odds ratio 12.83) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The risk for death or MI was significantly higher in patients with drug nonadherence associated with major bleeding (22 patients) than in those with drug nonadherence due to other factors (35 versus 7 percent; p&lt;0.001).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the ADAPT-DES study (see <a class="local">'Incidence of bleeding after PCI'</a> above), post-discharge bleeding was associated with an increased rate of all-cause mortality (13 versus 3.2 percent; p&lt;0.001) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].

This risk is highest during the first 30 days but is quite low if the patient is taking DAPT. After 30 days, the daily risk continues to fall with time. However, the risk of bleeding due to DAPT and its consequences are relatively constant over time. Thus, the benefit from DAPT is greatest during the first 30 days and is smaller after six months. </p><p>The impact of bleeding and ischemic events after PCI was examined in a study of 8582 patients who underwent successful PCI with drug-eluting stents [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. There were 1060 (12.4 percent of the entire cohort) episodes of definite or possible stent thrombosis (0.9 percent), clinical bleeding (8.1 percent), or myocardial infarction not related to stent thrombosis (3.4 percent). The risk of death within 30 days of each for these events was 38.5, 7.3, and 7.5 percent, respectively. This is consistent with much higher mortality risk but low frequency for stent thrombosis, whereas overall ischemic (stent thrombosis or myocardial infarction not related to stent thrombosis) and bleeding occur with similar frequency and carry similar mortality risk. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3234728117"><span class="h1">STENT SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3229790724"><span class="h2">BMS versus DES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is no strong evidence to suggest that the use of bare metal stents (BMS) compared with drug-eluting stents (DES) allows for a shorter period of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). In addition, there is evidence suggesting that cardiovascular outcomes are better with DES when DAPT is used for as short a period as 30 days, such as what might be considered in patients at high bleeding risk. The following trials support this concept:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the Zotarolimus-eluting Endeavor sprint stent in Uncertain DES candidates (ZEUS) trial, 1606 patients (with stable or unstable symptoms) for whom it was not clear whether DES or BMS was a superior choice (eg, high bleeding risk, low restenosis risk, or high stent thrombosis risk) were randomly assigned to a zotarolimus-eluting stent (ZES) or BMS and treated with DAPT for at least 30 days, after which they received either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> or P2Y<sub>12 </sub>monotherapy [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The total duration of DAPT was prespecified based on the reason for inclusion, and the mean duration was 32 days. The primary end point of 12-month major adverse cardiovascular events (including death, myocardial infarction [MI], or target vessel revascularization) occurred less often with ZES (17.5 versus 22.1 percent; hazard ratio [HR] 0.76, 95% CI 0.61-0.95). This was driven by lower rates of MI and target vessel revascularization. The rate of definite or probable stent thrombosis was significantly reduced in ZES patients (2 versus 4.1 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A prespecified analysis evaluated outcomes in 828 patients at high bleeding risk who had at least one of the following: age older than 80 years, clinical indication for treatment with oral anticoagulant agents, recent bleeding episodes that required medical attention or hospitalization, systemic conditions associated with increased bleeding risk, known anemia, and the need for long-term treatment with steroids or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. The primary end point occurred less often with ZES (22.6 versus 29 percent; HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57-0.98).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the LEADERS FREE trial, 2466 patients who were candidates for a BMS rather than a DES due to high bleeding risk were randomly assigned to a polymer- and carrier-free drug-coated stent that transfers umirolimus (biolimus A9) into the vessel wall over one month or a similar BMS [<a href="#rid18">18</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1575.html" rel="external">"Intracoronary stents: Stent types", section on 'Bioresorbable polymer drug-eluting stents'</a>). All patients received DAPT for one month followed by <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> alone. The primary safety end point (a composite of cardiac death, MI, or stent thrombosis) occurred less often in the drug-coated group at 390 days (9.4 versus 12.9 percent; p = 0.005 for superiority), owing to a difference in spontaneous and type 4C (restenosis-related) MI during follow-up. The primary efficacy end point of target lesion revascularization occurred less often in the drug-coated stent group (5.1 versus 9.8 percent; p&lt;0.001).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The SENIOR trial randomly assigned 1200 patients aged 75 years or older scheduled to undergo PCI to either a bioresorbable polymer DES or similar thin-strut BMS [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. DAPT was given for one month in stable patients and six months in those with an acute coronary syndrome. The composite primary end point (all-cause mortality, MI, stroke, or ischemia–driven target lesion revascularization at one year) occurred less often in the DES group (12 versus 16 percent; relative risk 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.94). </p><p></p><p>The ZEUS, LEADERS FREE, and SENIOR trials suggest that even in patients who receive DAPT for as short as 30 days, outcomes are better with some DES compared with BMS. The trials have several limitations including varying definitions of high bleeding risk, lack of power to detect differences in individual endpoints (including stent thrombosis and heterogeneous population), and limited ability to define subgroups that may have different outcomes. A longer course of DAPT in high bleeding risk patients may be considered in complex anatomic anatomy such as left main or bifurcation stenting. In addition, two of the three trials used bioresorbable polymer DES, one of which is not US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved. We believe that, despite trial limitations, current generation, thin strut DES with biocompatible durable or bioresorbable polymers should be favored over BMS in most patients at high bleeding risk even when DAPT may be limited to 30 days [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H183643594"><span class="h2">DES and DAPT duration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Studies suggest that for high-bleeding-risk patients treated with current-generation DES platforms, short DAPT durations of one to three months, with continuation of a single antiplatelet (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16784" href="/d/drug information/16784.html" rel="external">ticagrelor</a>) out to 12 months, reduce bleeding risk without increasing risk of ischemic events, even among patients with acute coronary syndromes.</p><p>Definitions of DAPT regimens are as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Abbreviated – One to &lt;3 months DAPT with 11 months of single APT (five months in patients with oral anticoagulants).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nonabbreviated DAPT – DAPT for minimum three months. </p><p></p><p>Among high-bleeding-risk patients undergoing current-generation DES implantation, abbreviated DAPT reduced bleeding without an increased risk of death or MI compared with nonabbreviated DAPT [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].

Six randomized trials and three propensity-matched studies were included.

Those receiving abbreviated DAPT had a similar risk of MI as those receiving nonabbreviated DAPT [OR 1.16; 95% CI 0.94-1.44].

DCBs are used (primarily in Europe) for the treatment of in-stent restenosis or de-novo lesions in small coronary arteries. There is currently no approved coronary DCB in the United States. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1571.html" rel="external">"Percutaneous coronary intervention of specific coronary lesions", section on 'Small coronary arteries'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1587.html" rel="external">"Intracoronary stent restenosis", section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p>The DEBUT trial is the first study to evaluate the use of DCB in patients with large coronary arteries [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. DEBUT randomly assigned 208 patients with de-novo lesions in a native coronary artery (measuring between 2.5 and 4.0 mm) or bypass graft and risk factors for bleeding to a paclitaxel- and iopromide-coated balloon or a bare metal stent. Exclusion criteria included (but were not limited to) ST-elevation MI, cardiogenic shock, bifurcation lesion requiring a two-stent technique, in-stent restenosis, left main coronary artery disease, or flow-limiting (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] blood flow&lt;3)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51941" href="/d/graphic/51941.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) dissection or substantial recoil (&gt;30 percent) of the target lesion after predilation.

At nine months, target-lesion revascularization occurred significantly less often with DCB (0 and 6 percent, respectively). Although more patients with diabetes were randomized to the bare metal stent group, adjusted cardiovascular mortality remained lower in the DCB group. Limitations of the trial include premature termination due to slow recruitment, a lower-than-predicted rate of major adverse cardiovascular events, use of bare metal stents as the comparator, and imbalance of randomization with regard to patients with diabetes.</p><p>Additional studies are necessary before we recommend the routine use of DCB with one month of dual antiplatelet therapy for patients at risk for bleeding. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1762641916"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT OF BLEEDING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>This issue is discussed separately.
