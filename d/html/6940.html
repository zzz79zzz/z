Treatment planning needs to incorporate the natural history of the disease and the risk of progression, since many of these cancers are biologically indolent and may never threaten the health or life of the patient.</p><p>For patients diagnosed with prostate cancer confined to the prostate, standard management options include radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy (external beam, brachytherapy), and for carefully selected patients with very low-risk, low-risk, or favorable intermediate-risk disease, active surveillance.</p><p>Key factors in choosing treatment for a male with very low- and low-risk prostate cancer include the likelihood of recurrence or metastasis following treatment (risk stratification), the patient's age and life expectancy, the presence or absence of significant comorbidity, and patient preferences. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6943.html" rel="external">"Localized prostate cancer: Risk stratification and choice of initial treatment", section on 'Risk stratification'</a>.)</p><p>This topic discusses the initial management approach for males with very low- and low-risk prostate cancer. The approach to treatment of males with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer, locally advanced (very high-risk) disease, and stage IV disease (clinical lymph node involvement or disseminated metastases) is discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6947.html" rel="external">"Initial management of regionally localized intermediate-, high-, and very high-risk prostate cancer and those with clinical lymph node involvement"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6941.html" rel="external">"Overview of systemic treatment for recurrent or metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11496394"><span class="h1">RISK STRATIFICATION AND SELECTION OF THE INITIAL APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial evaluation of males with suspected prostate cancer should include clinical staging based on a digital rectal examination by an experienced clinician to assess the extent of disease, a pretreatment serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the Gleason score/grade group in the initial biopsy, and the number and extent of cancer involvement in the biopsy cores. This information allows the stratification of males into clinical risk categories according to the primary tumor, as defined by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118962" href="/z/d/graphic/118962.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). This risk stratification system has been utilized in guidelines for treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer from the American Urological Association (AUA)/American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>Imaging studies (radionuclide bone scan, computed tomography [CT] of the abdomen and pelvis, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) are used selectively to assess for extraprostatic extension, regional adenopathy, or distant metastases, depending on the initial clinical stage and estimate of risk. Imaging for distant disease (including positron emission tomography scans using one of the new prostate-specific radiotracers) is not routinely recommended for very low- and low-risk prostate cancer according to the clinical staging system described above, while skeletal scintigraphy and cross-sectional imaging (of the pelvis, with or without abdominal imaging) are recommended for those with intermediate- and high-risk disease [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. MRI of the prostate is often obtained in males with low- and very low-risk disease to ensure that high-grade disease has not been overlooked. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16992.html" rel="external">"Initial staging and evaluation of males with newly diagnosed prostate cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97482.html" rel="external">"The role of magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer"</a>.)</p><p>The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) uses the clinical stage of disease (or pathologic stage, in those who have undergone prostatectomy), the baseline serum PSA, the histologic grade group (based on the Gleason score), and the extent of prostate involvement to divide patients into prognostic stage groups  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110728" href="/z/d/graphic/110728.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110729" href="/z/d/graphic/110729.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Among patients without distant metastases, these groups can also be used for selection of initial treatment according to risk, although we prefer to use the clinical risk categories as defined by the NCCN. It should be noted that a detailed evaluation of histology, and the impact of tumor size (rather than just the number of positive cores) and gene expression profiling are not fully captured by these risk groups. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94751.html" rel="external">"Molecular prognostic tests for prostate cancer"</a>.)</p><p>In general, active surveillance is preferred for most males with very low-risk or low-risk prostate cancer and a reasonable life expectancy in the absence of certain histologic features (areas of cribriform or intraductal cancer) and low-risk gene expression profiles. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94751.html" rel="external">"Molecular prognostic tests for prostate cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6924.html" rel="external">"Interpretation of prostate biopsy", section on 'Gleason 8, grade group 4'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6924.html" rel="external">"Interpretation of prostate biopsy", section on 'Presence of a special subtype of cancer'</a>.)</p><p>For males with higher risk disease and a reasonable life expectancy, definitive treatment using external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, or radical prostatectomy is an appropriate option. Guidelines from the AUA/ASTRO and ASCO endorse shared decision making that explicitly considers cancer severity (risk stratification), patient values and preferences, life expectancy, pretreatment general functional status and genitourinary symptoms, expected posttreatment functional status, and potential for salvage treatment [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H833689"><span class="h1">TREATMENT APPROACHES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The relative advantages and disadvantages of different treatment approaches for males with newly diagnosed low-risk and very low-risk prostate cancer are discussed in this section. Standard treatment approaches include active surveillance, external beam radiation therapy (RT), brachytherapy, and radical prostatectomy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3887962263"><span class="h2">Very low risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most males with clinically localized, very low-risk prostate cancer, we suggest active surveillance rather than immediate definitive therapy. However, this approach is associated with a need for close follow-up and may create significant anxiety, causing some patients to subsequently choose definitive intervention even in the absence of progressive disease. As such, this approach is appropriate for males who meet the biologic criteria of low risk for metastasis (in the absence of certain histologic features [areas of cribriform or intraductal cancer] and low-risk gene expression profiles) and have psychologic comfort with active surveillance. Some males may still choose to be treated (RT or radical prostatectomy) even in the presence of very low-risk disease.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H833697"><span class="h3">Active surveillance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Active surveillance is defined as the postponement of immediate definitive therapy, with curative-intent treatment instituted if there is clinical evidence of disease progression. Active surveillance is an appropriate management option for most patients with prostate cancers that are small, have a low Gleason grade, and thus, have a relatively low risk of progression (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] very low- and low-risk groups  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118962" href="/z/d/graphic/118962.html" rel="external">table 1</a>); tumor, node, metastasis [TNM] anatomic prognostic group I  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110728" href="/z/d/graphic/110728.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110729" href="/z/d/graphic/110729.html" rel="external">table 3</a>)).</p><p>The goal of active surveillance is to avoid treatment-related complications for males whose cancers are not likely to progress. For many males, such disease either never requires treatment or treatment can be postponed for a prolonged period without significantly decreasing the chance of cure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6922.html" rel="external">"Active surveillance for males with clinically localized prostate cancer", section on 'Rationale for active surveillance'</a>.)</p><p>Active surveillance must be distinguished from "watchful waiting," which is based on the premise that some males will not benefit from definitive treatment of their localized prostate cancer [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. For patients managed with watchful waiting, the decision is made at the outset that the patient is not a candidate for definitive therapy and to provide palliative treatment (typically androgen deprivation therapy [ADT]) if and when symptomatic progression requires therapy. Watchful waiting may be an acceptable alternative for males with a short life expectancy based on age and/or substantial comorbidity. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14257.html" rel="external">"Prostate cancer in older males"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6944.html" rel="external">"Radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer", section on 'Survival impact of radical prostatectomy'</a>.)</p><p>The available evidence suggests that for appropriately selected males with very low- and low-risk prostate cancer that outcomes from active surveillance are similar to those in patients who undergo immediate definitive therapy, with better quality of life based on the avoidance of treatment-related side-effects. (See <a class="local">'Evidence'</a> below.)</p><p>Given these data, and because of the potential for side effects associated with aggressive treatment of indolent disease, active surveillance is the preferred option for patients with very low-risk prostate cancer and an estimated life expectancy &gt;10 years in consensus-based guidelines from the NCCN [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]; these guidelines also state that observation (watchful waiting) is preferred for males with very low-risk prostate cancer and an estimated life expectancy &lt;10 years. Guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA)/American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO)/Society of Urologic Oncology (SUO), which have been largely endorsed by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), state that active surveillance is the best available care option for males with very low-risk localized prostate cancer [<a href="#rid1">1,5</a>].</p><p>Consistent with these guidelines, data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database indicate that the use of active surveillance or watchful waiting for males with very low- and low-risk prostate cancer increased in the United States from 2010 to 2015, and this approach has now become the most commonly used treatment for very low- and low-risk localized prostate cancer (used in approximately 42 percent of patients, compared with approximately 31 percent undergoing radical prostatectomy and 27 percent undergoing RT) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>However, in our view, immediate definitive treatment with RT or radical prostatectomy remains an alternative for patients desiring a more definitive approach. Although active surveillance avoids side effects in the short term, it does induce significant concerns and anxiety. Many males who initially choose active surveillance decide on definitive treatment within one to two years despite the absence of progression.</p><p>The key issues for patients who may be candidates for active surveillance include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Appropriate patient selection</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The frequency and type of monitoring required during surveillance and the ability and desire to comply with a surveillance schedule</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Criteria for initiating definitive therapy</p><p></p><p>These issues are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6922.html" rel="external">"Active surveillance for males with clinically localized prostate cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H260657907"><span class="h2">Low risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For males with low-risk prostate cancer and a life expectancy greater than 10 years, definitive therapy (radical prostatectomy, brachytherapy, or external beam RT) or active surveillance may be an appropriate option. The choice of a specific approach requires a consideration of the benefits and risks associated with each approach, taking into account the patient's individual preferences and comorbidities, the histology of the tumor, and molecular testing.</p><p>For most patients, especially those with a limited life expectancy (less than 10 years), we suggest active surveillance rather than immediate definitive therapy. However, immediate definitive treatment with RT or radical prostatectomy remains an alternative for patients desiring a more aggressive approach who have a life expectancy &gt;5 years.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1524822418"><span class="h3">Active surveillance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Because of the potential for side effects associated with aggressive treatment of indolent disease, active surveillance (as defined in the above paragraphs) is the preferred option for patients with low-risk prostate cancer and an estimated life expectancy ≥10 years in guidelines from the NCCN [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]; they also state that observation (watchful waiting) is preferred for males with low-risk prostate cancer and an estimated life expectancy &lt;10 years. Guidelines from the AUA/ASTRO/SUO, which are endorsed by ASCO, state that active surveillance is a preferred care option for most males with low-risk prostate cancer, but that observation (watchful waiting) should be recommended for males with a life expectancy ≤5 years [<a href="#rid1">1,5</a>]. Active surveillance is a reasonable option, even for appropriately selected younger males [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6922.html" rel="external">"Active surveillance for males with clinically localized prostate cancer"</a>.)</p><p>As noted above, consistent with these guidelines, SEER data indicate that the use of active surveillance or watchful waiting for males with very low- and low-risk prostate cancer increased in the United States from 2010 to 2015, and this approach has now become the most commonly used treatment for very low- and low-risk localized prostate cancer [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1627575634"><span class="h4">Evidence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A definitive assessment of the role of AS for prostate cancer patients requires a direct comparison between immediate treatment and AS, which includes definitive treatment at the time when there is evidence of progression. There are no available randomized trials that meet these criteria. However, taken together, the available data suggest that outcomes in appropriately selected males with localized prostate cancer who are managed with initial observation appear to be similar to those undergoing immediate definitive therapy:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Two large older studies, the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group 4 (SPCG-4) trial [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>] and the Prostate Cancer Intervention Versus Observation Trial (PIVOT) [<a href="#rid11">11-13</a>], compared immediate definitive therapy (radical prostatectomy) with delayed treatment for metastatic disease or symptomatic locoregional progression. Both trials provide insights into the natural history of prostate cancer, but neither trial utilized an active surveillance strategy with definitive therapy instituted if there was evidence of progression.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Nevertheless, in our view, the best evidence in support of AS comes from the PIVOT trial, for which long term results are available [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. This study randomly assigned 731 males with localized prostate cancer to upfront radical prostatectomy versus delayed initial treatment and reported that after 22 years of follow-up, surgery had only a very small impact on reducing death from any cause (restricted mean survival in the surgery group was 13.6 versus 12.6 years in the delayed treatment group). When the analysis was restricted to males with low-risk disease, the benefit of surgery was much smaller, with no appreciable difference in mortality between those who had surgery and those who were initially observed. Notably, the risk of dying from a non-prostate cancer cause in PIVOT was higher than in many other prostate cancer studies, and because of this the results should be interpreted with caution because they may not reflect outcomes in a healthy population.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Further evidence comes from the PROTECT trial which randomly assigned over 1600 males to "active monitoring," surgery, or radiation [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Patients assigned to active monitoring had their prostate-specific antigen (PSA) monitored every three months during the first year and every six months thereafter. Additional testing was carried out as indicated, and the therapeutic plan was reassessed as clinically indicated. Notably, MRI was not used to follow patients on active monitoring.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In this trial, there were only a limited number of prostate cancer-related deaths in any of the groups, and there was no significant difference in the 15-year cancer-specific survival or all-cause mortality among the three treatments [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The development of metastases was significantly more frequent in patients managed with AS (9.4 percent versus 4.7 percent with surgery, and 5.0 percent with radiation), as discussed below. (See <a class="local">'ProtecT trial'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">It is likely that these results were driven by the over 20 percent of males with intermediate- to high-risk disease who were randomized to the observation arm and, possibly, due to methods used for patient selection and surveillance. Unfortunately, the PROTECT trial was not powered appropriately for subgroup analyses, so a focused evaluation of low-risk patients was not possible.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1394703525"><span class="h4">Impact of tissue-based prognostic markers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An increased understanding of prostate cancer biology has led to the development of molecular tests that may provide some additional prognostic information, particularly when taken in conjunction with risk groups based on stage, Gleason score, and serum PSA. However, there is disagreement as to when and how to use these markers:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Consensus-based guidelines from the NCCN state that molecular testing should be considered for males with low-risk disease who are potential candidates for active surveillance and have a life expectancy &gt;10 years [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>On the other hand, guidelines from the combined AUA/ASTRO/SUO, which are endorsed by ASCO, state that among most low-risk prostate cancers, tissue-based genomic biomarkers have not shown a clear role in the selection of candidates for active surveillance, and they specifically recommend against this practice [<a href="#rid1">1,5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Notably, more recent data published after the guidelines were developed suggest that gene expression assays can add unique information regarding biologic risk and natural history in higher volume Gleason 6 tumors and even in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-detected cancers [<a href="#rid16">16-20</a>]. Updated guidelines for the use of molecular and cellular diagnostics in localized prostate cancer are under development.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We would support active surveillance in this group with low-risk disease only in the absence of certain high-risk histologic features (eg, areas of cribriform or intraductal cancer) and low-risk gene expression profiles.

Notably, prostate MRIs and genomic testing were not available; prostate biopsies were not done in the active surveillance group, and the trigger to consider a change in management was largely driven by PSA results.</p><p>The patients were recruited from a PSA screening population aged 50 to 69 years and included mainly males with low-risk disease (76 percent with stage T1c disease; the Gleason score was 6 in 77 percent of cases and was 7 in 21 percent of cases; the median serum PSA was 4.6 ng/mL).

Clinical progression included the development of metastatic disease, the diagnosis of clinical T3 or T4 disease, long-term ADT treatment, ureteral obstruction, rectal fistula, or the need for a urinary catheter due to local tumor growth. Clinical progression occurred in 26 percent, 10.5 percent, and 11.0 percent of males assigned to active monitoring, radical prostatectomy, or RT, respectively [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. The criteria for the detection of clinical progression (especially PSA progression) differed significantly between the three modalities, and this may have influenced the results.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prostatectomy had the greatest negative effect on sexual function and urinary continence, and although there was some recovery, these outcomes remained worse over time in this group [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. The negative effect of RT on sexual function was greatest at six months, but sexual function then recovered somewhat and was stable thereafter; RT had little effect on urinary continence. Bowel function was worse in the RT group at six months than in the other groups, but then it recovered somewhat, except for the increasing frequency of bloody stools. Effects on quality of life mirrored the reported changes in function.</p><p></p><p>The results of this trial are subject to several limitations. The applicability of the results of this trial to older males (≥70 years at diagnosis) or those of African or Caribbean ethnicity is unclear, and results may differ. Both RT and surgical techniques have improved since the trial was initiated, as have the criteria for patient selection for active surveillance. As noted above, prostate MRIs and genomic testing were not available; prostate biopsies were not done in the active surveillance group, and the trigger to consider a change in management was largely driven by PSA results. This "surveillance" strategy is largely outdated.
