The goal is to routinely identify individuals who smoke tobacco products and offer them evidence-based help to quit.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1177611231"><span class="h2">The 5A's approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinician’s role is to document the smoking status of all patients and to provide individuals who use tobacco with clear advice to quit, offer and connect them to pharmacologic and behavioral treatment options, and provide follow-up at future visits. For those individuals who are not ready to make a quit attempt, the clinician can use motivational interviewing to move these individuals towards quitting and use harm-reduction strategies such as initiating pharmacotherapy even before the patient is ready to stop tobacco use. A five-step treatment framework, the 5A’s  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74402" href="/z/d/graphic/74402.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52690" href="/z/d/graphic/52690.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), serves as a guide to the components of this strategy. In the United States, this method has been recommended in national guidelines since 2008 and is recommended by US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines [<a href="#rid3">3-8</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Implementing 5A's in practice'</a> below.)</p><p>The 5A’s steps are as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>A</strong>sk about tobacco use (see <a class="local">'Ask about tobacco use and exposure'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>A</strong>dvise quitting (see <a class="local">'Advise smoking cessation'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>A</strong>ssess readiness to quit (see <a class="local">'Assess readiness to quit'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>A</strong>ssist smokers ready to quit (see <a class="local">'Assist smokers ready to quit'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>A</strong>rrange follow-up (see <a class="local">'Arrange follow-up'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2541390473"><span class="h2">Variations of the 5A's approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Since 2008, a number of professional organizations have abbreviated the 5A’s framework to three steps that aim to be more feasible to deliver in a busy outpatient practice and to incorporate more members of the care team. The abbreviated versions vary slightly but share a common strategy.</p><p>A typical framework is <strong>AAR</strong>:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>A</strong>sk about tobacco use</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>A</strong>ssist – Offer advice to quit and assistance to make a plan, including prescribing cessation medication</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>R</strong>efer to behavioral support resources to continue treatment after the visit</p><p></p><p>In the <strong>AAR</strong>, asking the patient about tobacco use can be done and documented in the health record by office staff while they prepare the patient for the visit and obtain vital signs. The clinician’s unique role is to then offer advice, assistance, and cessation medication. Referral to behavioral support resources (usually located outside the office setting, elsewhere in the health system or community) can be facilitated by office staff after the process is initiated by the clinician.</p><p>Another alteration to the 5A’s approach is to replace the step of assessing readiness to quit with a proactive offer of treatment. With this method, the clinician approaches tobacco use like other chronic diseases; instead of first asking if the patient is ready to quit, the clinician proactively offers treatment. This approach resembles the approach to treatment of a chronic disease (eg, diabetes or hypertension), where embarking on a treatment plan is generally presented as an expectation, rather than as an option. Another similarity between chronic conditions and management of tobacco dependence is that they all require long-term follow-up [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>A suggested “proactive offer of treatment” approach is for the clinician to begin by briefly presenting treatment-related facts, including the availability of treatment, and then ask whether the patient would like to quit smoking:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>“Stopping smoking can be difficult.”</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>“Effective treatment for tobacco dependence is available.”</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>“I am prepared to help you, using available treatments.”</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>“Can I tell you more about these options?”</p><p></p><p>A proactive approach still includes several components of the 5A’s approach, including asking about use, assisting those ready to quit and/or willing to engage with tobacco treatment, and arranging follow-up. (See <a class="local">'Ask about tobacco use and exposure'</a> below and <a class="local">'Assist smokers ready to quit'</a> below and <a class="local">'Arrange follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p>Offering treatment to individuals who smoke in a positive way (rather than presenting it as optional) is hypothesized to increase the likelihood that they will use the treatment. Randomized trials of proactive outreach programs that offer smoking cessation interventions to individuals, regardless of readiness to set a quit date, have been shown to increase smoking cessation rates (compared with usual care) in veterans and patients of low socioeconomic status [<a href="#rid10">10-12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H796877865"><span class="h1">IMPLEMENTING 5A'S IN PRACTICE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The 5A’s are a simple algorithm  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74402" href="/z/d/graphic/74402.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52690" href="/z/d/graphic/52690.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) for treating tobacco use. Because implementing smoking cessation programs can be challenging in a busy practice, team-based versions have been proposed that involve the office staff as a team rather than having only the clinician involved [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. In this model, office staff members take on the responsibility for assessing each patient's smoking status and reminding the clinician to address smoking when identified. Documenting smoking status in an electronic medical record can improve identification of patients who use tobacco, which may increase the use of smoking cessation interventions [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>].</p><p>Once a smoker is identified, the clinician's primary role is to advise the individual to quit, consider prescribing smoking cessation pharmacotherapy, and refer the smoker to other services that can provide additional behavioral support for tobacco cessation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2016642542"><span class="h2">Ask about tobacco use and exposure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Step 1 of the 5A’s is asking all patients about tobacco use and exposure. The US Preventive Service Task Force recommends that smoking status should be evaluated and recorded as every health encounter [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. This practice of routinely asking about tobacco use has been shown to increase smoking-related discussions and smoking cessation rates [<a href="#rid3">3-6</a>].</p><p>It is important to ask a patient if they <strong>ever</strong> smoke cigarettes; otherwise, non-daily or intermittent smokers may not identify themselves as smokers. It also important to assess the full extent of tobacco use by asking specifically about the use of other tobacco and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9698" href="/z/d/drug information/9698.html" rel="external">nicotine</a> products (eg, cigars, pipes, smokeless tobacco, water pipes/hookahs, bidis, and electronic cigarettes). Many tobacco users consume more than one type of tobacco product, including both cigarettes and e-cigarettes. Often, patients incorrectly perceive that using tobacco products other than cigarettes poses less health risk to the user. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6916.html" rel="external">"Patterns of tobacco use"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/98400.html" rel="external">"Vaping and e-cigarettes"</a>.)</p><p>For patients who use tobacco, a full assessment includes determining frequency of use, products used, degree of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9698" href="/z/d/drug information/9698.html" rel="external">nicotine</a> dependence, history of quit attempts (including methods used and their effectiveness), and readiness to stop using tobacco at this time [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p>The degree of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9698" href="/z/d/drug information/9698.html" rel="external">nicotine</a> dependence can be estimated from the age of smoking initiation, the number of cigarettes/tobacco materials used daily, and how soon after awakening the individual has their first morning cigarette/tobacco product. An individual’s degree of nicotine dependence predicts the difficulty that they will have in quitting and the intensity of treatment likely to be required. More dependent patients started smoking early in life, smoke more cigarettes daily (the average number in the United States is 15 per day), and smoke within the first 30 minutes of awakening [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>].</p><p>Those who do not use tobacco products should be asked about secondhand exposure to smoke (eg, in the home, car, or workplace). Such exposure is associated with increased health risks (eg, coronary heart disease and lung cancer) in nonsmokers. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6919.html" rel="external">"Secondhand smoke exposure: Effects in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6375.html" rel="external">"Secondhand smoke exposure: Effects in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H84078137"><span class="h2">Advise smoking cessation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Step 2 of the 5A’s is advising smoking cessation. The main impact of clinician advice is prompting smokers to attempt to quit.</p><p>We offer brief advice and assistance to quit smoking. There is clear evidence that brief (&lt;5 minutes) clinician advice to quit at each encounter can increase smoking abstinence rates, even though not every patient counseled about smoking cessation will be prepared to consider quitting immediately [<a href="#rid6">6,19</a>]. For some patients, such as those with smoking-related disease, more intensive clinician counseling may be associated with increased cessation rates [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Even if they are not ready to quit, patients who are asked about their tobacco use or are advised to quit smoking report being more satisfied with their care than patients who do not receive such advice [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p>Providing physiologic measurements to a smoker to demonstrate the negative effects of smoking on their health has variable efficacy depending on the study; more evidence is needed to determine whether any such measurements should be routinely recommended. Some studies show improved smoking cessation rates after providing patients with certain physiologic measurements. For example, a randomized trial showed that providing results of salivary <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9698" href="/z/d/drug information/9698.html" rel="external">nicotine</a> metabolite levels was associated with increased short-term quit rates compared with counselling alone [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. In another randomized trial, smokers who were told their “lung age” (the age of the average person with a forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1] equal to the smoker’s measured FEV1) were more likely to quit smoking (verified quit rate at 12 months of 13.6 percent compared with 6.4 percent among those not told) [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. The lung age was calculated as follows: (for men) lung age = 2.87 x height (inches) – (31.25 x observed FEV1 [liters] - 39.375), and (for women) lung age = 3.56 x height (inches) – (40 x observed FEV1 [liters] – 77.28) [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p>However, other studies have not found efficacy for biomedical risk assessment (eg, carbon monoxide level measurement) in smoking cessation [<a href="#rid9">9,24-26</a>].</p><p>Although complete smoking cessation is always preferable, reducing the number of cigarettes smoked daily has been advocated as a possible alternative to complete cessation by patients who are unable to quit smoking. However, few data are available that support a goal of smoking reduction rather than complete cessation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16706.html" rel="external">"Benefits and consequences of smoking cessation", section on 'Questionable utility of smoking reduction'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H84078260"><span class="h2">Assess readiness to quit</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Step 3 of the 5A’s is assessing readiness to quit. The clinician should assess the patient's willingness to make a quit attempt. Smokers differ in their readiness to change their tobacco use. Understanding the smoker’s perspective is essential to providing useful assistance.</p><p>The concept that change is gradual is a useful construct when discussing smoking cessation. One model, called the “Stages of Change,” describes a process by which behavior change occurs. It identifies five stages through which smokers may progress as they move from smoking to abstinence [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pre-contemplation (not ready to quit)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Contemplation (considering a quit attempt)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Preparation (actively planning a quit attempt)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Action (actively involved in a quit attempt)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Maintenance (achieved smoking cessation)</p><p></p><p>After determining the patient's readiness to quit, the clinician can differentiate between those ready to quit (eg, contemplative stage or beyond), described below, for whom assistance with behavioral support and pharmacotherapy is indicated, and those not yet ready to quit (eg, precontemplative stage) for whom motivation to quit is needed. For those not yet ready to quit, it can be useful for the clinician to gain an understanding of the patient’s perspectives about quitting, consider using motivational interviewing techniques and components of the proactive approach (eg, offering treatment such as pharmacotherapy), and describe methods to limit exposure of others to secondhand smoke. (See <a class="local">'Assist smokers not ready to quit'</a> below and <a class="local">'Variations of the 5A's approach'</a> above.)</p><p>Some critics noted that individuals do not move through predictable stages of behavior change. A 2010 systematic review of 41 trials concluded that stage-based help-interventions were equivalent to their non-stage-based equivalents [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>].</p><p>Another alternative to assessing readiness to quit is to use the proactive approach, advise quitting, and offer treatment. (See <a class="local">'Variations of the 5A's approach'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H84078423"><span class="h2">Assist smokers ready to quit</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Step 4 of the 5A’s is assisting smokers ready to quit. When a smoker is motivated to quit (eg, contemplative stage or beyond), the clinician should follow several practical steps to assist with smoking cessation  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52690" href="/z/d/graphic/52690.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), including helping the smoker access appropriate resources and assessing the smoker's previous experiences with quit attempts. Understanding the methods that the smoker has tried and the degree of success with each method is important to guide the recommendations for the next attempt.</p><p>We recommend that smokers be managed with a combination of behavioral support and pharmacologic therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16635.html" rel="external">"Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6920.html" rel="external">"Behavioral approaches to smoking cessation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1124334982"><span class="h3">Set a quit date</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The process of quitting generally begins by setting a "quit date" within the following two to four weeks. We advise patients to quit abruptly on the quit date, but gradual reduction prior to the quit date is an acceptable alternative.</p><p>In a systematic review including 22 randomized trials and over 9000 participants, there was no difference in abstinence rates between those who reduced smoking before the quit date and those who quit abruptly (risk ratio [RR] 1.01, 95% CI 0.87-1.17) [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H83022898"><span class="h3">Address barriers to quit</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinicians should help the patient anticipate and address barriers to quitting. Several factors (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9698" href="/z/d/drug information/9698.html" rel="external">nicotine</a> withdrawal symptoms, triggers to smoke) contribute to the difficulty that smokers encounter when they try to quit. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6920.html" rel="external">"Behavioral approaches to smoking cessation", section on 'Content of therapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H83022810"><span class="h4">Nicotine withdrawal</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9698" href="/z/d/drug information/9698.html" rel="external">Nicotine</a> withdrawal symptoms should be discussed so that smokers will know what to expect and how to respond if these symptoms occur.

A quitline typically provides proactive smoking cessation counseling over several calls. This service is free in the United States at 1-800-QUIT-NOW.

Another randomized trial found that a series of postdischarge computerized telephone calls, each offering a way to reach a live counselor for help along with provision of free medication, increased smoking cessation rates by 71 percent at six months after hospital discharge compared with a discharge recommendation to use counseling and provision of a prescription [<a href="#rid75">75</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H696294230"><span class="h2">Preoperative management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients should be assessed for smoking during the preoperative evaluation so effective therapies can be initiated. Current smokers are at risk for postoperative pulmonary and other complications, and smoking cessation prior to surgery may improve outcomes. NRT and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10339" href="/z/d/drug information/10339.html" rel="external">varenicline</a> are suggested choices in this population; if surgery will occur within a few days, NRT is favored due to its rapid onset of action. Pharmacotherapy in preoperative smokers is discussed separately.

A meta-analysis found that intensive preoperative behavioral interventions (typically with NRT) led to a greater rate of smoking cessation at the time of surgery (risk ratio [RR] 10.76, 95% CI 4.55-25.46) and to reduced postoperative complications (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.27-0.65) compared with standard of care [<a href="#rid76">76</a>]. However, brief interventions (eg, 15 to 90 minutes of counselling) were associated with a smaller reduction in smoking cessation by the time of surgery and were not associated with a significant reduction in complications. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6920.html" rel="external">"Behavioral approaches to smoking cessation", section on 'Patients ready to quit'</a>.)</p><p>Additionally, a preoperative smoking cessation intervention may be maintained after surgery. A randomized trial found that smoking cessation rates were higher one year after surgery for patients who had received a perioperative smoking cessation intervention compared with usual care (25 versus 8 percent) [<a href="#rid77">77</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H821157969"><span class="h2">Light or intermittent tobacco use</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Those with light tobacco use (&lt;10 cigarettes per day [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]) and intermittent use (who do not smoke daily) benefit from smoking cessation.

Although the role of pharmacotherapy is less clear because few trials of smoking cessation medications enrolled light or intermittent smokers, medications effective for those with heavier tobacco use may also be effective for those with lighter use.

One approach to encouraging smoking cessation is the 5A’s five-step algorithm (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74402" href="/z/d/graphic/74402.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52690" href="/z/d/graphic/52690.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). A team-based 5A’s approach is a strategy a busy clinician can use to offer smoking cessation to patients. An alternative approach is to proactively offer treatment using the three-step AAR (Ask, Assist, Refer) approach.

(See <a class="local">'Ask about tobacco use and exposure'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>All individuals who smoke cigarettes should be advised to quit smoking. Even brief advice to quit has been shown to increase quit rates. (See <a class="local">'Advise smoking cessation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For individuals who are willing to quit, we recommend a combination of behavioral support and pharmacologic therapy (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). Combination therapy is superior to either behavioral intervention or pharmacologic therapy alone (see <a class="local">'Combination behavioral and pharmacotherapy most effective'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6920.html" rel="external">"Behavioral approaches to smoking cessation"</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>We encourage patients to use the maximal behavioral intervention acceptable to them. Behavioral intervention can consist of brief clinician counseling in the office, but smokers should also be referred to a free telephone quitline for continued counseling support.

(See <a class="local">'Treatments'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>With a few exceptions, choice of medication is generally based on patient preference after discussion with a clinician.

Those who are considering quitting but are not yet ready to discontinue tobacco use should be offered the option of initiating pharmacotherapy, rather than waiting until they are ready to stop tobacco use. This may help reduce cigarettes smoked in preparation for quitting in the future. Patients should also be advised about the health risks of secondhand smoke exposure to their household members and urged to commit to keeping their home and car smoke-free, especially if children are present. Clinicians can use motivational interviewing techniques for those not ready to quit.
