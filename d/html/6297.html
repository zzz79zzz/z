Causes of hearing loss in infants and children are summarized in the table and discussed in detail separately  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119919" href="/d/graphic/119919.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6308.html" rel="external">"Hearing loss in children: Etiology"</a>.)</p><p>Newborn hearing screening and management of hearing loss in children are also discussed in detail separately.

It can occur at any location from the outer ear (pinna, external auditory canal) to the stapes footplate and oval window. In children, conductive hearing loss is most often transient (eg, otitis media with effusion), but it can be permanent (eg, aural atresia or chronic adhesive otitis media). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6308.html" rel="external">"Hearing loss in children: Etiology", section on 'Conductive hearing loss'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL)</strong> – SNHL is hearing loss resulting from damage, disease, or other disorders affecting the inner ear (eg, the cochlea) and/or the auditory nerve (cranial nerve VIII).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>SNHL due to disorders of the inner ear</strong> – Numerous conditions (acquired or congenital) are associated with SNHL. The causes are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6308.html" rel="external">"Hearing loss in children: Etiology", section on 'Sensorineural hearing loss'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD)</strong> – In ANSD (also called auditory neuropathy, neural synchrony disorder, neural dyssynchrony, and paradoxical hearing loss), the cochlea can detect sound, but signals are not transmitted properly from the inner ear to the brain. ANSD is characterized by normal otoacoustic emissions, which indicate normal outer hair cell function. However, auditory brainstem responses are abnormal, implying an abnormality of the inner hair cells of the cochlea or the cochlear branch of cranial nerve VIII.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>"Retrocochlear" hearing loss</strong> – "Retrocochlear" refers to lesions proximal to the cochlea. We define "retrocochlear" hearing loss as hearing loss that results from abnormalities of the eighth cranial nerve. The most common retrocochlear lesion is a vestibular schwannoma (also called acoustic neuroma). However, there is overlap between retrocochlear hearing loss and ANSD and the terms are used somewhat inconsistently in the medical literature. Some resources use the term "retrocochlear" more broadly to describe other abnormalities of the auditory central nervous system.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mixed hearing loss</strong> – Mixed hearing loss refers to a combination of conductive and SNHL.</p><p></p><p>The causes and relative frequencies of different types of hearing loss in children are discussed in a separate topic review. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6308.html" rel="external">"Hearing loss in children: Etiology"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1024140577"><span class="h1">SCREENING FOR HEARING LOSS IN CHILDREN</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3141132380"><span class="h2">Rationale</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hearing screening beyond the newborn period is necessary to identify children with hearing loss that is acquired (eg, from meningitis, trauma, noise exposure), progressive (eg, certain genetic causes), has delayed onset (eg, congenital cytomegalovirus infection), or was not detected on newborn hearing screen [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6308.html" rel="external">"Hearing loss in children: Etiology"</a>.) </p><p>Hearing loss that is undetected and untreated can result in speech, language, and cognitive delays. Early identification and effective treatment of hearing loss is associated with improved language and communication skills [<a href="#rid4">4-7</a>].</p><p>Although most children with hearing loss are identified before they begin school [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], some cases are missed [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Hearing loss of at least 16 decibels (dB) in either the low- or high-frequency range occurs in approximately 15 percent of children aged 6 to 19 years [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. </p><p>Additional details about the rationale and evidence supporting newborn hearing screening are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4985.html" rel="external">"Screening the newborn for hearing loss", section on 'Rationale for screening'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2896293748"><span class="h2">Screening schedule</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We agree with the guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), which suggest a hearing risk assessment at all health maintenance visits and periodic hearing screening throughout childhood and adolescence [<a href="#rid3">3,12</a>]. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Children with risk factors</strong> – Children with identified risk factors for early hearing loss  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef142695" href="/d/graphic/142695.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) should have at least one formal audiologic assessment in infancy or early childhood even if they passed the newborn hearing screen. For infants with congenital or perinatal risk factors, formal audiology generally should be performed by age 9 months [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. For those with acquired risk factors, formal audiology should be performed no later than three months after the event or concern was identified [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Risk assessment'</a> below and <a class="local">'Formal audiology'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with abnormal formal audiology results should be referred to otolaryngology, speech-language pathology, and early intervention (see <a class="local">'Referrals'</a> below). Those with normal audiology results should have ongoing periodic developmentally appropriate hearing assessments thereafter. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Children without identified risk factors </strong>– For children without identified risk factors, office- or school-based hearing screening is suggested at ages 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 years [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. For children and adolescents &gt;10 years old, the AAP guidelines suggest audiometry screening that includes 6000 and 8000 hertz (Hz) frequencies once between 11 and 14 years, once between 15 and 17 years, and once between 18 and 21 years [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. This guidance places a high value on the potential for improved outcome with early detection and intervention (compared with the cost, inconvenience, and lost time necessary for follow-up of a potentially false positive result). Abnormal screening results should be followed up with formal audiology. (See <a class="local">'Formal audiology'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Abnormal results should be explained to the parents/caregivers and there should be a system in place to ensure appropriate follow-up.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H634609244"><span class="h2">Risk assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Risk assessment for hearing loss in childhood includes monitoring language milestones  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58598" href="/d/graphic/58598.html" rel="external">table 3</a>), performing routine developmental surveillance, identifying risk factors for hearing loss  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef142695" href="/d/graphic/142695.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), and eliciting any parental concerns about hearing [<a href="#rid3">3,13</a>]. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk factors</strong> – Risk factors for early childhood hearing loss include  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef142695" href="/d/graphic/142695.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Parent/caregiver concerns regarding hearing, speech, language, or developmental delay – Normal language and communication milestones are summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58598" href="/d/graphic/58598.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) and discussed in detail separately.

Tympanometry is an additional method to screen for conductive hearing loss associated with chronic otitis media with effusion (OME). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5966.html" rel="external">"Otitis media with effusion (serous otitis media) in children: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Pure tone audiometry and OAE should be performed in a quiet room. While a dedicated soundproof environment (like that used for formal audiology) improves the sensitivity of testing, this is generally not necessary for office-based hearing screening. Clinicians and patients should be aware that screening may fail to detect mild hearing loss (&lt;30 dB). </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pure tone audiometry</strong> – Pure tone audiometry involves determining the threshold at which the child can hear a sound 50 percent of the time at each frequency. The accuracy of this screening method depends upon the child’s ability to cooperate; it is generally not feasible in children younger than three or four years of age. Pure tone audiometry generates an audiogram, which is a graph showing hearing thresholds (in dB) plotted according to frequency (in Hz). Pure tone audiometry in the office setting typically involves testing only air thresholds (whereas formal audiology tests both air and bone conduction). The normal hearing threshold is between 0 to 20 dB. A threshold &gt;20 dB suggests hearing loss. Examples of audiograms are shown in the figures, depicting conductive hearing loss  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef119905" href="/d/graphic/119905.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) and sensorineural hearing loss  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef119906" href="/d/graphic/119906.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Pure tone audiometry'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Otoacoustic emission</strong> – OAE testing measures the presence and strength of low-intensity sound produced by the cochlea in response to an acoustic stimulus. One advantage of this screening tool is that testing does not require a behavioral response and thus can be performed in infants and young children. However, a quiet setting is still needed. An abnormal OAE may be due to cochlear dysfunction or conductive hearing loss. (See <a class="local">'Otoacoustic emissions'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">OAE is one of the two methods used for newborn screening, as discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4985.html" rel="external">"Screening the newborn for hearing loss", section on 'Otoacoustic emissions'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tympanometry</strong> – Tympanometry is most valuable in conjunction with pneumatic otoscopy in patients with chronic or recurrent ear infections. (See <a class="local">'Tympanometry'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Flat tympanograms (type B tympanograms)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67750" href="/d/graphic/67750.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>) are usually due to middle ear effusion (acute otitis media [AOM] or OME).

The external auditory canal should be cleared of cerumen for more accurate hearing testing. The tympanic membrane should be viewed to ensure that no middle ear abnormality (eg, middle ear fluid, tympanic membrane perforation, tympanic membrane scarring, cholesteatoma or other middle ear mass) exists.

Hearing loss at 256 Hz is equivalent to approximately 10 to 15 decibels (dB) and hearing loss at 512 Hz is equivalent to 20 to 30 dB. An ear with normal hearing has air conduction (sound waves traveling to the tympanic membrane and converted into sound in the inner ear) that is louder than bone conduction (sound transmitted via the vibration of the skull into the cochlea). The Weber and Rinne tests examine the relative adequacy of air and bone conduction of sound  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58032" href="/d/graphic/58032.html" rel="external">figure 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74212" href="/d/graphic/74212.html" rel="external">table 6</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The Weber test is performed by placing the tuning fork on the bridge of the forehead, nose, or teeth and asking the child if the sound is louder in one ear or the other. The sound is heard equally in both ears in children with normal hearing. Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is suspected if the vibratory sound is louder on the "good" side. Conductive hearing loss is suspected if the vibratory sound is louder on the "bad" side.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The Rinne test compares bone conduction (when the tuning fork is placed on the mastoid bone) with air conduction (when the tuning fork is held near the ear). An abnormal result occurs when sound is at least equally loud or louder when the fork is placed on bone as compared with when it is held next to the ear (bone&gt;air conduction). The Rinne test is considered normal when the vibrating fork placed near the ear is louder than when placed on the mastoid bone (air&gt;bone conduction). An abnormal test is consistent with conductive hearing loss, especially if the Weber test also lateralizes to that side.</p><p></p><p>As examples, a conductive hearing loss on the right side would demonstrate a Weber test that lateralizes to the right (ipsilateral side), an abnormal Rinne test (bone conduction&gt;air conduction) on the right, and a normal Rinne test on the left. An SNHL on the right side would demonstrate a Weber test that lateralizes to the left (contralateral side) and normal Rinne tests bilaterally. Testing results may vary for mixed hearing loss, severe SNHL (Rinne test on the bad ear will appear to be abnormal because bone conduction crosses over and is detected by the good ear), or conductive hearing loss below the thresholds that are detectable by the tuning forks used.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h1">FORMAL AUDIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Formal audiologic assessment is performed by an audiologist in a soundproof environment and provides detailed information about hearing ability. The audiologic assessment typically consists of numerous different studies. It may include pure tone audiometry, speech audiometry, behavioral audiometry, visual reinforcement audiometry, play audiometry, impedance audiometry, tympanometry, and/or electrophysiologic tests (including auditory brainstem response [ABR] and otoacoustic emissions [OAE]). The choice of which tests are performed is based on the child's developmental age, the reason for the referral, the test environment, the equipment available, and the skill of the test administrator. No child is too young to have their hearing evaluated.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3992426034"><span class="h2">Testing in cooperative children</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Pure tone audiometry</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Audiology measures the ability to hear pure tones of various frequencies as a function of intensity measured in decibels (dB). The pure tone frequencies evaluated in a complete audiogram are 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 8000 hertz (Hz). The threshold for each tone is determined by finding the intensity level at which the child can detect the tone 50 percent of the time.</p><p>Hearing is tested with both air and bone conduction. Air conduction, performed with earphones, tests the ability to hear when sound waves travel their normal route through the external auditory canal to the tympanic membrane and the middle ear system. Bone conduction, performed with an oscillator placed on the mastoid bone, tests the ability to hear when the middle ear is bypassed and the inner ear fluid and cochlea are stimulated directly with bone vibration.</p><p>Hearing loss is defined by the pure tone threshold: normal hearing has a threshold of 0 to 20 dB, mild hearing loss from 20 to 40 dB, moderate hearing loss from 40 to 60 dB, severe hearing loss from 60 to 80 dB, and profound hearing loss greater than 80 dB.

The speech threshold is the softest level at which a child can correctly repeat 50 percent of presented "spondee" words. Spondee words are two-syllable words such as airplane, armchair, or pancake. The speech threshold is recorded in decibels and serves as a cross-check for the pure tone air-conduction thresholds. The speech threshold is typically equal to the pure tone air-conduction average, ±10 dB. The pure tone average is the average decibel score at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz.</p><p>The word discrimination score is the percentage of phonetically balanced words that a child can correctly repeat at a given sensation level. Testing is typically performed at 40 dB above the child's speech threshold. This discrimination score serves two purposes: it can establish the prognosis for the use of a hearing aid, and it helps determine the site of the lesion. A poor discrimination score usually indicates significant neural degeneration. These individuals may not be good candidates for hearing aids because the aid will amplify sound but may not permit the child to understand what is being said.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h2">Tests for young and/or uncooperative children</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Young children and some children with developmental disabilities may not be able to cooperate with pure tone or speech audiometry testing as described above.

Sound stimuli (live voice and tones) are presented in the sound field and via insert earphones. The child is visually rewarded with lighted and animated toys for turning his or her head toward the sound source. The child is conditioned to perform this task repeatedly. An experienced audiologist will use several lighted and animated toys and an intermittent reinforcement schedule to maintain the child's attention.

The child is taught to perform a simple task, such as placing a block in a bucket or a peg on a pegboard each time a sound is heard. They are expected to perform the task over and over again when they hear the sound. The detection of speech sounds is determined by the child's ability to point to simple pictures when instructed by the audiologist.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Speech understanding or speech discrimination scores are obtained in children who are able to perform the tests.

It is mediated by a neural network with afferent input from the auditory nerve and efferent output to the facial nerve. The central portion of the reflex pathway is comprised of several centers in the brain. The acoustic stapedius reflex test assesses the presence or absence of ipsilateral and contralateral stapedial contraction with sound stimulation to each ear. Normally, sound stimulation on one side produces a stapedial contraction both on the ipsilateral and contralateral side.</p><p>Acoustic stapedius reflex testing can be used to help differentiate different types of hearing loss, particularly retrocochlear hearing loss (ie, due to abnormalities of the eight cranial nerve such as a vestibular schwannoma [also called acoustic neuroma]).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h2">Electrophysiology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Electrophysiologic tests of hearing do not require behavioral responses.

These responses are recorded using electrodes placed on the head and ears of the child. A computer averages the responses, and the waveforms generated are compared with normative data. Delayed or absent waves suggest cochlear or neurologic deficits. Normal hearing or conductive hearing loss patterns can also be recognized [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Children with auditory neuropathy have absent or severely distorted ABRs with preserved OAEs [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p>Diagnostic ABR testing is distinct from automated ABR (AABR), which is commonly performed to screen newborns. AABR is a screening tool with an automated pass/fail response, whereas diagnostic ABR testing provides quantitative data (eg, waveforms) that are interpreted by trained audiologists. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4985.html" rel="external">"Screening the newborn for hearing loss", section on 'Automated auditory brainstem response'</a>.)</p><p>ABR testing estimates auditory sensitivity, and it provides useful clinical information about the integrity of the eighth nerve pathway. However, it is not a true test of hearing and should not be used alone or as a substitute for behavioral hearing testing.</p><p>ABR testing can be used to confirm behavioral hearing testing in infants and preverbal children (ie, younger than 30 months), children with developmental delay or intellectual disability, and those who are otherwise difficult to test. ABR testing should generally be performed in infants who fail the newborn hearing screen or if the parents or health care provider are concerned about hearing.

The presence of OAE suggests normal cochlear function. This test is often used as a screening test since it is quick, noninvasive, and does not require sedation. OAE tests are commonly used in newborn hearing screening programs, which are discussed separately.
