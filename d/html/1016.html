         The upright tilt table test is a component of the evaluation of selected patients with suspected vasovagal syncope (a type of reflex syncope) or orthostatic syncope, although the clinical utility of this test is limited.
        </p>
        <p>
         Syncope is a clinical syndrome of self-limited transient loss of consciousness (LOC) caused by a period of inadequate cerebral nutrient flow, most often the result of an abrupt drop in systemic blood pressure. In evaluating a patient with suspected syncope, other causes of LOC and collapse should be excluded  (

         </span>
         The upright tilt table test is a component of the evaluation of selected patients with syncope. However, the role for tilt table testing is limited since the initial diagnostic evaluation (without tilt testing) by experienced clinicians is often diagnostic in patients with vasovagal syncope, and tilt table testing has limited reproducibility and diagnostic accuracy (see
         <a class="local">
          'Test performance'
         </a>
         below). Interpretation of test results requires careful evaluation of the patient’s overall clinical presentation. Despite criticism of the test’s utility, a strong argument can be made for retaining it in the overall diagnostic toolkit [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In general, our approach to tilt table testing is consistent with the published major society guidelines and expert recommendations [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         With the understanding that tilt table testing is an imperfect diagnostic test requiring experienced interpretation and that clinical practice varies, tilt table testing may be included as part of a comprehensive syncope evaluation for selected patients in the following settings [

          Syncope of unknown cause
         </strong>
         – For patients with recurrent episodes of syncope (or a single episode of syncope with high risk for physical injury or occupational hazard should syncope recur) with unknown cause after initial evaluation, tilt table testing is recommended. If structural heart disease is present, cardiac causes of syncope (eg, arrhythmias) should be excluded before further evaluation including tilt table testing is performed. (See

          To confirm diagnosis
         </strong>
         – For patients with suspected vasovagal or orthostatic syncope with uncertain diagnosis after the initial evaluation, tilt table testing may help confirm the diagnosis. It is particularly useful if the faint is induced by testing and when patients are able to confirm verbally that this is what they experience during spontaneous spells. The latter not only helps to confirm the diagnosis but also gives patients the confidence that the clinician has witnessed a true symptom spell and are thereby better positioned to recommend appropriate treatment.

         <strong>
          To identify the mechanism of syncope
         </strong>
         – In patients with suspected vasovagal syncope, tilt table testing is helpful to assess whether bradycardic and/or vasodepressor responses are occurring, as this influences therapy [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. For example, an individual with a predominantly vasodepressor response would be unlikely to respond to permanent cardiac pacing. (See

         <strong>
          Evaluation of autonomic system function
         </strong>
         – As part of the overall evaluation of interactions between the autonomic nervous system and the cardiovascular system. The "active standing" test may also be used as part of the evaluation procedure but does not replace the head-up tilt test; these tests supplement each other, but active standing is less thoroughly studied.

         As an example, tilt table testing is often performed in patients undergoing assessment for postural tachycardia syndrome, although the diagnostic utility of tilt testing is not well established. (See

         Similarly, tilt tests are usually avoided in pregnant patients as hypotension may potentially be harmful to the fetus.

         The patient is placed on a motorized tilt table with a foot board and safety restraints. The table should be capable of smoothly and rapidly moving the patient passively from a supine position to a head-up position between 60 to 70 degrees and quickly (in &lt;10 seconds) returning the patient to a horizontal supine position to minimize the duration of any precipitated asystole and/or hypotension [

         Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) and beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) monitoring are employed throughout the test. Careful monitoring of both is required, because while many patients have a pronounced cardioinhibitory response detectable by ECG, many others have vasodepressor episodes (characterized by symptomatic hypotension without marked bradycardia), and some patients exhibit simultaneous cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor responses.

         Most tests are performed using either three or six ECG leads, although there is no defined consensus on this. Conventional limb leads are commonly used as they are convenient and offer more than adequate monitoring to assess for changes in heart rate (HR) and rhythm.

         Invasive arterial monitoring is rarely used with tilt table tests, but it is acceptable as long as the line is placed at least an hour before the procedure to allow autonomic tone to return to baseline. Intermittent BP measurement via sphygmomanometer (such as an arm cuff) is

         Electroencephalogram monitoring may be warranted in certain cases, especially if pseudosyncope/pseudoseizure or ictal asystole are suspected. In the case of suspected pseudosyncope/pseudoseizure, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) may also be used to confirm that cerebral blood flow has not been diminished and that true syncope has not occurred [
         <a href="#rid12">

         To begin the test, the patient is monitored in an initial baseline horizontal supine position for 5 to 10 minutes to obtain baseline HR and BP measurements.

         The tilt table test findings should be interpreted in the context of all relevant clinical data, particularly information about the patient’s spontaneous events and other potential causes of events (eg, structural heart disease). On the other hand, while the tilt table test is frequently positive in patients with vasovagal syncope, it is not the gold standard for the diagnosis of vasovagal syncope, as it has limited sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility.
        </p>

         </a>
         increase the sensitivity of the test, these drug interventions also decrease test specificity (ie, increase the number of false positives). Thus, a positive test (with or without drug provocation) does not definitively establish that the patient’s clinical events were caused by the type of syncope induced by the test (eg, vasovagal syncope). After a positive test, the patient is asked if symptoms during the test were the same as those experienced during spontaneous events. It is crucial to interpret the test result in light of the patient’s spontaneous symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
         The vasovagal reflex seen on a tilt table test may reflect a given patient's predisposition to vasovagal syncope; however, the specific physiologic response to the tilt table test may differ from the physiology of clinical episodes. Also, the response to tilt table testing can be highly variable, and even the severity of cardioinhibitory versus vasodepressor components may differ from one test to another. Additionally, factors such as age and the use of medications during the protocol may affect the likelihood of a positive test. Older adults are less likely to have a cardioinhibitory response and more likely to have a vasodepressor response [

         ]. Ultimately, in all patients with syncope, obtaining a thorough history as part of the initial evaluation is the most important component of the diagnostic evaluation. In patients with structural heart disease, other causes of syncope should be evaluated before attributing the syncope to a vasovagal or orthostatic response. (See

          Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS)

Key features of POTS include symptoms of orthostatic intolerance (eg, lightheadedness or palpitations) with a sustained increase in heart rate (HR) ≥30 beats per minute (bpm; ≥40 bpm for individuals &lt;20 years old) within 10 minutes after the start of head-up tilt with no decline in BP. However, other common clinical factors (eg, dehydration, concomitant inflammatory conditions, anemia, hyperthyroidism, etc) should generally be excluded before tilt table testing, and should be excluded before a POTS diagnosis is made.

         Among patients experiencing syncope in response to head-up tilt, the associated physiologic features suggest the cause. Features of vasovagal syncope not present with orthostatic hypotension (OH) include latency (delay) in the BP fall after head-up tilt, an accelerating decline in BP, and a decline in HR.

          Vasovagal response
         </strong>
         – Key characteristics of the vasovagal response are a delayed accelerating fall in BP with mild to severe fall in HR. After a variable period of time after head-up tilt, there may be a gradual slight decline in BP and a gradual slight increase in HR. The rate of fall in BP then accelerates (convex curve), the rate of fall in HR also accelerates, and in some cases the HR falls to a period of asystole. LOC generally occurs within three minutes of onset of the vasovagal reaction [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. After return to the baseline position, HR and BP quickly increase.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Variations in the vasovagal response include: only a mild HR decrease, an initial brief slight HR increase followed by a greater HR decrease, and minimal change in BP and HR before accelerating declines in BP and HR  (

         ). Responses to tilt table testing appear to vary with patient age. Younger subjects are more likely to have a bradycardic response, whereas older subjects are more likely to have a vasodepressive response (ie, minimal decline in HR) [

          Orthostatic hypotension
         </strong>
         – Key features of OH are either an immediate fall in BP with or without an increase in HR ("immediate OH") or a delayed ("classic") hypotensive response occurring within three to five minutes after assuming upright posture; some patients may exhibit both forms. Further, patients with severe autonomic failure syndromes (eg, pure autonomic failure, Parkinson disease) may exhibit an abrupt drop of pressure with upright posture that does not recover and may become sufficiently severe to necessitate test termination.

         Immediately after head-up tilt, the BP declines at a decelerating rate (concave curve) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. After the first three minutes of head-up tilt, the BP may continue to decline considerably. The HR may increase in response to the fall in BP but if HR control is impaired there may be no or only slight increase in HR. The latter complicates prevention of OH, which typically demands therapies that further increase supine BP.

Additional supportive observations include tightly closed eyes and a prolonged period of apparent LOC (typically &gt;2 to 3 minutes even after return to supine posture). If an electroencephalogram is recorded during the test, it does not show the typical slowing that occurs in true syncope. (See

          Indications for tilt table testing
         </strong>
         – The upright tilt table test is a component of the evaluation of selected patients with syncope. The role for tilt table testing is limited since the initial diagnostic evaluation (without tilt testing) is often diagnostic in patients with vasovagal syncope, and tilt table testing has limited reproducibility and diagnostic accuracy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Test performance'

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         However, a positive test that reproduces patient symptoms may not only be helpful diagnostically but may also increase patient confidence that an accurate diagnosis has been made.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         With the understanding that tilt table testing is an imperfect diagnostic test requiring experienced interpretation and that clinical practice varies, tilt table testing may be included as part of the complete syncope evaluation for selected patients in the following settings:

          Equipment and procedure
         </strong>
         – Upright tilt table testing is typically performed in an electrophysiology laboratory or dedicated procedure room using a special motorized tilt table that raises to 60 to 70 degrees with rapid return to a horizontal position. The passive (drug-free) phase is 20 to 45 minutes long. If the initial passive phase is negative, a drug provocation phase using

          Interpretation
         </strong>
         – The tilt table test findings should be interpreted in the context of all relevant clinical data, particularly information about the patient’s spontaneous events and other potential causes of events (eg, structural heart disease). Although the tilt table test is frequently positive in patients with vasovagal syncope, it is not the gold standard for the diagnosis of vasovagal syncope, as it has limited sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility.

          Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS)
         </strong>
         – Key features include symptoms of orthostatic intolerance (lightheadedness, palpitations, fading vision, presyncope, difficulty concentrating, or headache) with a sustained increase in heart rate (HR) ≥30 beats per minute (bpm; ≥40 bpm for individuals &lt;20 years old) within 10 minutes after the start of head-up tilt with no decline in blood pressure (BP). However, other factors such as dehydration should be excluded before tilt table testing. (See

         – After a variable period of time after head-up tilt there is commonly a mild decrease in BP (generally &lt;10 mm Hg decline in systolic BP) and mild increase in HR (by ≤10 percent). The patient may or may not experience dizziness during this nondiagnostic response.

          Test performance
         </strong>
         – The sensitivity and specificity of tilt table testing are uncertain given the lack of a clinical gold standard. Reported sensitivity rates for passive phase testing have ranged from 13 to 75 percent and specificity may be greater than 90 percent. Drug provocation yields higher sensitivity but at the expense of a lower specificity.
