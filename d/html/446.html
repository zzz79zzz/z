         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         ]. High-quality prenatal care can prevent or lead to timely recognition and treatment of maternal and fetal complications. Complications of pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in females of reproductive age globally [

        <p>
         This topic will discuss the initial prenatal assessment (which may require more than one visit) in the United States. Most of these issues are common to pregnancies worldwide. Preconception care, ongoing prenatal care after the initial prenatal assessment, and issues related to patient counseling are reviewed separately.

         </span>
         There is evidence that prenatal care confers some health benefits, although how it does so and the types and magnitude of benefits appear to be complex and multifactorial [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. Prenatal care has many components, including timing of initiation of care, number and spacing of visits, type and quality of content (eg, assessment of risk, conditions screened for, patient education/counseling), clinical provider type/training, setting for provision of prenatal care, ancillary services (eg, nutrition, management of substance use, psychosocial support services, economic support), and prenatal care systems issues [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. The effectiveness of many of these components or packages of components generally has not been rigorously evaluated.
        </p>
        <p>
         The following examples are findings from meta-analyses of randomized trials of one or more components of prenatal care:

          Special assistance/support versus standard care

         – Special assistance may include emotional support, tangible support (eg, direct assistance, home visits), and informational support. A meta-analysis of randomized trials found that programs offering special assistance for pregnant people at risk for giving birth to a low birth weight (LBW) infant may have favorable effects compared with routine prenatal care, but the confidence intervals suggest that a true effect, if present, would not be large [

          Reduced versus standard number of prenatal visits
         </strong>
         – The number of visits for standard prenatal care varies among countries; therefore, what constitutes a reduced number of visits also varies. In a meta-analysis of trials of provision of prenatal care for low-risk pregnancies, patients in the reduced visit group in high-income countries had 8 to 12 prenatal visits, whereas many patients in the reduced visits group in low- and middle-income country trials had fewer than five prenatal visits.

         Perinatal mortality – When compared with standard care in low-risk pregnancies, reduced visits appeared to increase perinatal mortality (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.00-1.31, five trials, &gt;56,000 infants, moderate-quality evidence) [

         A summary of evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews on the effects of antenatal interventions for preventing stillbirth for low-risk or unselected pregnancies concluded that, while most interventions were unable to demonstrate a clear effect in reducing stillbirth or perinatal death, the following interventions were beneficial: balanced energy/protein supplements, midwife-led models of care, training versus not training traditional birth attendants, and antenatal cardiotocography [

         Respectful maternity care is variably defined but broadly involves absence of disrespectful conduct toward the pregnant individual (eg, physical/verbal/sexual abuse, lack of confidentiality, unnecessary examinations/procedures, discrimination, neglect/abandonment, poor communication, physical constraints) and promotion of respectful conduct (eg, informed consent/shared decision-making; dignity, respect, and privacy in interactions; equitable care; quality care; safe environment). A systematic review found that validated tools to measure respectful maternity care were available but the optimal tool was unclear [

         Prenatal care should be initiated in the first trimester, ideally by 10 weeks of gestation since some prenatal screening and diagnostic tests can be performed at 10 to 11 weeks of gestation. Early initiation of care is also useful to establish gestational age and early baseline maternal measurements (eg, weight [body mass index], blood pressure, laboratory evaluation [in patients with chronic diseases]) and provide early social service support and intervention, when warranted.
        </p>
        <p>
         The percentage of pregnant patients who initiate prenatal care in the first trimester is one of the standard clinical performance measures used to assess the quality of maternal health care. In the United States, approximately 57 percent of federally funded community health centers met the Healthy People 2020 baseline for patients initiating prenatal care in the first trimester (78 percent), and only 38 percent met the Healthy People 2020 target (85 percent) [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>

         <a href="#rid16">
          16

         ]. Less than 50 percent of pregnant people in resource-limited regions received early antenatal care versus over 80 percent in resource-abundant regions; more than 80 percent of pregnant people in the highest income group received early antenatal care versus 25 percent of those in the lowest income group.

          Standard one-on-one care
         </strong>
         – Prenatal care is generally provided by midwives, obstetrician-gynecologists, family medicine physicians, and/or maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) subspecialists. Midwives and family medicine physicians generally provide prenatal care for patients with pregnancies in which major complications are not anticipated. Obstetrician-gynecologists are specialists who provide prenatal care for uncomplicated and some complicated pregnancies. MFM clinicians are subspecialist obstetrician-gynecologists with expertise for managing high-risk, complicated pregnancies.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Midwifery-led care and collaboration between midwives and physicians are common models of prenatal care, influenced by the medical/obstetric needs and personal preferences of the pregnant person as well as local licensing regulations. (See

         Prenatal doulas and prenatal educators are ancillary providers who provide education and support. Prenatal educators tend to deliver information in a group setting. Prenatal doulas work one-on-one with their patient and may serve as a coach. Birth doulas provide education, support, and advocacy during childbirth (see

          Group prenatal care
         </strong>
         – Group prenatal care is an alternative means of providing prenatal care in which participants with the same month of expected delivery receive the majority of their care in a group setting. The only private times between patient and clinician are during the initial prenatal assessment, when health concerns involving need for privacy arise, and during cervical assessment late in pregnancy. The majority of the visit, which may last two hours, involves facilitated group discussion, education, and skills building to address explicit learning objectives in prenatal care, childbirth preparation, and postpartum and parenting roles.

          Subspecialty obstetric care
         </strong>
         – MFM subspecialists are obstetrician-gynecologists with additional training in the area of high-risk, complicated pregnancies. A high-risk pregnancy has been defined as one in which the mother, fetus, or newborn is at risk of death or residual injury and thus requires additional resources, procedures, or specialized care to optimize outcome [

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Referral to an MFM subspecialist is appropriate for individuals with chronic health conditions or serious acute disorders, those who have experienced pregnancy complications in the past, and those who develop complications during their current pregnancy; this decision depends on the obstetrician-gynecologist's level of expertise with the specific problem.

         – At or prior to the first prenatal visit, it is efficient for the patient to complete a questionnaire detailing their psychosocial, medical, obstetric, and family history.

         Although rare, patients should be queried about a history of phenylketonuria, which is detected on newborn screening. If the patient does not volunteer the diagnosis because they are no longer on a restricted diet, asking about dietary restrictions during childhood might reveal the diagnosis. Elevated serum phenylalanine concentration during early pregnancy in a mother with phenylketonuria or hyperphenylalaninemia can result in phenylalanine embryopathy, which can be prevented by dietary restriction of phenylalanine intake.

         Mental health and level of stress (including depression screening, access to interpersonal support, self-esteem/agency issues). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) suggests screening patients for depression and anxiety at the initial prenatal visit, later in pregnancy, and at postpartum visits using a standardized, validated tool, such as the PHQ-9 or Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale  (

          table 7
         </a>
         ), which assesses severity of anxiety. Practices may distribute questionnaires at check-in for patients to complete or have staff distribute or verbally administer questionnaires along with measuring vital signs. The provider can further evaluate patients who screen positive. Systems should be in place to ensure timely access to assessment and diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate monitoring and follow-up based on severity.

         If the initial blood pressure is elevated, the clinician should attempt to find records of prepregnancy blood pressures to document whether the patient has chronic (preexisting) hypertension (ie, elevated blood pressure: systolic 120 to 129 mmHg and diastolic &lt;80 mmHg, stage 1 hypertension: systolic 130 to 139 mmHg or diastolic 80 to 89 mmHg, stage 2 hypertension: systolic ≥140 mmHg or diastolic ≥90 mmHg). This information can be important in establishing the correct diagnosis (chronic hypertension versus preeclampsia versus gestational hypertension) if blood pressure increases in the second half of pregnancy. If blood pressure is measured using an automated device, it should have been properly validated in a pregnant population [

         A complete physical examination is performed, with special attention to uterine size and shape and evaluation of the adnexa. The size-gestational age correlation is learned by experience and is often described in terms of fruit (eg, for singleton pregnancies: 6 to 8 week size = plum, 8 to 10 week size = orange, 10 to 12 week size = grapefruit), despite the imprecision of this terminology. When the uterine size on physical examination differs from that predicted by menstrual dating, early sonographic assessment is indicated. Causes for a discrepancy between the actual uterine size and that predicted by the last menstrual period include uterine fibroids, uterine malposition (eg, retroverted uterus), multiple gestation, and incorrect last menstrual date.

          Gestational age
         </strong>
         – Ultrasound examination in the first trimester to determine gestational age is particularly important when menses are irregular, the last menstrual period is unknown or uncertain, in patients who conceive while using hormonal contraception, and when the uterine size is discordant with menstrual dates. Routine early (before 20 weeks of gestation) ultrasound examination provides a better estimation of gestational age than menstrual dates, resulting in significant reductions in the frequency of labor induction for postterm pregnancy and tocolysis for suspected preterm labor. More accurate estimation of EDD may also reduce planned cesarean birth before 39 weeks of gestation resulting from misdiagnosis of gestational age. These data are reviewed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5391.html" rel="external">

         The assessment of appropriate fetal/neonatal size is based upon the expected weight for gestational age. If gestational age is overestimated, then an appropriately grown fetus/neonate may be incorrectly classified as growth restricted or small for gestational age (SGA) and receive inappropriate intervention. However, in a 2015 Cochrane review of trials of routine/revealed ultrasound versus selective/concealed ultrasound before the

         Patients undergoing any screening test should understand the difference between a screening test and diagnostic test. This is particularly important in genetic screening, in which couples need to understand what is and is not being screened for, the interpretation of screen-positive and -negative results, the possibility of false-positive and -negative results, possible follow-up invasive or noninvasive testing, and possible reproductive choices.

         We believe that all pregnant patients should be offered prenatal genetic screening (serum biomarker screening with or without nuchal translucency or cell-free DNA screening) and should have the option of having an invasive procedure for diagnostic testing instead of noninvasive screening (regardless of maternal age), in agreement with ACOG guidance [

         Diagnostic testing involves performing genetic studies on samples (eg, chorionic villi or amniocytes) obtained by an invasive procedure, typically chorionic villus biopsy or amniocentesis, to identify fetuses who are aneuploid. (See

         Assessment of cell-free DNA in the maternal circulation to screen for trisomy 21, trisomy 18, trisomy 13, and sex chromosome aneuploidies is an increasingly popular option. (See

         Assessment of maternal serum levels of specific biochemical markers associated with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) and trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome), with or without assessment of specific ultrasound markers, is another option. This approach may lead to detection of fetal conditions beyond the primary targets. (See

         Either approach is acceptable if the patient receives appropriate pretest genetic counseling to make an informed choice, including no screening or testing. The cost can differ substantially depending on the approach and is another factor for the patient to consider.

          Fetal anomaly screening

         </span>
         Increasingly, a first-trimester fetal anatomy scan is performed before, in conjunction with, or after first-trimester aneuploidy screening. Detection of fetal anomalies in the first trimester is limited by small fetal size, ongoing fetal development, and maternal habitus. Nevertheless, ultrasound technology is rapidly progressing and assessment of fetal anatomy in the first trimester is becoming more widely available. In a 2017 systematic review of 30 studies from 1991 to 2014, the sensitivity of first-trimester ultrasound screening for detection of fetal anomalies in low-risk or unselected populations was 32 percent (95% CI 22-43 percent) and, in high-risk populations, 61 percent (95% CI 38-82 percent) [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. When only major anomalies were considered, sensitivity in low-risk or unselected populations was 46 percent. An anomaly of any type was present in 1.8 in 100 fetuses in low-risk pregnancies and 6.6 in 100 fetuses in high-risk pregnancies; a major anomaly was present in 1 in 100 fetuses in low-risk pregnancies. No information was available on specific anomalies. Although there was considerable heterogeneity among these studies and sonographic equipment and expertise improved over the 23-year study period and since the study was done, the findings affirm both the potential benefits and limitations of the first-trimester fetal anatomic survey. Most patients will need a second-trimester survey to provide a more reliable assessment of fetal anatomy.
        </p>
        <p>
         The type and order of testing depend on patient preference, which is often influenced by insurance coverage. As an example, for patients who elect genetic screening rather than testing, many will have an ultrasound at 10 to 13 weeks to confirm gestational age and fetal heart activity, determine the number of fetuses, assess for aneuploidy markers such as enlarged nuchal translucency, and evaluate early fetal anatomy, acknowledging that early fetal anatomy is best evaluated at the latter part of this interval (12 to 13 weeks). Blood for cell-free DNA screening is often drawn at this visit; however, patients with enlarged nuchal translucency or multiple soft markers may opt for diagnostic testing instead of screening based on the sonographic findings. If the ultrasound is normal, the patient returns at 18 to 20 weeks for a detailed anatomy scan. For patients who opt for diagnostic testing rather than screening, chorionic villus sampling (CVS) can be performed at the 10 to 13 weeks ultrasound examination. For the rare patient who prefers an amniocentesis to CVS, we suggest an ultrasound at 10 to 13 weeks to assess for indications for earlier genetic testing (eg, enlarged nuchal translucency) and if none are found, the patient is reassured that waiting until 15 to 16 weeks for the amniocentesis is reasonable.

         The clinical utility of expanding cell-free DNA testing of maternal blood to include panels of microdeletions and microduplications, rare autosomal trisomies, and monogenic disorders has not been established. Professional societies, such as the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, European and American Societies for Human Genetics, Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM), and International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis, recommend against offering expanded cell-free DNA testing as part of routine prenatal genetic screening, while endorsing its use for screening for trisomies 21, 18, and 13 and sex chromosome aneuploidy [

         Patients who desire to maximize information about the genetic status of their fetus should undergo diagnostic testing of amniocytes or chorionic villi by microarray. The potential for detecting a microdeletion/microduplication by microarray is 30- to 50-fold greater than that by cell-free DNA screening of maternal blood [

         The recommendation against expanded cell-free DNA screening was made because it is not possible to provide reliable estimates of no call rates, detection rates, false-positive rates, or positive predictive values, given the small numbers of cases detected, variable penetrance, uncertainty in the underlying prevalence, difficulty in follow-up, and lack of clinical validation based on real samples.

         Consanguinity, which is defined as the reproductive union of second cousins or closer relatives, is common in several ethnic/religious groups and increases the fetal risk for recessive disorders due to runs of homozygosity, including inborn errors of metabolism, common variable immune deficiency, some types of deafness, and congenital abnormalities with a complex etiology [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46,47

         ]. It is most common in North Africa and parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and west, central, and south Asia (eg, Pakistan, India), but consanguineous couples can be found anywhere because of local customs and immigration; thus, it is prudent to assess the possibility of consanguinity in all pregnant couples [

        </p>
        <p>
         Consanguineous couples should be offered genetic counseling to discuss the increased risk of recessive conditions in their offspring, as well as increased risks for stillbirth or perinatal mortality. First cousins share approximately one-eighth of their variants. For a variant with a frequency of 1 in 100, the chance that unrelated partners will both be carriers of the pathogenic variant is 1/100 X 1/100 = 1/10,000, whereas the chance that two first cousins will both be carriers is 1/100 X 1/8 = 1/800 [

         All pregnant patients are screened for hepatitis in each pregnancy, regardless of previous vaccination status, because prevaccination screening to exclude acute or chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is not commonly performed. The initial screen (called the triple panel) consists of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), and total hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc). If a previous triple panel was negative and the patient has had no HBV exposures since the triple panel was performed, then subsequent screening can be limited to HBsAg testing. However, patients who are at high risk for HBV infection (eg, injection drug user, sexual partner or household contact with chronic HBV) should be tested for anti-HBs and anti-HBc as well. Patients who are susceptible to infection should be offered immunization. (See

         Hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening is recommended for all pregnant individuals at the first prenatal visit of each pregnancy. The rationale is that HCV infection is increasing in females of childbearing age, risk-based screening is not consistently performed, risk-based screening alone fails to detect a sizable minority of infected individuals, and documentation of infection may affect pregnancy management (eg, avoid chorionic villus sampling and use of an internal fetal heart rate monitoring electrode) [
         <a href="#rid64">
          64-68
         </a>
         ]. In addition, knowledge of HCV status during pregnancy facilitates appropriate postpartum maternal treatment and informs infant follow-up.
        </p>
        <p>
         Initial screening or diagnostic testing for chronic HCV typically begins with an antibody test by immunoassay. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/89950.html" rel="external">

         If the antibody test is nonreactive, then chronic HCV infection is unlikely and testing can stop. (See

         Reactive HCV antibody tests should be followed with an HCV RNA test. The absence of detectable HCV RNA using a sensitive assay essentially confirms the absence of chronic HCV infection. False-negative tests for RNA are unusual. A reactive antibody test in this setting is generally a false positive or reflective of past, cleared infection. (See

         In 2020, the CDC revised their previous risk-factor-based guidance and recommended universal HCV screening during each pregnancy, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is &lt;0.1 percent [
         <a href="#rid69">
          69
         </a>
         ]. In the absence of available data for HCV prevalence, they advised health care providers to initiate universal HCV screening until they establish that the prevalence of HCV RNA positivity in their population is &lt;0.1 percent. The same year, the USPSTF recommended one-time HCV screening for asymptomatic adults aged 18 to 79 years (including pregnant persons) without known liver disease [
         <a href="#rid70">
          70
         </a>
         ]. In 2021, ACOG and the SMFM updated their hepatitis C screening guidance to recommend HCV screening for all pregnant individuals at the first prenatal visit of each pregnancy [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71
         </a>
         ]. The goal is to connect pregnant patients who screen positive for HCV with appropriate care so (1) they can begin direct-acting antiviral treatment postpartum and after completion of breastfeeding and (2) the pediatrician responsible for the care of their newborn is informed about their hepatitis C carrier status.
        </p>
        <p>
         If universal screening is not performed, risk-based screening is indicated. Several organizations have provided guidelines that describe criteria for considering an individual high risk, regardless of pregnancy status. Despite having reviewed similar data, the various guidelines are not concordant. In a study that offered screening for HCV antibody to all pregnant people presenting for prenatal care before 23 weeks of gestation, over 106,000 patients were screened, and HCV antibody seroprevalence was 2.4 cases per 1000 pregnant people (95% CI 2.1-2.7) [
         <a href="#rid72">
          72
         </a>
         ]. Factors associated with HCV antibody positivity included injection drug use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 22.9, 95% CI 8.2-64.0), blood transfusion (aOR 3.7, 95% CI 1.3-10.4), a partner with HCV (aOR 6.3, 95% CI 1.8-22.6), more than three lifetime sexual partners (aOR 5.3, 95% CI 1.4-19.8), and smoking (aOR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.6). A composite of any of these risk factors had 91 percent sensitivity for detecting HCV antibody. These findings suggest that traditional historic risk factors for HCV screening should be expanded to include more than three lifetime sexual partners and possibly smoking. (See

         Pregnant people with signs or symptoms of thyroid disease should undergo measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level. The TSH should be interpreted using population- and trimester-specific TSH reference ranges for pregnant people, when available. If the TSH is abnormal, free or total T4 should be measured.

         The diagnosis of overt hyperthyroidism during pregnancy is based primarily upon a suppressed (&lt;0.1 milli-units/L) or undetectable (&lt;0.01 milli-units/L) serum TSH value and a free T4 and/or free T3 (or total T4 and/or total T3) measurement that exceeds the normal range for pregnancy.

          82-85

Criteria for selecting candidates for targeted TSH screening (eg, personal or family history of thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, or clinical suspicion of thyroid disease), diagnostic evaluation (free T4, TPO antibodies) of patients with an elevated trimester-specific serum TSH concentration, and decision-making regarding treatment of these patients are reviewed separately.

         Whether all pregnant people should undergo serological screening for toxoplasmosis is controversial. It is a routine practice is some areas with a high prevalence of infection, but this is uncommon. Maternal acquisition of toxoplasmosis is via environmental exposure (eg, ingestion of unwashed fruit or vegetables contaminated with oocytes in soil or water) and ingestion of undercooked or cured meat from infected animals.

Infected individuals are often unaware of their infection and the potential seriousness of the condition (eg, maternal cardiovascular/gastrointestinal complications, transmission to the fetus, hydrops fetalis). Ideally, screening is performed before pregnancy because antitrypanosomal drugs prevent congenital infection and are contraindicated during pregnancy. If prepregnancy screening was not performed, testing in pregnancy is still useful because early diagnosis and treatment of infected infants improves the prognosis of congenital Chagas disease and maternal treatment can be initiated postpartum, if appropriate.

          Effectiveness
         </strong>
         – Prenatal care confers some health benefits, although how it does so and the types and magnitude of these benefits appear to be complex and multifactorial. It has many components, and the effectiveness of many of these components or packages of components generally has not been evaluated in randomized trials. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Effectiveness'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Goals
         </strong>
         – The major goal of prenatal care is to help ensure the birth of a healthy newborn while minimizing maternal risk. This requires identification of individuals at increased risk of medical or obstetric complications; anticipation of problems, with intervention (if possible) to prevent or minimize morbidity; and health promotion, education, support, and shared decision-making. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Goals'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         This is achieved, in part, by taking a comprehensive medical, obstetric, psychosocial, and family history; establishing an accurate estimated date of delivery; and appropriate laboratory testing. Forms can be helpful for this purpose. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Components of the initial prenatal visit'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Timing
         </strong>
         – Prenatal care should be initiated in the first trimester, ideally by 10 weeks of gestation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Timing'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Care provider(s)
         </strong>
         – Prenatal care is generally provided to individual patients by midwives, obstetrician-gynecologists, or family medicine clinicians. Group prenatal care is an appealing alternative for some patients. Referral to a maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) specialist is appropriate for patients with chronic health conditions, patients who have experienced pregnancy complications in the past, and patients who develop complications during their current pregnancy.

         <a class="local">

          Use of ultrasound
         </strong>
         – Routine early (before 20 weeks of gestation) ultrasound examination provides better estimation of gestational age than menstrual dates (

          calculator 1

          calculator 2
         </a>
         ), resulting in reduced frequency of labor induction for postterm pregnancy and use of tocolysis for suspected preterm labor. Early ultrasound examination can lead to earlier detection of clinically unsuspected fetal malformations and multiple pregnancy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Calculating the estimated date of delivery'
         </a>

          Aneuploidy screening
         </strong>
         – All pregnant people are offered aneuploidy screening or a diagnostic invasive procedure (genetic studies on samples obtained by chorionic villus biopsy or amniocentesis) before 20 weeks of gestation, regardless of maternal age.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Screening tests fall into two categories: (1) Assessment of maternal serum levels of specific biochemical markers associated with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), with or without assessment of specific ultrasound markers and (2) Assessment of cell-free DNA in the maternal circulation. Either approach is acceptable as long as the patient receives appropriate pretest genetic counseling to make an informed choice and is aware that costs may differ substantially. (See

          'Aneuploidy screening and diagnosis'

          Hemoglobinopathy
         </strong>
         – Red cell indices are used to screen for carriers of hemoglobinopathies; an MCV less than 80 femtoliters (fL) in the absence of iron deficiency denotes patients at increased risk for alpha or beta thalassemia. However, a complete blood count (CBC) and MCV may not detect carriers of hemoglobin S, C, or E; thus, maternal hemoglobin analysis by either high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or isoelectric focusing (IEF) is recommended to identify these abnormal hemoglobins.
