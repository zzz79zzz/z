         Acute stress disorder (ASD) is characterized by acute stress reactions that may occur in the initial month after a person is exposed to a traumatic event. The disorder includes symptoms of intrusion, dissociation, negative mood, avoidance, and arousal. Some patients who experience ASD go on to experience posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is diagnosed only after four weeks following exposure to trauma.
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment for ASD is aimed at curtailing symptoms of acute stress responses and preventing their development into PTSD.
        </p>
        <p>
         The treatment of ASD is discussed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, and diagnosis of ASD are discussed separately. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, diagnosis, and treatment of PTSD are also discussed separately.

          APPROACH TO TREATMENT

         </span>
         We suggest trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) as first-line treatment of patients with acute stress disorder (ASD) rather than other psychotherapies or medication. There are no clinical trials comparing trauma-focused CBT with other interventions with efficacy in the treatment of ASD or prevention of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Trauma-focused CBT is the most extensively studied treatment for ASD with the most extensive evidence of efficacy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Trauma-focused CBT'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         CBT for ASD patients should typically be provided by a trained clinician over six weekly sessions of 60 to 90 minutes; additional sessions can be added if necessary. The intervention is typically delivered at least two weeks after trauma exposure. This allows the individual additional time for transient symptoms to abate and for post-trauma stressors to ease. The commencement of therapy should be timed with respect for other stressful events stemming from the trauma. The patient may find it difficult to focus attention on therapy if distracted by trauma-related events or experiences, such as pain, surgery, legal proceedings, relocation, or other stressors.
        </p>
        <p>
         For some patients with ASD, it is necessary to delay exposure therapy for several months into the PTSD phase for others, including patients with:
        </p>

         Extreme avoidance or dissociative responses, because these presentations may indicate extreme stress responses that may be complicated by exposure.

        <p>
         Exposure, a component of trauma-focused CBT, has been found to be more effective when provided as monotherapy than cognitive restructuring in patients with ASD [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The trial randomly assigned 90 individuals who experienced trauma and met diagnostic criteria for ASD to receive imaginal and in vivo exposure, cognitive restructuring, or to a waitlist control group. After six weeks of treatment, fewer patients in the exposure group met diagnostic criteria for PTSD as compared with those in the cognitive restructuring or waitlist groups. At six months, patients in the exposure group remained less likely to meet PTSD criteria and were 2.8 times more likely to achieve remission of their initial symptoms than patients in the waitlist group.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with ASD and acute, intense anxiety, agitation, or sleep disturbance in the immediate period following the traumatic event, we suggest adjunctive treatment with a benzodiazepine rather than other medications. Clinical trials have not yielded sufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of benzodiazepines in comparison with placebo or with other medications in patients who have experienced acute trauma or have been diagnosed with ASD. In our clinical experience, benzodiazepines can reduce symptoms of anxiety, agitation, and sleep disturbance. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Benzodiazepines'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Benzodiazepine treatment should be limited to two to four weeks. Prolonged benzodiazepine treatment may be detrimental. As an example,

          Exposure
         </strong>
         – Exposure therapy assists patients in confronting their feared memories and situations in a therapeutic manner. Re-experiencing the trauma through exposure allows it to be emotionally processed so that it can become less painful [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. By repeatedly confronting traumatic memories or safe reminders of a traumatic experience, the individual can experience them safely, until they no longer elicit such strong emotions and can see that they are not dangerous.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Trauma-focused CBT for ASD optimally includes both imaginal exposure and in vivo exposure. In imaginal exposure, the patient provides a detailed narrative of his or her traumatic experience in which the patient orally relives the traumatic experience with the therapist (usually for at least 30 minutes), with the intention of achieving extinction learning. By reliving the memory repeatedly, the patient can learn that the salient reminder of the trauma (eg, the memory) is no longer a threat and does not result in aversive outcomes. Based on a similar mechanism, in vivo exposure is conducted to ensure that the patient is not avoiding feared situations in their daily life, thereby consolidating the learning that reminders are no longer signaling threat.

         Trauma-focused CBT reduces symptoms of ASD.
         <strong>
         </strong>
         A meta-analysis of three clinical trials with 93 patients with ASD found that trauma-focused CBT reduced ASD symptoms compared with control conditions [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-8
         </a>
         ]. As an example, a clinical trial of 30 patients with acute stress disorder compared cognitive processing therapy (a variant of CBT) with supportive counseling, finding no difference in primary outcomes in [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. This could suggest that cognitive processing therapy is not as effective as other types of trauma-focused CBT for the disorder; however, our conclusions are tempered by the trial’s small sample size and the absence of head-to-head trials of cognitive processing therapy and other trauma-focused CBT interventions.

A meta-analysis of five randomized clinical trials found that CBT reduced the proportion of patients meeting diagnostic criteria for PTSD at six months (relative risk 0.56, 95% CI 0.42-0.76), with continued benefit seen at three years of follow-up. A subsequent meta-analysis of 10 randomized clinical trials found that CBT to have a moderate effect size at initial follow-up (effect size = 0.54) that was reduced to a small effect size at extended follow-up (effect size = 0.34) [

Two hundred and forty-two patients were randomized to receive prolonged exposure, cognitive therapy, a waitlist control,

In a trial of 242 patients randomized to one of five treatment groups, patients assigned to receive cognitive therapy were less likely to have PTSD after five months compared with patients in the waitlist group (18.2 versus 58.2 percent), but no difference between groups was seen at nine months [

         For patients with acute stress disorder (ASD), we suggest first-line treatment with trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy rather than other psychotherapies or medication (

         Trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy typically includes patient education, cognitive restructuring, and exposure. The goals of treatment are to reduce the severity of ASD symptoms and to prevent the development of posttraumatic stress disorder. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Approach to treatment'

         Trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy is typically delivered at least two weeks after trauma exposure. Some patients may benefit from further delay in starting exposure (eg, suicidal, acutely grieving, or highly avoidant following trauma) so that more urgent problems can be addressed. (See
         <a class="local">

         For patients with ASD and intense anxiety, agitation, or sleep disturbance in the immediate period following the traumatic event, we suggest short-term (up to four weeks) treatment with a benzodiazepine (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C

         Despite extensive use following disasters and other traumatic events, psychological debriefing (also known as "critical incident stress debriefing") has
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         been found to be effective in preventing PTSD among individuals experiencing a traumatic event.
