Although the most marked change is a reversal in the ratio of squamous cell cancers to adenocarcinomas [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], there has also been a shift in stage distribution. The incidence of superficial esophageal cancer (invading no deeper than the submucosa) is increasing, particularly in Asian countries where screening for upper digestive tract cancers is common [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. A similar trend has been seen in the United States and attributed, at least in part, to routine endoscopic surveillance for malignancy and high-grade dysplasia (HGD) in patients with Barrett's esophagus, a complication of longstanding gastroesophageal reflux disease [<a href="#rid5">5-7</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2276.html" rel="external">"Barrett's esophagus: Pathogenesis and malignant transformation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2236.html" rel="external">"Barrett's esophagus: Surveillance and management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2274.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and pathobiology of esophageal cancer"</a>.)</p><p>For many years, the standard treatment for both HGD and superficial esophageal cancer has been esophagectomy. High cure rates were achieved but at the cost of treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Endoscopic approaches to definitive therapy (eg, endoscopic resection) have increasingly been used in this country following encouraging early reports from Japan and Europe. However, these techniques are only appropriate for patients who have a very low risk of lymph node metastases or who are poor candidates for esophageal surgery.</p><p>This topic review will focus on treatment strategies for superficial esophageal cancer. The epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of esophageal cancer; surgical techniques for esophagectomy; and combined modality approaches for the treatment of muscle-invasive disease are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2274.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and pathobiology of esophageal cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2502.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of esophageal cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2663.html" rel="external">"Endoscopic ultrasound for evaluating patients with esophageal cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2530.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of resectable esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancers"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2478.html" rel="external">"Radiation therapy, chemoradiotherapy, neoadjuvant approaches, and postoperative adjuvant therapy for localized cancers of the esophagus"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">INITIAL ASSESSMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A critical component of choosing the appropriate management strategy for a superficial esophageal cancer is an accurate assessment of disease extent. Submucosal involvement is the most important prognostic determinant for early esophageal cancers because the presence of lymphatic vessels within the submucosa facilitates dissemination of cancer cells. Thus an accurate assessment of tumor extent is needed to direct therapy. For most patients, this entails endoscopic resection (ER), high-frequency endoscopic ultrasound, and in selected cases, integrated positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Pathologic subclassification and the risk of nodal metastases</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Early esophageal cancers are those that are classified as Tis (high-grade dysplasia [HGD], which includes all noninvasive neoplastic epithelial that was formerly called carcinoma in situ) or T1 tumors, which are split into T1a and T1b subcategories depending on the depth of invasion  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111221" href="/z/d/graphic/111221.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The risk of nodal metastases is higher for T1b than for T1a tumors [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. In one series, of 3963 patients derived from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) who were treated surgically for localized esophageal cancer, the risk of nodal metastases for T1a and T1b tumors was 5 versus 16.6 percent [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>However, this classification by itself is inadequate to distinguish clinically meaningful differences in lymph node involvement among T1a versus T1b esophageal cancers [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. There are two main strategies to further refine the assessment of nodal involvement: subclassification of tumor (T) status, and use of pathologic factors other than depth of invasion. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2502.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of esophageal cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H872486681"><span class="h3">More comprehensive T stage subclassification</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A more comprehensive subclassification scheme has been proposed by Japanese investigators for early esophageal cancers and is useful for determining prognosis and selecting treatment  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64349" href="/z/d/graphic/64349.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. According to this classification, mucosal tumors are divided into three types based on the depth of invasion:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>M1 – Limited to the epithelial layer</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>M2 – Invades the lamina propria</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>M3 – Invades into but not through the muscularis mucosa</p><p></p><p>M1 tumors correspond to the Tis stage in the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage definition, while M2 and M3 tumors would be considered T1a lesions.</p><p>Tumors invading the submucosa are subclassified as follows [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>SM1 – Penetrates the shallowest one-third of the submucosa</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>SM2 – Penetrates into the intermediate one-third of the submucosa</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>SM3 – Penetrates the deepest one-third of the submucosa</p><p></p><p>All of these subcategories would be considered T1b disease according to the AJCC stage definitions, regardless of histology  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52078" href="/z/d/graphic/52078.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62895" href="/z/d/graphic/62895.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p>The incidence of lymph node metastases in published series of patients with early esophageal cancer, stratified according to depth of invasion, is summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64478" href="/z/d/graphic/64478.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) [<a href="#rid12">12-21</a>]. The following conclusions can be drawn from these data:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Although there are fewer data on superficial adenocarcinomas, rates of nodal metastases are no higher [<a href="#rid18">18</a>] than with squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), which have been more extensively investigated.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>M1 and M2 tumors are not associated with lymph node metastases and hence are well suited to endoscopic treatment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The risk of nodal metastases with M3 tumors is zero in many studies, but as high as 12 percent in others  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64478" href="/z/d/graphic/64478.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Patients with evidence of lymphovascular invasion are the most likely to harbor lymph node metastases:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a report of 464 consecutive patients with superficial esophageal cancer who underwent radical esophagectomy with node dissection, only four of the 38 patients with M3 lesions and no lymphatic invasion had lymph node metastases, whereas five of the 12 patients with lymphatic invasion were found to have nodal metastases [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a second report of 402 patients with superficial esophageal SCC, the cumulative five-year metastasis rate (both lymphatic and distant) in patients with M3 cancers was 8.7 percent; among patients with mucosal cancer (M1, 2, or 3), the five-year rate of metastases with and without lymphovascular invasion was 47 versus 0.7 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Thus, for patients with M3 tumors without evidence of lymphovascular invasion, endoscopic therapy is also a reasonable strategy [<a href="#rid24">24-26</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>All submucosal tumors have a risk of lymph node metastases. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) should be avoided in these patients, as it exposes the patients to an unacceptably high risk of both local and distant recurrence [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>]. As an example, one series reported on outcomes after esophagectomy for 23 patients who had undergone an EMR for adenocarcinoma with submucosal involvement and negative margins [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Twenty-six percent had nodal disease at the time of esophagectomy, and 48 percent had residual disease in the resected specimen.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, this has not been seen in all series, particularly when patients were carefully selected for shallow invasion into the submucosa and otherwise favorable histologic features [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. In this study of 66 patients who underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for low-risk T1b esophageal cancer (macroscopically polypoid or flat, good to moderate differentiation, no lymphovascular invasion), there were eight patients with noncurative resections and of the 53 who achieved a complete ER, 10 (19 percent) had residual/recurrent disease, predominantly amenable to further ER. Long-term remission was achieved by 51 of the 53 patients (96 percent) and only one patient developed a nodal metastasis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Available guidelines are disparate. While one guideline from Japan suggests that selected superficial submucosal esophageal squamous cell cancers with shallow invasion (SM1, defined as ≤200 micrometers in depth) may be considered for ESD by expert endoscopists [<a href="#rid29">29</a>], other guidelines suggest that the presence of any submucosal invasion should prompt esophagectomy, regardless of histology [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. NCCN guidelines do not include endoscopic management as an option for T1b tumors, regardless of histology. In our view, esophagectomy with therapeutic lymphadenectomy provides the greatest chance for potentially curative therapy in this setting. (See <a class="local">'Esophagectomy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Notably, most centers in North America have not adopted the Japanese classification system and instead rely on the broad AJCC T1a versus T1b classification scheme (any invasion of submucosa, regardless of depth) for superficial esophageal cancer  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52078" href="/z/d/graphic/52078.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62895" href="/z/d/graphic/62895.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H872486694"><span class="h3">Other features</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In addition to depth of invasion, other tumor features that may impact on the risk of lymph node metastases are macroscopic appearance of the lesion (flat-type versus non-flat [elevated, depressed, or ulcerated]), tumor size, the presence of lymphovascular invasion, and possibly histologic grade of differentiation [<a href="#rid10">10,13,14,21,31-33</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the Shimada series described above, the risk of positive nodes was significantly higher for non-flat type lesions as compared with flat-type lesions (37 versus 17 percent, respectively), while it was no different among patients with histologically poorly differentiated versus differentiated lesions (31 and 29 percent, respectively) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Tumors with lymphatic invasion also had a higher rate of nodal metastases.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>On the other hand, in the NCDB series described above, predictors of nodal metastases other than depth of invasion included tumor size &gt;2 cm and intermediate/high-grade (versus low-grade) lesions [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. As an example, 0.5 percent of low-grade T1a lesions &lt;2 cm had nodal metastases. Among T1b tumors, 17 percent of all patients had at least one positive node, which decreased to 8.9 percent for low-grade lesions &lt;2 cm.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Accuracy of EUS in the staging evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As noted above, the depth of invasion is an important indicator of the risk for nodal metastases in patients with superficial esophageal cancer. At present, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the most accurate noninvasive method to assess depth of invasion  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73301" href="/z/d/graphic/73301.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2657.html" rel="external">"Endoscopic ultrasound: Examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2663.html" rel="external">"Endoscopic ultrasound for evaluating patients with esophageal cancer"</a>.)</p><p>The accuracy of EUS for T staging of superficial tumors has been controversial. While an earlier meta-analysis suggested that EUS may not be as accurate for T staging in patients with early esophageal cancer compared with those with more advanced tumors [<a href="#rid34">34</a>], a subsequent larger meta-analysis found that EUS was accurate for staging T1a and T1b tumors, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.93 to 0.96 [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. However, the accuracy of EUS for T staging of superficial tumors is highly dependent on operator experience and technique.</p><p>If the EUS identifies esophageal cancer that invades the muscularis mucosa or if there is evidence of lymph node involvement, then surgical therapy is often recommended. On the other hand, if the EUS identifies only mucosal disease and the patient is potentially eligible for endoscopic treatment, an ER is then performed to precisely define the depth of invasion. The pathology result from the ER (particularly the presence or absence of lymphovascular invasion) can be used to guide the final decision as to whether endoscopic therapy alone is sufficient or if surgery should be recommended.</p><p>This approach has been questioned by some who suggest that EUS should not be used to determine which patients should go to surgery and that instead all patients with an apparently superficial esophageal cancer should undergo careful endoscopic examination with ER without EUS. This position is supported by at least two retrospective studies suggesting that the addition of EUS in this setting does not improve diagnostic accuracy of cancer invasion depth [<a href="#rid36">36,37</a>]. This subject is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2663.html" rel="external">"Endoscopic ultrasound for evaluating patients with esophageal cancer", section on 'EUS for T staging of superficial tumors'</a>.)</p><p>Given that ER provides more precise histologic staging, EUS appears to be of diminishing importance in the diagnostic workup of a superficial esophageal cancer, except to exclude that there is not deeper involvement (ie, T3 or T4 disease) or lymph nodes. Upfront EUS may not be necessary if endoscopic inspection suggests that ER is feasible. If a diagnostic ER confirms a low-risk neoplasm, the additional impact of EUS is questionable. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2673.html" rel="external">"Overview of endoscopic resection of gastrointestinal tumors"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H599683134"><span class="h2">Utility of FDG-PET</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients whose esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) findings are more advanced than just a small solitary focus ≤15 mm) with no suspicion for locally advanced disease, we obtain a PET/CT if the results might impact therapy. Importantly, the results may be confusing if the PET/CT is done after EMR, and ideally this test should precede ER. On the other hand, if the initial EGD is suggestive of superficial or nonadvanced disease, we proceed directly to EUS to locally stage the tumor, and resect if the lesion meets criteria (ie, no submucosal invasion or suspicion for nodal disease).</p><p>There is no consensus as to the role of integrated FDG-PET/CT scan in the evaluation of patients with superficial esophageal cancer. National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines suggest obtaining FDG-PET/CT for all patients with esophageal cancer, but they do not provide specific guidance for superficial cancers [<a href="#rid38">38</a>].</p><p>Clinically based assessment modalities, including PET/CT, have low diagnostic performance in superficial esophageal cancer, particularly for detecting N1 disease [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. The low sensitivity of FDG-PET in this setting is likely due to the small size of involved lymph nodes at diagnosis (median 3 mm in one study [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]).</p><p>However, the documented relationship between the depth of the primary tumor and risk for nodal metastases in superficial esophageal cancer has prompted investigations of the role of FDG positivity of the primary tumor site in predicting the risk for clinically occult nodal metastases:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In an early Japanese report of 41 patients with superficial thoracic esophageal SCCs, 51 percent were FDG avid, including 68 percent of SM2/SM3 tumors and 15 percent of M1, M2, M3, or SM1 tumors [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. FDG uptake correlated with both depth of tumor invasion and lymph node metastasis. Although no nodal metastases were detected by the FDG-PET, among the 13 patients with pathologically involved lymph nodes, FDG uptake in the primary tumor was the only identifiable risk factor for nodal metastasis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Others suggest that the extent of FDG uptake (as measured by the maximum standardized uptake value [SUV]) by the primary tumor may serve to differentiate tumors that are more versus less likely to have clinically occult nodal metastases. In this Japanese series, 40 consecutive patients diagnosed with clinical T1N0 superficial esophageal SCC underwent FDG-PET prior to esophagectomy with lymphadenectomy [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. Tumors invaded the middle submucosal layer or beyond (SM2 or higher) in 53 percent, and six (15 percent) had lymph node metastases. Analysis of the areas under the ROC curves for the maximum SUV of the primary tumor was used to predict factors involved in tumor infiltration to SM2 or beyond or clinically occult nodal metastases. The optimal SUV cutoff was 2.7. Patients with a maximum SUV ≥2.7 were 20-fold more likely to have invasion to SM2 or beyond and were eightfold more likely to have pathologically involved nodes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In another report, 80 consecutive patients with superficial esophageal cancer had a pretreatment FDG-PET; 57 then underwent esophagectomy, and 23 had ER [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. FDG uptake in the primary tumor correlated with depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, and lymphatic as well as vascular invasion. All patients with a ≥4.4 maximum SUV in the primary tumor had deeper invasion of the submucosa (SM2 to SM3 disease).

It is important to balance the risk of nodal metastases and procedural risk when counseling patients regarding their treatment options. The ideal candidate has a solitary, small (ie, &lt;1.5 cm diameter) mucosal lesion without evidence of lymphovascular invasion  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64349" href="/z/d/graphic/64349.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) within a short segment of Barrett's esophagus.

With ER, the neoplastic epithelium is excised rather than ablated, thus allowing for a definitive histologic diagnosis. A variety of techniques are available, which are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2651.html" rel="external">"Barrett's esophagus: Treatment of high-grade dysplasia or early cancer with endoscopic resection"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2673.html" rel="external">"Overview of endoscopic resection of gastrointestinal tumors"</a>.)</p><p>In general, there are two procedures available for ER. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) involves snare resection of dysplastic lesion. By contrast, for endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), endoscopic tools are used to dissect lesions from the submucosa. Lesions larger than 1.5 cm are difficult to treat with EMR since piecemeal resection is often necessary, which requires a higher level of endoscopic expertise, increases the risk of complications, and often makes it impossible to be conclusive about the completeness of the resection at the lateral margins. While ESD can remove larger lesions intact, expertise in this technique for esophageal lesions is less widely available. Nevertheless, at least some data suggest that where available, ESD is preferred over EMR [<a href="#rid50">50</a>].

Most observational series contain a small number of patients with both high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and superficial cancer (mainly treated at large centers), and the duration of follow-up in many reports is limited. The following represents the range of findings:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>One of the largest series included 349 patients with Barrett's esophagus and either HGD (n = 61) or intramucosal adenocarcinoma (n = 288) who underwent ER [<a href="#rid51">51</a>].

At a mean follow-up of 63.1 months, a complete response was found in 96.6 percent (n = 337) of treated patients. Surgery was needed in only 3.7 percent after endoscopic therapy failed. Recurrences were noted in 21.5 percent (n = 74), but no patient died from esophageal cancer.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a meta-analysis of 21 studies of ESD for early esophageal cancer, the pooled en bloc resection rate was 99 percent [<a href="#rid52">52</a>].

The most common complications of ESD were esophageal stenosis (5 percent; 95% CI 3-8 percent) and perforation (1 percent, 95% CI 0-1 percent).

Of the 36 patients who underwent potentially curative resection, five-year cause-specific survival was 100 percent, and there were no recurrences or metastases detected.

In the T1a subgroup, 46 percent were treated endoscopically, 15 percent had chemoradiotherapy, and 18 percent underwent esophagectomy. In the T1b subgroup, 23 percent had endoscopic treatment, 17 percent had chemoradiotherapy, and 51 percent underwent esophagectomy. Among the T1a patients, Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated no significant survival difference between endoscopic and surgical treatment, whereas both treatments conferred better survival over chemoradiotherapy alone.

Strictures are more common after resection of circumferential resections and this complication must be considered when deciding upon ER, especially in longer lesions.

Some argue that the majority of patients who recur can be salvaged with repeat ER, and they do not die of their disease [<a href="#rid25">25,55,56,62,63</a>]. As an example, Saeki and colleagues reported on the outcomes of esophagectomy in 40 patients after noncurative ER of deep T1a and superficial T1b lesions. There were no recurrences identified during follow-up, and five-year overall survival was 90 percent [<a href="#rid62">62</a>].</p><p>If endoscopic surveillance after ER demonstrates a local recurrence usually either esophagectomy or definitive radiotherapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy is chosen as an appropriate treatment. Most patients should be re-staged with a PET/CT in that circumstance. Several reports indicate the majority of these patients can be salvaged. One Japanese study reported on 37 patients who had salvage RT (and 25 also had chemotherapy) after previous ER. The five-year survival was 78 percent [<a href="#rid64">64</a>]. Another Japanese study reported on 160 patients after noncurative ER, 123 receiving chemoradiotherapy and 37 who underwent esophagectomy.

Although the preferred treatment for intramucosal superficial cancers has previously been surgery, endoscopic resection (ER) is our preferred approach for patients with M1 and M2 tumors, as well as those with well-differentiated M3 disease without lymphovascular invasion  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64349" href="/z/d/graphic/64349.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Esophagectomy is still preferred for patients with intramucosal M3 carcinomas with lymphovascular invasion. In addition, we still recommend esophagectomy for persistent positive margins after endoscopic therapy, recurrences that cannot be endoscopically treated, long-segment lesions not amenable to endoscopic therapy, and rarely, patient preference. Because outcomes are directly related to surgeon as well as institutional experience, patients needing esophagectomy should be referred to a high-volume center that specializes in esophageal cancer care.</p><p>Prior to the emergence of endoscopic techniques, esophagectomy was the treatment of choice for superficial esophageal cancers. The potential advantages of esophagectomy include precise pathologic staging information, the permanent removal of all Barrett's mucosa at risk to develop a malignant focus, and treatment is definitive, without the need for posttreatment surveillance or salvage therapy in the event of a local recurrence. Among the disadvantages are an average 10-day hospital stay, a substantial risk of major complications, a small but real risk of perioperative death (approximately 2 percent in high-volume centers, see below), a recovery period that can take several months, and the potential for long-term problems with swallowing.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">The volume-performance relationship</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the past, esophagectomy was associated with perioperative morbidity and mortality rates that were among the highest of all standard cancer operations as well as other major procedures such as cardiac or vascular surgery. As such, it earned a reputation as high-risk surgery, prompting reluctance on the part of clinicians to refer patients for resection, particularly if they had early-stage disease.</p><p>However, patients who undergo esophagectomy by experienced surgeons at hospitals that perform large numbers of procedures have lower perioperative mortality rates and better early clinical outcomes than those who undergo resection at lower-volume institutions [<a href="#rid66">66-74</a>]. In the most often-quoted study on the volume-performance relationship for esophagectomy, the Medicare claims database for 1998 and 1999 was analyzed to determine the relationship between surgeon and hospital volume and operative mortality [<a href="#rid66">66</a>]. In general, these were older adult patients with significant comorbidity and usually advanced disease. Perioperative mortality rates were significantly related to surgeon volume: They were 19, 13, and 9 percent for surgeons performing fewer than two, between two and six, and more than six esophagectomies per year, respectively (p &lt;0.001). This effect held true even among low-volume surgeons working in high-volume hospitals.</p><p>There was also a significant correlation between hospital volume and perioperative mortality. When compared with the lowest volume hospitals (fewer than two procedures annually), the adjusted odds ratio for mortality for patients treated at the highest volume hospitals (more than 19 procedures annually) was 0.36 (95% CI 0.26-0.50). A second series found that high-volume hospitals were able to reduce their esophagectomy-related mortality over time (from 11 to 7.5 percent, p = 0.003), presumably from increasing experience with the procedure, while low-volume hospitals could not (procedure-related mortality rates were 15.3 versus 14.5 percent, respectively) [<a href="#rid67">67</a>]. Other reports document lower complication rates in high-volume hospitals and more successful management of complications compared with low-volume hospitals [<a href="#rid68">68</a>].</p><p>A meta-analysis sought to define the number of esophagectomies needed for a center to achieve an acceptably low mortality rate [<a href="#rid69">69</a>]. Hospitals that performed more than 20 resections per year had a perioperative mortality rate of only 4.9 percent, and the odds ratio of death for hospitals performing more than 20 resections per year compared with a lesser number was 0.43 (95% CI 0.31-0.58). Thus, a minimum of 20 esophagectomies per year has become a benchmark, with most large high-volume centers now reporting perioperative mortality rates in the range of 1 to 4 percent.</p><p>In summary, the weight of evidence supports the view that "practice makes perfect" in this high-risk, demanding operation. As such, the optimal management strategy is to refer patients needing esophagectomy to a high-volume center that specializes in esophageal cancer care. Nevertheless, a large proportion of esophagectomies in the United States are still performed in low-volume centers.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Outcomes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several published reports detail outcomes from esophagectomy for superficial esophageal cancer  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59698" href="/z/d/graphic/59698.html" rel="external">table 5</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2,9,11,12,75,76</a>]. However, interpretation of these data is limited by high perioperative morbidity and mortality rates in many series, attributable both to the long time period over which cases were collected and to the volume-performance issues discussed above. Nonetheless, these reports provide an approximation of expected outcomes after esophagectomy in patients with superficial cancers. The following conclusions can be drawn:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Results are much better than standard surgical series of esophagectomy for muscle-invasive cancers, where three to five-year survival rates are 25 to 30 percent. Likewise, recurrence rates are relatively low, with most patients dying of other causes, again unlike standard surgical series.

There was only one local recurrence among 79 patients with M1, M2, M3, or SM1 tumors  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64349" href="/z/d/graphic/64349.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) (five-year recurrence-free survival 97 percent). Recurrence rates were higher among those with SM2 and SM3 tumors (8 of 41 patients, five-year recurrence-free survival 57 percent). In this series, 19 patients already had nodal metastases at the time the superficial cancer was diagnosed; their outcomes were significantly worse after resection than those for patients without nodal metastases (five-year recurrence-free survival 33 versus 94 percent).</p><p></p><p>Additional information can be derived from series of patients undergoing esophagectomy for a biopsy diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia (HGD; sometimes called high-grade esophageal intraepithelial neoplasia [HGIN]) in the setting of Barrett's esophagus. Typically, these patients (largely in the past) have not had endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or ER, so they are often understaged. The high incidence of finding invasive cancer in the resected specimen (approximately 40 percent) in the past led many surgeons to recommend esophagectomy for fit patients with a diagnosis of HGD, although others suggest endoscopic surveillance every three months until invasive cancer is detected [<a href="#rid78">78-86</a>]. A modern approach is that a biopsy diagnosis of HGD typically leads to endoscopic staging with endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) with or without EUS, and a consideration of endoscopic therapy alone if HGD or a T1a lesion is confirmed and complete eradication is thought to be possible.

Invasive adenocarcinoma was present in 37 percent of the specimens. The mortality of esophagectomy was 2 percent, and there were three recurrences (6 percent), compared with seven in the endoscopically treated group (15 percent). Among surgically treated patients, the five-year survival rate was 83 percent, and the disease-specific survival was 94 percent. When the analysis was limited to patients found to have either HGD alone or invasive cancer limited to the mucosa or submucosa and uninvolved lymph nodes (n = 41), the disease-specific five-year survival rate was 100 percent.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Impact on health-related quality of life</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Esophagectomy can result in long-term symptoms such as dysphagia, cough, and reflux, all of which may impair health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) [<a href="#rid87">87-89</a>].

MIE can be performed by conventional laparoscopy and thoracoscopy or can be performed with robot assistance. It is not clear currently which is better and there are strong proponents of each approach.

In our view, patients who are best suited for this approach are those who are candidates for ER but for whom this approach is contraindicated (eg, liver disease with extensive varices, previous perforation, severe cervical spine disease), and those who are candidates for esophagectomy, but deemed poor surgical candidates. An important point is that the severity of the liver disease may preclude even chemotherapy and RT [<a href="#rid90">90-96</a>].</p><p>Concurrent definitive chemoradiotherapy is considered a standard approach for patients with muscle-invasive squamous cell cancer who have a good response to therapy, but the adequacy of nonsurgical approaches for invasive adenocarcinomas remains controversial. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2478.html" rel="external">"Radiation therapy, chemoradiotherapy, neoadjuvant approaches, and postoperative adjuvant therapy for localized cancers of the esophagus", section on 'Necessity for surgery'</a>.)</p><p>Unfortunately, as with endoscopic ablation, this approach does not eliminate the risk of a local recurrence, which is higher for patients with submucosal (T1b) as compared with mucosal tumors (T1a)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111221" href="/z/d/graphic/111221.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The following represents the range of findings:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the largest series, 104 patients with superficial esophageal cancer underwent EBRT alone or with concurrent chemotherapy [<a href="#rid90">90</a>]. The one-, two-, and three-year survival rates for patients with disease limited to the mucosa were 95, 90, and 90 percent, respectively; the corresponding rates for those with submucosal involvement were 90, 81, and 70 percent, respectively. Patients who received chemotherapy had a better survival than did those treated with RT alone, although the difference was not statistically significant.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The utility of chemoradiotherapy was further explored in a retrospective Japanese series of 173 endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-staged patients with T1b squamous cell esophageal cancer, of whom 102 were treated with radical esophagectomy and 71 had definitive chemoradiotherapy [<a href="#rid96">96</a>]. Chemoradiotherapy consisted of EBRT (at least 50 Gy) with concurrent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/z/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a> (FU) plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/z/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a>. At a median follow-up of 65 months for surgically treated patients and 42 months for those who received definitive chemoradiotherapy, the difference in overall survival was potentially clinically meaningful but not statistically significant (three-year survival 87 versus 78 percent for surgically and nonsurgically treated patients, respectively). The frequency of positive nodes was high (20 percent) in the group of surgically staged patients with T1b SCC. Recurrences were more frequent following chemoradiotherapy (20 of 71 versus 12 of 102 patients [28 versus 12 percent]). Furthermore, although post-chemoradiotherapy local recurrences could be controlled by salvage esophagectomy, only 4 of 12 patients with lymph node recurrence were cured of their disease.</p><p></p><p>Whether brachytherapy adds benefit to EBRT alone is unclear [<a href="#rid93">93,94,97</a>]. The benefit of intraluminal brachytherapy was evaluated in series of 59 consecutive patients with submucosal esophageal cancer who were treated with EBRT without chemotherapy, 36 of whom also received brachytherapy [<a href="#rid93">93</a>]. Eight of the 23 patients treated with EBRT alone recurred locoregionally, compared with 6 of 36 in the combined treatment group (35 versus 17 percent). Overall, deaths were more frequently observed in the EBRT alone group, but the difference in disease-specific death rates between the EBRT and intraluminal brachytherapy groups was not statistically significant (39 versus 14 percent). Since this is not a randomized trial, the true contribution of brachytherapy to outcomes is uncertain.</p><p>A disadvantage of RT as a form of nonsurgical therapy is the need for prolonged treatment (typically approximately five weeks of daily treatment) as opposed to a single treatment for ER.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1528989441"><span class="h1">POSTTREATMENT SURVEILLANCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The importance of prolonged follow-up, especially for patients treated with an endoscopic approach, cannot be overemphasized, as late recurrences may develop.

The risk of nodal metastases is higher for tumors with submucosal invasion, especially those with deep submucosal invasion.

An accurate assessment of tumor extent (particularly the depth of invasion into the wall of the esophagus) is needed to direct therapy. It is important to balance the risk of nodal metastases and procedural risk when counseling patients regarding their treatment options. An algorithmic approach to initial assessment and treatment selection is provided  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef140122" href="/z/d/graphic/140122.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>), and summarized in the following bullets:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The depth of invasion is an important indicator of the risk for nodal metastases in patients with superficial esophageal cancer. At present, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the most accurate noninvasive method to assess depth of invasion. (See <a class="local">'Accuracy of EUS in the staging evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">If the patient is a candidate for ER (small solitary focus ≤15 mm, no suspicion for submucosal invasion or nodal involvement), we suggest a diagnostic (and potentially therapeutic) ER to more accurately define the depth of invasion. The presence of submucosal invasion or muscularis mucosa invasion (ie, an M3 tumor) with lymphovascular invasion  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64349" href="/z/d/graphic/64349.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) increases the risk for lymph node metastases, and these patients are not good candidates for endoscopic therapy alone.

(See <a class="local">'Accuracy of EUS in the staging evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">There is no consensus as to the role of integrated FDG-PET/CT in the evaluation of patients with superficial esophageal cancer. NCCN guidelines suggest obtaining FDG-PET/CT for all patients with esophageal cancer, but provide no specific guidance for superficial cancers. We obtain a PET/CT prior to EUS and endoscopic resection in all patients with tumors &gt;15 mm or any suspicion for locally advanced disease, if the results might impact therapy. If the PET/CT suggests disease that is limited to the mucosa, we then proceed to EUS to formally assess tumor stage. (See <a class="local">'Utility of FDG-PET'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Other factors to consider in the selection of ER versus surgical treatment are lesion size, the presence of lymphovascular invasion, histologic grade of differentiation, the presence and extent of Barrett's mucosa, other esophageal pathology (particularly varices), comorbid medical conditions, patient age, local expertise, and patient preference. Regardless of the approach chosen, patients with superficial esophageal cancer are best treated in high-volume centers that specialize in treatment of esophageal cancer.
