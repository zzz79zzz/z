(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13888.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of dizziness and vertigo in children and adolescents"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6464.html" rel="external">"Emergency evaluation of syncope in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1082343771"><span class="h1">BACKGROUND</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ataxia can be defined as a disturbance in the smooth, accurate coordination of movements. It is most commonly manifested as an unsteady gait, and in children, refusal to walk.</p><p>Ataxia is usually the result of cerebellar dysfunction. However, disturbances at many levels of the nervous system can also affect coordination [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. As an example, ataxia that develops as the result of loss of sensory function (such as proprioception) would be described as a sensory ataxia.</p><p>Acute ataxia, defined as presence of ataxia for &lt;7 days, is an uncommon presenting complaint in children. In the largest study conducted in a pediatric emergency setting, acute ataxia accounted for 0.02 percent of all emergency department visits by children 1 to 18 years of age [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Although causes of acute ataxia include life-threatening conditions such as mass lesions and central nervous system (CNS) infection, the majority of children have a benign, self-limited process. Historical features, specific physical findings, and selected ancillary studies can identify most causes of ataxia, particularly those that are serious and require stabilization and intervention.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CAUSES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Conditions that cause acute ataxia include acute infections, post-infectious inflammatory conditions, toxins, tumors, and trauma  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79383" href="/d/graphic/79383.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Based upon observational series of patients referred to the emergency department or a pediatric neurology specialist, the most frequent diagnoses are [<a href="#rid2">2-7</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute cerebellar ataxia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Drug intoxication</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Migraine-related disorders (vestibular migraine and benign paroxysmal vertigo)</p><p></p><p>Of these, acute cerebellar ataxia is most common [<a href="#rid1">1-4,6,8</a>]. Historical features such as the time course of the presentation and the age of the child may suggest a particular diagnosis. Conditions such as migraine syndromes, seizures, and certain inborn errors of metabolism cause recurrent ataxia. By comparison, chronic or progressive ataxia usually develops with congenital anomalies, degenerative diseases, or hereditary ataxias.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Life-threatening conditions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Life-threatening causes of acute ataxia in children are fortunately uncommon. For those conditions that create a mass effect, signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (such as vomiting, headache, or papilledema) are typically evident. Focal neurologic deficits and mental status changes are worrisome [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Etiologies include tumors, hemorrhage, stroke, and infection.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h3">Tumors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Of all childhood brain tumors, 45 to 60 percent arise in the brainstem or cerebellum [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. Posterior fossa tumors may present with slowly progressive ataxia and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. These symptoms include progressive night-time or early morning headache with nausea/vomiting. The absence of these symptoms, however, does not exclude the diagnosis of a brain tumor. In addition to ataxia, physical findings that may be noted with a posterior fossa tumor include papilledema, cranial neuropathies, and other focal neurologic abnormalities. Acute decompensation can occur as the result of obstructive hydrocephalus, hemorrhage into the lesion, or edema. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5219.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and risk stratification of medulloblastoma", section on 'Symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>Acute ataxia in association with opsoclonus-myoclonus (rapid, dancing eye movements and rhythmic jerking) may be the presenting manifestation of an occult neuroblastoma. As many as half of children with opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome have a neuroblastoma [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5187.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging evaluation of neuroblastoma"</a> and <a class="local">'Other conditions'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Intracranial hemorrhage</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hemorrhage into the cerebellum or posterior fossa as the result of trauma or a vascular malformation can cause ataxia with dramatic, rapid deterioration and life-threatening elevation of intracranial pressure [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Injury that causes intraparenchymal hemorrhage is typically severe. In comparison, a child with a ruptured vascular malformation typically has no significant antecedent trauma. A history of trauma may not be immediately forthcoming for children with inflicted injury. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6609.html" rel="external">"Child abuse: Epidemiology, mechanisms, and types of abusive head trauma in infants and children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Stroke</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute ataxia may develop as the result of vertebral or basilar artery disease. Conditions that cause cerebrovascular disease are rare in children and include sickle cell disease, hypercoagulable states (as can occur with systemic lupus erythematous), and homocystinuria. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5926.html" rel="external">"Acute stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) in children and adults with sickle cell disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6420.html" rel="external">"Childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Thromboembolic'</a>.)</p><p>Vertebrobasilar artery dissection following a neck injury can also cause stroke, manifested as acute ataxia [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Life-threatening infectious processes that cause acute ataxia generally produce other symptoms as well. Rarely, ataxia may be an early symptom of meningitis [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Patients with inflammatory post-infectious conditions, such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), may also develop ataxia.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cerebellar abscesses, often caused by contiguous spread of infection from either otitis media or mastoiditis, can cause ataxia and fever [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. Associated symptoms related to a mass effect in the posterior fossa include headache and vomiting. Rapid clinical deterioration with meningismus can occur when the abscess ruptures into the intraventricular or subarachnoid space [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1297.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of brain abscess"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Brainstem encephalitis is a rare cause of acute ataxia that is associated with high morbidity. Patients are often febrile and have other neurologic findings such as cranial nerve abnormalities, mental status changes, and seizures [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis and electroencephalographic (EEG) changes are commonly seen. Infectious agents associated with brainstem inflammation include Listeria monocytogenes, Lyme disease, EBV, and herpes virus (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1277.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Listeria monocytogenes infection", section on 'Spectrum of CNS involvement'</a>). Reflexes are preserved in patients with encephalitis, which helps to differentiate them from those with GBS or Miller Fisher syndrome. (See <a class="local">'Common conditions'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>ADEM, an uncommon inflammatory demyelinating disease that typically follows an infection, may have ataxia as part of its presentation. Common neurologic features of ADEM include seizures, cranial neuropathies, weakness, hemiparesis, sensory deficits, and transverse myelitis. Systemic symptoms such as fever, headache, and meningismus may also occur. Altered mental status and the fulminant onset of multifocal neurologic deficits distinguish ADEM from benign etiologies such as acute cerebellar ataxia. Although most patients slowly recover and have no neurologic deficit, mortality from post-infectious ADEM may be as high as 5 percent. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6184.html" rel="external">"Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in children: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute cerebellitis, although often considered on the spectrum of post-infectious acute cerebellar ataxia, is a rare condition that has distinctive clinical and imaging features. Children with acute cerebellitis typically are ill with acute ataxia accompanied by vomiting, headache, altered consciousness, and increasing sedation. Some may present more fulminantly with severe cerebellar edema. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will demonstrate cerebellar inflammation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6206.html" rel="external">"Acute cerebellar ataxia in children", section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Common conditions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Common conditions that cause acute ataxia in children are often treatable and/or self-limited.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">Acute cerebellar ataxia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute cerebellar ataxia is the most common cause of childhood ataxia, accounting for about 30 to 75 percent of all cases [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. It is a self-limited syndrome that is frequently post-infectious and typically seen in children between two and five years of age. Varicella infection-induced cases, once the most common single post-infectious cause, have diminished due to vaccination. Numerous other infectious agents have been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute cerebellar ataxia, including coxsackievirus, echovirus, enteroviruses, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis A, herpes simplex virus 1, human herpes virus 6, measles, mumps, parvovirus B19, <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> (Lyme disease), malaria, <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em>, and typhoid fever. SARS-CoV2 has also been recently implicated [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. The diagnosis of acute cerebellar ataxia can only be made after exclusion of other more serious illnesses such as toxic ingestions, central nervous system infection, structural intracranial lesions, metabolic derangement, or neurodegenerative disorders. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6206.html" rel="external">"Acute cerebellar ataxia in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Guillain-Barré syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>GBS is an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy thought to result from a post-infectious immune-mediated process. It has also been reported following vaccination and <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em> infection. GBS predominantly affects motor nerves, although as many as 15 percent of children with GBS also lose sensory input to the cerebellum and develop sensory ataxia [<a href="#rid1">1,3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6235.html" rel="external">"Guillain-Barré syndrome in children: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>The Miller Fisher syndrome is a form of GBS classically characterized by the triad of ataxia, areflexia, and ophthalmoplegia. Ataxia can be profound and is often more marked in the extremities [<a href="#rid1">1,19</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6235.html" rel="external">"Guillain-Barré syndrome in children: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Miller Fisher syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>Ataxia associated with GBS usually progresses over several days. The prognosis for children with GBS is generally better than that for adults. As many as 85 percent of children can be expected to have an excellent recovery.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4274339423"><span class="h3">Toxic exposure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Toxic exposure (typically ingestion of an oral medication) is responsible for up to 30 percent of cases of acute childhood ataxia [<a href="#rid1">1,3</a>]. Associated symptoms may include mental status changes such as lethargy, confusion, or inappropriate speech or behavior. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6496.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with occult toxic exposure"</a>.)</p><p>Exposures commonly associated with ataxia include anticonvulsants (<a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12702" href="/d/drug information/12702.html" rel="external">phenytoin</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13113" href="/d/drug information/13113.html" rel="external">carbamazepine</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12698" href="/d/drug information/12698.html" rel="external">phenobarbital</a>, and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12727" href="/d/drug information/12727.html" rel="external">primidone</a>), lead, carbon monoxide, inhalants (such as toluene), alcohol, benzodiazepines, and other drugs of abuse. Some substances associated with abuse can be identified in routine urine toxicology screens. A few medications and toxins (such as anticonvulsants, ethanol, and lead) can be identified with specific blood tests.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h3">Labyrinthitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Inflammation of the vestibular apparatus, often from bacterial or viral infections such as otitis media, causes acute labyrinthitis. Symptoms include hearing loss, vomiting, and intense vertigo exacerbated by head movements [<a href="#rid20">20-22</a>]. Labyrinthitis may be difficult to distinguish from acute cerebellar ataxia in a toddler. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5102.html" rel="external">"Vestibular neuritis and labyrinthitis", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h3">Migraine syndromes and benign paroxysmal vertigo</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute ataxia is a clinical feature of several migraine syndromes, including basilar migraines and familial hemiplegic migraines. Benign paroxysmal vertigo (BPV) can be difficult to distinguish from ataxia in young children. Children with BPV may have a family history of migraine, and some develop typical migraines later in life. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6202.html" rel="external">"Types of migraine and related syndromes in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6155.html" rel="external">"Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in children", section on 'Benign paroxysmal vertigo'</a>.)</p><p>Associated symptoms such as headache and vomiting without alteration in consciousness, as well as the episodic course, distinguish migraine syndromes from other causes of acute ataxia. However, the diagnosis may be difficult to establish at the initial presentation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h3">Trauma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ataxia may occur following mild traumatic brain injury. Ataxia in association with post-traumatic vertigo is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/111925.html" rel="external">"Sequelae of mild traumatic brain injury", section on 'Posttraumatic vertigo and dizziness'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h2">Other conditions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are a number of other conditions that can cause acute, episodic, and chronic ataxia  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79383" href="/d/graphic/79383.html" rel="external">table 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hypoglycemia</strong> – Younger children with hypoglycemia may appear ataxic [<a href="#rid3">3,14</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Seizure disorder</strong> – Ataxia can occur during the ictal or postictal phases of seizures [<a href="#rid1">1,14</a>]. Other epileptic features (such as mental status change or abnormal eye movements) may be noted. However, nonconvulsive seizures (without alterations of consciousness or abnormal movements) may manifest as ataxia alone [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome</strong> – Opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome, also known as opsoclonus-myoclonus, is a rare syndrome that includes opsoclonus along with diffuse or focal body myoclonus and truncal titubation with or without ataxia and other cerebellar signs. Ataxia of trunk and limbs with falling is often the first symptom [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Patients subsequently develop myoclonus and opsoclonus (spontaneous, involuntary, arrhythmic, conjugate, multidirectional saccades occurring in all directions of gaze without a saccadic interval). Encephalopathy of varying severity can accompany motor symptoms. In children, a moderate to severe sleep disturbance is common. All children with opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome should be evaluated for neuroblastoma. As many as 50 percent of children with opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome have an underlying neuroblastoma; symptoms of opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome precede the diagnosis of neuroblastoma in about one-half of patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15861.html" rel="external">"Opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome", section on 'Pediatric syndrome'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inborn errors of metabolism</strong> – Numerous inborn errors of metabolism affecting the central and peripheral nervous system may lead to episodic or recurrent presentations of acute ataxia. A child with one of these yet undiagnosed metabolic disorders may present acutely with the first episode of ataxia and metabolic decompensation in the setting of an intercurrent illness and poor dietary intake. Specific disorders include urea cycle disorders, amino acidopathies, mitochondrial disorders, and organic acidopathies. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2936.html" rel="external">"Inborn errors of metabolism: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical features", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6234.html" rel="external">"Overview of the hereditary ataxias"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tick paralysis</strong> – Tick paralysis is a form of toxic exposure that may present with ataxia. Patients develop an unsteady gait that progresses to motor weakness, ascending paralysis, and areflexia. Fever, headache, and mental status changes are characteristically absent. A neurotoxin in the tick saliva causes the symptoms. The onset of symptoms of tick paralysis occurs only after a female tick has attached and begun feeding.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and metabolic syndromes usually present with a slower, more progressive onset of symptoms, usually over a few days.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A slower and relatively insidious course is characteristic of brainstem and cerebellar tumors, although medulloblastomas may grow rapidly, and acute decompensation may occur secondary to obstructive hydrocephalus or hemorrhage into the lesion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Associated symptoms – Important associated symptoms include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Otalgia, vertigo, and vomiting in association with acute ataxia suggest acute labyrinthitis.

The approach to the neurologic examination of a child is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15360.html" rel="external">"Detailed neurologic assessment of infants and children", section on 'Neurologic examination'</a>.)</p><p>Findings that are associated with various causes of acute ataxia include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mental status</strong> – Abnormal mental status suggests ingestion, ADEM, meningitis, encephalitis, cerebellitis, or stroke. Lethargy may be present in many inborn errors of metabolism. By comparison, children with post-infectious acute cerebellar ataxia are normally alert and interactive.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Focal neurological deficits</strong> – Focal findings on neurological examination are a "red flag" symptom of a potential serious neurological process such as stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, CNS tumor, or brain abscess.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cranial nerves</strong> – Abnormalities of cranial nerve function, such as ophthalmoplegia, suggest posterior fossa lesions, brainstem encephalitis, or the Miller Fisher syndrome.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Motor examination</strong> – Children with the acute onset of weakness may stagger as an attempt to compensate. This gait abnormality may be mistaken for true ataxia and has been called "paretic" ataxia. Paretic ataxia is proportional to the degree of weakness. It may be due to GBS, botulism, myasthenia gravis, transverse myelitis, or tick paralysis [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Deep tendon reflexes are absent in patients with GBS, botulism, and tick paralysis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sensory examination</strong> – Impairment of proprioceptive input may result in sensory ataxia, as may occur with GBS. (See <a class="local">'Guillain-Barré syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cerebellar examination</strong> – A cerebellar lesion is the likely cause of ataxia for a patient with an abnormal cerebellar examination. However, patients with significant cerebellar dysfunction may have no specific findings. Cerebellar signs include abnormalities in gait, speech, and coordination of voluntary movement. Gait is typically wide-based, unsteady, lurching, or staggering. Speech abnormalities include fluctuations in clarity, rhythm, tone, and volume. Patients may have difficulty maintaining truncal position (titubation). Coordination of voluntary movement, as demonstrated with over- or under-shooting (best seen on finger-nose testing) and difficulty with rapid alternating movements (dysdiadochokinesia), is poor. Hypotonia and tremor may also occur.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Findings that localize the disorder within the cerebellum include the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Vermis (midline cerebellar) lesions cause dysarthria, truncal titubation and gait abnormalities.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Lesions of the cerebellar hemispheres result in ipsilateral limb dysmetria, hypotonia, and tremor.

In a retrospective review of 40 cases of acute childhood ataxia evaluated in the emergency department at one institution, nearly half of the 35 drug screens sent were positive [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Frequently identified agents include benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, anticonvulsants, ethanol, and opioids [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Blood glucose</strong> – A bedside test for blood glucose will quickly identify children with ataxia due to hypoglycemia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Metabolic evaluation</strong> – For children with episodic acute ataxia and other features that suggest an inborn error of metabolism (such as altered mental status or family history), the following tests may be useful: liver function tests, blood pH, CBC, quantitative amino acid determinations of blood and urine, serum lactate, pyruvate and ammonia levels, and urine organic acids. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/17216.html" rel="external">"Inborn errors of metabolism: Identifying the specific disorder"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination</strong> – CSF examination is rarely indicated for the emergency evaluation of a child with acute ataxia. Moderate CSF protein elevation can occur in acute cerebellar ataxia, ADEM, and multiple sclerosis. CSF protein is also usually elevated in GBS, but it may be normal in as many as 20 percent of children within a week of symptom onset [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Neuroimaging should be obtained before a lumbar puncture is performed when there is concern for increased intracranial pressure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">CSF should be obtained whenever there is concern for CNS infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis.

Imaging may also be helpful when considering a diagnosis of exclusion, such as acute cerebellar ataxia or functional neurological symptoms, especially in patients with atypical or persistent signs and symptoms.</p><p></p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging modality of choice for patients with acute ataxia, although emergency MRI may be difficult to obtain. It is superior to computed tomography (CT) for detection of posterior fossa lesions such as tumors, strokes, and abscesses.

In consultation with a pediatric neurologist, EEG is indicated for children who may be having seizures, as suggested by altered levels of consciousness and/or fluctuating clinical signs. EEG may also demonstrate nonspecific abnormalities that are clues to a metabolic etiology or toxic exposure. Although electrophysiologic studies are the most specific and sensitive tests for diagnosis of GBS, they may not be helpful early in the disease.

The CT scan is typically normal for patients with meningitis, brainstem encephalitis, or ADEM. If the CT scan is negative, a lumbar puncture is indicated if meningitis is suspected to obtain CSF for analysis and culture.
