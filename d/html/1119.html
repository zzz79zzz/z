         Options for the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke or TIA caused by large artery disease include revascularization for symptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis due to atherosclerosis, and multifactorial risk reduction including treatment with antiplatelet agents, blood pressure control, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering therapy. The role of anticoagulation in this setting is quite limited. (See

         The treatment of symptomatic extracranial carotid atherosclerotic disease requires intensive medical management and may include carotid revascularization with carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting. The importance of medical management, the identification of patients likely to benefit from revascularization, and the choice of revascularization procedure are discussed in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1106.html" rel="external">

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Carotid artery occlusion may occur without clear symptoms, but it can be associated with TIA and stroke. Older data suggest that the subsequent yearly risk of a stroke ipsilateral to the occluded carotid artery is 2 to 5 percent [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]; later retrospective data suggest that the rate of early neurologic deterioration or recurrent stroke after symptomatic carotid occlusion ranges from 8 to 30 percent [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In most cases, medical management is the only practical option in the setting of chronic carotid occlusion. Data from small observational studies suggest that recanalization can be achieved by stenting of extracranial carotid artery occlusion [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ], but clinical benefit is uncertain. Surgical revascularization is a viable option only when residual flow can be demonstrated in the internal carotid artery (ie, near occlusion), but efficacy is likewise unproven. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1106.html" rel="external">
          "Management of symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease", section on 'Patients unlikely to benefit'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         With acute ischemic stroke related to extracranial internal carotid artery occlusion and a tandem intracranial large artery occlusion, treatment options include acute stenting and/or angioplasty of the extracranial carotid artery combined with mechanical thrombectomy of the intracranial occlusion. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115663.html" rel="external">
          "Mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke", section on 'Approach to tandem lesions'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         For isolated acute symptomatic internal carotid artery occlusion, the optimal treatment is uncertain. Limited retrospective data from small observational studies suggest that urgent stenting results in a high revascularization rate, but benefit is unproven [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. More data are needed to determine whether early secondary prevention with endovascular treatment improves outcomes compared with maximal medical therapy [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Historically, some experts used short-term (three to six months) anticoagulation for acute symptomatic occlusion; the rationale for this approach is based on limited evidence that emboli may form and propagate from the stump of the occluded artery after acute occlusion [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ], but the risk and benefit of such an approach, particularly when compared with dual antiplatelet therapy, remains uncertain. An earlier randomized, controlled trial in patients with symptomatic carotid narrowing or occlusion found that surgical treatment using extracranial to intracranial bypass failed to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ], and the later Carotid Occlusion Surgery Study (COSS) trial in patients with symptomatic carotid occlusion and hemodynamic cerebral ischemia also found no benefit for extracranial to intracranial bypass surgery compared with medical therapy alone [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9

         Carotid web, considered a variant of fibromuscular dysplasia (see
         <a class="local">
          'Fibromuscular dysplasia'
         </a>
         below), is a shelf-like projection of intimal fibrous tissue of the internal carotid artery bulb that can be focal or multifocal [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. It may appear as a filling defect on computed tomographic angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, or conventional contrast angiography (eg, digital subtraction angiography) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Carotid web is rarely associated with severe stenosis. However, carotid web may alter hemodynamic flow and increase the risk of platelet aggregation leading to thromboembolism [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The optimal management of symptomatic carotid web is uncertain. The 2021 American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines recommend antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. The guidelines also note that the risk of recurrent stroke in medically treated patients with symptomatic carotid web is high, and carotid stenting or endarterectomy may be considered to prevent recurrent events, particularly in patients who have a recurrent ischemic stroke despite medical treatment.

         In most cases, prevention of ischemic stroke and TIA due to extracranial vertebral artery stenosis is managed by intensive medical treatment and multifactorial risk reduction, including the use of antiplatelet agents  (

         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. In addition, angioplasty and stenting is a treatment option [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15-18
         </a>
         ], and surgical transposition of the vertebral artery to the common carotid artery is another alternative for vertebral origin stenosis. However, efficacy for these procedures is uncertain [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,18,19
         </a>
         ]. In an analysis that pooled individual patient data from three trials comparing stenting with medical treatment for the subgroup with symptomatic extracranial vertebral artery stenosis, there was no significant difference in the risk of any stroke in the stenting group compared with the medical treatment group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.63, 95% CI 0.27-1.46) [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Thus, extracranial vertebral artery revascularization is generally considered only when maximal medical therapy has failed to prevent embolism or low-flow recurrent ischemic events.

         Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a noninflammatory, nonatherosclerotic disorder that leads to arterial stenosis, occlusion, intraluminal thrombus, aneurysm, dissection, and arterial tortuosity [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21

         ]. The most frequently involved arteries are the renal and internal carotid arteries, followed by the vertebral, visceral, and external iliac arteries. Disease presentation may vary widely, depending upon the arterial segment involved and the severity of disease. TIA and ischemic stroke are potential manifestations of carotid or vertebral artery FMD; hypertension is the most common presenting sign of renal artery FMD. (See

         Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a unique cerebrovascular disorder characterized by progressive large intracranial artery narrowing and the development of prominent small vessel collaterals in patients who may have genetic susceptibilities but no underlying risk factors. Moyamoya syndrome (MMS) refers to patients with moyamoya angiographic findings who also have an associated medical condition. (See

        <p>
         Ischemic stroke and TIA affecting the anterior circulation are the most common clinical presentations. Hemorrhagic complications of moyamoya, mainly intracerebral hemorrhage, represent a significant clinical burden, particularly in adults. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Secondary stroke prevention for patients with symptomatic moyamoya is largely centered on surgical revascularization techniques. Antiplatelet therapy is reasonable [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14

         The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a hypercoagulable state characterized by recurrent arterial or venous thromboembolism, or pregnancy loss, in association with antibodies directed against plasma proteins that may be bound to anionic phospholipids. The presence of such antibodies may be detected as lupus anticoagulants, anticardiolipin antibodies, or anti-beta2 glycoprotein-I antibodies. (See

         Cryptogenic stroke is variably defined and generally designates the category of brain infarction that is not attributed to an established source of cardioembolism, large artery atherosclerosis, small artery disease, or other determined cause of stroke. However, the term cryptogenic stroke has been applied to patients with an incomplete diagnostic evaluation, a complete but unrevealing evaluation, or an evaluation that identifies multiple potential causes of stroke. (See

        <p>
         Embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) is a subcategory of cryptogenic stroke defined as a nonlacunar brain infarct without proximal arterial stenosis or cardioembolic sources; ESUS requires a full standardized stroke evaluation to exclude other causes. While the less well-defined term of cryptogenic stroke has been reported to account for approximately 25 to 40 percent of ischemic strokes, the more specific term of ESUS consistently accounts for approximately 20 percent of ischemic strokes. (See

         For secondary prevention, most patients with a cryptogenic ischemic stroke or TIA should be treated with blood pressure control, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering therapy, and lifestyle modification. Initial antiplatelet therapy is advised while awaiting the results of long-term cardiac monitoring. For patients initially diagnosed with cryptogenic stroke who have atrial fibrillation of any duration detected on long-term monitoring, even if detected remotely from the incident stroke, anticoagulant therapy with

          Symptomatic internal carotid stenosis

         – In addition to medical management, revascularization is generally beneficial for patients with recently symptomatic internal carotid artery atherosclerotic stenosis with 50 to 99 percent luminal narrowing. In the setting of complete carotid occlusion, medical management is the only practical option. (See
