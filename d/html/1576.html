Intracoronary thrombosis may result during or soon after the procedure. In addition, metal (which is procoagulant) stents can trigger thrombus formation. Stent thrombosis can be a life-threatening event. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/87310.html" rel="external">"Coronary artery stent thrombosis: Clinical presentation and management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1582.html" rel="external">"Coronary artery stent thrombosis: Incidence and risk factors"</a>.)</p><p>Aggressive antithrombotic therapy with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a>, platelet P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blockers, and parenteral anticoagulants is used to decrease the risk of early intracoronary thrombosis; a minority of patients may be candidates for a glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitor.

We then give clopidogrel 75 mg daily until the PCI.

Additional heparin is administered to achieve an activated clotting time (ACT) between 250 to 350 seconds (depending upon the ACT device). Although we prefer heparin, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8792" href="/z/d/drug information/8792.html" rel="external">bivalirudin</a> is a reasonable alternative for patients at high bleeding risk or those with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia; we give a loading dose of 0.75 mg/kg and an infusion according to renal function  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64612" href="/z/d/graphic/64612.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). In uncomplicated procedures, the heparin or bivalirudin is stopped at the end of the procedure. For femoral access, sheath removal should be accomplished when the ACT falls to less than 150 to 180 for heparin (or two hours after discontinuation for bivalirudin) or a vascular closure device can be used immediately when there is suitable vascular anatomy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients who are at high risk for acute stent thrombosis based on angiographic criteria (visible thrombus, persistent dissection, postprocedure Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] flow grade &lt;3), we add a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor.

We then start an infusion of 2 mcg/kg/min (maximum dose of 15 mg/hour) after first bolus. The drug is continued for 2 to 18 hours; the duration depends on balancing the risks for thrombosis and bleeding.

The efficacy of these agents has been demonstrated in numerous randomized trials. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1577.html" rel="external">"Antithrombotic therapy for elective percutaneous coronary intervention: Clinical studies", section on 'P2Y12 receptor blockers'</a>.)</p><p><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/z/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">Clopidogrel</a> is the preferred platelet P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker in patients with <strong>stable </strong>coronary artery disease undergoing PCI, although there is a role for <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16784" href="/z/d/drug information/16784.html" rel="external">ticagrelor</a> based on studies of long-term safety and efficacy such as the TWILIGHT trial. </p><p>We suggest pretreatment (prior to PCI) with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/z/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a> for most stable patients whose coronary anatomy is known from a recent diagnostic coronary angiogram. When clopidogrel is chosen, we give a loading dose of 600 mg. It should be given preferably 24 hours or more (but at least two hours) before scheduled or anticipated PCI in most patients. Our recommendation to pretreat with clopidogrel in some patients is based on one randomized trial (CREDO) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1577.html" rel="external">"Antithrombotic therapy for elective percutaneous coronary intervention: Clinical studies", section on 'Clopidogrel'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95.html" rel="external">"Acute non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes: Early antiplatelet therapy"</a>). For stable patients whose coronary anatomy is not known and who are scheduled for diagnostic coronary angiography with possible PCI, we suggest withholding the P2Y<sub>12 </sub>receptor blocker until after diagnostic coronary angiography, as many patients will either not have disease that needs revascularization or will have disease that requires coronary artery bypass surgery. In these situations, the patient will have been unnecessarily exposed to clopidogrel if it is given prior to angiography. </p><p>For patients in whom a decision is made to treat with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16784" href="/z/d/drug information/16784.html" rel="external">ticagrelor</a>, we give a loading dose of 180 mg using the same time protocol as described directly above for <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/z/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a>. If the patient needs to be switched from ticagrelor to clopidogrel near the time of discharge, often due to inability to pay for ticagrelor, we give a loading dose of 600 mg.</p><p><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9533" href="/z/d/drug information/9533.html" rel="external">Prasugrel</a><strong> </strong>has not been extensively evaluated in patients with stable disease undergoing PCI.

Furthermore, if bleeding occurs, anticoagulant therapy may still need to be interrupted, increasing the risk for thromboembolism. We try to minimize any interruption of oral anticoagulation with use of radial access and other bleeding avoidance strategies. This issue is discussed separately.

Some experts, including the authors of the Primary and Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease section of the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis guidelines, suggest one month of dual antiplatelet therapy (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/z/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a>) due to concerns about an increase in thrombotic potential caused by iatrogenic plaque rupture [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p>While balloon angioplasty does disrupt the integrity of the vascular endothelium, acute intracoronary thrombosis rarely occurs after 48 hours.

However, even with proper timing and dosing, the risk of stent thrombosis and other ischemic complications, as well as major bleeding, including gastrointestinal bleeding, persists. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1572.html" rel="external">"Long-term antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery stenting in stable patients"</a> and <a class="local">'Bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">Aspirin</a><strong> </strong>– All patients with coronary artery disease should receive long-term daily aspirin for secondary prevention. For stable patients in whom percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting is scheduled or anticipated, we load all patients, including those taking low-dose maintenance aspirin, with 325 mg, preferably given at least two hours before the procedure. (See <a class="local">'Aspirin'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Our approach </strong>– For most stable patients in whom PCI with stenting is scheduled, we suggest pretreatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/z/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a>  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64612" href="/z/d/graphic/64612.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>).
