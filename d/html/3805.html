         Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection (TTBI) is a complication of transfusion in which a bacterial pathogen from a transfused blood component causes symptomatic disease in the transfusion recipient. The risk of TTBI is greatest with platelet transfusion.

         This topic reviews definitions, epidemiology, risk factors, prevention, and immediate interventions for TTBI. Separate topics present an overview of transfusion reactions and summarize routine evaluation of blood donors, testing of blood components, and pathogen inactivation methods:

         Evolving definitions make it challenging to track the epidemiology of transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection (TTBI) and to accurately evaluate case reporting.
        </p>
        <p>
         TTBI is a subset of transfusion-transmitted infection (TTI); TTBI refers to TTI caused by bacterial organisms. The following classifications for TTI are included in a 2021

          Case definitions
         </strong>
         – Definitive cases are those for which there is laboratory evidence of a pathogen in the transfusion recipient. Possible cases are those with an illness that is temporally associated with the transfusion but for which no pathogen is detected in the recipient and other adverse transfusion reactions (such as allergic or hemolytic reactions) have been excluded.

         Nonsevere TTBI does not cause permanent organ damage or impairment but does require medical intervention.

         Severe reactions are those that lead to hospitalization, prolong hospital stay, require medical or surgical intervention to prevent organ damage, and/or cause persistent disability or incapacity due to organ dysfunction. Severe TTBI may also be referred to as a septic transfusion reaction or transfusion-associated sepsis.

         <strong>
          Imputability
         </strong>
         – Imputability refers to the confidence that the infection came from the transfusion. Criteria for definite TTI include evidence of the pathogen in the transfused component, in the donor at the time of donation, in another component from the same donation, or in another recipient of a component from the same donation. In addition, there must not be any other exposure of the recipient to the pathogen, the recipient must not have been infected with the pathogen prior to receiving the transfusion, or there must be evidence that the specific bacterial organism in the component is the same as the organism in the recipient (by DNA testing or extended phenotypic comparison).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         These case definitions can be used for clinical care as well as for case reporting. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Case reporting'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Other groups, such as the United Kingdom Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) program, define TTBI as the isolation of the same pathogen from the donor or the donated blood component and the transfusion recipient, with no evidence of infection prior to transfusion nor any reasonable alternative explanation for the infection [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In distinction from TTI, the term contamination may be used for a positive bacterial culture (or other test for viable organisms) from the blood product. Positive bacterial cultures are not definitive for TTBI: some may represent "false positives" in which contaminating organisms were introduced when the sample of the product was taken for culture or during or plating of the culture, while others may reveal an organism in the product that is unlikely to cause clinical disease in the recipient.
        </p>
        <p>
         Not all blood products that contain viable organisms cause infection or disease in the recipient. In one study involving apheresis platelet products, the rate of positive cultures was 112 to 252 per million donations, whereas the rate of septic transfusion reactions was 9 per million donations, a &gt;10-fold difference [

         more common than transfusion-transmitted viral infections.
        </p>
        <p>
         As an example, transfusion-transmitted hepatitis C virus (HCV) occurs in &lt;1 per million  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69661" href="/z/d/graphic/69661.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ), whereas the incidence of TTBI from platelets can be as high as 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 100,000 (10 to 20 times higher).
        </p>
        <p>
         Estimates of TTBI incidence vary depending on several factors, especially the definitions used, the extent of mitigation measures, and the specific blood product that is transfused. (See

         <strong>
          Definitions
         </strong>
         – The incidence is highest in studies that report rates of bacterial contamination of the blood component and lower when more stringent criteria are applied (positive culture from the transfusion recipient, transfusion-associated sepsis). (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Extent of mitigation measures
         </strong>
         – Rates of TTBI are higher with active surveillance (testing components at the time of issue, prior to transfusion, for the presence of bacterial organisms) than with passive surveillance (relying on clinicians to report transfusion-related adverse events and investigating them once they occur) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Active surveillance consumes more time and resources but reduces the risk of transfusing a contaminated unit.

         Methods to limit introduction of bacteria during collection, processing, and sampling of
         <strong>
          platelet products
         </strong>
         have been emphasized in the United States since 2019, although implementation has been delayed due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Rates of TTBI declined following institution of routine platelet culturing and are expected to decline further as these new measures are introduced. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Platelet-specific guidance and requirements'

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In low-income and middle-income countries where routine surveillance (primary culture) or other mitigation processes are not in regular use, rates of TTI are higher. The few studies done in Africa show higher rates of TTBI compared with rates in high-income countries. As an example, in a 2021 survey of members of the African Society for Blood Transfusion (AfSBT), only 14 of 38 respondents (37 percent) reported using measures routinely used in high-income countries (such as diversion pouches for blood collection) and only 8 (21 percent) reported using bacterial culture of platelet units [

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         It is likely that the rate of TTBI from platelets will decline further once additional measures such as bacterial culture following high-volume delayed sampling (for platelets) or pathogen-inactivation are routinely used. (See

          Platelets

         – The incidence of TTBI is higher with platelet products than other components; platelets are stored at room temperature in bags that allow gas exchange, to prevent platelet activation and keep the platelets viable. (See

         Estimates of bacterial contamination of platelets using passive surveillance data (based on recognized adverse reactions post transfusion) suggest an incidence of 1 in 1500 to 1 in 3000; estimated rates from active surveillance (based on culturing platelet components prior to transfusion) are as much as 10-fold higher [

         species. They came from six separate apheresis platelet donors from six different states; four had been pathogen-reduced and three had undergone bacterial culture prior to transfusion. Following an investigation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the source was determined to be the manufacturer of the platelet collection sets, where deficiencies were found in environmental controls and sterility assurance processes.

          Damage to collection bags
         </strong>
         – The containers in which platelets are stored can become damaged (scratched, pierced, cut) during manufacture, transport, or storage, leading to leaks and environmental contamination, although this is rare. Manufacturing defects are typically identified during inspection at the manufacturing facility, but damage can occur after the product has left the facility. A 2022 report reviewed reports of 23 apheresis platelet container defects, including one that led to fatal TTBI [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. The unit had been visually inspected and no defects were apparent, but an independent laboratory identified a leak in the bag. Based on the 23 reports from &gt;500,000 apheresis platelet sets, the overall defect rate was determined to be 44 per 1 million; the implicated bags were removed from inventory and implicated units were not transfused.

         There are challenges in interpreting culture results that include known environmental contaminants and skin commensals. As an example,
         <em>
          Cutibacterium (

         formerly
         <em>

         </em>
         is sometimes cultured from platelet units, but it is unclear how often it causes overt clinical reactions in the transfusion recipient. Vigilance is prudent when interpreting culture results, given the potential risk of a large inocula of any bacteria infused into a high-risk recipient.

         Platelets are routinely stored at room temperature in gas permeable bags to prevent their activation and to support their normal metabolic functions. However, room temperature storage also facilitates growth of bacterial organisms. (See

         The role of storage duration is challenging to assess. The majority of TTBI cases (and fatalities) occur with day 4 to day 5 platelets; however, this may reflect the timing with which platelets are administered since most platelets are transfused on day 4 or day 5 [

          Mitigation options introduced in the United States in 2019
         </strong>
         – TTBI can occur despite the use of primary culture because the initial inoculum was too small or the contaminating organisms were slow-growing, thus risking false-negative cultures in the first 24 to 36 hours after collection. Large volume delayed sampling (use of 16 mL rather than 8 mL and delaying culture beyond 24 to 36 hours) addresses both of these elements.

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In response to the observation that TTBI remained a leading cause of transfusion-associated morbidity and mortality despite the widespread use of primary culture, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) introduced further mitigation methods to reduce bacterial contamination of platelets in 2019 [
         <a href="#rid41">

          Pathogen inactivation treatments
         </strong>
         – UpToDate contributors use the term "pathogen inactivation" to refer to the procedures and "pathogen reduced" to refer to the blood components. Pathogen inactivation treatments for platelets involve addition of chemicals that damage nucleic acids followed by exposure to ultraviolet light; this is done shortly after platelets are collected. The goal is to inactivate or sufficiently reduce a variety of pathogens present in the unit so that the unit cannot cause TTBI.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         These treatments can inactivate different types of microorganisms including viruses, bacteria, and parasites, and they have the potential to inactivate emerging pathogens for which blood components are not screened. The main disadvantage is increased cost.

          Changes to storage time
         </strong>
         – The shelf life of platelets is short relative to other blood components, resulting in greater pressure to maintain inventory. Data to determine the effect of storage duration on the risk of TTBI are challenging to evaluate. The FDA allowed the storage time to be increased from five days to seven days, but an increase in septic transfusion reactions led the FDA to return to the five-day storage period in the mid-1980s. As noted in the discussions above, platelet products subjected to certain mitigation methods can have a shelf life extended to day 7.

         Clinical manifestations of TTBI can be highly variable and range from asymptomatic to fatal septic shock. Potential explanations for the variation in presentation of TTBI include the size of the bacterial inoculum, bacterial virulence, the recipient's immune status and underlying condition, and treatments the individual is receiving.
        </p>
        <p>
         Signs and symptoms may be nonspecific and may overlap both with other transfusion reactions and/or with the patient's underlying condition, making it challenging to distinguish between TTBI and other causes of the patient's symptoms, especially in the initial few hours  (

          table 4

         ). Clinicians managing patients who become unwell during or following blood product administration must maintain a high degree of vigilance for TTBI as well as other transfusion reactions. (See

         TTBI can also occur in the absence of the above findings. A study from the early 1990s reported fever in 80 percent, chills in 53 percent, hypotension in 37 percent, and nausea or vomiting in 26 percent [

          50

         ]. In a study from 2001 that included 41 cases of TTBI, 19 patients had minor symptoms, 16 had life-threatening severe sepsis or shock but recovered, and 6 patients died [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12

        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to evaluating the unused component, the transfusion medicine service or blood bank can determine if other products may be affected, such as red blood cell (RBC) and plasma units from whole blood donations or additional apheresis platelet units from an apheresis platelet donation. All products from the same donation should be quarantined. Once the evaluation is completed, they can notify the appropriate agency. (See

          Testing for other transfusion reactions
         </strong>
         – One of the major considerations in the differential diagnosis of TTBI is an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR), typically due to ABO incompatibility. This is evaluated by confirming the unit was administered to the intended recipient (rather than mistransfused due to a clerical error). Laboratory testing includes antiglobulin testing (Coombs testing), repeating the type and crossmatch, and testing for free heme in serum and urine. Close coordination between the treating clinicians and the transfusion service is important to coordinate this testing. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7932.html" rel="external">

         Broad spectrum antibiotics are started empirically when there is a high suspicion for TTBI, guided by the gram stain of the implicated product if applicable. (See

         Once culture results and the results of testing for other transfusion reactions are available, antibiotics can be narrowed, expanded, or discontinued:

         Another clinical scenario is when a patient is clinically well, but either the blood collection center notifies the hospital that a platelet unit has a positive culture (after it has already been released to a hospital and transfused) or a gram stain and/or culture is positive on a co-component during investigation of a suspected transfusion reaction on another patient.
        </p>
        <p>
         The decision to start antibiotics in such a case is individualized, realizing that the positive culture may represent a contaminant introduced during sampling of the unit, and the patient may not warrant changes in management.

         If the patient is at high risk for infection (due to neutropenia), they may warrant increased surveillance and blood cultures; antibiotics may be started pending the blood culture results.

         Case reporting protects patients, since most apheresis platelet units are divided among several recipients, and another individual could be at risk for receiving a platelet unit from the same collection. Reporting also allows agencies to track the incidence of TTBI, determine whether mitigation processes are effective, identify new infectious pathogens, and maintain the safety of the blood supply.

         Local requirements for case reporting should be followed. The transfusion medicine service usually submits the incident report. Many countries have robust hemovigilance systems.

The National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) differentiates definitive from possible cases and grades the confidence in the diagnosis. (See

          Incidence and implicated blood products

         – The incidence of TTBI depends on definitions and extent of surveillance and reporting. Overall, platelet products carry the highest risk of TTBI. (See

         – Manufacturers and donation facilities must adhere to quality controls. Donors undergo medical history screening and are deferred if they have symptoms of active infection. The preferred skin disinfection solution is a product combining 2%

          Mitigation procedures for platelets
         </strong>
         – Primary culture of platelet units has been in place in the United States for decades. Guidance from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published in 2019 specifies a choice of additional mitigation measures including large volume delayed sampling and use of pathogen-inactivated platelet products  (

          Administering the transfusion

         – Visual inspection may intercept a contaminated unit prior to transfusion. Patient monitoring may identify TTBI at an earlier stage and facilitate faster intervention. (See

          Evaluation
