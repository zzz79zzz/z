         In adults, dyslipidemia is an established risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and correcting dyslipidemia reduces the risk of ASCVD. Dyslipidemia often begins in childhood and adolescence. Identifying children with dyslipidemia and successfully improving their lipid profile may reduce their risk of accelerated atherosclerosis and premature ASCVD.

         The definition of pediatric dyslipidemia and the approach to screening, evaluation, and diagnosis of lipid disorders in children will be reviewed here. Management of pediatric dyslipidemia is discussed separately. (See

         Normal lipid and lipoprotein values in children vary by age and sex  (

          table 1

         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Normative values are derived from population-based data from the Lipid Research Clinical Prevalence Study, which obtained fasting lipoprotein profiles from 15,626 children (age range 0 to 19 years) between 1972 and 1976 [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ], and from the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), which collected lipid levels in 7000 children from 1988 to 1994 [
         <a href="#rid4">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Lipid levels change with normal growth and maturation. Lipoproteins are very low in cord blood at birth and rise slowly in the first two years of life. Higher cholesterol levels are seen in breastfed babies related to the higher saturated fat content of breast milk [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Lipid levels are relatively stable from two years of age until adolescence. During puberty, total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels decrease with increasing age, before rising in the late teenage years. Males experience a decrease in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels during late puberty, whereas HDL levels remain stable in females until menopause.

         Lipid levels are impacted by obesity. In an analysis of the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 1996 to 2006, the likelihood of adverse lipid values was higher in adolescents with greater body mass index (BMI). The prevalence among youths who were healthy weight, overweight (BMI 85
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         to 95
         <sup>

         percentile), and obese (BMI &gt;95
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         percentile) were 14, 22, and 43 percent, respectively [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. However, lipid abnormalities are also common in youth with normal weight. In an analysis of 12- to 19-year-olds enrolled in NHANES from 1988 to 2016, approximately 52 percent of those with high TC, 38 percent of those with low HDL-C, and 41 percent of youth with high non-HDL-C had a BMI in the normal weight range [

         ].

        <p>
         Reported rates of pediatric dyslipidemia in other countries are generally comparable to those in the US, including similar relationships to obesity [

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Lipid levels have improved over time. In an analysis of NHANES data from 1999 and 2016, favorable temporal trends were observed in mean lipid levels and in the distribution of ideal and adverse lipid levels among youths aged 6 to 19 years [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Mean TC level declined from 164 mg/dL in 1999-2000 to 155 mg/dL in 2015-2016; mean HDL-C level increased from 52.5 mg/dL in 2007-2008 to 55.0 mg/dL in 2015-2016. Trends were generally consistent across racial/ethnic groups and BMI categories. Despite these favorable trends, it was estimated at the end of the study period that only one-half of youths in the United States had all lipids at ideal levels and approximately one in five had at least one adverse level.

         Dietary causes – Excessive dietary intake of saturated and trans fats is an important cause or contributor to elevated low-density lipoprotein and excessive intake of refined carbohydrates and simple sugars raises triglyceride levels. (See

         Some patients may have a clinical phenotype similar to that of FH but without a single mutation of sufficient pathogenicity to produce it. Such patients likely have multiple gene variants, each of which makes a small independent contribution. These patients are said to have polygenic hypercholesterolemia. (See

         Screening for lipid disorders in childhood is based on the rationale that early identification and control of pediatric dyslipidemia will reduce the risk and severity of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in adulthood [

         In the absence of direct long-term data demonstrating that lipid screening in childhood leads to reduced ASCVD in adulthood, some experts have raised concerns that screening may identify a large number of patients who may be harmed by further diagnostic testing and/or initiation of drug therapy with uncertain benefit [

         It is estimated that 100,000 children &lt;17 years and &gt;400,000 adolescents and young adults aged 17 to 21 years in the United States would qualify for statin therapy based on the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute screening recommendations [

         ]. Statin treatment may be beneficial for these patients. However, the potential risks of statin therapy in this population must also be considered. Rare but important side effects of statin therapy in adults include rhabdomyolysis and new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus. Adverse effects of statin therapy in children are rare and are discussed separately. (See

In the case of a family history of hypercholesterolemia or premature atherosclerotic ASCVD, screening typically begins after the age of two years. The interval of subsequent surveillance testing is tailored to the individual's risk profile (typically every one to three years) and continues so long as the risk factor(s) persist.

         Lipid levels can be measured either in a fasting or nonfasting state. Treatment decisions are generally made based on fasting lipid profiles; however, screening can be accomplished with nonfasting lipid levels. If the initial screen is performed with a nonfasting test and the result is abnormal, a follow-up fasting lipid profile should be obtained. At least two fasting profiles should be used to guide clinical decision-making, including pharmacologic therapy. (See

         Nonfasting lipid levels often are more practical as a screening test for pediatric patients because many patients and families find it challenging to comply with fasting. Differences in TC and HDL-C measurements between the fasting or nonfasting state are small and clinically insignificant [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ]. The nonfasting non-HDL-C level (which is calculated based on the difference between TC and HDL-C) appears to be a sensitive screening test for dyslipidemia in children [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ]. Non-HDL-C includes all cholesterol present in lipoprotein particles that are considered atherogenic, including LDL-C, lipoprotein(a), intermediate-density lipoprotein, and very-low-density lipoprotein.
        </p>
        <p>
         In an analysis from the Bogalusa study, non-HDL-C was at least as good a predictor as other lipid tests (ie, LDL-C, TC, HDL-C, and the ratio of TC:HDL-C) for predicting increased carotid intima-media thickness (an indirect marker for atherosclerosis) [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. Another report from the Bogalusa study found that abnormal levels of childhood non-HDL-C persisted into adulthood and were predictive of adult dyslipidemia independent of baseline body mass index (BMI) and BMI changes over 27 years [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In the Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth study (PDAY study), non-HDL-C and HDL-C levels were the best lipid predictors of pathologic atherosclerotic lesions in autopsies of children who had died from noncardiac causes [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Of note, the Friedewald formula, which is used to calculate LCL-C levels in the fasting lipid profile is valid only if the TG level is &lt;400 mg/dL (&lt;4.5 mmol/L). The Sampson equation can be used for patients with TG levels up to 800 mg/dL [

         For patients with borderline lipid results, recommendations for a heart-healthy lifestyle should be reinforced as for all children and adolescents. Further follow-up and testing is tailored to the specific clinical scenario. Important considerations include the age of the patient and underlying medical conditions or other risk factors  (

         The diagnosis of dyslipidemia requires confirmation testing with fasting lipid profiles obtained on two separate occasions two weeks to three months apart [

         </a>
         ]. Decisions regarding the need for pharmacotherapy should be based on the results of at least two low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) values derived from fasting lipid profiles. Counseling regarding dietary and other lifestyle changes should begin with the first abnormal test. (See

         – Adult primary prevention treatment recommendations are based in part on calculating a patient's individual baseline risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) by using validated risk scores (eg, the Framingham and the Reynolds risk scores, and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines [
         <a href="#rid50">

          51
         </a>
         ]. The lifetime risk approach is more relevant to pediatric practice since the 10-year risk for children and adolescents is exceedingly low. Adult risk assessment scores, which were developed based on the ASCVD risk in a general population, should not be used in individuals with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) who have a lifetime risk for ASCVD events that is not adequately captured by these scores [

          Rationale for screening

         – Dyslipidemia often begins in childhood and adolescence and tracks into adulthood. Pediatric dyslipidemia contributes to early atherosclerosis and, by extrapolation, to premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). In the high-risk subset of children with severe dyslipidemia due to familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), treatment reduces the risk of cardiovascular events. Screening for lipid disorders in childhood is based on the rationale that early identification and control of pediatric dyslipidemia will reduce the risk and severity of ASCVD in adulthood. (See

          Approach to screening
         </strong>
         – Our approach to screening for dyslipidemia in children and adolescents uses a strategy of combined age-based universal and selective screening  (

         <strong>
          Children with risk factors
         </strong>
         – For children with one or more risk factors for premature ASCVD  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109927" href="/z/d/graphic/109927.html" rel="external">
          table 5
         </a>
         ), we suggest regular screening for dyslipidemia (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Screening typically begins at the age when the ASCVD risk factor is first identified (generally, not earlier than age two years, unless there is clinical suspicion for homozygous FH is suspected). The interval of testing is tailored to the individual's risk profile (typically, every one to three years) and continues so long as the risk factor(s) persist. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Who should be screened'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Children without risk factors
         </strong>
         – For children without any risk factors for premature ASCVD, we suggest routine screening for dyslipidemia twice during childhood and late adolescence (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). The first screening should be performed between age 9 and 11 years and the second between age 17 and 21 years. Screening should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be performed at age 12 to 16 years in children without ASCVD risk factors, because changes in lipid levels that normally occur during puberty decrease the sensitivity and specificity of screening. (See

         <strong>
          Choice of screening test
         </strong>
         – Lipid screening can be performed with a full fasting lipid profile or with nonfasting lipid levels (with the latter, non-HDL-C is calculated based on the TC and HDL-C levels). Abnormal results require confirmatory testing. (See
         <a class="local">

          Repeat lipid profile
         </strong>
         – For patients with abnormal results, repeat testing is performed with a fasting lipid profile to confirm the diagnosis and determine the need for intervention  (

         <strong>
          Evaluation for secondary causes
         </strong>
         – Patients with confirmed dyslipidemia should be evaluated for secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia, which include diabetes mellitus, nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, pregnancy, hepatic disease, and certain medications  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71294" href="/z/d/graphic/71294.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Referral
         </strong>
         – Children with LDL-C ≥250 mg/dL (6.5 mmol/L) should be referred to a pediatric lipid specialist since markedly elevated cholesterol levels are associated with a high likelihood of FH and almost certainly require pharmacotherapy. Referral may also be necessary for children with less severe lipid profiles if LDL-C levels remain elevated (≥160 mg/dL) despite adequate lifestyle modification counseling. (See
