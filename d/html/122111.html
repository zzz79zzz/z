         gene (other thrombophilic variants in

         The FVL variant is a point mutation in the
         <em>
          F5
         </em>
         gene, which encodes factor V in the coagulation cascade. FVL shifts the balance towards clotting, resulting in increased VTE risk. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1355.html" rel="external">
          "Factor V Leiden and activated protein C resistance", section on 'Biology of factor V and protein C'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Heterozygosity for FVL confers an increased risk for VTE of approximately fourfold to fivefold (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108016" href="/z/d/graphic/108016.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). Common sites of thrombosis include deep veins of the legs (deep vein thrombosis [DVT]) and pulmonary emboli (PE); less common sites include cerebral and portal veins.
        </p>
        <p>
         Homozygosity for FVL or compound heterozygosity (for FVL plus another thrombophilia variant) are infrequent and carry a higher risk. We do not routinely test for other variants in asymptomatic individuals, but many individuals who have had thrombophilia testing will have this information available. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1355.html" rel="external">
          "Factor V Leiden and activated protein C resistance", section on 'Risk of initial VTE'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Heterozygosity for FVL is very common in White populations (approximately 5 percent). The vast majority of these individuals (approximately 90 percent) are unaware that they carry the variant and will never develop VTE. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1355.html" rel="external">
          "Factor V Leiden and activated protein C resistance", section on 'Epidemiology'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The tested individual should be counseled that VTE risk depends on many inherited and acquired risk factors, and risk may be increased despite a negative test for FVL.

        <p>

         The risk of a first venous thromboembolism (VTE) is determined by many factors besides
         <em>
          F5
         </em>
         genotype. These should be considered when determining the risk reduction strategy for every patient, regardless of whether they carry the FVL variant. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical significance (VTE risk)'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Our approach to VTE risk reduction in FVL heterozygous individuals is similar to the general population, with the following differences:

         We are more likely to use prophylactic anticoagulation for certain surgeries. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Surgery'

         We often advise avoidance of exogenous estrogens. If contraception is used, we encourage alternative methods (progestin-releasing intrauterine systems, progestin-only oral agents, or nonhormonal methods). We encourage non-estrogen alternatives for dysmenorrhea (eg, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) or acne (eg, topical therapies). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Estrogen-containing contraceptives'

         We may use anticoagulation during pregnancy and postpartum if other risk factors are present. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pregnancy'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         This approach is illustrated in the table (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122639" href="/z/d/graphic/122639.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ) and algorithm (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef123067" href="/z/d/graphic/123067.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         VTE risk is increased in individuals who are homozygous for FVL or compound heterozygous for FVL and another inherited thrombophilia (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119942" href="/z/d/graphic/119942.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ). This still translates to a relatively low overall risk (&lt;1 percent per year), and we generally do not chronically anticoagulate these individuals. However, anticoagulation may be considered if there is a very strong family history of VTE. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1355.html" rel="external">
          "Factor V Leiden and activated protein C resistance", section on 'FVL homozygous carriers'

         Surgery confers increased VTE risk independent of other risk factors, and FVL may further increase this risk.
        </p>
        <p>
         We generally treat individuals with FVL as a high-risk group when making decisions about postoperative VTE prophylaxis, and when postoperative VTE prophylaxis is considered, we are more likely to use prophylactic anticoagulation rather than other modalities (
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">
          aspirin
         </a>
         or intermittent pneumatic compression alone). FVL does not affect the choice or dosing of anticoagulant.

         Estrogen-containing contraceptives carry an increased risk of VTE independent of other risk factors, and the risk is significantly increased by the FVL variant (

         Alternatives to estrogen-containing contraceptives are favored for FVL heterozygous individuals with a negative personal and family history of VTE. However, an estrogen-containing contraceptive may be reasonable if other VTE risk factors are absent. If an oral estrogen-containing contraceptive is used, we use a pill with a low estrogen dose.

          table 4

         Our approach to primary VTE prophylaxis is summarized in the table (

         For individuals without a prior VTE who are heterozygous for FVL, management is similar to the general population; we do not routinely provide prophylactic anticoagulation. Anticoagulation may be appropriate for selected individuals based on additional risk factors such as a strong family history of VTE, immobility, cancer, or surgery.

         Airline travel is associated with a small increased risk of VTE, especially with longer flights (&gt;4 to 6 hours).
        </p>
        <p>
         For healthy people who are traveling by airplane for &gt;4 hours, we typically recommend frequent ambulation (every one to two hours) and/or calf and thigh muscle stretching. For individuals who place a high value on reducing VTE risk, we suggest below-the-knee graduated compression stockings.

         Some individuals may ask about the value of taking low-dose

         For individuals with venous thromboembolism (VTE), the presence of FVL generally does not affect management decisions regarding anticoagulation, choice of anticoagulant, or duration of therapy (

         An exception is homozygosity for FVL or double heterozygosity for FVL and another thrombophilia variant, which is considered high risk and generally is an indication for indefinite anticoagulation following a first VTE.

         It is unclear whether FVL increases the risk of early or late pregnancy loss, with most prospective studies not finding an association.

        <p>
         Preeclampsia does not appear to be more common with FVL.

         Individuals with early or late pregnancy loss who are found to have FVL should be evaluated by their obstetrician to determine the likely cause(s). (See

         Routine testing of first-degree relatives of an individual with FVL is controversial and may not be indicated, especially if the family history is negative for venous thromboembolism (VTE). For those with questions, referral to a hematologist or genetic counselor may be helpful.
        </p>
        <p>
         Individuals with FVL should share this information with their first-degree relatives, who can discuss the risks and benefits of knowing their FVL status with their own clinicians and individualize decisions about whether to be tested.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are most likely to find value in testing at-risk relatives of individuals with FVL who have a strong personal or family history of VTE, relatives considering use of an estrogen-containing contraceptive, and/or siblings of those with homozygosity for FVL or compound heterozygosity for FVL plus another inherited thrombophilia.
