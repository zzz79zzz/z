         Fibromyalgia (FM) is the most common cause of chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain, often accompanied by fatigue, cognitive disturbance, psychiatric symptoms, and multiple somatic symptoms [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. The etiology of the syndrome is unknown, and the pathophysiology is uncertain [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Despite symptoms of soft tissue pain affecting the muscles, ligaments, and tendons, there is no evidence of inflammation in these tissues.
        </p>
        <p>
         FM, like many other common chronic pain syndromes, has been a controversial condition [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Patients look well, there are no obvious abnormalities on physical examination other than widespread soft tissue tenderness, and laboratory and radiologic studies of musculoskeletal structures are normal. Thus, the role of organic illness had been questioned, and FM has often been considered by some to be psychogenic or psychosomatic. However, ongoing research suggests that FM is a disorder of pain regulation, often classified as a form of central sensitization [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5626.html" rel="external">
          "Pathogenesis of fibromyalgia"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         FM is often associated with other conditions that may cause musculoskeletal pain, disruption of sleep, or psychiatric symptoms; features of these conditions may also mimic FM, and the presence of such disorders should be considered in the diagnostic evaluation. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5625.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of FM will be reviewed here. The differential diagnosis of FM is discussed in detail separately, as are the presentation and impact of chronic widespread pain (CWP) in other musculoskeletal diseases, the possible pathogenic mechanisms and treatment of FM in adults, and the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of FM in children and adolescents.

         Fibromyalgia (FM) is a common cause of chronic pain and the most common cause of generalized, musculoskeletal pain in women between ages of 20 and 55 years; in the United States and in other countries, the prevalence is approximately 2 to 3 percent and increases with age [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-7
         </a>
         ]. Initially termed fibrositis, FM was described in France and England in the mid-19
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         century. By the end of the 20
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         century, many rheumatologists recognized FM as a discrete syndrome, and diagnostic classification criteria were proposed, evaluated, and then validated. FM is more common in women than men and occurs in both children and adults [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-8
         </a>
         ]. It is six times more common in women in reports from specialty clinics, although the female predominance is not as striking in the community and when using survey criteria that do not require a tender point examination [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis may be under-recognized in clinical practice. Prevalence estimates vary greatly with the specific diagnostic criteria applied. The prevalence of FM was much higher using surveys with standardized criteria than estimates based upon medical record documentation of the diagnosis (6.4 versus 1.1 percent) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Prevalence studies in adolescents have been very similar to those in adults [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. A United Kingdom population study found a prevalence of chronic widespread pain (CWP) of 14 percent and FM of 5 percent [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. In a National Health Service electronic health records survey in the United Kingdom, there was an increase in the diagnosis of FM for the period 2001 to 2013 compared with 10 years earlier [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Ten to 15 percent of the general population have CWP and do not have any specific disease or structural abnormality to account for the pain [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,9,11
         </a>
         ]; there is no clear boundary separating those who meet criteria for FM from the larger pool of people with CWP  (

         <a href="#rid7">
          7,9,11
         </a>
         ]. FM, also termed by some as CWP, as well as conditions such as chronic low back pain, may be conceived as diseases in their own right, termed "chronic primary pain" according to the new International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12

         Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, accompanied by other somatic symptoms, particularly fatigue and sleep disturbances, as well as cognitive and psychiatric disturbances  (

         ] (see

          'Symptoms'

         <a class="local">
          'Other common symptoms'
         </a>
         below). Physical examination reveals tenderness in multiple soft tissue anatomic locations (see
         <a class="local">
          'Physical findings'
         </a>
         below). Laboratory testing is normal in the absence of other illnesses. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Laboratory testing and other studies'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Some disorders are seen in greater frequency in patients with FM than in the general population. Certain of these conditions may cluster with FM and have some common pathophysiologic features, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), tension headache, and migraine. Additionally, certain features of other commonly associated disorders may simulate or exacerbate the symptoms of FM, such as musculoskeletal pain in patients with chronic forms of arthritis; and sleep disturbance and fatigue in patients with depression, obstructive sleep apnea, or restless legs syndrome.

         <a class="local">

         The core symptoms of FM are generalized pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbances, present for at least three months and not explained by any other medical condition  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120702" href="/z/d/graphic/120702.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Widespread musculoskeletal pain
         </strong>
         – The cardinal manifestation of FM is chronic widespread pain (CWP), also termed multisite pain (MSP) [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-8,13
         </a>
         ]. A 2018 report from an expert working group suggested using MSP rather than CWP to define pain in FM  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef120690" href="/z/d/graphic/120690.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Typically, at least six sites are involved in patients with FM, which may include the head, each arm, the chest, the abdomen, each leg, the upper back and spine, and the lower back and spine (including the buttocks).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Sometimes the pain may initially be localized, often in the neck and shoulders. Common patient descriptions include "I feel as if I hurt all over" or "It feels as if I always have the flu." Patients typically describe pain predominantly throughout the muscles, but often state that their joints hurt, and sometimes describe joint swelling, although synovitis is not present on examination [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2,13
         </a>
         ].

         </span>
         <strong>
          Fatigue and sleep disturbances
         </strong>
         – Moderate to severe persistent fatigue and sleep disturbances are core features of the FM diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Seemingly minor activities aggravate the pain and fatigue, although prolonged inactivity also heightens symptoms. Patients are stiff in the morning and feel unrefreshed, even if they have slept 8 to 10 hours. The morning stiffness may be difficult to differentiate from that of rheumatic diseases such as in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or polymyalgia rheumatica [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Patients with FM characteristically sleep "lightly," waking frequently during the early morning and have difficulty getting back to sleep. A common quote is "No matter how much sleep I get, it feels like a truck ran me over in the morning." Fatigue may be a sense of ongoing physical and/or emotional exhaustion.

         <strong>
          Cognitive disturbances
         </strong>
         – Cognitive disturbances are present in the majority of patients. The cognitive disturbances are often referred to as "fibro fog." Patients typically describe problems with attention and difficulty doing tasks that require rapid thought changes. Neuropsychological testing reveals abnormalities that are somewhat different than those found in psychiatric disorders [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. However, subjective cognitive deficits are much more common than changes on objective measures, either by brain imaging or validated instruments [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. A meta-analysis of 23 case-control studies found significant cognitive impairment in FM patients compared with healthy controls that were explained in part by levels of pain and depression [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ].

         <strong>
          Psychiatric symptoms
         </strong>
         – Depression and/or anxiety are present in 30 to 50 percent of patients at the time of diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17-21
         </a>
         ]. In a Canadian general population sample of 127,000, those 1635 subjects with FM were three times more likely to have depression compared with subjects without FM [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Twenty-two percent of the FM group had concurrent major depression. Depression in that group correlated with younger age, female sex, unmarried status, food insecurity, number of chronic conditions, and limitations in activities. Two-fifths of those with depression and FM had not discussed mental health concerns with any health professionals in the previous year (see
         <a class="local">
          'Coexisting disorders'
         </a>
         below). A meta-analysis of 11 studies of the prevalence of depression in FM found that one-fourth of FM patients had current major depression and that one-half had a lifetime history of major depression [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and traits such as catastrophizing and alexithymia are more common in patients with FM than in the general population [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19-21
         </a>
         ]. In a systematic review, 50 percent of FM patients had a lifetime history of depression, and one-third had a lifetime history of bipolar disorder, panic disorder, or PTSD [
         <a href="#rid21">

         <strong>
          Headache
         </strong>
         – Headaches are present in more than 50 percent of patients with FM and include migraine and muscular (tension) types [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22,23
         </a>
         ]. In an ambulatory tertiary headache clinic, FM was present in 174 of 889 patients (20 percent), including 44 percent of those with chronic, tension-type headaches [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. FM comorbidity correlated with frequency of headaches, anxiety, pericranial tenderness, poor sleep, and physical disability. FM is especially common in patients with episodic migraine [

         – Patients also often report paresthesias, including numbness, tingling, burning, or creeping or crawling sensations, especially in both arms and both legs. However, unless a concurrent neurologic disorder, such as carpal tunnel syndrome or a cervical radiculopathy, is present, a detailed neurologic evaluation or formal electrophysiologic testing is usually unremarkable (see
         <a class="local">
          'Physical findings'

         below). Many FM patients who fill out an inventory often complain of edema or swelling that is usually not visible to the examiner’s eye. This usually represents evidence for a small fiber neuropathy with or without paresthesias that reflect alterations in the osmotic gradient from small fiber nerve pressure [

         In patients with FM, the one finding that is usually present on physical examination is tenderness, sometime marked, on modest palpation in multiple soft tissue sites, particularly (but not exclusively) in those tender point locations previously described in the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria. These were located at the upper mid-trapezius muscle, the lateral epicondyle (the so-called tennis elbow location), the second costochondral junction (the site of costochondritis), the greater trochanter (the site of trochanteric bursitis of the hip), and other locations. By contrast, patients are not as tender over joints, and FM does not cause swelling or erythema of soft tissue or joints. (See

         </span>
         Fibromyalgia (FM) should be suspected in patients with chronic pain of at least three months' duration without another identified cause. The diagnosis of FM is symptom-based  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120702" href="/z/d/graphic/120702.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. FM can generally be diagnosed based upon symptoms of widespread pain in multiple sites, often accompanied by moderate to severe problems with sleep or fatigue, also of at least three months duration; other symptoms may also be present. Although widespread tenderness is present at multiple sites, there is an absence of joint swelling or other inflammatory changes on physical examination. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical manifestations'
         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
         As with many of the most common illnesses in clinical practice, including depression, migraine, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), the diagnosis rests on documenting a number of subjective symptoms and excluding other conditions that could account for those symptoms. There are no confirmatory tests or biomarkers. Therefore, the clinician's familiarity with the diagnosis and a comprehensive clinical encounter are pivotal in making a timely diagnosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         FM will continue to be a controversial diagnosis because of a lack of clinically apparent objective changes, and there has been controversy regarding the utility of the diagnosis of FM. Although some have argued that providing a diagnostic label to everyday symptoms increases illness behavior, there are now more studies suggesting that patients improve after a diagnosis and there is significant saving of health care dollars [

          Pain characteristics

          Physical examination
         </strong>
         – A thorough physical examination should be performed, with particular attention to a careful joint and neurologic examination to identify generalized widespread soft tissue tenderness and to exclude other illness presenting with similar symptoms. The examination should include palpating multiple soft tissue and joint sites, and a joint examination should always be done, looking for any synovitis and also palpating for tenderness over the joints themselves. Generally, many soft tissue sites are very tender with modest palpation and are more tender than the joints. There should be no soft tissue or joint swelling or redness.

         We no longer recommend palpating specific "tender point" locations or enumerating the number of tender points but rather estimating widespread or multisite soft tissue tenderness. The presence of such tender points was part of the 1990 ACR classification criteria. These tender points were located at the upper mid-trapezius muscle, the lateral epicondyle (the so-called tennis elbow location), the second costochondral junction (the site of costochondritis), the greater trochanter (the site of trochanteric bursitis of the hip), and other sites.

          Laboratory testing

         – There is no diagnostic laboratory test or radiographic or pathologic finding, and testing should be kept to a minimum; frequently only a complete blood count (CBC) and either an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) are required. Often, subspecialty referral is more cost-effective than ordering multiple laboratory and imaging studies if another condition or type of disorder is suspected. Testing is done primarily to exclude an associated disease or another illness that may mimic FM  (

         Various classification criteria for fibromyalgia (FM) have been developed and tested in an attempt to provide some homogeneity in patient populations for clinical studies; such classification criteria are most useful for clinical research and epidemiologic studies. In general, they have not been validated for individual patient diagnosis. Particularly in symptom-based diagnosis, the experience of the clinician and the details of the clinical encounter are paramount to rendering an accurate diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In efforts to design diagnostic criteria for FM, it gradually became apparent to clinicians and investigators that the tender point examination, an important element of the 1990 criteria (see
         <a class="local">
          '1990 ACR classification criteria'
         </a>
         below), should not be used for diagnosis of FM and that the presence of somatic symptoms, such as sleep disturbances and fatigue, must be included in any diagnostic criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
         Both the 2010 ACR preliminary diagnostic criteria (2010 criteria) for FM and the AAPT diagnostic criteria for FM are designed to aid in diagnosis (see
         <a class="local">
          '2010 ACR preliminary diagnostic criteria'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="local">
          'AAPT criteria'
         </a>
         below). They both can be quickly documented and the 2010 criteria are especially useful for following symptom severity (SS) over time  (

          figure 3A-B
         </a>
         ). Nevertheless, these criteria need to be further tested and compared with clinician diagnosis. Furthermore, these criteria have not been evaluated in FM patients with concurrent rheumatic or medical conditions.

         The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for FM were published in 1990 and have been used in most clinical and therapeutic trials [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The ACR criteria were based upon expert rheumatologists' opinions regarding the optimal historical and physical findings that could differentiate patients with FM from those with other rheumatic diseases and forms of chronic pain. These criteria were then field-tested in a number of academic rheumatology clinics and office practices.
        </p>
        <p>
         The final 1990 ACR FM classification criteria included:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         These simple criteria had greater than 85 percent sensitivity and specificity for differentiating patients with FM from those with other rheumatic diseases. However, these initial FM criteria were not intended for use in clinical practice. They focused on specific tender point locations despite the evidence that FM is a central pain disorder. It became clear over time that a tender point examination would be impossible to standardize in primary care and was not being performed, even by rheumatologists. Most importantly, these initial criteria neglected the multiple somatic symptoms in FM.

         The 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) preliminary diagnostic criteria (2010 criteria) for FM  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef120698 graphicRef81631" href="/z/d/graphic/120698.html" rel="external">
          figure 3A-B

         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. Importantly, these criteria were based upon patient self-reporting.
        </p>
        <p>
         According to these 2010 preliminary criteria  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef120698 graphicRef81631" href="/z/d/graphic/120698.html" rel="external">

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The WPI is a measure of the number of painful body regions from a defined list of 19 areas. The SS score includes an estimate of the degree of fatigue, waking unrefreshed, and cognitive symptoms, and the number of somatic symptoms in general  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef120698 graphicRef81631" href="/z/d/graphic/120698.html" rel="external">
          figure 3A-B
         </a>
         ). In contrast to the initial 1990 classification criteria, these 2010 criteria were formulated to be used for diagnosis, hence the term the 2010 ACR preliminary diagnostic criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
         The 2011 modification of the 2010 ACR preliminary criteria slightly modified a few questions from the 2010 criteria so that they can be self-administered [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ]. These criteria are to be used primarily for epidemiologic studies.
        </p>
        <p>
         Applying the 1990, the 2010, or the 2011 modified FM criteria changed estimates of the prevalence of FM as much as fourfold [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. The prevalence of FM was 1.7 with the 1990 criteria and 1.2 with the 2010 criteria, but 5.4 with the 2011 modified criteria. These modified criteria identified a greater proportion of men with FM and were more influenced by somatic symptoms than by pain [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2016, further modification of the 2010 criteria suggested using a generalized pain criterion, which decreased misclassification of regional pain syndromes [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. These criteria require that FM patients have pain in 4 of 5 regions, termed multisite pain (MSP), in contrast to the 1990 definition of chronic widespread pain (CWP). In general, there was good agreement between physician- and patient-based FM diagnostic criteria, especially for research [

         Classification criteria are essential for epidemiologic studies and clinical trials but have limited utility in clinical practice. They provide a window for quantifying symptoms that are present on a spectrum of severity, such as chronic pain. For clinicians who are inexperienced or uncomfortable with the diagnosis of FM, we consider it appropriate to utilize either the 2010 criteria or the AAPT diagnostic criteria to help guide the diagnosis, despite some limitations to their use for this purpose [

Because of the importance of excluding other conditions and recognizing comorbid disorders, clinicians unfamiliar with these disorders may need to refer patients identified by use of such criteria to a clinician familiar with these conditions and with FM for confirmation of the diagnosis.

         The multiple nonspecific symptoms of fibromyalgia (FM) can mimic many other conditions, and consideration of the differential diagnosis is important in making the diagnosis of FM. The history and physical examination, as well as limited laboratory testing, are usually sufficient to differentiate FM from these other conditions, such as systemic inflammatory arthropathies, spondyloarthritis, systemic autoimmune ("connective tissue") disorders, polymyalgia rheumatica, inflammatory myopathy, and hypothyroidism  (

         Several groups of disorders may occur in association with fibromyalgia (FM) more often than expected by chance alone. Some features of these conditions may simulate or exacerbate the symptoms of FM, such as musculoskeletal pain in patients with chronic forms of arthritis; and sleep disturbance and fatigue in patients with depression, obstructive sleep apnea, or restless legs syndrome. Recognition and effective treatment of these comorbidities can potentially contribute to symptomatic relief in patients with FM. These conditions include:

          53

         <a href="#rid52">
          52,53

         Demographic, clinical, and potential pathophysiologic characteristics of CFS, IBS, and other functional somatic syndromes are very similar to those of FM, and patients with FM may receive multiple diagnoses according to subspecialty referral patterns, if the clinicians caring for the patient are diagnostic "splitters" (ie, those who prefer to divide what others might consider as one entity into multiple distinct entities). On the other hand, the exact label may be less important if these functional illnesses are considered as part of a spectrum. Each of these conditions is diagnosed using criteria based upon the patients' symptoms when other diseases have been excluded, and they tend to be controversial because of the absence of a specific diagnostic test or of objective pathophysiologic abnormalities.

          Psychiatric disorders
         </strong>
         – Psychiatric disorders, including depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), are more prominent in FM than in other rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Approximately 25 percent of patients with FM have concurrent major depression, and 50 percent have a lifetime history of depression [

         An informal evaluation for psychiatric illness should be part of the initial evaluation of any patient with FM, with a more formal assessment by a mental health professional in selected patients. (See

         <strong>
          Sleep disorders
         </strong>
         – Most patients with FM have nonrestorative sleep as a characteristic of their illness; sleep disturbances are also very common in patients with FM, although the most common is a nonspecific interruption in stage 4 sleep [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]. Nonrestorative sleep abnormalities correlate with severity of FM symptoms and quality of life [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59
         </a>
         ]. However, primary sleep disturbances, including sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, and periodic limb movement disorders (PLMD), are also quite common [
         <a href="#rid60">
          60
         </a>
         ]. A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies found lower sleep quality and sleep efficiency, longer wake time after sleep onset, and a short sleep duration [
         <a href="#rid60">
          60
         </a>
         ]. Subjective sleep disturbances were more prominent than objective evidence of disturbed sleep.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The associated sleep disorders can contribute significantly to the symptoms of fatigue and nonrestorative sleep experienced by patients with FM, and symptom relief in patients with these comorbidities requires recognition of these conditions and appropriate treatment interventions. Thus, a careful sleep history should be obtained in patients with FM symptoms. Patients with possible sleep apnea or PLMD (also termed nocturnal myoclonus) should be referred to a sleep clinic for further evaluation and treatment. (See

          Inflammatory rheumatic diseases
         </strong>
         – The prevalence of FM is increased in patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis and systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases, including RA, psoriatic arthritis, and spondyloarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Sjögren's disease, and in osteoarthritis and regional pain disorders. This association, which may impact assessment and attribution of symptoms and evaluation of disease activity, has implications for management, and can influence patient outcomes, is discussed in detail separately.

         <a href="#rid64">
          64
         </a>

         </span>
         The diagnosis of FM, like that of headaches, chronic low back pain, and depression, can generally be made in the primary care setting, although many barriers exist for a timely diagnosis of FM in primary care. Despite improved awareness among primary care clinicians, many continue to be uncomfortable with a diagnosis of FM. There are no objective physical, laboratory, or imaging abnormalities, and the diagnosis is based on subjective reporting of symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
         In one study, FM patients rated receiving a diagnosis as somewhat difficult on average and had difficulties communicating their symptoms to the physician [
         <a href="#rid66">
          66
         </a>
         ]. Most patients rated their chronic widespread pain as moderate or severe, and FM symptoms were on average "fairly" to "very" disruptive and had a "moderate" to "strong" impact on patients' lives. However, patients waited on average almost a year after experiencing symptoms before presenting to a clinician, and before receiving a diagnosis of FM there was an average duration of 2.3 years and patients presenting to 3.7 different clinicians. Among patients with chronic pain, an average of three years was needed to receive a FM diagnosis, and the diagnosis was most often overlooked in males [
         <a href="#rid67">
          67
         </a>
         ]. In a study of general practice patients, FM was commonly misdiagnosed as a psychiatric illness [
         <a href="#rid68">
          68
         </a>
         ]. In large population database studies, the FM diagnosis varied greatly based on demographic and social factors more than on symptom severity (SS) [

         Recognition and diagnosis of FM leads to a decrease in resource use, including subsequent testing and overall health care costs, despite concerns that diagnostic labels such as FM would promote illness behavior and drive up health care costs. This was shown in a study involving more than 2000 patients, 81 percent women, who were newly diagnosed with FM [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. During the 10 years before diagnosis, the patients with FM had considerably higher mean annual rates of visits, medication prescription, and testing, compared with controls (25 versus 12 visits and 11 versus 4.5 prescriptions). Following an FM diagnosis, visits for most symptoms and health care usage declined, although within two to three years visit levels rose.
        </p>
        <p>
         A decrease in costs as compared with the predicted trend has also been observed in the four years after diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid70">
          70
         </a>
         ]. Costs before diagnosis were used in a trend analysis to predict later costs, assuming the diagnosis had never been made, and these predicted costs were compared with the observed costs after diagnosis. The average difference between the predicted and observed cost in the primary care population in the United Kingdom that was studied was £66.21 per six months per patient. Another report described both improved quality of life and decreased cost of health care after a diagnosis of FM, suggesting a need for early diagnosis and treatment [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71
         </a>
         ]. The impact of a delayed FM diagnosis was assessed in patients with an early diagnosis (less than two years), late diagnosis (two to seven years) and very late diagnosis (more than seven years) [
         <a href="#rid72">
          72
         </a>
         ]. An early diagnosis was associated with a lower symptom severity scale and tender point measure.

         Earlier detection of FM in primary care may be advanced with new diagnostic tools [
         <a href="#rid73">
          73,74
         </a>
         ]. The FibroDetect includes 14 questions assessing patients' pain and fatigue, personal history and attitudes, symptoms, and impact on lives. The predictive accuracy of the tool increased to 0.86 for FM and non-FM patient detection, with a sensitivity of 90 percent and a specificity of 67 percent for a cutoff of 6 on the score. Using self-report Multidimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire scores, a Fibromyalgia Assessment Screening Tool (FAST) was developed and correctly identified FM patients [
         <a href="#rid74">
          74
         </a>
         ]. However, these screening diagnostic questionnaires have not been widely adopted for use in clinical practice settings. Electronic medical records have been used to identify variables associated with the diagnosis of FM [
         <a href="#rid75">
          75
         </a>
         ]. Significant differences between the FM and no-FM cohorts were observed for nearly all the demographic, clinical, and health care resource variables. These results support the use of electronic medical records data in clinical research for identifying variables associated with FM.
        </p>
        <p>
         Proposed diagnostic criteria may also help to guide and confirm an FM diagnosis and assess severity of symptoms as discussed above (see

          figure 3A-B

         <a href="#rid76">
          76,77

         ]. Those subjects meeting the FM criteria had more pain and poorer outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis of FM, like that of every medical condition lacking a diagnostic gold standard, is based on clinical judgment [

          Diagnosis

         – The diagnosis of FM should be considered in any patient with greater than three months of widespread or multisite pain (MSP) and when there is no evidence for another condition to account for that pain  (

         ). Core symptoms include fatigue and sleep disturbances. Diagnostic criteria for FM are available and can be used to help guide diagnostic evaluation and confirm clinical decision-making but have not been validated for individual patient diagnosis  (

          Role of laboratory testing
         </strong>
         – Testing should be kept to a minimum since there are no diagnostic laboratory tests for FM. We advise obtaining a complete blood count (CBC) and either an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP), to exclude systemic inflammatory disease. Additional laboratory testing should be based upon clinical suspicion of a specific disorder, such as a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test or a creatine kinase (CK), if hypothyroidism or inflammatory myopathy are suspected, respectively. (See

         <strong>
          Indications for additional evaluation
         </strong>
         – Additional evaluation should be considered for associated conditions if clinically suspected, including sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome, and psychiatric disorders, such as depression or anxiety. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Avoidance of unnecessary testing
         </strong>
         – There is a broad differential diagnosis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef50712" href="/z/d/graphic/50712.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ), but screening for rheumatologic and other diseases with multiple serologic tests, laboratory studies, and invasive testing is not recommended. Excluding other conditions that may mimic FM is best accomplished with early subspecialty referral. This is especially important in FM patients with coexisting rheumatic disorders. (See
