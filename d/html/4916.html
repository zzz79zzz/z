(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4956.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Gene mutations and clinical genetic testing"</a>.)</p><p>HCM is characterized by an enormous diversity in both phenotypic expression and clinical course (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58156" href="/d/graphic/58156.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The location, pattern, and extent of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) are heterogeneous, although the most common location for increased wall thickness is the basal anterior septum in continuity with the anterior free wall. HCM patients can develop one or more of the following morphologic abnormalities:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Left ventricular (LV) outflow tract obstruction (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4947.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Morphologic variants and the pathophysiology of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction"</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diastolic dysfunction</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Myocardial ischemia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mitral regurgitation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Systolic dysfunction (ie, LV ejection fraction [LVEF] &lt;50 percent)</p><p></p><p>These structural and functional abnormalities can produce a variety of symptoms, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fatigue</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dyspnea</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chest pain</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Palpitations</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Presyncope or syncope</p><p></p><p>In broad terms, the symptoms related to HCM can be categorized as those related to heart failure (HF), chest pain, or arrhythmias. Patients with HCM have an increased incidence of both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias and are at an increased risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4926.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in adults: Supraventricular tachycardias including atrial fibrillation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4952.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Risk stratification for sudden cardiac death"</a>.)</p><p>For the majority of patients with HCM, LVH is not progressive, and the clinical course is relatively benign. A small subset of patients, however, will progress to an advanced form of the disease that is characterized by systolic dysfunction with other adverse LV remodeling such as LV dilation and wall thinning present in some patients as well. Such patients are managed according to the standard approach to patients with HF due to systolic dysfunction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/121085.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in adults"</a>.)</p><p>The natural history of HCM will be reviewed here. Other issues such as the clinical manifestations, diagnosis and evaluation, and treatment of this disorder are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4948.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4950.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Management of patients without outflow tract obstruction"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4920.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Management of patients with outflow tract obstruction"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">DEVELOPMENT OF HYPERTROPHY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H36997658"><span class="h2">Hypertrophy and fibrosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>HCM can present in infancy and childhood, but, more commonly, LV hypertrophy (LVH) develops during the adolescent period [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In the majority of HCM patients, LV wall thickness measurements do not typically change once early adulthood is reached. However, progressive wall thinning may occur in patients with initially severe hypertrophy. In a series of 106 patients with initial wall thickness ≥30 mm, more than 5 mm of wall thinning was seen in 41 of the 71 patients who underwent serial assessment (58 percent); the duration of follow-up was a significant predictor of thinning [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>A multitude of pathologic studies in children and young adults with HCM who died suddenly demonstrated that increased wall thickness is due to myocyte hypertrophy and an expanded extracellular matrix composed of interstitial and replacement fibrosis. [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The mechanisms leading to increased collagen matrix in HCM are not well defined but may be mediated by angiotensin II, an observation supported by studies using genetic mouse models of HCM in which increased interstitial fibrosis was attenuated by an angiotensin II receptor blocker [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4956.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Gene mutations and clinical genetic testing", section on 'Renin-angiotensin system polymorphisms'</a>.)</p><p>The amount and distribution of hypertrophy in patients with HCM may be related to the underlying genetic mutation. In a study comparing 150 patients with one of the more commonly seen thick filament mutations (eg, myosin heavy chain, myosin binding protein C) with 80 patients with one of the rarer thin filament mutations (eg, troponin T or I, alpha-tropomyosin, cardiac actin), patients with a thin filament mutation had significantly less hypertrophy, which was more often in an atypical location (ie, not the basal septum/anterior wall), and were less likely to have LV outflow tract obstruction [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. While there was no difference in rate of ventricular arrhythmias or SCD depending on the mutation in this study, patients with a thin filament mutation were more likely to develop severe HF symptoms. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4956.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Gene mutations and clinical genetic testing", section on 'Mutations in sarcomeric protein genes'</a>.)</p><p>A separate study has also shown evidence that serum markers of myocardial fibrosis may be present in HCM family members who carry a disease causing mutation but no LVH (genotype positive/phenotype negative). Levels of serum C-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP) were significantly higher in mutation carriers without LV as compared with controls (31 percent higher). It remains unresolved whether increases in serum markers of collagen turnover reflect a true increase in myocardial fibrosis in genotype positive phenotype negative patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4948.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation", section on 'Cardiovascular magnetic resonance'</a>.)</p><p>The presence of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging represents myocardial fibrosis. In one systemic review of LGE in patients with HCM, which included 1063 patients from four cohorts, 60 percent of patients had LGE [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. While the numbers of events were small, those patients with LGE had significantly higher total mortality (odds ratio [OR] 4.5, 95% CI 1.5-13.0), cardiac mortality (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.0-8.4), and HF mortality (OR 5.7, 95% CI 1.0-31.1) compared with patients without LGE. The role of CMR in patients with HCM is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4948.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation", section on 'Cardiovascular magnetic resonance'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Late onset disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although most HCM disease expression develops during childhood and adolescence, late-onset disease is recognized (ie, LVH developing between ages 20 and 50 years) and was first noted in patients with mutations in cardiac myosin binding protein-C. Most cross-sectional studies of families with mutations in the cardiac myosin binding protein-C gene, which account for approximately 15 percent of cases of familial HCM, have shown that the proportion of proven carriers of the mutation who have hypertrophy increases with age [<a href="#rid7">7-10</a>].</p><p>In one cross-sectional study of 16 probands and 574 family members at risk, 58 percent of patients aged less than 50 years with a mutation in the cardiac myosin binding protein C gene had hypertrophy [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. However, a later age at onset with cardiac myosin binding protein-C gene mutations has not been noted in all series [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4956.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Gene mutations and clinical genetic testing", section on 'Cardiac myosin binding protein-C gene'</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to familial early-onset HCM (which results from defects in the beta myosin heavy chain, cardiac troponin T, and alpha tropomyosin genes in more than 45 percent of cases), the onset of HCM in older patients is in some series associated with mutations in the cardiac myosin binding protein-C, troponin I, and alpha myosin heavy chain genes [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. In addition, the likelihood of identifying any mutation may be lower in late-onset HCM [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>Additionally, HCM patients who are identified late in life (age &gt;60 years) are at low risk for HCM-related death or adverse events compared with early-onset disease. Within one cohort of 428 patients presenting at age 60 years or greater who were followed for an average of six years, 89 percent of the deaths (133 out of 149) were non-HCM related, with HCM-related mortality of only 0.6 percent per year [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. In addition, a substantial proportion of older HCM patients also had ≥1 conventional risk factors for sudden death. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4947.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Morphologic variants and the pathophysiology of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction", section on 'Obstructive HCM in older adults'</a>.)</p><p>In a small subset of patients, sigmoid septal morphology (with maximal LV wall thickness ≥15 mm) is part of the phenotypic spectrum of HCM. A sigmoid shaped basal septum can also be observed in older individuals without HCM, but in these cases the maximal wall thickness of the septum is normal. Among HCM patients, this morphologic subtype appears to be less commonly associated with a mutation than other morphologic variants. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4947.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Morphologic variants and the pathophysiology of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction", section on 'Sigmoid septal morphology'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Relation to restrictive cardiomyopathy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Restrictive cardiomyopathy is characterized by restrictive filling and reduced diastolic volume of the left and/or right ventricle despite normal or near-normal systolic function and wall thickness [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Primary forms are uncommon, while secondary forms usually present at the advanced stage of an infiltrative disease (sarcoidosis, amyloidosis) or a systemic storage disease (eg, hemochromatosis). Idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy is uncommon, and may be familial and present in children and young adults. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4918.html" rel="external">"Restrictive cardiomyopathies"</a>.)</p><p>Several observations suggest that idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy may be part of the spectrum of familial HCM:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Some cases of restrictive cardiomyopathy have extensive myocyte and myofibrillar disarray at explant or postmortem, findings similar to those seen in HCM [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Some patients with primary restrictive cardiomyopathy have a family history of HCM, and mutations in sarcomeric contractile protein genes can lead to restrictive and/or HCM within the same family [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>].</p><p></p><p>The frequency and clinical significance of this relationship was illustrated in 1226 patients from 688 consecutive HCM families [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. A restrictive phenotype was seen in 19 patients (1.5 percent) and was associated with a relatively poor prognosis, with a 44 percent rate of death, heart transplantation, or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) discharge. Genotyping was feasible in 15 of 16 probands: mutations were found in eight, four in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene and four in the cardiac troponin I gene. A troponin I mutation has also been identified in six of nine unrelated individuals transplanted for idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4956.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Gene mutations and clinical genetic testing"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2647006698"><span class="h1">ADVANCED HEART FAILURE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">HCM with LV systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction &lt;50 percent)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A small proportion of patients with HCM (&lt;5 to 8 percent) eventually progress to a stage of disease associated with adverse LV remodeling with reduced systolic performance (LVEF &lt;50 percent). In some patients, there is cavity dilation and wall thinning due to a process of extensive myocardial fibrosis, as demonstrated by histologic examination in hearts removed at time of heart transplant and on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with extensive late gadolinium enhancement (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81390" href="/d/graphic/81390.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2,19-26</a>]. Not all patients with HCM and LV systolic dysfunction will demonstrate cavity dilation or wall thinning, and therefore the unifying definition is considered when a patient achieves an LVEF &lt;50 percent.</p><p>This phase, previously termed "end-stage" or "burned out" HCM, is best described as "HCM with LV systolic dysfunction." HCM with LV systolic dysfunction is associated with a marked increase in the risk of SCD [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>]. The mechanism of LV dysfunction is uncertain, but diffuse myocardial ischemia due to microvascular dysfunction leading to a process of substantial cell death and repair process in the form of myocardial replacement fibrosis may be important [<a href="#rid24">24,27</a>]. Among a cohort of 30 patients with HCM and LV systolic dysfunction who underwent transplantation, histologic review of the explanted heart revealed extensive myocardial fibrosis averaging 37 percent of the total myocardium [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. The degree of microvascular dysfunction assessed by quantitative PET imaging is an independent predictor of clinical deterioration and death [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. HCM with LV systolic dysfunction is associated with a high mortality rate and overall poor prognosis [<a href="#rid23">23,29</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of HCM with LV systolic dysfunction, which has been estimated in a variety of cohorts, appears to range from 4 to 8 percent:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among 6793 patients from the multicenter international SHaRE registry, 553 patients (8 percent) developed HCM with LV systolic dysfunction [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among 2447 patients from a single referral center, 118 patients (5 percent) developed HCM with LV systolic dysfunction [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Data from other smaller cohorts (5 percent) and pooled cohort analyses (4 percent) have shown similar rates of HCM with LV systolic dysfunction [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>].</p><p></p><p>Although uncommon, the transition to HCM with LV systolic dysfunction represents a significant change. Patients with LVEF between 50 and 60 percent, as well as those with significant LGE by CMR, should be followed more closely as the risk of progression to HCM with LV systolic dysfunction is increased in these subsets of patients [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>]. Clinically, patients with HCM with LV systolic dysfunction typically present with HF signs and symptoms. Early detection of LV dysfunction and/or dilation should prompt consideration of more aggressive interventions, including standard drug treatment for systolic HF (eg, angiotensin converting enzyme or aldosterone inhibitors), possibly cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT; ie, biventricular pacing), and early consideration for heart transplantation. Among patients treated with these contemporary HF therapies, approximately 50 percent stabilize with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I or II HF symptoms, while the remaining 50 percent developed refractory HF symptoms, with a significant increase in mortality and the need for cardiac transplantation.</p><p>The role of CRT in patients with HCM and systolic dysfunction is fairly limited, with mixed results in a number of small studies. While the response is not durable in all patients, some studies have demonstrated an improvement in HF symptoms and LVEF in a subset of patients, raising consideration for CRT in delaying advanced HF therapies including cardiac transplantation. Clinical predictors for response to CRT in patients with HCM with LV systolic dysfunction have not been identified.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among 150 patients with HCM with LV systolic dysfunction seen at a single referral center between 2004 and 2017, 20 patients (1.3 percent) were identified with LVEF ≤50 percent, NYHA class III/IV symptoms refractory to drug therapy, and QRS duration &gt;120 ms [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Following CRT device implantation in these 20 patients, 14 patients (70 percent) had a favorable response at one year with improvement to NYHA class I/II symptom status. Five of the 14 "responders" ultimately had recurrent NYHA class III/IV symptoms at 3.9 years of mean follow-up. These data suggest a role for CRT in patients with HCM with LV systolic dysfunction and drug refractory HF as a therapeutic intervention to potentially delay the need for advance HF therapies such as LV assist devices (LVADs) or cardiac transplantation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among 2447 patients with HCM from a single referral center, of the 118 patients (5 percent) who developed HCM with LV systolic dysfunction, 29 patients with QRS&gt;120 ms underwent CRT at mean age of 51 years [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Among these patients, 18 of the 29 (62 percent) experienced a clinical improvement with decrease in symptoms to class I or II.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>From the Mayo Clinic cohort of 2073 patients with HCM, nine patients were identified with HCM and LVEF &lt;50 percent who had received CRT; these patients were matched with control subjects with HCM in a 1:1 fashion [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. Over a mean follow-up of 13 years, there was no significant difference in outcomes between the two groups, with five patients from the CRT group and two from the control group requiring LVAD or cardiac transplantation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among an Italian cohort of 61 patients with HCM with LV systolic dysfunction, 13 underwent CRT (mean age at CRT 49 years, 12 patients with left bundle branch block, 8 patients with NYHA class II symptoms, 5 with NYHA class III/IV symptoms) [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. One year following CRT, 7 of the 13 patients had ≥1 NYHA functional class improvement, while the others had no improvement or worsening of symptoms.

The cause for HF in this subgroup of patients appears to be LV diastolic dysfunction due to impaired filling resulting in a low-output HF state. The time period between onset of symptoms and listing for heart transplant is on average eight years, underscoring the importance of close longitudinal follow-up in nonobstructive patients with HCM and HF symptoms and a low threshold to pursue cardiovascular evaluation for heart transplantation once symptoms become substantial.</p><p>The characteristics of HCM patients with advanced HF and preserved systolic function (LVEF ≥50 percent) were evaluated in a retrospective analysis combining two cohorts that included a total of 2100 patients [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].

However, in HCM, severity of HF symptoms are not always substantiated by traditional heart transplant testing. For example, 10 percent of HCM patients considered for transplant demonstrate peak VO<sub>2</sub> measurements that are outside of traditional transplant cutoff values (&gt;14 mL/kg/min) [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].

Compared with survival of an age-matched group without HCM, survival was less among patients with HCM over time. However, this study included patients beginning in 1980, prior to the introduction of many contemporary risk stratification and treatment therapies such as the risk stratification algorithm and ICD for SCD prevention, and invasive septal reduction therapies including alcohol septal ablation and contemporary surgical techniques for myectomy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Risk factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As noted, patients with HCM have an increased risk of death from several causes (SCD, HF, and stroke).

Severe CAD was defined as the presence of a single luminal stenosis of ≥50 percent in the left main coronary artery, ≥70 percent in other major epicardial branches, or two stenoses of ≥50 percent. Ten-year overall survival was 46 percent, 71 percent, and 77 percent for patients with severe, mild-to-moderate, and no coronary artery disease, respectively.

Ten-year survival was significantly lower in those with abnormal (with fixed and/or reversible defects) SPECT images (67 versus 90 percent with a normal test) and in those with reversible defects (64 versus 90 percent without reversible defects).

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

However, early onset disease in HCM can occur in infancy and early childhood, and late-onset disease occurring in mid-life has also been recognized. (See <a class="local">'Development of hypertrophy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Heart failure symptoms</strong> – Progression to New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV HF (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683" href="/d/graphic/52683.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) occurs in a minority of patients with HCM and is most often associated with LV outflow tract obstruction (LVOT; ≥30 mmHg). Progression to severe HF symptoms is associated with a marked increase in cardiovascular mortality, particularly in nonobstructed HCM patients. In patients with obstruction and class III/IV symptoms, relief of the gradient is associated with substantial improvement in HF symptoms and normal longevity. (See <a class="local">'Heart failure'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Arrhythmias</strong> – HCM is associated with an age-related increase in the prevalence of supraventricular arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4926.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in adults: Supraventricular tachycardias including atrial fibrillation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diastolic dysfunction</strong> – Patients with nonobstructive HCM with preserved systolic function (LVEF ≥50 percent) may also develop advanced HF symptoms due to low cardiac output syndrome related to impaired LV filling. Such patients who develop significant functional limitation despite medical therapy, usually in the absence of adverse LV remodeling, should undergo consideration for heart transplant. In a subgroup of these patients, traditional objective transplant measures with peak VO<sub>2</sub> are not present. In select patients, additional therapeutic interventions should be considered as a bridge to transplant, including primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), intravenous inotropic drugs, and LV assist device. (See <a class="local">'Nonobstructive with preserved systolic function (ejection fraction ≥50 percent)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>End-stage hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</strong> – A small proportion of patients with HCM (&lt;5 percent) will develop the high-risk phenotype of HCM with LV systolic dysfunction, associated with reduced systolic function (LV ejection fraction [LVEF] &lt;50 percent). In some cases, there is relative LV dilation and wall thinning, with greater resemblance to the morphologic and functional features of dilated cardiomyopathy. HCM with LV systolic dysfunction raises consideration for aggressive therapy, including consideration for primary prevention ICD, conventional heart failure (HF) therapy, and early consideration for transplant evaluation. (See <a class="local">'HCM with LV systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction &lt;50 percent)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Heart transplantation</strong> – Patients with HCM with LV systolic dysfunction, as well as those with preserved systolic function (LVEF ≥50 percent) who develop advanced HF symptoms despite drug therapy, may be candidates for transplant. Extent of functional limitation and other important results from objective testing, including cardiopulmonary exercise testing and invasive hemodynamics, support transplant listing in HCM. Mortality on transplant list for patients with HCM is similar to non-HCM causes of HF, although outcomes for patients with HCM who undergo cardiac transplantation appear as good compared with transplant recipients with other etiologies of cardiomyopathy. (See <a class="local">'Heart transplant'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk of mortality</strong> – HCM is compatible with normal life expectancy for the majority of patients, with annual mortality rates of referral-based HCM populations of 1 percent, with the major causes of death being sudden cardiac death (SCD), HF, and stroke. SCD is more common in young patients, while death from HF or stroke is more common in mid-life and beyond.
