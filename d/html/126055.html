         Adenocarcinomas of the endometrium are the most common gynecologic malignancy in developed countries and the second most common in resource-limited countries. While the majority of patients present with localized disease and have an excellent prognosis, a subset has metastatic disease at presentation, or develops distant recurrence after initial treatment of the primary tumor. For those in whom endometrial cancer (EC) recurs or progresses to distant sites, the goals of treatment are palliative rather than curative.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will review the approach and treatment options for patients with metastatic EC. Early involvement of palliative care is also appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
         The treatment of early and locally advanced cancers, locoregional recurrence, and later-line systemic therapy for metastatic disease are discussed separately. In addition, chemotherapy protocols used in the treatment of EC are available separately.

         <strong>
          Clinical presentation
         </strong>
         – The clinical presentation for metastatic EC is variable. Most patients with metastatic disease will have previously been treated for a localized primary EC, and subsequently develop a distant area of relapse or progression. A small subset will present with de novo metastatic disease.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Signs and symptoms of metastatic disease are relatively nonspecific. If locoregional disease is also present, they may include bleeding (which emanates from the vagina, bladder, or rectum), abdominal pain, pelvic pain, and lower abdominal or extremity swelling, but could also involve anorexia, weight loss, shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, or bone pain [

         <strong>
          Evaluation
         </strong>
         – For patients with suspected metastatic disease, whole-body imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is necessary for staging. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) scan, or a combined PET-CT scan are appropriate options. If cancer antigen (CA) 125 was elevated at the time of initial presentation, it is also reasonable to remeasure CA 125, though the level of CA 125 alone should not influence treatment decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Additionally, pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis with a biopsy is typically performed to provide confirmation of the diagnosis. Of note, tissue obtained at this time may also be sent for genomic analysis that might lend insight into molecular features of the tumor that inform prognosis and treatment decisions.

         For patients with newly diagnosed, metastatic EC, we typically suggest surgical cytoreduction, followed by systemic treatment. We use the same criteria in EC as in ovarian cancer for deciding on upfront cytoreduction versus chemotherapy, taking into account the ability to optimally cytoreduce the disease and the performance status of the patient. Unfortunately, high-quality data are lacking for cytoreduction for EC. (See

          Surgical candidates

         – For patients who undergo surgical cytoreduction of metastatic disease, we suggest adjuvant chemotherapy, with or without immunotherapy, rather than observation alone. The administration of postoperative therapy in this setting is extrapolated from the benefits of treatment for patients with newly diagnosed high-risk EC. Based on the results of the GOG 209 trial, our preferred chemotherapy regimen is

          Nonsurgical candidates

         – Patients who are not surgical candidates should be offered medical therapy (chemotherapy, with or without immunotherapy), provided that they are candidates for treatment. Selection of therapy is the same as for patients who are surgical candidates. (See

         We typically suggest systemic therapy alone, typically with a platinum-based combination, with or without immunotherapy, rather than cytoreduction followed by systemic therapy. However, carefully selected patients with metastatic progression or recurrence may be candidates for cytoreduction (ie, those with good performance status, platinum-free interval ≥1 year, and expectation of complete cytoreduction).

         As discussed above, surgical cytoreduction is appropriate in select patients with metastatic disease. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Overview of treatment'

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The approach to primary cytoreduction of EC is identical to that for patients with advanced ovarian cancer. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/122088.html" rel="external">
          "Cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Surgical cytoreduction"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Cytoreduction appears to confer a survival advantage to patients with pelvic or intra-abdominal spread of EC, but high-quality data are lacking, and management is often extrapolated from the literature on cytoreduction for ovarian cancer. However, survival in this disease is inferior to patients who undergo cytoreduction for ovarian cancer [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In a meta-analysis of retrospective cohort studies including over 3600 patients with advanced-stage EC undergoing primary cytoreductive surgery, maximal cytoreduction (ie, no gross residual disease) was achieved in 52 percent of patients and optimal cytoreduction to &lt;1 cm of residual disease was achieved in 75 percent [

         Patients with metastatic EC are treated with systemic therapy, either following surgical cytoreduction or as primary therapy. The benefit of multiagent chemotherapy for advanced, recurrent, or metastatic EC was shown in a 2012 meta-analysis of trials that compared administration of multiagent combinations ("more intensive" regimens) with less intensive combinations [

         For patients receiving systemic treatment for metastatic disease, we typically perform CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis every two to three cycles, or more frequently in the setting of new or concerning symptoms. As in the adjuvant setting, the data do not support the routine monitoring of serum cancer antigen (CA) 125 for patients with recurrent or metastatic EC. However, in patients whose disease was marked by an elevated CA 125, it may be reasonable to use this as a marker of disease activity alongside imaging and/or clinical examination. (See

         Older age (eg, &gt;65 years) has been associated with higher rates of clinical relapse and decreased survival. The decision to use chemotherapy in such patients is complicated due to an increased number of comorbidities. Prior to making a decision regarding therapy, we suggest a comprehensive geriatric assessment in order to help guide discussions on primary and adjuvant treatment. This topic is addressed in more detail separately. (See

         Although clinical practice varies, we prefer to dose chemotherapy based on actual rather than ideal body weight. This is consistent with guidelines published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. One exception to this is the dosing of

          carboplatin

         , where we continue to use fixed dosing based on area under the curve because it reduces the risk of neurotoxicity compared with weight-based dosing. However, since patients with recurrent or metastatic disease are not able to be cured, the balance of efficacy and toxicity must always be considered. (See

         For patients with newly diagnosed, metastatic EC, we typically suggest surgical cytoreduction followed by systemic therapy rather than either modality on its own (

         By contrast, for patients who develop metastatic EC after having been treated for localized disease, we typically suggest systemic therapy alone rather than cytoreduction followed by systemic therapy (

          Grade 2C
