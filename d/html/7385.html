PCOS can be readily diagnosed when women present with the classic features of hirsutism, irregular menstrual cycles, and polycystic ovarian morphology on transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS). However, there has been considerable controversy about specific diagnostic criteria when not all of these classic features are evident.</p><p>The diagnosis of PCOS will be reviewed here. The epidemiology and pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and treatment of PCOS are described in detail separately. The diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents is also reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7430.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, phenotype, and genetics of the polycystic ovary syndrome in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7436.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7421.html" rel="external">"Treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94182.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic evaluation of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescents"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H93970491"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinical features of PCOS are described here briefly but are reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7436.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults"</a>.)</p><p>PCOS is thought to be one of the most common endocrinopathies in women, affecting between 5 and 10 percent of women, depending upon the population studied [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7430.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, phenotype, and genetics of the polycystic ovary syndrome in adults", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>). The syndrome is characterized clinically by oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenism, as well as the frequent presence of associated risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including obesity, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, fatty liver, and obstructive sleep apnea. Other features include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Menstrual dysfunction – The menstrual irregularity typically begins in the peripubertal period, and menarche may be delayed. The menstrual pattern is typically one of oligomenorrhea (fewer than nine menstrual periods in a year) and, less often, amenorrhea (no menstrual periods for three or more consecutive months). Women with PCOS often experience more regular cycles after age 40 years. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7436.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults", section on 'Menstrual dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hyperandrogenism – Hyperandrogenism may include clinical signs (hirsutism, acne, male-pattern hair loss) and/or elevated serum androgen concentrations (ie, hyperandrogenemia) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15679.html" rel="external">"Female pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia in females): Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>). Most women with PCOS have both clinical and biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism. Signs of more severe androgen excess (virilization), such as deepening of the voice and clitoromegaly, occur rarely and suggest the possibility of ovarian hyperthecosis or an androgen-secreting tumor. (See <a class="local">'Severe hyperandrogenism/virilization'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Hirsutism is defined as excess terminal (thick, pigmented) body hair in a male distribution and may be noted above the upper lip, chin, periareolar area, in the midsternum, and along the linea alba of the lower abdomen  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73544" href="/d/graphic/73544.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). There is substantial racial variability in hirsutism; Asian women with PCOS, as an example, have a lesser degree of hirsutism, than do non-Hispanic White or Black women. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7439.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology and causes of hirsutism", section on 'Ethnicity'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Polycystic ovaries – The typical polycystic appearance of the ovaries is seen on transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) in the majority of women with irregular menses and hyperandrogenism. However, this ultrasound appearance is nonspecific as it may also be seen in normal-cycling women. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7436.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults", section on 'Ultrasound appearance'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Metabolic issues/cardiovascular risks – Approximately 40 to 85 percent of women with PCOS are overweight or obese compared with age-matched controls [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Insulin resistance is present in both lean and obese women with PCOS (30 and 70 percent, respectively) compared with age- and weight-matched controls [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Women with PCOS are also at increased risk for type 2 diabetes. There are concerns that women with PCOS are at higher risk than women without PCOS for coronary heart disease, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, but data are inconclusive. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7436.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults", section on 'IGT/type 2 diabetes'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7436.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults", section on 'Coronary heart disease'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other clinical manifestations related to PCOS include nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and sleep apnea. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7436.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults", section on 'Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7436.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults", section on 'Sleep apnea'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mood – There is evidence that PCOS is associated with mood disorders (depression and anxiety), impaired quality of life, and eating disorders (binge eating, even when compared with women with the same body mass index [BMI]). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7436.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults", section on 'Psychosocial issues'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2857069684"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2574299161"><span class="h2">When to suspect PCOS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of PCOS should be suspected in any women of reproductive age who presents with irregular menses and symptoms of hyperandrogenism (acne, hirsutism, male-pattern hair loss). The presence of overweight or obesity should further raise suspicion. Some women present with either oligomenorrhea or hyperandrogenic symptoms alone. They should also be evaluated for PCOS, particularly those with hyperandrogenism (as most women with hirsutism have PCOS). Women with polycystic ovaries on ultrasound and no other clinical features of PCOS (hyperandrogenism or menstrual dysfunction) do not have PCOS and need no further evaluation. (See <a class="local">'Transvaginal ultrasound'</a> below.)</p><p>Lastly, it is important to have a high index of suspicion for PCOS because these women may have associated risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including obesity, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, fatty liver, and obstructive sleep apnea that require evaluation and treatment. (See <a class="local">'Cardiometabolic risk assessment'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3200266717"><span class="h3">Delays in diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Early diagnosis and intervention are important in women with PCOS for quality of life and well-being.<strong> </strong>However, most women with PCOS describe a<strong> </strong>poor diagnosis experience related to long delays and inadequate health information [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. In a cross-sectional, international study of diagnosis experiences in over 1300 women with PCOS (using online questionnaires), almost half saw three or more health professionals prior to diagnosis, and for one-third, it took over two years before their diagnosis was made [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In addition, only 16 percent were satisfied with the health information and educational materials they received. These observations highlight opportunities for improving care for women with PCOS.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1575001986"><span class="h2">History and physical</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Using the Rotterdam criteria, many patients can be diagnosed based upon the history and physical (eg, a history of irregular menses and clinical signs of hyperandrogenism: acne, hirsutism, and/or male-pattern hair loss). As noted above, irregular menses typically begin in the teenage years. Women who develop oligomenorrhea at a much later age (eg, &gt;30 years) are less likely to have PCOS. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7402.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of secondary amenorrhea"</a>.)</p><p>We suggest using the Ferriman-Gallwey score to assess the degree of hirsutism on physical exam  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66629" href="/d/graphic/66629.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). However, there are a number of limitations to this approach in clinical practice. Most importantly, the expression of hair growth varies among racial groups. Most East Asian and Native American women have little body hair, White and Black women have an intermediate amount, and most Mediterranean, South Asian, and Middle Eastern women have substantially greater quantities of body hair, even though serum androgen concentrations are similar in all groups. Therefore, even a minimal amount of acne or facial hair in an East Asian or Native American women should raise suspicion for a hyperandrogenic disorder, most commonly, PCOS.</p><p>Women with evidence of virilization and/or hirsutism of recent onset that is rapidly progressive need immediate evaluation for the most serious causes of hyperandrogenism (ovarian and adrenal androgen-secreting tumors). (See <a class="local">'Severe hyperandrogenism/virilization'</a> below and <a class="local">'Androgen-secreting tumors/ovarian hyperthecosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3727155361"><span class="h2">Biochemical testing</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2659188992"><span class="h3">Women with hyperandrogenism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We suggest measuring serum androgens in women with hyperandrogenic symptoms (with or without oligomenorrhea). Most women who present with hirsutism have PCOS, but it is essential to identify those who have other disorders such as NCCAH, or a more serious cause (androgen-secreting tumors and ovarian hyperthecosis). The approach to ruling out other disorders is similar to the evaluation of women with hirsutism, 75 to 80 percent of whom have PCOS.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2316287915"><span class="h4">Normal menstrual cycles</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Women with hyperandrogenic symptoms (most commonly hirsutism) and normal menstrual cycles are most likely to fall into the category of PCOS or idiopathic hirsutism and are unlikely to have a more serious cause for their hirsutism. For these women, we suggest measuring only a serum total testosterone. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7441.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of premenopausal women with hirsutism", section on 'Hirsutism and normal menstrual cycles'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3970071755"><span class="h4">Oligomenorrhea</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For women with hyperandrogenic symptoms and oligomenorrhea, we suggest measuring a serum total testosterone, an early morning 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and routine labs to investigate other causes of irregular menses. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7441.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of premenopausal women with hirsutism", section on 'Hirsutism with oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Total testosterone</strong> – In women with clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism (hirsutism, acne, or male-pattern hair loss on exam), we suggest measuring serum total testosterone. Serum total testosterone is best assessed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS), an accurate and specific method. With LC-MS/MS, the upper limit of normal for serum testosterone in women is in the 45 to 60 ng/dL range (1.6 to 2.1 nmol/L); women with a serum testosterone &gt;150 ng/dL require evaluation for the most serious causes of hyperandrogenism (ovarian and adrenal androgen-secreting tumors) (see <a class="local">'Severe hyperandrogenism/virilization'</a> below). The immunoassays that are available in most hospital laboratories are not suitable to accurately measure testosterone in women. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7441.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of premenopausal women with hirsutism", section on 'Hirsutism with oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other androgens</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Free testosterone</strong> – We do <strong>not</strong> suggest the routine measurement of serum free testosterone. Some groups do recommend measuring free testosterone instead of or in addition to total testosterone because it may be the most sensitive test to establish the presence of hyperandrogenemia. However, commercially available free testosterone assays are currently unreliable. If measured, it should be done in a laboratory that measures it by equilibrium dialysis. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Another option, although less good, is to order free testosterone from a laboratory that calculates it from total testosterone and <strong>sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)</strong> measurements using a formula demonstrated to give results that agree closely with those of equilibrium dialysis [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]; laboratories that use other formulae should not be used, since other formulae give spuriously high results [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Direct measurement of SHBG is helpful in other ways. In women with PCOS, an abnormally low SHBG is a risk factor for increased biologically active testosterone and, hence, a more severe phenotype [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>DHEAS</strong> – We do <strong>not</strong> suggest the routine measurement of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) in women thought to have PCOS, because mildly elevated levels of DHEAS are unlikely to affect management.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">However, we do suggest measuring DHEAS in severe hyperandrogenism because it can be extremely high in adrenocortical carcinoma. (See <a class="local">'Severe hyperandrogenism/virilization'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Androstenedione</strong> – The role of serum androstenedione in the evaluation of PCOS and/or hirsutism is unclear [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. However, its measurement in some populations with PCOS, for example, Icelandic women, may be important for documenting hyperandrogenism [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Two studies have reported isolated elevations of serum androstenedione concentrations in women with PCOS, but the percent of women with this biochemical pattern is variable (20 of 86 [23 percent] [<a href="#rid11">11</a>] and 49 of 1128 [4.1 percent] [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]). In the smaller study, serum androstenedione was negatively associated with insulin sensitivity. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7436.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone</strong> – We suggest measuring a morning serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone in the early follicular phase in all women with possible PCOS to rule out nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCCAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. For women who have some spontaneous menstrual cycles, this should be done in the early follicular phase, while for those without cycles, it can be drawn on a random day.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The clinical presentation of NCCAH can be similar if not identical to that of PCOS (hyperandrogenism, oligomenorrhea, and polycystic ovaries). NCCAH is less common than PCOS but should be ruled out because there are risks that offspring could be affected with the more severe classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65205" href="/d/graphic/65205.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). It is particularly important to test women of Eastern European Jewish descent (who have a 1:27 prevalence) and women of Hispanic, Slavic, or Italian descent, in whom the prevalence is 1:40, 1:50, and 1:300 women, respectively [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/147.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis and treatment of nonclassic (late-onset) congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency", section on 'Genetic testing'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tests to rule out other causes of oligomenorrhea</strong> – In any woman with oligomenorrhea/oligo-ovulation, other causes of irregular menses should be investigated. Testing should include human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). In general, it is not necessary to measure luteinizing hormone (LH); an elevated LH-to-FSH ratio is not a criterion for the diagnosis of PCOS. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7402.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of secondary amenorrhea", section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In the past, many clinicians measured LH and FSH and used an elevated LH:FSH ratio ≥2 as evidence for the diagnosis of PCOS. However, the LH:FSH ratio was never a criterion for the diagnosis, and its use can be misleading (eg, if there has been a recent ovulation, LH will be suppressed and the ratio will be ≤2:1).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anti-müllerian hormone (AMH)</strong> – Serum AMH concentrations are generally in the upper range of normal or markedly elevated in women with PCOS [<a href="#rid14">14-16</a>]. At this time, AMH assays are limited by the absence of an international standard; AMH is not currently part of the laboratory evaluation of PCOS.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1560275034"><span class="h4">Already taking pharmacologic therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some women with hirsutism seek advice when they are already taking pharmacotherapy, usually estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives. Measuring serum androgens is generally not useful in this setting, because oral contraceptives suppress serum gonadotropins and ovarian androgens, most importantly, testosterone. Androgen measurements should also not be obtained when women are on <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9621" href="/d/drug information/9621.html" rel="external">metformin</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9943" href="/d/drug information/9943.html" rel="external">spironolactone</a>, as the interpretation of the result is confounded by the effects of these medications on androgen levels. In general, we ask women stop their medications at least four to six weeks before measuring serum androgens.
