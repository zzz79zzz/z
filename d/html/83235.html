In most cases, patients in the ICU die after life-sustaining treatments are withdrawn or withheld [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16295.html" rel="external">"Withholding and withdrawing ventilatory support in adults in the intensive care unit"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16296.html" rel="external">"Ethics in the intensive care unit: Responding to requests for potentially inappropriate therapies in adults"</a>.)</p><p>When asked, most patients express a preference to die at home [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>], though logistical and medical issues frequently preclude this from happening, and sometimes these preferences may change [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Therefore, increasing attention is being focused on end-of-life care in the ICU setting. Despite many efforts to improve quality of care, evidence suggests that there is significant variation in quality across hospitals, although there is some evidence of significant improvement in palliative care provision in the ICU setting over time [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. Overall, palliative care consultation in the ICU setting seems to be increasing, particularly for patients with cardiovascular disease [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss palliative care issues as they specifically apply to patients admitted to the ICU. Other topics in palliative care and the ICU are covered separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14240.html" rel="external">"Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1643.html" rel="external">"Communication in the ICU: Holding a meeting with families and caregivers"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16296.html" rel="external">"Ethics in the intensive care unit: Responding to requests for potentially inappropriate therapies in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16295.html" rel="external">"Withholding and withdrawing ventilatory support in adults in the intensive care unit"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2196.html" rel="external">"Approach to symptom assessment in palliative care"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14241.html" rel="external">"Palliative care: The last hours and days of life"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15482315"><span class="h1">RELATIONSHIP OF PALLIATIVE CARE TO END-OF-LIFE CARE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Palliative care focuses on preventing and relieving suffering for any patient facing serious illness. It can be initiated and administered concurrently with life-prolonging therapies [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. End-of-life care is a subset of palliative care that occurs during the circumscribed period of time when curative or life-prolonging therapy may be no longer indicated or effective and patients are in their final hours, days, or weeks of life.</p><p>Regardless of where a particular patient is in their disease trajectory, palliative care aims to provide patients facing serious illness and their families, caregivers, and surrogates with the best possible quality of life, whether or not they die from this episode of illness. The primary tenets of palliative care are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Symptom assessment and management</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Elucidation of the patient's goals of care that are in keeping with their personal values and preferences</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Consistent and sustained communication between the patient and all those involved in their care</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Psychosocial, spiritual, and practical support both to patients and their caregivers</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Coordination across sites of care</p><p></p><p>Further discussion on the benefits, services, and models for palliative care are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14240.html" rel="external">"Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care", section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15482459"><span class="h2">Comfort measures only</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients facing the end of life in an ICU often transition from care aimed at prolonging life to care that is focused primarily on the alleviation of symptoms, or what is otherwise known as "comfort measures" or "comfort measures only." This refers to a philosophy of care focused exclusively on the treatment of symptoms. In the ICU, a transition to comfort measures only typically occurs after a patient intentionally foregoes or does not improve with life-sustaining treatments or when life-sustaining treatment is felt to be medically inappropriate. Usually, at the time someone is considered to be a candidate for a transition to comfort measures only, the ICU team and patient and/or caregiver have come to the conclusion that the underlying disease process cannot be stabilized or cured. For these patients, efforts should be made to minimize invasive and uncomfortable interventions and care should be redirected toward the management of physical, psychosocial, and spiritual symptoms. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16296.html" rel="external">"Ethics in the intensive care unit: Responding to requests for potentially inappropriate therapies in adults"</a>.)</p><p>In some institutions, the term "comfort care" is used instead of "comfort measures only." However, in our opinion, "comfort care" can be confused with care focused on sustaining life or curing disease that is <strong>simultaneously</strong> aimed at managing a patient's symptoms. Therefore, we prefer the term "comfort measures only" when all available interventions are aimed exclusively on symptom management and quality of life. We acknowledge the term "comfort measures only" may be upsetting for some patients and caregivers who may not accept this approach or perceive this as a limitation in care. However, the clarity of the term has advantages over the less clear "comfort care." Each of these terms are also subject to variable definition and interpretation by patients, families, surrogates, caregivers, and providers, so thoughtful exploration and discussion around a plan of care beyond these broad phrases and terms is essential [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3360231113"><span class="h1">ICU ADMISSION FOR PALLIATIVE THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The utilization of ICU services specifically for palliative care purposes depends on both the institution's guidelines for intensive care and the patient's goals. While a relatively intensive level of care might be possible on acute care inpatient units at some institutions, other institutions may only be able to provide these services in the context of an ICU. Some examples that may prompt admission to the ICU for these patients include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients who experience an acute life-threatening event may be admitted to the ICU before there is a clear understanding of the patient's goals or likely outcomes as these relate to intensive care</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients for whom symptom control requires a higher level of monitoring or one-to-one nursing</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients for whom medications are recommended that cannot be given on a regular acute care inpatient unit (eg, palliative sedation) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83710.html" rel="external">"Palliative sedation"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1032755"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS FOR PALLIATIVE CARE REFERRAL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Individual studies have evaluated different consultation triggers when evaluating the impact of palliative care consultation in the ICU [<a href="#rid12">12-17</a>]. In general, patients who meet any of the following criteria may be appropriate referrals for palliative care consultation:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chronic critical illness – Although there is no general consensus to what constitutes a chronic critical illness, it typically is characterized by an ICU stay longer than 5 to 14 days</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use of specific medical procedures in patients with life-limiting illness (eg, tracheostomy, percutaneous gastrostomy tube, extracorporeal life support)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Age ≥80 years</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Presence of significant medical comorbidities or poor baseline functional status</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of chronic or incurable life-limiting illnesses (eg, metastatic cancer; advanced respiratory, cardiac, or renal disease; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Specific acute illnesses (eg, anoxic brain injury after cardiac arrest, intracerebral hemorrhage requiring mechanical ventilation)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Overall poor prognosis as determined by an attending physician</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unmet palliative care needs among patients or family members, surrogates, and caregivers</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient or family member request for referral</p><p></p><p>For patients specifically admitted to a surgical ICU, the American College of Surgeons Surgical Palliative Care Task Force recommends palliative care consultation in the following situations [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When requested by the patient, their surrogate decision maker, and/or family</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In situations involving a conflict between the care team, the patient, their surrogates, and/or family (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16296.html" rel="external">"Ethics in the intensive care unit: Responding to requests for potentially inappropriate therapies in adults"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with an advance directive requesting limited interventions</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients hospitalized for &gt;30 days</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients for whom clinicians believe life-sustaining treatments are potentially inappropriate</p><p></p><p>Use of such criteria for palliative care consultation can decrease resource utilization in the ICU without affecting mortality and improve access to palliative care services [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. It is also important to understand that some patients or their caregivers who do not meet these criteria may have unmet palliative care needs [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15482324"><span class="h1">PALLIATIVE CARE SERVICES IN THE ICU</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The incorporation of palliative care in the ICU requires interdisciplinary collaboration, with coordinated management provided by critical care specialists as well as palliative care consultants.</p><p>Interdisciplinary palliative care consultants are becoming an increasingly available option across many health systems and their involvement in this setting is associated with multiple benefits, including [<a href="#rid20">20-23</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Improved symptom management</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased utilization of hospice resources</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased patient and caregiver satisfaction</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decreased ICU readmission rates following hospital discharge</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Higher utilization of and transition to formal advance directives</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reduced moral distress and burnout among ICU clinicians</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased savings to the medical system</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1249117"><span class="h2">Models for palliative care provision</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In general, three models of palliative care provision are described in the critical care literature [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Consultative model – In the consultative model, palliative care specialists provide services directly to critically ill patients, but are not part of the primary ICU team. In general, consultations are sought for patients who are felt to be the most ill, have the highest palliative care needs, and/or have the poorest prognosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Integrative model – In the integrative model, palliative care is provided as part of the practice of critical care teams. Therefore, ideally all patients in the ICU with palliative care needs are provided with palliative care, not only those with the poorest prognosis or with unmet palliative care needs [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mixed model – In the mixed model, both consultative and integrative approaches are used simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Systematic reviews from 2011 and 2021 evaluating interventions to improve communication in the ICU included studies involving palliative care consultants (as in the consultative model) as well as palliative care provided by critical care clinicians (as in the integrative model) [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>]. These reviews found that several factors were associated with reduced family, surrogate, and caregiver distress; improved family, surrogate, and caregiver comprehension of diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment; and decreased utilization of intensive treatments at the end of life. These factors included access to palliative care consultants, provision of printed information, and regular, structured communication by the critical care team [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>]. Palliative care interventions in the ICU and the associated outcomes that have been studied are highly variable, although improvements in length of stay and decisions regarding life-sustaining treatment and code status have been associated with both the integrative and consultative models of palliative care [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>].</p><p>A randomized trial of palliative care-led family, surrogate, and caregiver meetings to discuss prognosis with family, surrogates, and caregivers of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation found no significant improvement in families', surrogates', and caregivers' symptoms of anxiety and depression and a possible worsening in symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder associated with the intervention [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Importantly, the palliative care specialists did not perform a formal palliative care consultation and they only led one or two family, surrogate, and caregiver meetings, often without the ICU clinicians present. Thus, the palliative care intervention was not very comprehensive. This study suggests that interventions to integrate specialty palliative care into the ICU must coordinate this care with the ICU team [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p>A randomized trial among critically ill patients and their surrogates found that a family-support intervention delivered by an inter-professional ICU team was associated with improved surrogate ratings of the quality of communication and the patient- and family-centeredness of care as well as a reduction in the length of stay compared with usual care [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. The intervention was delivered by the ICU team with support from ICU nurses who were specially trained to promote regular inter-professional family, surrogate, and caregiver meetings and provide family, surrogates, and caregivers with emotional support between these meetings.</p><p>An end-of-life program that integrated patient-centered and family-, surrogate-, and caregiver-centered wishes for the dying was evaluated in a study called the three wishes project (3WP) [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. The 3WP intervention involved an ICU clinician or team member eliciting three dying wishes for patients in whom a decision was made to withdraw life-sustaining treatments or in whom there was an estimated mortality &gt;95 percent. There were several wish categories ranging from honoring the patient as an individual (eg, dressing in their own clothing) to family, surrogate, or caregiver connections (eg, unlimited visiting hours) and postmortem tributes (eg, sending a fruit basket to the home). The intervention was assessed as valuable by caregivers, providers, and administrative staff. The program required minimal financial investment and proved to be sustainable after study completion.</p><p>Interventions to increase palliative care provision in the ICU have been evaluated, including pre-rounds between the ICU and palliative care team [<a href="#rid33">33</a>], proactive identification of patients at high risk of dying [<a href="#rid12">12</a>], and the use of a palliative care needs checklist by the ICU team during ICU rounds [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. However, further work is needed to ensure access to palliative care in the ICU given that a high proportion of ICU patients (approximately one in seven) meet common triggers for palliative care consultation [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1249131"><span class="h2">Barriers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Despite data suggesting that access to palliative care services enhances quality of care in the ICU [<a href="#rid27">27</a>], palliative care is underutilized in the ICU setting at many institutions. Common barriers include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A lack of awareness by ICU clinicians that these consultations are available or beneficial</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A misconception that palliative care is only for patients who are actively dying</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Limited availability of palliative care specialists</p><p></p><p>Additional barriers identified by clinicians include family, surrogates', caregivers', and patients' difficulty understanding or accepting a poor prognosis or accepting limitations on life-sustaining treatments; disagreement among family, surrogates, and caregivers about the goals of care; and patients' incapacity to make decisions about goals of care [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p>Data suggest that immigration status impacts end-of-life care. One study of over 47,000 Canadian immigrants reported that compared with long-standing residents, recent immigrants (&lt;30 years) were more likely to be admitted to the ICU (25 versus 19 percent), die in the ICU (16 versus 10 percent), and receive more aggressive measures of care including mechanical ventilation (22 versus 13 percent), dialysis (6 versus 3 percent), feeding tube placement (6 versus 3 percent), and tracheostomy (2 versus 1 percent) [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. Rates of ICU death varied among different nationalities but were greatest in South Asians and lowest in Western and Northern Europeans. Mortality risk was greatest in those who had immigrated most recently (&lt;2 years). The analysis did not adjust for race, ethnicity, and English-speaking ability. Further studies are required to understand the mechanisms for this association, but underlying causes may relate to communication barriers, challenges in health literacy, and cultural differences in preferences for end-of-life care.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15482338"><span class="h1">COMMUNICATION ISSUES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Because of the sensitive nature of issues related to palliative care, it is important that clinicians have a clear assessment of the patient and their ability to participate in conversations, particularly if goals of care are being discussed. In addition, issues related to advance care planning and surrogate decision making should be thoroughly explored.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2125030113"><span class="h2">Discussing end of life</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many people defer discussions of their preferences to a time when there is a decline in their health status. However, these conversations may be difficult or even impossible when a patient is acutely decompensating. Still, an anticipated or recommended admission to the ICU is an important opportunity to talk with patients about their hopes, fears, values, and goals at the end of life. Discussions should encompass the potential benefits and burdens of ICU-level of care as well as alternatives including care focused primarily on comfort and symptom management.</p><p>For patients admitted to the ICU, particularly those who have not completed advance care planning, these discussions should occur early in an ICU stay and it may be helpful to use the framework of the "time-limited trial" of intensive care [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. A time-limited trial (TLT) is defined as an "agreement between clinicians and a patient or family members or caregivers to use certain medical therapies over a defined period to see if the patient improves or deteriorates according to agreed-on clinical outcomes" [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. TLTs can be helpful in giving clinicians additional information about prognosis and also in helping families and caregivers prepare for a possible transition in the goals of care. TLTs have been associated with a decreased length of stay in the ICU [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].

Capacity can be established by bedside clinicians and does not require legal or psychiatric evaluation. However, capacity should not be presumed to be static across decisions of varying complexity or over time. For example, a patient may have the capacity to make one decision but lack capacity to make a more complex decision. Assessment of decisional capacity in the ICU can be challenging and time-consuming, but it is extremely important. Barriers to capacity assessment may include intubation, sedation, delirium, or the presence of hearing impairment in the patient.

They are generally completed in advance of critical illness by an individual in whom decisional capacity is not in question. There are some data to suggest that patients who make their wishes known in a living will are more likely to receive the care of their choosing [<a href="#rid40">40-42</a>]. Additionally, the presence of advance directives has been shown to improve family, surrogate, and caregiver ratings of the quality of the dying process and decrease the burden on surrogate decision-makers [<a href="#rid43">43-46</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/86248.html" rel="external">"Advance care planning and advance directives"</a>.)</p><p>Clinician orders for comfort measures or for limited interventions that are completed prior to hospitalization may reduce admission rates into the ICU. One retrospective cohort study of 1818 decedents who had chronic life-limiting illness, had completed Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST, also known in other states as Clinician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment [COLST]) form, and were admitted to hospital within six months before their death reported that 22 percent of patients had orders for comfort measures only, 42 percent had orders for limited interventions, and 36 percent had orders for full treatment [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. Those with comfort measures and limited intervention orders were less likely to be admitted to the ICU than those with orders for full treatment (31 versus 62 percent). However, 38 percent of patients with comfort measures and limited intervention orders received treatments that were discordant with the prior order; this effect was more exaggerated in those who did not have cancer compared with those who had cancer (36 versus 23 percent) and in patients without dementia than with dementia (34 versus 21 percent). Despite study design limitations (eg, retrospective nature, limited generalizability), these data suggest that clinician orders regarding goals of care reduce unnecessary admissions to the ICU. A 2021 systemic review reported similar findings, namely, that having a POLST or COLST form setting limits on care intensity was associated with decreased delivery of high-intensity treatment and in-hospital death [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. More work needs to be done to understand the reason for the provision of care that is discordant with the order and provide tools to reduce such discordance, when appropriate.</p><p>Even if patients have an advance directive, surrogate decision-makers for patients with a serious life-threatening illness often face challenging treatment choices that are not addressed in the living will. High-quality discussions about what is most important to patients promotes appropriate decision-making and patient-centered care. Understanding the patient's values, preferences, and care goals in the context of a serious illness allows clinicians to align the care provided with what is most important to the patient. Discussing goals of care is a unique skill that should be separated conceptually from talking about prognosis or delivering bad news. While discussions about goals of care may involve some of the same principles as other difficult communication tasks, these discussions demand a different framework. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/95552.html" rel="external">"Discussing goals of care"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15482504"><span class="h2">Surrogate decision-makers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When a patient lacks decisional capacity, a person close to them is frequently called upon to participate in medical decision-making in the critical care setting. In the absence of a designated guardian or durable power of attorney for health care (DPOAHC or healthcare proxy), clinicians rely on the legally defined "next-of-kin" to assist with medical decision-making. It is important that the physician identify the legal next-of-kin, rather than making the assumption that bedside caregivers are legal surrogate decision makers.</p><p>The order of priority for specific family members, surrogates, and caregivers varies somewhat by state and country. Of note, unless DPOAHC designation is given in an advance directive, committed partners may not necessarily be given "spousal" rights as a surrogate decision maker. This highlights the importance of completing a DPOAHC for such partners in advance. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2207.html" rel="external">"Legal aspects in palliative and end-of-life care in the United States", section on 'Surrogate decision makers'</a>.)</p><p>Surrogate medical decision-making for a critically ill patient is associated with high rates of anxiety and depression [<a href="#rid49">49,50</a>], particularly for patients with chronic critical illness [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. In one study, 82 percent of families, surrogates, and caregivers of critically ill patients who were asked to participate in medical decision-making demonstrated symptoms of post-traumatic stress 90 days after patient discharge or death [<a href="#rid52">52</a>]. The task may be complicated by the surrogate's unfamiliarity with the medical environment (including the rapid pace of events that can occur in the ICU) and with complex medical decision-making processes in general, both of which can add to the challenge of functioning as a surrogate decision-maker. Studies suggest that the involvement of palliative care consultation services can mitigate this stress upon surrogates [<a href="#rid45">45,53</a>]. Structured support interventions are an evidence-based strategy to improve psychologic outcomes for caregivers as well. A recent randomized trial found that a structured three-step intervention for families or caregivers of patients dying in the ICU (a conference to prepare relatives for the patient's death, a support visit within the ICU room, and a meeting after the patient's death to offer sympathy and closure) was associated with lower rates of prolonged grief amongst the bereaved [<a href="#rid53">53</a>].</p><p>Guidelines have been issued by the American Thoracic Society on shared decision-making [<a href="#rid54">54</a>]. Details regarding the utility and process of shared decision-making during family/caregiver conferences in the ICU are provided separately.

This suggests that families, surrogates, and caregivers may be positively influenced by having more time and space to come to terms with medical decisions and with their own feelings of grief and loss. One way to ensure that families, surrogates, and caregivers have more time is to begin to address these issues early in the ICU stay. Additionally, family, surrogate, and caregiver satisfaction with decision-making can be increased through exploration of patients' wishes, direct recommendations by clinicians regarding withdrawing life support, when appropriate, and attention to families' spiritual needs [<a href="#rid57">57,58</a>]. Another study reported that a designated communication facilitator, whose role is to support communication between families, surrogates, caregivers, and clinicians, is associated with decreased family, surrogate, and caregiver depressive symptoms at six months and may also help to reduce cost and length of stay [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].

Multifaceted quality improvement interventions which include interprofessional education and outreach, training of local champions, and coordination across institutions providing ICU-level care have been shown to improve process measures specific to palliative care in the ICU, including, but not limited to: identification of surrogate decision makers, attention to code status and advance directives, assessment of symptoms, and completion of multidisciplinary meetings with patients and/or surrogate decision makers [<a href="#rid59">59</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3835700"><span class="h2">Symptom assessment in the ICU</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Common symptoms in the critical care setting include pain, dyspnea, and thirst, as well as sleep disturbance and anxiety [<a href="#rid60">60-63</a>].

For patients with a limited ability to communicate (eg, due to intubation), the clinician may use simple "yes or no" questions or use other cues such as facial expressions (eg, grimacing) or vital signs as well as the response to therapy to assess the presence and severity of symptoms [<a href="#rid62">62,68,69</a>]. However, symptom assessment in patients who are unable to communicate presents a particular challenge to clinicians in the ICU. When patients are unable to report their symptoms, validated tools, such as the Behavioral Pain Scale, the Critical Care Pain Observation Tool, and the Respiratory Distress Observation Scale can be used for objective assessment [<a href="#rid68">68,70-72</a>]. However, such tools should be interpreted carefully as they are an indirect representation of the patients' experience.

We prefer the term "comfort measures only" instead of "comfort care" because the latter can be confused with care focused on sustaining life or curing disease that is <strong>simultaneously</strong> aimed at managing a patient's symptoms. (See <a class="local">'Comfort measures only'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indications for palliation in the ICU</strong> – A palliative care consultation may be appropriate for any ICU patient who has a chronic critical illness, has an indication for specific medical procedures (eg, tracheostomy, percutaneous gastrostomy tube, extracorporeal life support), is ≥80 years old, had significant medical comorbidities or poor functional status at baseline, has chronic or life-limiting illnesses (eg, metastatic cancer), has specific acute illnesses with a poor prognosis (eg, anoxic brain injury, intracerebral hemorrhage requiring mechanical ventilation), or an overall poor prognosis as determined by an attending physician. There are also some patients with palliative care needs that are not identified with these criteria and screening for unmet palliative care needs should be considered. (See <a class="local">'Indications for palliative care referral'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Before patients are approached to make any medical decisions, decisional capacity related to the specific decision at hand should be determined.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Communication issues</strong> – While there is no clear evidence that standard advance directives alter care once patients are in the ICU, the presence of advance directives has been shown to improve families', surrogates', and caregivers' assessments of the quality of the dying process and decrease the burden on surrogate decision-makers. Furthermore, the process of advance care planning may be useful to help patients and their families, surrogates, and caregivers make more informed decisions. (See <a class="local">'Advance directives'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">When patients lack decisional capacity, a person close to them is frequently called upon to participate in medical decision-making in the critical care setting. In the absence of a designated guardian or durable power of attorney for health care, clinicians rely on the legally defined "next-of-kin" to assist with medical decision-making. (See <a class="local">'Surrogate decision-makers'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ICU-specific palliation</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients in the ICU for whom life-sustaining interventions are withdrawn, steps should be taken to maximize patient comfort and minimize any unnecessary interventions. (See <a class="local">'Patients for whom life-sustaining treatment is withdrawn'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In general, it is appropriate to allow the family, surrogates, and caregivers to witness CPR when they so wish, provided they have adequate support from the ICU team. (See <a class="local">'CPR and families bearing witness'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Religious and staffing issues</strong> – For patients in the ICU, the provision of spiritual support should be offered utilizing pastoral services available at each institution. (See <a class="local">'Addressing religion and/or spirituality'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">We support interventions to help mitigate burnout, including interdisciplinary conferences and opportunities to discuss and enhance the provision of interdisciplinary decision-making in the critical care setting. (See <a class="local">'Staff support'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3683530699"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges J Randall Curtis, MD, MPH (deceased), who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Sprung CL, Cohen SL, Sjokvist P, et al.
