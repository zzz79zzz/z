By extension, they were sometimes used to treat Graves' disease, but by the end of the century, they were considered to be a dangerous form of therapy. They returned to favor in the 1920s as preoperative treatment for hyperthyroidism and were used in the 1930s as the sole therapy for mild hyperthyroidism prior to the introduction of the thionamides. Today, iodine continues to have a minor role in the treatment of hyperthyroidism.</p><p>The role of iodine in the treatment of hyperthyroidism will be reviewed here. The treatment of hyperthyroidism in general is reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7872.html" rel="external">"Graves' hyperthyroidism in nonpregnant adults: Overview of treatment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7874.html" rel="external">"Beta blockers in the treatment of hyperthyroidism"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7876.html" rel="external">"Thionamides in the treatment of Graves' disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7879.html" rel="external">"Radioiodine in the treatment of hyperthyroidism"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Iodine has several effects on thyroid function.

This is the most acute effect of iodine on thyroid status, occurring within hours of the start of therapy.</p><p>A second effect involves inhibition of iodine organification in the thyroid gland, thereby diminishing thyroid hormone biosynthesis, a phenomenon called the Wolff-Chaikoff effect [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism are more sensitive to the inhibitory effect of pharmacologic doses of iodine than normal individuals. Thus, iodine is effective in some patients with Graves' disease because it:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acutely ameliorates hyperthyroidism by blocking thyroid hormone release</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis</p><p></p><p>The overall inhibitory effect of iodine on serum thyroid hormone concentrations is maximal after approximately 10 days of treatment. However, the inhibitory effect may be transient and is often followed by a return to high thyroid hormone concentrations, although the benefit may be more prolonged, especially in patients who have received radioiodine [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5852546"><span class="h1">ROLE OF IODINE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Iodine is primarily used in the short term (frequently for only one to two weeks but sometimes up to four to six weeks) for the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Preoperative preparation for thyroidectomy in Graves' disease</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Adjunctive therapy (one week after radioiodine or with thionamides) in Graves' disease</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Treatment of thyroid storm</p><p></p><p>We suggest against the routine use of long-term iodine therapy for the treatment of hyperthyroidism. However, long-term iodine may be of benefit in patients with mild disease, including those with thionamide intolerance and a contraindication or aversion to definitive treatment with initial or repeat radioiodine therapy or surgery. (See <a class="local">'Is there a role for long-term iodine therapy?'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3876867532"><span class="h2">Graves' disease</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4192231993"><span class="h3">Preoperative preparation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For preoperative preparation for thyroidectomy in Graves' disease, we suggest short-term iodine (potassium iodide-iodine or potassium iodide solutions) to decrease gland vascularity and surgical blood loss [<a href="#rid4">4-8</a>] and, in patients who are not euthyroid, to lower serum thyroid hormone concentrations.</p><p>In a prospective cohort study, the use of preoperative potassium iodide was associated with a lower incidence of transient hypoparathyroidism and hoarseness compared with those who were not given potassium iodine preoperatively [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Two small randomized trials showed a significant reduction in blood loss in iodine-treated patients (median estimated blood loss 50 versus 140 mL in the control group), but there were no reported differences in complications (eg, persistent hypocalcemia or permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve injury) [<a href="#rid5">5,7</a>]. Similarly, in a meta-analysis of predominantly observational studies (223 patients given preoperative iodine and 287 controls), the iodine-treated patients had reduced vascularity and reduced intraoperative blood loss, but no change in recurrent laryngeal nerve damage, hypoparathyroidism, or postoperative hematoma [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. It is typically given for up to 10 days. (See <a class="local">'Iodine preparations and dosing'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7880.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of hyperthyroidism", section on 'Preoperative preparation'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with Graves' disease in regions with iodine deficiency (or hyperthyroid patients with toxic adenoma or toxic nodular goiter), iodine administration may exacerbate hyperthyroidism because the iodine provides more substrate for new hormone synthesis. These patients should <strong>not</strong> be routinely treated with iodine to reduce gland vascularity preoperatively, and when iodine is used to help lower serum thyroid hormone concentrations, iodine should not be administered until one hour <strong>after</strong> a thionamide has been given to block thyroid hormone synthesis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2179916835"><span class="h3">Adjunctive therapy after radioiodine or with thionamides</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Potassium iodide may also be beneficial as adjunctive therapy one week after radioiodine (particularly in patients with thionamide intolerance) or with thionamides.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>After radioiodine</strong> – In selected patients with Graves' disease in whom more rapid normalization of thyroid function is essential but who are allergic to thionamides, saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI) given daily, beginning one week after radioiodine, normalizes thyroid function several weeks earlier than in patients given radioiodine alone [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].

However, long-term iodine may be of benefit in selected patients, including those with thionamide intolerance and a contraindication or aversion to definitive treatment with radioiodine or surgery. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) task force guidelines for management of hyperthyroidism indicate that there is insufficient evidence to assess benefits or risks for the use of long-term iodine treatment [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>The long-term use of iodine has been reported for the primary medical treatment of patients with Graves' disease (particularly those with thionamide intolerance) or after unsuccessful radioiodine therapy. It has also been used as the primary treatment of pregnant women with Graves' disease. However, the safety of using iodine for hyperthyroid pregnant women is controversial due to concerns that it might cause fetal goiter or hypothyroidism. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7884.html" rel="external">"Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy: Treatment", section on 'Is there a role for iodine as primary therapy for hyperthyroidism?'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Primary medical therapy</strong> – In Japan, the long-term use of potassium iodide has been reported in patients who had adverse reactions to thionamides. In one study of 44 patients, 66 percent were controlled for an average of 18 years (range 9 to 28 years) and 39 percent achieved remission [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. In another Japanese study comparing 20 patients with mild hyperthyroidism treated with potassium iodide and 20 treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9627" href="/d/drug information/9627.html" rel="external">methimazole</a>, a similar proportion of patients had normal thyroid function at one year (85 and 95 percent, respectively) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Most patients receiving potassium iodide were treated with 50 mg daily and had mild thyroid dysfunction at baseline.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Primary medical therapy during chemotherapy for cancer</strong> – Long-term potassium iodide therapy was also used successfully in five Japanese patients with mild Graves' disease who were receiving potentially neutropenic chemotherapy [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Potassium iodide was used rather than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9627" href="/d/drug information/9627.html" rel="external">methimazole</a> to avoid the possibility of methimazole-induced neutropenia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Medical therapy after unsuccessful radioiodine treatment</strong> – The inhibitory effects of iodine on thyroid hormone release and synthesis are greater in patients previously treated with radioiodine [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Thus, potassium iodide can be given months after radioiodine administration to ameliorate mild persistent hyperthyroidism and to delay or prevent the need for a second radioiodine dose.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Primary medical therapy during pregnancy</strong> – There are insufficient data to recommend routine iodine for the primary treatment of pregnant women with Graves' disease. Older reports suggested that prolonged, high-dose iodine therapy can cause fetal goiter [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. However, limited data suggest that low-dose potassium iodide is safe during pregnancy and therefore may have a potential role for the treatment of pregnant women with mild hyperthyroidism who require therapy but are intolerant of thionamides. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7884.html" rel="external">"Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy: Treatment", section on 'Is there a role for iodine as primary therapy for hyperthyroidism?'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Because of the known teratogenicity of antithyroid drugs, a preliminary study from Japan compared 1333 hyperthyroid women with Graves' disease who continued antithyroid drugs during pregnancy with 283 who switched to potassium iodine [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. The incidence of congenital anomalies was lower in the group that switched to iodine (1.5 versus 4.1 percent, respectively), none of the neonates had thyroid dysfunction at birth, and live births were more common in the iodine group (92 versus 85 percent). However, maternal hyperthyroidism was less well controlled.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In another study from Japan, only 1 of 35 neonates exposed to iodine during pregnancy had subclinical hypothyroidism at birth [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2215996299"><span class="h2">Thyroid storm</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The therapeutic regimen for patients with severe hyperthyroidism or thyroid storm typically consists of multiple medications, each of which has a different mechanism of action.

We typically use saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI, 50 mg iodide per drop [0.05 mL], 1 to 2 drops three times daily [approximately 300 mg daily]) for up to 10 days before surgery. (See <a class="local">'Preoperative preparation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Thyroid storm</strong> – Iodine-containing solutions are routinely used for the treatment of thyroid storm since iodine blocks the release of T4 and T3 from the gland within hours. For patients with thyroid storm or severe thyrotoxicosis, we administer iodine one hour <strong>after</strong> the first dose of thionamide is taken to prevent the iodine from being used as substrate for new hormone synthesis. (See <a class="local">'Thyroid storm'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7885.html" rel="external">"Thyroid storm"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Adjunctive therapy with radioiodine or thionamides</strong> – Iodine-containing solutions may also be beneficial as adjunctive therapy one week after radioiodine, particularly in patients with thionamide allergies, or with thionamides. (See <a class="local">'Adjunctive therapy after radioiodine or with thionamides'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Long-term iodine therapy</strong> – We suggest against the routine use of long-term iodine therapy for the treatment of hyperthyroidism (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). However, long-term iodine may be of benefit in patients with mild disease, including those with thionamide intolerance and a contraindication or aversion to definitive treatment with radioiodine or surgery. (See <a class="local">'Is there a role for long-term iodine therapy?'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Available preparations and dosing</strong> – Iodine-containing agents include Lugol's solution, potassium iodide (KI) tablets, and SSKI. Dosing varies with the indication.
