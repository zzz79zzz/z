It is the final step in liberating a patient from mechanical ventilation.</p><p>Assessing the safety of extubation, the technique of extubation, and postextubation management are described in this topic. Extubation following anesthesia, and methods of weaning from mechanical ventilation are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94224.html" rel="external">"Extubation following anesthesia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94537.html" rel="external">"Emergence from general anesthesia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1652.html" rel="external">"Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1650.html" rel="external">"Initial weaning strategy in mechanically ventilated adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">ASSESSING SAFETY OF EXTUBATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Extubation should not be performed until it has been determined that the patient's medical condition is stable, a weaning trial has been successful, the airway is patent, and any potential difficulties in reintubation have been identified. Most patients are extubated during daytime hours, although nocturnal extubation is appropriate in select circumstances.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H981740378"><span class="h2">Stable medical condition</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients cannot be extubated unless the condition for intubation is improved and the clinical criteria for weaning have been met (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62377" href="/z/d/graphic/62377.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Readiness for weaning is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1652.html" rel="external">"Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H498853455"><span class="h2">Successful weaning trial</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In general, most patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) should not be extubated unless a successful weaning trial has been passed. Exceptions include postoperative patients who are recovered for short periods in the ICU (eg, 24 hours) and patients undergoing terminal extubation. One study showed a decrease rate of reintubation at 48 hours when patients were rested back on the ventilator for an hour before extubation after the completion of a spontaneous breathing trial. This observation awaits further confirmation [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Further details on weaning including terminal weaning and weaning of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16295.html" rel="external">"Withholding and withdrawing ventilatory support in adults in the intensive care unit", section on 'Withdrawal of ventilatory support'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1652.html" rel="external">"Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1650.html" rel="external">"Initial weaning strategy in mechanically ventilated adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1638.html" rel="external">"Management and prognosis of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation", section on 'Weaning'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1652.html" rel="external">"Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing", section on 'Rapid shallow breathing index'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Assess airway protection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Airway protection is the ability to guard against aspiration during spontaneous breathing. It requires sufficient cough strength and an adequate level of consciousness, each of which should be assessed prior to extubation. The amount of secretions should also be considered prior to extubation because airway protection is significantly more difficult when secretions are increased or difficult to expectorate (eg, dry or thick).</p><p>Universally accepted threshold levels of cough strength, level of consciousness, and suctioning frequency that prohibit extubation have not been established. For many patients, it is reasonable to delay extubation if the cough strength is weak, the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) is &lt;8 (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81854" href="/z/d/graphic/81854.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), or suctioning is required more frequently than every two to three hours. However, the final decision to delay or proceed with extubation should be made on a case-by-case basis since delayed extubation is associated with adverse outcomes, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and increased length of stay [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Extubation failure is highest when a combination of risk factors affecting airway patency is present. As an example, in one study when reduced cough peak expiratory flow rate (PEF ≤60 L/minute), increased sputum volume (&gt;2.5 mL/hour), and impaired neurologic function (inability to follow commands) were present, the incidence of extubation failure was 100 percent, compared with 3 percent when none of the risk factors were present (relative risk [RR] 23, 95% CI 3.2-167) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23549634"><span class="h3">Cough strength and secretion clearance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ability of the patient to cough and clear their own secretions following extubation should be assessed prior to extubation.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Secretions</strong> – Although the volume of secretions can be measured at the bedside (via the suction canister), most clinicians assess secretion clearance by the frequency of suctioning. In general, those who require suctioning more than every two to three hours should not be extubated. The nature of secretions (eg, thick or thin) can also be examined bedside but thick secretions on their own is not a contraindication to extubation unless the cough is borderline or weak.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cough</strong> – In most patients, cough strength is assessed informally during deep (endotracheal) suctioning at the bedside with or without gag reflex evaluation. However, a formal assessment may be useful in patients noted to have a weak cough on endotracheal suctioning or patients with neuromuscular disorders (eg, Parkinson disease, critical care myopathy). Several tests are available:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Spirometry – A spirometer (specifically designed for mechanical ventilators) is inserted into the ventilator circuit and the patient is then instructed to cough. The PEF during the cough is measured. Most experts use a cutoff of PEF ≤60 L/minute since this indicates a high likelihood of failure. Patients with a PEF ≤60 L/minute are five times more likely to require reintubation than patients with a PEF &gt;60 L/minute [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Index card – The endotracheal tube (ETT) is detached from the ventilator circuit and a card (eg, an index card) is held approximately 1 to 2 cm from the proximal end of the ETT. The patient is then instructed to cough. A patient who is unable to moisten the card with 3 to 4 coughs is three times more likely to fail extubation than a patient who can moisten the card [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p>The importance of cough strength and the amount of secretions was illustrated by several observational studies reporting that successful extubation directly correlated with strength of the spontaneous cough and inversely correlated with the frequency of suctioning [<a href="#rid2">2,3,6-8</a>]. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An observational study of 130 patients who had passed a spontaneous breathing trial demonstrated that extubation failure was more likely among patients who were unable to cough on command or who had a PEF rate during a cough of &lt;35 L/minute (24 versus 3.5 percent, RR 6.9, 95% CI 2.0-24) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Another observational study enrolled 88 patients who had passed a spontaneous breathing trial [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Patients were more likely to fail extubation if their PEF during a cough was ≤60 L/minute (RR 4.8, 95% CI 1.4-16.2) or their secretions were &gt;2.5 mL/hour (RR 3.0, 95% CI 1.0-8.8).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A prospective observational study examined predictors of extubation failure in 225 patients who were mechanically ventilated for more than 24 hours. Ineffective cough was the strongest predictor of extubation failure and requirement for reintubation within one week (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 5.03, 95% CI 1.80-14.1) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Additional risk factors included abundant secretions (OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.21-9.13) and duration of mechanical ventilation greater than seven days (OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.11-7.41). This study was limited by the use of semi-objective measures of cough strength and secretion volume.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23549646"><span class="h3">Mental state</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ideally, patients are extubated awake, alert, following commands, and preferably off sedatives. However, this is not always feasible and a small proportion of patients who are cooperative and arousable upon stimulation or receiving minimal sedation (eg, patients with resolving delirium on stable low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8897" href="/z/d/drug information/8897.html" rel="external">dexmedetomidine</a> who are arousable) may be extubated with vigilant monitoring of the airway and mental status and prompt weaning of sedatives, once extubated.</p><p>The importance of level of consciousness has been demonstrated in observational studies:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a study of 100 neurosurgical patients, patients with a GCS ≥8 (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81854" href="/z/d/graphic/81854.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) were significantly more likely to undergo successful extubation than patients with a GCS &lt;8 (75 versus 37 percent) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In another observational study of 88 patients, the inability to complete four commands (open eyes, follow object with eyes, grasp hand, stick out tongue) was associated with an increased risk of extubation failure (RR 4.3, 95% CI 1.8-10.4) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p>The potential benefit of daily interruption of sedation in mechanically ventilated patients is discussed separately.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Assess risk for postextubation stridor</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prior to extubation, all patients should be assessed for the risk of postextubation stridor. Postextubation stridor occurs in less than 10 percent of critically ill patients and is associated with increased rates of reintubation, prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, and longer length of ICU stay [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Most cases are due to vocal cord edema related to the ETT; others include laryngeal injury, secretions, vocal cord dysfunction, and rarely tracheal stenosis or lesions. In those considered at high risk of postextubation stridor (see <a class="local">'Risk factors'</a> below), most experts use the cuff leak test to facilitate the decision to extubate. The cuff leak test is not performed in unselected patients since it has been demonstrated to be neither sensitive nor specific in this setting. Unfortunately, despite assessment, many cases may not be detectable until after extubation when patients present with postextubation stridor that may require reintubation. (See <a class="local">'Patients who fail due to postextubation stridor'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1342818796"><span class="h3">Risk factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Risk factors for postextubation stridor include [<a href="#rid11">11-18</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prolonged intubation (variably defined as ≥36 hours to ≥6 days)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Age greater than 80 years</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A large ETT (&gt;8 mm in men, &gt;7 mm in women)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A ratio of ETT to laryngeal diameter greater than 45 percent on computed tomography</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A small ratio of patient height (in mm) to ETT diameter (in mm)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An elevated acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A GCS score &lt;8 (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81854" href="/z/d/graphic/81854.html" rel="external">table 2</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Traumatic intubation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Female gender</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A history of asthma</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Excessive tube mobility due to insufficient fixation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Insufficient or lack of sedation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Aspiration</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1875807941"><span class="h3">Patients not at risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who have no risk factors for postextubation stridor should be extubated in the same manner as other patients and no assessment of the cuff leak test is necessary.

The absence of a leak suggests there is reduced space between the ETT and the larynx. This may be due to laryngeal edema, laryngeal injury, secretions, stenosis, or a large ETT within a relatively small larynx. Patients <strong>without</strong> a cuff leak are at increased risk for postextubation stridor.</p><p>The cuff leak can be detected qualitatively or quantitatively:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Qualitative assessment is performed by deflating the cuff and then listening for air movement around the ETT using a stethoscope placed over the upper trachea. Air movement indicates that a cuff leak is present while no air movement suggests that it is absent and may indicate laryngeal obstruction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Quantitative assessment is performed by deflating the ETT cuff and measuring the difference between the inspired and expired tidal volumes of ventilator-delivered breaths during <strong>volume</strong>-cycled mechanical ventilation. The lowest three expired tidal volumes obtained over six breaths are averaged and then subtracted from the inspired tidal volume to give the cuff leak volume [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Although ill-defined, we and other experts consider cuff leak volumes less than 110 mL or less than 12 to 24 percent of the delivered tidal volume as thresholds for determining diminished airway patency and risk for postextubation stridor from laryngeal edema (ie, "reduced" or "absent" cuff leak) [<a href="#rid12">12,14,19-22</a>]. Cuff leak volumes greater than or equal to 110 mL or greater than 24 percent of the delivered tidal volume is considered a normal cuff leak test.</p><p></p><p>The decision with how to proceed based upon the results of the cuff leak test is challenging. In general, for patients with risk factors for postextubation stridor, we use the following guidelines:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients with a sufficient cuff leak (eg, sufficient air movement around the ETT or greater than or equal to 110 mL or greater than 24 percent of the delivered tidal volume), we proceed with extubation. (See <a class="local">'Extubation equipment and technique'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients with an absent or reduced cuff leak, we delay extubation and treat with glucocorticoids (for presumed laryngeal edema) for at least six to eight hours before re-assessing with another cuff leak test and/or extubation. (See <a class="local">'Risk factors'</a> above and <a class="local">'Glucocorticoids'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>In the event that a cuff leak test is inadvertently performed in a patient <strong>without</strong> risk factors for postextubation stridor and in whom the leak is absent or reduced, glucocorticoid administration before extubation should be considered on an individual basis. If extubated, the threshold for reintubation should be low.</p><p>The absence of a cuff leak alone is an imperfect predictor of postextubation stridor with a reported sensitivity of 15 to 85 percent and a specificity of 70 to 99 percent [<a href="#rid10">10,12,13,19-21,23-26</a>]. The wide ranges likely reflect variability in the patient populations, how the cuff leak was measured, and what was considered an acceptable cuff leak. Best illustrating the poor sensitivity of the cuff leak test is a pooled analysis of nine studies that found a sensitivity and specificity of 56 and 92 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. A meta-analysis of 14 observational studies estimated that when used in select populations, the cuff leak test resulted in reduced rates of reintubation (2.4 versus 4.2 percent) and postextubation stridor (4 versus 7 percent) but at the expense of delayed extubation (9 percent absolute increase) [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. In addition, certain conditions such as tracheomalacia may affect the utility of the test since it may increase the likelihood of a cuff leak.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H965316784"><span class="h4">Other tests</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several other methods for evaluating the risk of postextubation stridor have been proposed but are not well-validated:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Laryngeal ultrasonography is a simple, rapid, and noninvasive way to evaluate the width of the laryngeal air column during cuff deflation, thereby assessing the likelihood of postextubation stridor [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>]. Although promising, this modality is not recommended for routine use until controlled clinical trials are performed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Simultaneous assessment of both cough and cuff leak may improve prediction of postextubation stridor. After the cuff is deflated, the ETT is occluded and the patient is instructed to cough. The absence of both an audible cough and a cuff leak indicates the patient is 10 times more likely to develop postextubation stridor [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h4">Glucocorticoids</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We and others limit glucocorticoid therapy to patients who are assessed to be at high risk of postextubation stridor and who have a reduced or absent cuff leak [<a href="#rid27">27,30,31</a>] (see <a class="local">'Assess risk for postextubation stridor'</a> above) and to patients who have failed extubation due to postextubation stridor. Since the overall incidence of postextubation laryngeal edema requiring reintubation is low (less than 5 percent), we believe this approach focuses therapy on those who are most likely to benefit and avoids unnecessarily prolonging mechanical ventilation for glucocorticoid therapy.

The syringe is attached to the cuff. Instructions are then given to the patient to take a deep breath and then exhale or cough. During exhalation/coughing, the cuff is quickly deflated and the ETT is removed in a single, smooth motion. The patient typically coughs during removal and residual oral secretions are suctioned again to avoid aspiration. Alternatively, many experts deflate the cuff with the inline suction catheter in place and then remove the ETT during exhalation or coughing while simultaneously suctioning residual secretions during ETT removal. Orogastric tubes are typically removed simultaneously, although some remain in place if a vital indication is present.

Choosing among low-flow devices or HFNC should be individualized and depend upon factors including oxygen requirement, the etiology of respiratory failure, and patient preferences. For example, in patients with minimal oxygen requirements, low-flow devices often suffice, while patients with higher oxygen requirements (eg, patients with interstitial lung disease or pulmonary hypertension) may be suitable for HFNC. HFNC, in addition to improved oxygenation, may also provide a small amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and be better tolerated when compared with oxygen delivered through low or high-flow facemasks [<a href="#rid46">46,47</a>].

Although encouraging, this trial does not support the routine use of HFNC following extubation and further trials in select populations are needed. In contrast, a randomized trial of 220 patients who were extubated to either HFNC or standard low-flow oxygen following major abdominal surgery (not risk stratified) reported no difference in the rate of hypoxemic respiratory failure or other pulmonary outcomes; mortality was not reported [<a href="#rid49">49</a>].</p><p>HFNC is not routinely available in all institutions for adult use and it should only be administered by staff educated in its application.

Consequently, practice varies significantly with much of this decision at the discretion of the treating physician/respiratory therapist. We believe the choice between observation, and NIV and/or HFNC should be individualized and depends upon factors including the assessed degree of risk and type of respiratory failure (eg, hypoxic, hypercapnic), and oxygen and positive end expiratory pressure requirements of the patient, as well as local availability of and expertise in HFNC and NIV. In our practice, most patients at risk of postextubation respiratory failure undergo a brief period of observation with close monitoring, while a select few who are considered to be at the highest risk of failure may be extubated directly to NIV and/or HFNC (eg, patients who have already failed extubation previously, patients with neuromuscular disorders with a very weak cough who have declined tracheostomy, patients with a high oxygen requirement, and patients with hypercapnic COPD or heart failure).

NIV was administered (8 cm [inspiratory pressure] and 5 cm [expiratory pressure]) for at least 12 hours per day for 48 hours (mean total duration was 22 hours and mostly delivered at night during sleep) alternating with HFNC at 50 L/minute in between NIV sessions (mean total duration 42 hours). Post-hoc subgroup analysis suggested that patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure (at the end of their spontaneous breathing trial) are most likely to benefit (reintubation rates 8 versus 21 percent). In addition, 28-day mortality was lower in hypercapnic patients who had received NIV prior to developing postextubation respiratory failure than those who had received HFNC (3 versus 31 percent, p = 0.006), although the absolute numbers were small [<a href="#rid72">72</a>]. The benefit to the alternating strategy of NIV with HFNC, including reintubation and ICU mortality, was limited to patients who were obese or overweight (BMI &gt;25) [<a href="#rid73">73</a>]. Limitations of this analysis include the lack of blinding, use of HFNC as a comparator, use of NIV as a rescue therapy in one-third of patients in the HFNC group, and the considerable experience of the participating ICUs in NIV use, which may reduce generalizability of the NIV/HFNC combination. We continue to suggest an individualized approach to selecting postextubation support for patients at high risk of postextubation failure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1114331068"><span class="h2">Patients with established postextubation respiratory failure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Up to 14 percent of patients who undergo planned extubation require reintubation, mostly within the first 24 hours. Similarly, over half of patients who undergo unplanned extubation require immediate reintubation. (See <a class="local">'At-risk patients'</a> above and <a class="local">'Patients with unplanned extubation'</a> below.)</p><p>Postextubation respiratory failure typically manifests as falling peripheral oxygen saturation, increasing respiratory rate, respiratory distress, and sometimes stridor. The most common etiologies are atelectasis from poor secretion clearance, heart failure, aspiration, bronchospasm, and laryngeal edema. The clinician should re-examine the patient for potential etiologies and, provided immediate re-intubation is not needed, in most cases an arterial blood gas (ABG) and chest radiograph are performed to help elucidate the nature and severity of respiratory failure and shed some light on the etiology.</p><p>As soon as it is suspected that a patient may be failing extubation, therapies targeted at the suspected etiology of respiratory failure and a simultaneous trial of HFNC or NIV should be immediately implemented rather than waiting for overt respiratory failure to occur on low-flow oxygen. The European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society suggest not using NIV once respiratory failure has already developed in the postextubation setting [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]. However, they acknowledge that the data are flawed and that more studies are required. Furthermore, the American College of Physicians made a recommendation that HFNC rather than low-flow oxygen be used in patients with postextubation respiratory failure [<a href="#rid74">74</a>] but did not extend their recommendation to facilitate the choice between HFNC and NIV. The principles that influence the choice between NIV and HFNC are discussed above. (See <a class="local">'Patients at high risk of postextubation respiratory failure'</a> above.)</p><p>Data regarding the role of NIV and HFNC in treating established postextubation respiratory failure are discussed in this section.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>NIV</strong> – Most experts individualize NIV application in this setting since the role of NIV is unclear in patients with postextubation respiratory failure. While anecdotal evidence suggests that NIV may avoid intubation in some cases, available data suggest that NIV may be less effective and even potentially harmful when its application is delayed [<a href="#rid75">75-77</a>]. Thus, in this population, if NIV is administered, it should be started as soon as extubation failure is suspected and trials should be short (eg, one to two hours); if benefit is not demonstrated, the threshold to re-intubate should be low.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Questionable benefit of NIV in this population was illustrated by a trial of 221 patients who developed respiratory failure after extubation and then were randomly assigned to receive conventional medical therapy with or without NIV [<a href="#rid75">75</a>]. Respiratory failure was defined as two or more of the following: respiratory acidosis (pH &lt;7.35 with a PaCO<sub>2</sub> &gt;45 mmHg), clinical signs of respiratory fatigue (ie, use of accessory muscles, intercostal retractions, paradoxical motion of the abdomen), a respiratory rate &gt;25 breaths/minute for two consecutive hours, or hypoxemia (arterial oxygen tension &lt;80 mmHg or arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation &lt;90 percent despite a fraction of inspired oxygen &gt;50 percent). All-cause mortality increased in the NIV group (25 versus 14 percent), resulting in early termination of the trial. However, the increased mortality seen in this trial may have been related to delayed reintubation since the median time from respiratory failure to reintubation was longer in the NIV group (12 versus 2.5 hours). In another meta-analysis of three trials that compared NIV with HFNC, both modalities had similar impact on mortality and reintubation rate, although a small increase in these outcomes among those treated with HFNC could not be excluded [<a href="#rid77">77</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>HFNC</strong> – Data are limited to support the use of HFNC in this population. In one meta-analysis of three studies of a mixed population of patients with acute postextubation respiratory failure (eg, medical and surgical patients, COPD), HFNC had little or no impact mortality or intubation rates compared with NIV [<a href="#rid77">77</a>]. When compared with low-flow oxygen, HFNC reduced reintubation rate (odds ratio [OR] 0.60, 95% CI 0.23-1.61) and improved patient comfort. However, this analysis was limited by heterogeneity, risk of bias, and imprecision. These limited data have led the American College of Physicians to make a recommendation that HFNC rather than low-flow oxygen be used in patients with postextubation respiratory failure [<a href="#rid74">74</a>]. Trials that discuss the role of HFNC in postoperative respiratory failure (that sometimes includes postextubation respiratory failure) are discussed in detail separately.

During reintubation a careful inspection of the vocal cords (edema erosions, abnormal movement or masses) and upper airway (masses, secretions) are prudent. Measures should be taken to continue treatment before a second attempt is made to extubate (often one to two days or longer). Patents who fail extubation on more than one occasion generally require a tracheostomy, although exceptions exist when a clear cause for failure is identified and easily reversed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4389.html" rel="external">"Tracheostomy: Rationale, indications, and contraindications"</a>.)</p><p>The impact of reintubation may depend upon the patient population. In medical ICU patients, reintubation is associated with increased hospital mortality, a longer ICU stay, longer hospitalization, and nosocomial pneumonia [<a href="#rid54">54,78,79</a>]. Mortality is highest among those who fail extubation late (&gt;12 hours after extubation) or who require reintubation for reasons unrelated to the airway (ie, respiratory failure, heart failure, or encephalopathy) [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. Similarly, in most surgical patients, respiratory failure requiring reintubation in the postoperative period is associated with high morbidity, leading to a longer hospital stay, and increase in 30-day mortality [<a href="#rid80">80-82</a>]. In contrast, reintubation in cardiac surgery patients has not been shown to be associated with increased mortality [<a href="#rid83">83,84</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1173770234"><span class="h2">Special populations</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Patients with unplanned extubation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Unplanned extubation occurs in 3 to 12 percent of intubated patients [<a href="#rid52">52,85-93</a>].

Thus, the point at which patients can eat following extubation should be individualized and depends upon factors including duration of intubation, mental status, and underlying comorbidities (eg, neuromuscular disorders, critical care myopathy, poor level of consciousness) which may predispose patients to dysphagia and aspiration.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>As a general rule, patients intubated for short periods (eg, less than one week) can generally eat within a few hours after extubation; swallowing is initially typically observed with small amounts of ice chips or water and if tolerated, a solid diet is slowly introduced over the ensuing few days.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>However, many clinicians do not allow patients who have been intubated for a prolonged duration (eg, two weeks or longer) to eat for approximately 12 to 24 hours following extubation.

Most patients are in this category and can be discharged from the ICU after 12 to 24 hours, provided no other indications for ICU care are present.

We believe the choice between observation and NIV and/or HFNC should be individualized and depend upon factors including the degree of risk and type of respiratory failure (eg, hypoxic, hypercapnic), oxygen and positive end expiratory pressure requirements of the patient, and local availability of and expertise in HFNC and NIV.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>We extubate directly to HFNC or NIV (for roughly 6 to 24 hours) in a select group of patients who are assessed as having the highest risk.
