This is a question that clinicians involved in patient care and also those researching asthma would like to be able to answer. Preschool wheezing, a symptom that can herald the subsequent development of childhood asthma, is a common problem worldwide [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. However, the condition improves and ultimately disappears by school years in many children. Proper identification of infants and young children at increased risk to develop persistent asthma may help predict long-term outcomes and improve prevention and treatment, but the ability to identify these children remains limited.</p><p>Several classifications of wheezing phenotypes and other tools have been developed in an effort to categorize children with recurrent wheezing and determine which will ultimately develop asthma. These wheezing phenotypes and predictive tools are reviewed in this topic. The definition and diagnosis of asthma in children; asthma risk factors, genetics, and natural history; bronchiolitis and virus-induced wheezing; and other causes of wheezing in children are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5742.html" rel="external">"Asthma in children younger than 12 years: Initial evaluation and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/572.html" rel="external">"Risk factors for asthma"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/561.html" rel="external">"Genetics of asthma"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/567.html" rel="external">"Natural history of asthma"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6018.html" rel="external">"Bronchiolitis in infants and children: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/535.html" rel="external">"Role of viruses in wheezing and asthma: An overview"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/546.html" rel="external">"Treatment of recurrent virus-induced wheezing in young children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5752.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of wheezing in infants and children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23915804"><span class="h1">WHEEZING PHENOTYPES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4151833292"><span class="h2">Overview of wheezing phenotypes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Almost 50 percent of children are reported to have wheezing in the first year of life, although only 20 percent will experience continued wheezing symptoms in later childhood [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Wheezing phenotypes have been defined to identify the characteristics and risk factors associated with children that experience wheezing [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Some of these phenotypes describe children who continue to wheeze until later childhood, while others identify those who continue to wheeze through adolescence and adulthood. However, the relationship between risk factors and the subsequent development of asthma in later childhood and adult life is not clear.</p><p>Many of these early-childhood wheezing phenotypes were determined retrospectively in longitudinal studies. However, it can be difficult to clinically distinguish among these phenotypes during the preschool years because of the variation in expression of both symptoms and risk factors over time. In addition, the application of these phenotypes to diverse populations is not established, and it is not clear which are the most effective therapies for a particular wheezing phenotype or whether early intervention can alter the course and outcome over time.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1059571"><span class="h2">Epidemiologic phenotypes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several epidemiologic phenotypes based upon wheezing history have been developed. There is some variability in age cutoffs differentiating among transient, persistent, and late-onset wheezing and inconsistencies in which risk factors are associated with each phenotype. There are also concerns about the prospective validity of these phenotypes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H797255817"><span class="h3">Tucson classification</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study (TCRS), four different wheezing phenotypes were identified among 1246 newborns followed for lower respiratory tract infections based upon the presence of wheezing symptoms during the first three years of life and again at six years [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The epidemiologic phenotypes generated from this prospective longitudinal study included:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Never wheezers (51 percent) – Healthy children who never wheezed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Early, transient wheezers (20 percent) – Children with wheezing that began before three years of age and resolved by six years of age.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Persistent wheezers (14 percent) – Children with wheezing that began before three years of age and was still present at six years of age.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Late-onset wheezers (15 percent) – Children who developed wheezing between three and six years of age.</p><p></p><p>Children in the persistent wheezing and late-onset wheezing groups are at increased risk for persistent asthma-like symptoms into adolescence and adulthood.</p><p>A report from the Italian Studies of Respiratory Disorders in Childhood and the Environment (SIDRIA) found a different frequency of the above phenotypes [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The classification was the same as the Tucson classification with the exception that the cutoff for distinguishing between transient, early wheezing and persistent wheezing was two, not three, years of age. Of the 16,333 children aged six to seven years in this population-based cohort, 83 percent had never wheezed; 7 percent had transient, early wheezing; 4 percent had persistent wheezing; and 6 percent had late-onset wheezing.</p><p>Subsequent prospective studies of the Tucson cohort led to revised definitions of the three groups of wheezers [<a href="#rid5">5-7</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Transient wheeze in infancy – Begins in infancy (the first year of life) and resolves by the preschool years; associated with decreased lung function, narrower intrapulmonary airways, maternal tobacco use during pregnancy, having siblings, and daycare attendance.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nonatopic persistent wheezing phenotype – Begins in infancy and resolves in mid-childhood; associated with lack of both allergic sensitization and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="126558" href="/d/drug information/126558.html" rel="external">methacholine</a> hyperresponsiveness.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Immunoglobulin E (IgE) associated/atopic, persistent wheezing phenotype – Can begin in infancy but increases in prevalence with age; associated with personal and family history of atopy, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="126558" href="/d/drug information/126558.html" rel="external">methacholine</a> hyperresponsiveness, and poor growth of lung function. This phenotype may represent a classic allergic asthma phenotype, but it is unknown if children with this phenotype will have symptoms that persist into adulthood.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H797255831"><span class="h3">Avon classification</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a prospective, longitudinal study of a population-based cohort in the United Kingdom, looked at maternal reports of child wheezing between birth and six months and again between 30 and 42 months in 8594 children [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Early infant wheeze was defined as those who wheezed during the first six months, late-onset wheeze as those who wheezed between 30 to 42 months but not early infancy, and persistent wheeze as those who wheezed during both periods. A parental history of asthma (particularly maternal) and a personal history of atopic disease were predictive of wheezing in all three groups. Wheezing only during early infancy was associated with other factors, such as maternal smoking during pregnancy and the presence of older siblings, whereas persistent wheezing was associated with preterm delivery and lower socioeconomic status.</p><p>The wheezing phenotypes from the Avon study were further refined with continued longitudinal follow-up [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Data were collected at more time points and over shorter intervals than the Tucson study. Incorporation of objective measures (eg, lung function and allergen sensitization) and use of more sophisticated statistical methods led to the inclusion of two additional phenotypes to the Tucson classification (prolonged, early wheeze and intermediate-onset wheeze):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Never/infrequent wheeze (59 percent)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Transient, early wheeze (16 percent) – Wheezing common from 6 to 18 months but rare to never after 42 months</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prolonged, early wheeze (9 percent) – Wheezing common from 6 to 54 months but rare to never after 69 months</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intermediate-onset wheeze (3 percent) – Wheezing rare to never from 6 to 18 months but common thereafter</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Late-onset wheeze (6 percent) – Infrequent wheezing from 6 to 42 months but common thereafter</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Persistent wheeze (7 percent) – Wheezing common from six months onward</p><p></p><p>Similar wheezing phenotypes were identified in the Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy (PIAMA) birth cohort [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. These phenotypes were also analyzed from early childhood into adolescence by pooling data of 7719 participants from five birth cohorts [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Compared with the never/infrequent wheeze, the other phenotypes had higher odds of asthma and lower lung function in adolescence. The persistent wheezing and late-onset wheezing groups exhibited the highest prevalence of current asthma in adolescence (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 48.31 and 36.39, respectively) and use of asthma medications (adjusted OR 42.45 and 24.51, respectively). Considerable within-class heterogeneity was noted at the individual level, particularly in the late-onset wheeze group and early-onset, preschool-remitting wheeze groups.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3336247837"><span class="h3">Multizentrische Allergiestudie (MAS) and Protection against Allergy: Study in Rural Environments (PASTURE)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>This study identified benign, symptomatic, and severe atopy phenotypes using latent class analyses of two cohorts of healthy German infants and rural European children followed during the first six years of life [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Although the severe atopy phenotype was found in only 5 percent of children in these cohorts, it was associated with an asthma rate of 20 percent. A pronounced increase in seasonal aeroallergen sensitization was observed before three to four years of age, followed by the development of high serum IgE levels and then the onset of asthma symptoms. Higher serum IgE production was linked to impaired lung function and increased asthma risk in later life.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3670038365"><span class="h3">Mechanisms of the Development of ALLergy (MeDALL)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The MeDALL database collects data from over 44,000 participants from 14 European cohorts [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. It found that polysensitization, but not monosensitization, to aeroallergens was linked to asthma symptom onset in early life and the presence of other allergic comorbid diseases (eg, rhinitis, eczema). Children with the polysensitization phenotype also had more persistent symptoms, more severe asthma, and increased total and specific IgE levels. The researchers were unable to develop a predictive algorithm for asthma risk in young children, postulating that viral infections may have confounded the predictive value of preschool asthma-like symptoms.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2915193947"><span class="h3">Canadian Asthma Primary Prevention Study (CAPPS)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CAPPS identified three wheezing phenotypes (low progressive, early transient, and early persistent) in a cohort of 545 infants followed from birth to 15 years of age who were considered high risk for asthma due to first-degree relatives with allergic disease and who underwent a primary prevention intervention [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The low, progressive group had low rates of wheeze in early life, but the wheezing frequency increased to 16 percent by age 15 years. The early-life intervention was avoidance of house dust mites, pet allergens, and environmental tobacco smoke exposure, as well as promotion of breastfeeding and use of a partially hydrolyzed formula if supplementing. These interventions were found to decrease the risk of persistent wheezing during school age only in the early, persistent wheeze phenotype. Risk factors associated with the early, persistent phenotype included wheezing during the second, but not first, year of life; male sex; and maternal asthma. Those in the early, transient or early, persistent groups were more likely to have allergic sensitization at 12 months than those in the low, progressive group.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2849812684"><span class="h3">Urban Environment and Childhood Asthma (URECA)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Five wheezing phenotypes (low wheeze/low atopy, low wheeze/high atopy, transient wheeze/low atopy, high wheeze/low atopy, high wheeze/high atopy) were identified in a high-risk, urban cohort of 442 children followed between birth and seven years of age using latent class mixed models [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Early-life environmental exposures were found to differentiate these phenotypes. The high-wheeze/high-atopy and high-wheeze/low-atopy phenotype groups were associated with decreased indoor allergen exposure and an increased frequency of asthma by age seven years. The high-wheeze/high-atopy group also demonstrated increased disease burden. Prenatal smoke exposure and maternal stress and depression were associated with the high-wheeze/low-atopy group. The high-wheeze/high-atopy phenotype was associated with low household dust microbial diversity. Early-life environmental exposures may modify risk for wheezing phenotypes.</p><p>The wheezing phenotypes from the URECA cohort were updated to include repeated measures of wheeze, allergen-specific IgE, and lung function data from birth until 10 years of age [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. These were linked to early-life exposures and nasal epithelial gene expression at age 11 years. Six wheezing phenotypes were identified, three of which demonstrated little or no atopy and differed by patterns of wheeze, and three that were defined by significant atopy, different patterns of wheezing, and lung function:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Low wheeze/low atopy (22 percent) – Minimal wheeze</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Transient wheeze/low atopy (17 percent) – Wheezing during early life that generally had resolved by three to four years of age</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Moderate wheeze/low atopy (12 percent) – High rates of wheezing during infancy that steadily diminished through age 10 years</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Low wheeze/high atopy (19 percent) – High rates of allergic sensitization, little or no wheezing</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Moderate wheeze/high atopy (17 percent) – High rates of allergic sensitization, wheezing during infancy that steadily diminished with time</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>High wheeze/high atopy/low lung function (13 percent) – High rates of allergic sensitization, high rates of wheezing that persisted through age 10 years, and evidence of airway obstruction</p><p></p><p>The high wheeze/high atopy/low lung function group had the most respiratory morbidity. Children with this phenotype had low exposure to common allergens and elevated exposure to ergosterol in house dust. All high atopy groups demonstrated increased expression of a type-2 inflammation gene module in nasal epithelial samples. However, epithelium interleukin (IL) 13 response was linked with impaired lung function, and the high wheeze/high atopy/low lung function group was associated with mucin 5AC, oligomeric mucus/gel forming (MUC5AC) hypersecretion. Conversely, altered expression of modules of epithelial integrity, epithelial injury, and antioxidant pathways were associated with the medium wheeze/low atopy group.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1059585"><span class="h2">Symptom-based phenotypes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Epidemiologic phenotypes are limited by their retrospectively defined patterns of duration of wheeze. This limitation led to the proposal of phenotypes based upon temporal patterns of wheeze that can be applied prospectively and may therefore be more useful when making treatment decisions.</p><p>The European Respiratory Society defined two symptom-based phenotypes [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Episodic (viral) wheeze – Wheezing during discrete time periods, with absence of wheeze between episodes; usually associated with viral respiratory tract infections</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Multi-trigger wheeze – Wheezing both during discrete exacerbations and between episodes; triggers include viruses, allergens, exercise, and cigarette smoke</p><p></p><p>Airway function, particularly conductive airways ventilation inhomogeneity, was lower in multiple trigger than episodic wheeze, suggesting that these are functionally different phenotypes [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. However, in one study, over half of children classified into these two phenotypes based upon their wheezing history in the previous year switched to the other phenotype in the ensuing year [<a href="#rid19">19</a>], suggesting that these phenotypes are not stable over time.</p><p>Another study compared epidemiologic phenotype definitions identified by latent class analysis (similar to the Avon classification: persistent, late onset, intermediate, transient, and none/infrequent) with clinical phenotypes based upon patient histories from one to six years of age in an international, multicenter birth cohort [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Four clinically defined wheeze phenotypes (recurrent, unremitting wheeze; unremitting wheeze; asthma diagnosis; and frequent wheeze) were found to have a high sensitivity and specificity (displayed area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 97, 87, 85, and 84 percent, respectively). These findings suggest that these clinical phenotypes may be useful asthma definitions for future epidemiological studies. The clinical phenotypes were characterized as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Asthma diagnosis – Clinician diagnosis of asthma ever or recurrent diagnoses of spastic, obstructive, or asthmatic bronchitis by age six years</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Multi-trigger wheeze – At least two common asthma triggers leading to wheeze between ages three to six years</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unremitting wheeze – Having symptoms between wheezing episodes or wheeze without a cold at least once between ages one to six years</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recurrent, unremitting wheeze – Having symptoms between wheezing episodes or wheeze without a cold reported for two or more years between ages one to six years</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Frequent wheeze – Wheeze on a monthly basis for at least one year between ages one to six years</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Episodic wheeze – Wheezing episodes associated with viral respiratory tract infections only between ages one to six years</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2250383638"><span class="h2">Trousseau wheezing phenotypes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Three wheezing phenotypes were identified in a cross-sectional analysis of 551 children less than 36 months of age with recurrent wheezing enrolled in the Trousseau Asthma Program in France [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. These categories share some similarities with both the epidemiologic and symptom-based phenotypes. It is not known whether these phenotypes are persistent over time.

Children in the late-onset and persistent wheezing phenotype groups had a significantly higher rate of allergen sensitization at six years of age than healthy children without wheezing (56 and 51 percent versus 34 percent, respectively). In addition, sensitization to the common mold <em>Alternaria</em> was associated with a higher rate of chronic asthma at age 22 years (odds ratio [OR] 3.6) [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].

Children with this phenotype have a lower level of prebronchodilator lung function and enhanced airway reactivity [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. This phenotype is widespread among children with low socioeconomic status [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].

Risk factors linked with atopic wheeze include parental asthma, male sex, atopic dermatitis, eosinophilia at nine months, a history of wheezing with lower respiratory tract infections [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], early sensitization to food or aeroallergens [<a href="#rid30">30,31</a>], and the development of symptoms between wheezing exacerbations [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].

Early age of onset of atopic dermatitis and allergic sensitization is associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma in several studies.

In the Avon cohort, for example, the largest decrements in lung function were seen in the prolonged, early; intermediate-onset; and persistent wheezing groups, whereas airway hyperresponsiveness was greatest in the intermediate- and late-onset phenotypes [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>The age of onset of reduced lung function has varied in different studies [<a href="#rid2">2,23,24,33,35-37</a>].

Colonization with common respiratory bacterial pathogens, such as <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em>, and <em>Haemophilus</em> <em>influenzae</em> [<a href="#rid39">39,40</a>], and viral respiratory infections in infancy, particularly with human rhinovirus [<a href="#rid41">41,42</a>], appear to act synergistically in increasing the asthma risk with both allergic sensitization and reduced lung function during early childhood [<a href="#rid43">43,44</a>]. Viral infections can lead to changes in the composition of the airway microbiome and overgrowth of respiratory pathogens, likely contributing to respiratory symptoms and perhaps airway obstruction [<a href="#rid40">40,45</a>]. Although bacterial pathogens are linked to wheezing and asthma, environmental exposure to a broad range of bacteria might protect against wheezing illnesses [<a href="#rid46">46,47</a>].

It is postulated that colonization with protective gut bacteria has a direct antiinflammatory effect on the respiratory tract, reducing airway hyperreactivity [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. Other species of gastrointestinal microbiota are associated with an increased ability of the respiratory immune system to combat viral pathogens [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. It is also hypothesized that exposure to diverse microbes and allergens prenatally or during infancy is immunostimulatory and inversely related to the risk of wheezing illnesses [<a href="#rid46">46,50,51</a>]. Moreover, reduction of the immune and inflammatory processes during respiratory infections is another potential pathway for asthma prevention. As an example, a randomized trial of 40 infants hospitalized with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis treated with two weeks of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12937" href="/d/drug information/12937.html" rel="external">azithromycin</a> during the acute illness demonstrated less frequent wheeze during the subsequent year in treated children (36.7 days compared with 70.1 in the placebo group) [<a href="#rid52">52</a>].

In addition, sufficient vitamin D levels (≥30 ng/mL) during pregnancy in mothers with asthma has been shown to lower the risk of recurrent wheeze and asthma in children prior to age three years [<a href="#rid56">56</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3656163689"><span class="h2">Vitamin C</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12806" href="/d/drug information/12806.html" rel="external">Vitamin C</a> supplementation is postulated to negate the effects of in utero tobacco exposure on the developing lung. Tobacco exposure in utero is associated with decreased lung volumes and wheezing in infants [<a href="#rid57">57</a>].

These models have employed various risk factors associated with the development of asthma in epidemiologic studies, such as parental history of allergic sensitization and asthma, wheezing history, atopic disease in the child, IgE levels, and cytokine secretion profiles. However, none of these clinical tools have been validated in populations different from the study group.</p><p>A 2015 systematic review of 12 childhood asthma prediction models that assessed symptomatic children up to four years of age and predicted subsequent development of school-age asthma revealed the following predictive factors: demographic factors, respiratory symptoms, number of respiratory tract infections or wheezing episodes and hospitalizations, family history of allergy or asthma, other comorbid allergic conditions, eosinophilia, total IgE, specific IgE and allergen skin-prick testing to both food and aeroallergens, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels, and preterm or post-term delivery [<a href="#rid62">62</a>].

The major criteria were clinician-diagnosed eczema or parental asthma. The minor criteria were clinician-diagnosed allergic rhinitis, wheezing apart from colds, and eosinophilia ≥4 percent. A positive loose index was defined as any parental/caregiver report of wheezing on the surveys at two or three years of age and either one major criterion or two minor criteria. A positive stringent index was defined as frequent wheezing on these same surveys (score of ≥3, scale: 1 to 5, from "very rarely" to "on most days") plus the same combination of major or minor criteria. Children with a positive loose index were four times more likely to have active asthma during a subsequent survey at 6, 8, 11, or 13 years of age (sensitivity 42 percent; specificity 85 percent). Children with a positive stringent index were seven times more likely to have active asthma in at least one of these school-aged surveys (sensitivity 16 percent; specificity 97 percent). In addition, the positive likelihood ratio (LR), the probability of a child with active asthma classified as at risk divided by the probability of a child without active asthma classified as at risk, of the API is 7.43 at age six years [<a href="#rid66">66</a>]. The negative LR, the probability of a child with active asthma classified as not at risk divided by the probability of a child without active asthma classified as not at risk, is 0.75 at age six years [<a href="#rid66">66</a>].</p><p>The API was validated in a population-based birth cohort in Leicester, United Kingdom [<a href="#rid67">67</a>]. The API and wheeze frequency were assessed in 1954 children at three years of age and then compared with rates of asthma at 7 and 10 years of age. Results were similar to the findings in the Tucson cohort, with a fivefold increased risk of asthma at seven years of age with a positive loose API and an eightfold increased risk with a positive stringent API. Using a simpler rule of early wheeze (wheezing in the first three years of life) or early, frequent wheeze yielded comparable results. Thus, using the simpler definition may save screening costs. However, the overall predictive performance for all measures was low [<a href="#rid68">68,69</a>].</p><p>Yet, there remains a need to identify children that are unlikely to develop later asthma in order to prevent exposing children inappropriately to costly preventive therapies with potential side effects. The sensitivity of the API index is low (15 to 57 percent), suggesting that the test is poor at predicting later asthma [<a href="#rid63">63-65,67,70,71</a>]. However, the API has a high negative predictive value in the populations tested, which is essential for identifying children that have a low probability of having later asthma when the API is negative [<a href="#rid23">23,64,65</a>].

It may also be useful for identifying treatment responders, as demonstrated in the Prevention of Early Asthma in Kids (PEAK) study [<a href="#rid73">73</a>]. The predictive value of this modified API was tested in a cohort of high-risk children with a family history of allergy and/or asthma [<a href="#rid74">74</a>].

Compared with other asthma risk scores, the inclusion of race makes this asthma risk tool unique.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1066133"><span class="h1">FUTURE DIRECTIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Multidimensional approaches that include novel variables, such as biomarkers [<a href="#rid86">86-92</a>], lung imaging [<a href="#rid93">93,94</a>], genetics [<a href="#rid22">22,95-100</a>], and statistical techniques [<a href="#rid101">101</a>], may improve on the fidelity of phenotype designations and their stability over time. With further study, phenotypes may be identified that are highly predictive of the ultimate expression of asthma. This in turn may improve the precision of research into mechanisms causing asthma, with the ultimate goal of the primary prevention of asthma.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23915834"><span class="h1">SUMMARY</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Overview</strong> – Almost 50 percent of children are reported to have wheezing in the first year of life, although only 20 percent will experience continued wheezing symptoms in later childhood. The question of which children will go on to develop asthma that persists into adolescence and adulthood has been extensively studied but remains only partially answered. (See <a class="local">'Wheezing phenotypes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Wheezing phenotypes </strong>– Wheezing phenotypes have been defined to identify the characteristics and risk factors associated with children that experience wheezing. These include several epidemiologic phenotypes that are based upon wheezing history and symptom-based phenotypes that are based upon temporal patterns. Accurate classification of young children at high risk to develop persistent asthma may help predict long-term outcomes and identify children who may benefit from secondary prevention interventions. (See <a class="local">'Wheezing phenotypes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The most well-known of these phenotypes is the classification from the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study (TCRS) cohort, which divided young children with wheezing into the following groups: early, transient wheezers; persistent wheezers; and late-onset wheezers. The European Respiratory Society defined two symptom-based phenotypes: episodic (viral) wheeze and multi-trigger wheeze.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Asthma risk factors</strong> – Genetic, environmental, developmental, and host factors may contribute to the development of asthma and can alter the expression or persistence of the asthma phenotype over time. The major risk factors identified in various wheezing phenotype studies include the presence of atopy (in both the child and the parents), reduced lung function, and viral infections in infancy, particularly with rhinovirus. (See <a class="local">'Asthma risk factors'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/572.html" rel="external">"Risk factors for asthma"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/535.html" rel="external">"Role of viruses in wheezing and asthma: An overview"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Asthma predictive tools</strong> – Various predictive models or clinical indicators of risk have been studied to help the clinician identify those children who will continue wheezing into older childhood. These models have employed various risk factors associated with the development of asthma in epidemiologic studies, such as parental history of allergic sensitization and asthma, wheezing history, atopic disease in the child, immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, and cytokine secretion profiles. The most commonly used predictive scoring systems are the Asthma Predictive Index (API) and Pediatric Asthma Risk Score (PARS). (See <a class="local">'Predictive tools in children with wheezing'</a> above.)</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Garcia-Marcos L, Mallol J, Solé D, et al.
