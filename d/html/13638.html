         Lasers and intense pulsed light (IPL) are used for the treatment of multiple cutaneous vascular lesions, including telangiectasias, port wine birthmarks (PWBs; also called capillary malformations or port wine stains), and infantile hemangiomas. During treatment, the absorption of light energy by intravascular oxyhemoglobin leads to heating and coagulation of lesional blood vessels. The responses of vascular lesions to therapy are influenced by the type of light source used, the clinical characteristics of the target lesion, and patient-specific factors (eg, skin color, patient age).
        </p>
        <p>
         Although laser and IPL therapy can result in clinical benefits, treatment is not innocuous. Cutaneous and ocular damage can occur if clinicians are not vigilant. The use of appropriate equipment settings, skin cooling mechanisms, and other safety measures minimize the occurrence of adverse events due to treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         The types of lasers used in the treatment of vascular lesions as well as the efficacy and clinical use of lasers for the treatment of PWBs, infantile hemangiomas, and telangiectasias will be discussed here. The general principles of medical lasers, the principles of light therapy for the treatment of skin, and laser and light therapy for lower extremity telangiectasias and veins are reviewed elsewhere.

         The theory of selective photothermolysis describes the method through which lasers or intense pulsed light (IPL) can be used to selectively destroy specific targets in the skin while minimizing damage to other cutaneous structures [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In concordance with this theory, light energy must be delivered in a manner that results in preferential absorption of light by light-absorbing molecules (chromophores) located within the target. The absorption of light energy by chromophores leads to heating and coagulation of the target. To limit collateral damage, the diffusion of heat to adjacent tissues must also be minimized. The principles of laser and light therapy for cutaneous lesions are reviewed in greater detail elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13648.html" rel="external">
          "Principles of laser and intense pulsed light for cutaneous lesions"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The major chromophore targeted during therapy of vascular lesions is generally oxyhemoglobin, although absorption by other hemoglobin species, including deoxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin, can also occur. Significant light absorption by oxyhemoglobin occurs in the range of yellow and green light; peak absorption occurs at 418, 542, and 577 nm [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. A lower peak of light absorption by oxyhemoglobin occurs in the near-infrared light range. Thus, lasers that emit wavelengths of light near the primary absorption peaks of oxyhemoglobin, such as the 585 or 595 nm pulsed dye and the 532 nm frequency-doubled neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) lasers, are often favored for the treatment of vascular lesions. Infrared-range lasers (1064 nm Nd:YAG, alexandrite, or diode) can also be effective for this indication but are associated with a greater risk for tissue damage and ulceration.
        </p>
        <p>
         The potential for light absorption by melanin, another chromophore ubiquitously present in the skin, must be considered prior to the treatment of vascular lesions. Light absorption by melanin progressively increases as wavelengths of light decrease, leading to a relatively higher risk of dyspigmentation secondary to melanin absorption with the use of shorter wavelengths of light. This is of particular concern in patients with darkly pigmented skin, in whom epidermal melanin is abundant. Epidermal skin cooling techniques and adjustments to laser settings can be used to reduce the incidence of adverse effects secondary to epidermal melanin absorption [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Absorption of light by epidermal melanin can also affect the efficacy of treatment through reducing the amount of light that reaches vessels in the dermis. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13648.html" rel="external">
          "Principles of laser and intense pulsed light for cutaneous lesions", section on 'Skin cooling'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the absorption of light by superficial chromophores can influence the amount of light that reaches deep tissues, the wavelength of emitted light is a critical factor for determining the depth to which light penetrates the skin. Longer wavelengths of light penetrate the skin more deeply than shorter wavelengths. As an example, in a patient with Fitzpatrick skin type II  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60541" href="/z/d/graphic/60541.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ), light with a 585 nm wavelength may penetrate roughly 0.65 mm into the skin, while 595 nm may reach a depth of approximately 1 mm [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13648.html" rel="external">
          "Principles of laser and intense pulsed light for cutaneous lesions", section on 'Wavelength'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Because short wavelengths of light penetrate the skin only superficially, long wavelengths (eg, those in the near-infrared range) are required to reach vessels that are deeper than the upper dermis. This feature plus a relatively high risk of light absorption by epidermal melanin are the primary reasons that lasers with wavelengths near the 418 nm peak of oxyhemoglobin light absorption are generally avoided in the treatment of vascular lesions. Since target vascular lesions often contain vessels at variable depths, using lasers of different wavelengths over the course of several treatments can be useful for achieving desired clinical effects.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other laser settings that influence the efficacy of laser and light therapy for vascular lesions include the pulse duration, fluence (energy delivered per unit area), and spot size.

          Pulse duration
         </strong>
         – Pulse durations equal to or shorter than the vessel thermal relaxation time (time required for a target to lose accumulated heat) are often used to reduce the risk of damage to surrounding structures. Pulse durations that exceed a structure's thermal relaxation time allow the diffusion of heat to adjacent structures, increasing the risk for collateral damage in the skin. The thermal relaxation times for vessels in port wine birthmarks (PWBs; typically 10 to 300 micrometers in diameter) range from 1 to 10 ms [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13648.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The pulse duration also affects clinical responses to treatment. Short pulse durations (eg, 0.45 ms) often result in rapid heating and rupture of target vessels, contributing to the appearance of post-treatment purpura, which some patients treated for telangiectasias find undesirable. In contrast, long pulse durations deliver light energy over a longer period and allow slower heating of target vessels, preventing sudden vessel rupture and reducing the risk of purpura. Long pulses may also be useful for the destruction of large vessels. Large structures lose heat slowly, and the accumulation of heat that occurs over long pulse durations may facilitate coagulation of larger vessels.

         <strong>
          Fluence
         </strong>
         – The appropriate laser or IPL setting for the amount of energy delivered to the skin per unit area (fluence) is an important factor for efficacious and safe treatment of vascular lesions. The energy delivered must be sufficient for the chromophore to absorb enough heat to induce vessel coagulation but should not reach levels that induce excessive damage to the skin. Skin cooling mechanisms can be used to reduce the risk of skin damage associated with the use of high fluences [

          Spot size
         </strong>
         – The term "spot size" is used to describe the size of the area through which light is delivered. Large spot sizes minimize scattering of light as it enters the skin, allowing more light to reach the target structure. Large spot sizes also facilitate the treatment of large lesions. A small spot size may be preferred for the treatment of a small, focal telangiectasia. (See

         High peaks for the absorption of light by oxyhemoglobin occur within the range of yellow and green light. Thus, lasers that emit light in this range are commonly used for the treatment of vascular lesions. However, the restricted depth of penetration of light emitted from these lasers may limit their efficacy for the destruction of vessels located below the superficial dermis. Dyspigmentation is also a risk associated with the use of these lasers, given the relatively high absorption of light in this range by melanin. (See

         The flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser (PDL; 585 to 600 nm) has a long history of safe and effective use for vascular lesions. Original 577 nm PDLs were commonly used with pulse durations of approximately 0.45 ms, which is much shorter than the thermal relaxation time of small, superficial vessels (1 to 10 ms). Use of short pulse durations minimizes collateral damage in the skin but also often leads to rapid heating of vessels and vessel rupture, contributing to the appearance of post-treatment temporary purpura. Longer pulse PDLs (595 to 600 nm, pulse duration ≥1.5 ms) slowly heat target vessels and can be used without the formation of purpura. However, subpurpuric protocols with long-pulse PDLs may be less effective for the treatment of telangiectasias [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6

         ], and clinical experience suggests similar effects in the treatment of port wine birthmarks (PWBs). (See

         The frequency-doubled neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet/potassium titanyl phosphate (Nd:YAG/KTP) laser consists of light from an Nd:YAG laser that is passed through a KTP crystal. The wavelength of this laser is 532 nm, near the 542 nm absorption peak of oxyhemoglobin. Pulse durations of frequency-doubled Nd:YAG/KTP lasers are in the millisecond range, which allows for the treatment of vascular lesions without the formation of purpura. However, the short wavelength results in a lower depth of skin penetration compared with PDLs. Light emitted by frequency-doubled Nd:YAG/KTP lasers is also absorbed to a greater extent by melanin, augmenting the risk of dyspigmentation, particularly in patients with darkly pigmented skin.

         A secondary, lower peak for the absorption of light by oxyhemoglobin occurs in the near-infrared range (720 to 1200 nm). There is also a small deoxyhemoglobin absorption peak between 750 to 800 nm. Alexandrite (755 nm), diode (800 to 980 nm), and long-pulsed Nd:YAG (1064 nm) lasers are used to capitalize on this absorption and can be effective for the treatment of vascular lesions [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7

         ]. The relatively long wavelengths of light emitted by these lasers penetrate the skin to greater depths than is possible with PDL or frequency-doubled Nd:YAG/KTP lasers. Thus, these lasers are generally utilized when vessels deep in the skin are targeted. Pulse durations of these near-infrared lasers are in the millisecond range, facilitating the treatment of larger vessels.

         A disadvantage of near-infrared lasers is that the relatively lower absorption of light by hemoglobin species in this light range demands the use of higher fluences during the treatment of vascular lesions [

         Intense pulsed light (IPL) sources are nonlaser flashlamp devices that produce incoherent, broad bands of light ranging from 515 to 1200 nm. Selective light filters can be used to restrict the emitted wavelengths to a narrower range for a more specific tissue effect.
        </p>
        <p>
         IPL devices have versatility, as they generate a wide range of light wavelengths, pulse durations, and pulse sequences. However, treatment of some types of vascular lesions with IPL can require more sessions than laser therapy to achieve the same clinical effect (see
         <a class="local">
          'Other lasers and light therapies'
         </a>
         below). Another potentially detrimental feature of IPL is the emission of wavelengths of light highly absorbed by epidermal melanin, which leads to a relatively high risk of pigmentary adverse effects. Use of skin cooling techniques during IPL therapy is essential for reducing this risk.

         Protective eyewear is essential for all individuals present in the treatment room. Clinical personnel must wear laser safety goggles that specifically protect against the wavelength of the laser used.

        <p>
         Patient protective eyewear depends on the location to be treated. If nonfacial areas are to be treated, patients may wear laser safety goggles similar to those of the clinical staff. For the treatment of the face outside of the periorbital area, protective pads specific for laser procedures or laser treatment metal goggles correctly placed can be used. Corneal shields inserted with the aid of ocular anesthetic drops and lubricant are required when the eyelid or immediate periorbital area is treated. Appropriate sizing and placement of the patient's eyewear should always be confirmed prior to starting a procedure.

          General anesthesia
         </strong>
         – General anesthesia may be helpful to ensure safe and complete treatment of large lesions (port wine birthmarks [PWBs] or infantile hemangiomas) in infants, children, and some adults. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning regarding use of general anesthetics in children under three years of age [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12

         The multiple treatments required and the use of protective eyewear, especially corneal shields, can be difficult for children. General anesthesia is routinely used for large lesions at the author's institution for young children over the age of three years who would benefit from treatment. Older children and adults often do not need general anesthesia, but it depends on the individual.

         Capillary malformations (nevus flammeus, port wine stains, port wine birthmarks [PWBs], MIM #163000) are congenital low-flow vascular malformations of dermal capillaries and postcapillary venules presenting as pink to erythematous to violaceous patches  (

         ). Although the term "port wine stain" is commonly used, patients may prefer the term "port wine birthmark," as "stain" has a negative connotation [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Lesions may be extensive, and papular and nodular components often develop during adulthood. PWBs can lead to psychologic distress in some patients, and complications such as nodules, bleeding, pyogenic granulomas, and tissue hypertrophy can occur in mature lesions [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,19

         ]. Isolated lesions do occur, but PWBs may be associated with several syndromes that should be considered when these patients present. (See

         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. We typically aim to begin treatment of PWBs within the first month of life.
        </p>
        <p>
         An uncontrolled study of 89 patients with PWBs treated with PDL found no difference in the degree of improvement in patients of varying ages (0 to 31 years) [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. However, the results of multiple studies suggest that very young children (under one year of age) may require fewer treatments for lesion clearance and may be more likely to achieve greater overall lightening [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The greater efficacy of treatment in young children may be related to a variety of factors, including increased hemoglobin concentration (in the first 6 to 12 months of life), especially hemoglobin F, and the presence of thinner skin and smaller lesional vessels in this population when compared with older individuals. PWBs often develop thickening and nodularity as patients age, and lesions with these changes may be more difficult to treat [

         Although PDLs are the standard of care for PWBs, a lack of studies evaluating the efficacy of specific laser parameters, the continued evolution of laser technology, and variations in patient skin color and lesion characteristics have precluded the development of standardized treatment guidelines.

          Wavelength and pulse duration
         </strong>
         – The 595 nm PDL with variable pulse duration has become the laser most frequently used for the treatment of PWBs. Compared with the earlier developed 585 nm PDL, light from the 595 nm PDL penetrates the skin to a slightly greater depth. In addition, the ability to deliver pulse durations in the millisecond range (typically 1.5 to 10 ms or longer) may facilitate the destruction of larger vessels.

          Fluence
         </strong>
         – Appropriate initial PDL fluence settings vary. Factors such as patient age, skin color, lesion morphology, lesion location, average vessel size, laser type, and laser spot size determine the correct fluence setting.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         As an example, when treating a PWB on the cheek in an older child or adult with skin phototype II  (

          Cooling

         – Adequate epidermal cooling techniques reduce the risk of epidermal damage and scarring and allow for the use of higher fluences in the hands of experienced clinicians. Epidermal cooling is particularly important in patients with darkly pigmented skin, in whom inadequate cooling is likely to result in hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation.

          Spot size
         </strong>
         – Large spot sizes (≥7 mm) are generally preferred as they minimize light scattering and thus allow greater delivery of light energy to target structures. Large spot sizes also facilitate the treatment of large PWBs.

          Patient positioning
         </strong>
         – Although the impact of patient positioning during treatment has not been specifically studied, we typically place the treatment site in a dependent position (eg, Trendelenburg position for facial lesions) immediately prior to treatment to increase local blood volume, which theoretically may increase the size of the vascular target.

        </p>
        <p>
         The frequency with which treatments are administered varies in the literature, ranging from every two weeks to every few months. We typically administer PDL treatments every three to six weeks for facial lesions. Other clinicians have successfully used shorter intervals. In a retrospective study of 24 infants with facial PWBs (Fitzpatrick skin phototype I to III), treatment intervals of two, three, or four weeks were effective for improving PWBs and were well tolerated [

        <p>
         We may use longer intervals (six to eight weeks) for patients with darkly pigmented skin (Fitzpatrick phototype IV or higher) or with extremity lesions if there is postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Longer time intervals between sessions allow for treatment and improvement of hyperpigmentation. Hyperpigmentation can reduce treatment efficacy. (See

         The efficacy of PDL for the treatment of ulcerated infantile hemangioma is supported by a few observational studies [
         <a href="#rid76">
          76,79-81
         </a>
         ]. In a study of 78 children with ulcerated infantile hemangioma, 71 (91 percent) responded to therapy with 585 nm PDL [
         <a href="#rid76">
          76

         ]. An earlier retrospective study found less dramatic results, with 11 of 22 treated children exhibiting definite improvement [

        <p>
         Pain reduction is another potential benefit of PDL treatment. In a series of nine infants with ulcerated hemangiomas, pain appeared to improve in all patients after one treatment with a 585 nm PDL [

         The ideal timing of PDL therapy in infantile hemangiomas remains uncertain. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that early treatment influences the risk for the development of deep components.
        </p>
        <p>
         Beneficial effects of early PDL therapy are supported by the results of a prospective study of 165 children treated with a 585 nm PDL [
         <a href="#rid74">
          74
         </a>
         ]. In this study, involuting hemangiomas were more likely to lighten in color than actively proliferating lesions and required fewer treatments to achieve improvement. Some authors have suggested that early treatment of infantile hemangiomas (prior to the proliferative stage) may also inhibit the proliferation of deeper components [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. However, studies conflict on the validity of this theory [
         <a href="#rid73">
          73-75,83
         </a>
         ]. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although patient age often loosely correlates with lesion stage, age may not be an independent determining factor for the efficacy of treatment. In a prospective study of 548 children (age 3 to 36 months) with 692 proliferating hemangiomas who were treated with a 585 nm PDL, mean scores for response to treatment did not differ according to patient age [

         Superficial involuting lesions may respond best to treatment, indicating that when desired, PDL may be useful for accelerating clinical resolution of actively involuting lesions [

        <p>
         We typically use a 595 nm PDL and select laser settings based upon multiple factors, including lesion stage (proliferating versus involuting), lesion location, and patient skin type. Low fluences (around 5 J/cm
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         ) should be used for proliferating lesions to minimize risk of ulceration. The initial fluence setting should also be reduced for patients with darkly pigmented skin and lesions in areas with thin skin (eg, eyelid).
        </p>
        <p>
         The often undulating surface of infantile hemangiomas requires the clinician to play close attention to the correct positioning of the laser in relation to the skin  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80239" href="/z/d/graphic/80239.html" rel="external">
          picture 2

         ). Integrated skin cooling mechanisms are required and should be utilized to minimize the risk of epidermal damage during treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatments can be performed at two- to four-week intervals in rapidly proliferating or ulcerated lesions. Stable or involuting lesions may be treated less frequently every four to six weeks. Treatment is often performed without anesthesia. However, in occasional cases, local or general anesthesia may be necessary for safe and effective treatment. (See

          84

         <a href="#rid73">
          73
         </a>
         ]. In this trial, 121 infants aged 1 to 14 weeks with early infantile hemangiomas were assigned to PDL treatment or observation and followed up to the age of one year. At one year, the proportion of children who achieved complete clearance or minimal residual signs was similar in both groups (42 versus 44 percent, respectively). Infants treated with PDL were more likely to have skin atrophy (28 versus 8 percent) and hypopigmentation (45 versus 15 percent).

         In a split-face comparison study of nine patients with facial telangiectasias and erythema treated with a 595 nm long-pulse (6 ms) PDL, purpuric fluences were more effective at reducing vessel diameter and arborization of telangiectasias than multiple passes with subpurpuric laser settings [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5

          38,96

         ]. Pulse stacking involves the immediate delivery of repeated pulses (usually two to three) to the same treatment area to increase cumulative heating of the target vessels, while allowing sufficient time for epidermal cooling between pulses. Multiple passes and pulse stacking techniques should only be used cautiously. Cutaneous damage may occur if incorrect settings are used or if the skin response to treatment is not properly monitored.

         Rosacea-associated telangiectasias are managed similarly to other telangiectasias.

         Multiple light-based treatments are generally required to achieve the desired clinical response.

          Principles of laser therapy
         </strong>
         – The efficacy of lasers and intense pulsed light (IPL) for vascular lesions stems from the absorption of light by oxyhemoglobin and other hemoglobin species (deoxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin) in lesional vessels. Yellow and green light and, to a lesser extent, near-infrared light are preferentially absorbed by hemoglobin species. Light sources that emit light in these ranges are generally used for the treatment of vascular lesions. Pulsed dye lasers (PDLs) are most commonly used for the treatment of vascular lesions. (See

          Port wine birthmarks
         </strong>
         – PDL therapy is considered the standard of care for the treatment of port wine birthmarks (PWBs) in children and young patients who desire treatment (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13726.html" rel="external">
          "Capillary malformations (port wine birthmarks) and associated syndromes"
         </a>
         ). We typically utilize a 595 nm PDL with pulse duration of 0.45 ms or greater and an integrated mechanism to cool the epidermis. Multiple treatments are required to achieve clinically significant improvement. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pulsed dye lasers'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Millisecond pulsed near-infrared lasers such as the 755 nm alexandrite or 1064 neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser may be useful for the treatment of thick or nodular PWBs. However, the risk of scarring with long wavelength lasers exceeds the risk with PDL, and the use of these lasers for PWBs should be restricted to experienced clinicians.

         Other treatment options for PWBs include the 532 nm frequency-doubled Nd:YAG/potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser, diode laser, IPL, and photodynamic therapy (PDT). (See
