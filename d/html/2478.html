The low cure rates after locoregional therapy alone prompted the inclusion of systemic chemotherapy in multimodality treatment regimens, to control distant micrometastatic disease and enhance local radiation effects.</p><p>Classification and management of esophagogastric junction (EGJ) tumors have also evolved over time. In the current (2017, eighth edition) revision of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) staging classification [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], tumors involving the EGJ with the tumor epicenter no more than 2 cm into the proximal stomach are staged as esophageal cancers  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111221" href="/z/d/graphic/111221.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), while EGJ tumors with their epicenter located more than 2 cm into the proximal stomach are staged as stomach cancers, as are all cardia cancers not involving the EGJ, even if they are within 2 cm of the EGJ  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111351" href="/z/d/graphic/111351.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2502.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of esophageal cancer", section on 'TNM staging criteria'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2513.html" rel="external">"Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of gastric cancer", section on 'TNM staging criteria'</a>.)</p><p>Most clinicians now treat EGJ and proximal gastric (ie, cardia  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56689" href="/z/d/graphic/56689.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>)) cancers as esophageal cancers, using preoperative chemoradiotherapy. However, these tumors have been included in many of the trials examining the benefit of perioperative chemotherapy for gastric cancer, and this approach is also widely used. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16226.html" rel="external">"Multimodality approaches to potentially resectable esophagogastric junction and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas"</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will focus on the efficacy of radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy and multimodality management of localized and locoregional cancer involving the thoracic esophagus.

Although most clinical studies have not differentiated between the two histologies, an increasing amount of evidence supports the view that they differ in terms of pathogenesis, epidemiology, tumor biology, and prognosis. In acknowledgment of these differences, the Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging system provides separate stage groupings (but similar definitions for T, N, M, and grade [G] categories) for SCCs and ACs of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction (EGJ)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111221" href="/z/d/graphic/111221.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). In addition, tumor location (for SCCs only) is incorporated into stage grouping. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2502.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of esophageal cancer"</a>.)</p><p>However, it remains unclear as to whether and how histology should dictate the therapeutic approach, and largely due to the lack of data on the impact of histology on treatment outcomes, the approach tends to be similar for both histologies, at least initially. However, pathologic complete response rates are higher in SCC following chemoradiotherapy (CRT), and if an endoscopic complete response is achieved, non-operative management is an option following initial CRT. By contrast, few data exist on the adequacy of nonoperative management for ACs, and most patients are recommended to undergo surgery after upfront CRT. (See <a class="local">'Necessity for surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>Future studies in esophageal cancer should analyze and report separately the results of therapeutic strategies according to histology.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H607555500"><span class="h2">Differences</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An increasing amount of evidence supports the view that esophageal SCC and ACs differ in terms of pathogenesis, epidemiology, tumor biology, and prognosis:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The incidence of SCC is declining in the United States while that of AC has increased markedly over the last 20 years, suggesting underlying etiologic differences. SCC almost always occurs in individuals with histories of tobacco and/or alcohol abuse while ACs are associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and high body mass. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2274.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and pathobiology of esophageal cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The precursor lesion of SCC is epithelial dysplasia, which when untreated sequentially progresses to carcinoma in situ, and finally to invasive carcinoma [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. By contrast, ACs usually arise in the setting of persistent GERD, which can initiate intestinal metaplasia in the distal esophagus. Carcinogenesis begins with genetic alterations which endow the metaplastic cells with a growth advantage, permitting them to hyperproliferate. As the cells progressively acquire DNA damage, they become morphologically dysplastic, and eventually, frankly malignant. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2276.html" rel="external">"Barrett's esophagus: Pathogenesis and malignant transformation", section on 'Adenocarcinoma'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Although SCCs tend to be diagnosed on average 10 years earlier than ACs, perioperative mortality is higher for SCC than for a Barrett's associated AC, likely related to associated comorbidities and tumor location [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. The sequelae of GERD involve mostly the distal esophagus/EGJ, and 94 percent of cancers associated with Barrett's esophagus are located below the tracheal bifurcation. By contrast, 65 percent of SCCs are located above this location [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Patients with tumors located in the upper third of the esophagus who undergo resections have significantly higher rates of postoperative death. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2530.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of resectable esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancers"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2274.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and pathobiology of esophageal cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2276.html" rel="external">"Barrett's esophagus: Pathogenesis and malignant transformation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Histology also influences the pattern of first recurrence after resection. Upper or mid-thoracic SCCs  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111260" href="/z/d/graphic/111260.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) tend to recur locoregionally first, while distal esophageal ACs more commonly recur with distant dissemination.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Despite these data, many (but not all [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]) contemporary series suggest that the prognosis of AC is better than that of SCC, particularly in early stage disease [<a href="#rid6">6-12</a>]. One reason may be the lower prevalence of lymphatic spread for Barrett's-associated ACs than for SCCs [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>].</p><p></p><p>It has been proposed that the difference in tumor location and histology also has implications for the choice of therapy:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Some suggest that induction chemotherapy alone may suffice for ACs, while results are superior with CRT for SCCs because of the greater need for tumor downsizing to achieve a complete radical resection and possibly because of the increased propensity for regional lymphatic spread [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Others note the higher degree of radiosensitivity for SCC, and the lack of survival improvement when CRT has been added to chemotherapy and surgery in contemporary series in which ACs predominate [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Chemotherapy versus chemoradiotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>However, there is controversy about this viewpoint and little agreement as to whether histologic type should be used as a factor in selecting the treatment strategy. A major area where data are lacking is nonsurgical management for ACs.

However, these tumors have been included in many of the trials examining the benefit of perioperative chemotherapy alone for gastric cancer, and this is also a widely accepted approach. The specific therapeutic approach to tumors of the EGJ is addressed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16226.html" rel="external">"Multimodality approaches to potentially resectable esophagogastric junction and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Given the higher rate of locally persistent/recurrent disease after CRT alone and a lack of data on nonsurgical management of patients with adenocarcinomas (ACs), who have a low rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) after CRT, we suggest inclusion of surgery rather than definitive CRT for clinically resectable ACs. (See <a class="local">'Necessity for surgery'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">We also suggest inclusion of surgery rather than definitive CRT for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). However, for those with SCC who have an endoscopic complete response, nonoperative management is an option, balancing the risks of surgical mortality versus improved locoregional control. Nonoperative management may be preferred for a patient with a higher burden of comorbidities who is less likely to tolerate surgery and/or has a tumor located in the proximal esophagus (eg, close to the larynx) where laryngectomy would be necessary in order to obtain optimal resection margins. (See <a class="local">'Chemoradiotherapy responders'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">An important point is that the optimal way to define "complete CRT responders" and detect those with residual disease is not established. At some institutions, an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is routinely undertaken [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>], but others (including the National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]) advise only upper endoscopy with biopsy if avoidance of surgery is being considered. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Until further data are available, we suggest against using postinduction therapy positron emission tomography (PET) scanning as an exclusive determinant in order to select patients for nonsurgical therapy.

Its utility as monotherapy has been challenged [<a href="#rid20">20-26</a>]. More recently, contemporary surgical series report five-year survival rates of as high as 30 to 46 percent for surgery alone, with the most favorable outcomes in patients with node-negative SCC [<a href="#rid27">27-30</a>]. In one analysis of 4627 patients with esophageal cancer who were treated with surgery alone, without adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy, five-year survival rates were 42 percent, but they were &lt;50 percent for all disease stages except T1N0 cases  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111221" href="/z/d/graphic/111221.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), and they were 15 percent for any patient with node-positive disease [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p>This relatively poor long-term outcome has prompted an evaluation of neoadjuvant (preoperative), adjuvant (postoperative), and nonoperative strategies aimed at improving survival in patients with apparently localized disease.

Modern radiation techniques (eg, three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy [3D-CRT], intensity-modulated radiation therapy [IMRT]) are associated with more favorable toxicity profiles than those associated with units which deliver lower energy radiation that were used in earlier years. The success of advanced radiation technology can be illustrated by a Chinese trial in which surgery was compared with RT alone in 269 patients with esophageal SCC [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].

Conformal treatment planning also enables measurement of the dose of radiotherapy delivered to a volume of given organs, allowing more refined assessment of the interaction between radiotherapy dose and potential side effects.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">3D-CRT uses four to eight beams if necessary to conform the distribution of radiation dose to the gross tumor volume (GTV), clinical tumor volume (CTV), and planning tumor volume (PTV), while the surrounding normal structures are protected from excessive radiation dose to the greatest extent possible. 3D-CRT plan provides a dose-volume histogram for GTV, CTV, and PTV as well as for normal organs at risk for complications. Thus, it is feasible to formulate a radiation dose schedule for the desired level of tumor control probability that is balanced with an acceptable level of toxicities. However, such risk assessment is not feasible with 2D-RT.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">IMRT is an advanced radiation modality. Unlike 2D and even standard 3D-CRT, it uses inverse treatment planning to deliver highly conformal RT plans, enabling increased sparing of normal structures while still delivering the same dose of radiotherapy to the GTV, CTV, and PTV. As a result, the volume of normal tissue in the high radiation dose region (40 to 60 Gy) is smaller with IMRT than with 3D-CRT while the volume of normal tissue in the low-dose region (5 to 10 Gy) is larger with IMRT than with 3D-CRT.

The CTV should include 4 to 5 cm margins beyond the radiographic tumor extent in the cephalad-caudad direction and 2 to 2.5 cm beyond the radial border of GTV (defined by <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9180" href="/z/d/drug information/9180.html" rel="external">barium</a> esophagogram or CT scan). For lesions of the lower third of the esophagus and EGJ, the caudal extension CTV beyond GTV includes a 3 to 4 cm margin of gastric cardia below the lower border of GTV. CTV for regional lymph nodes includes the celiac, gastric, and gastrohepatic lymph node groups for primary tumors at the EGJ. For primary tumors involving the upper two-thirds of the thoracic or the cervical esophagus, CTV includes both supraclavicular regions. It is necessary to add another 0.5 to 0.7 cm beyond CTV as the PTV in order to compensate for daily set-up error and respiratory tumor motion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Esophageal cancers that are located at the EGJ can have a significant degree of tumor motion associated with respiration. We reported peak-to-peak motion of the primary tumor in 10 patients (9 near the EGJ with their involved lymph nodes at the celiac region) [<a href="#rid67">67</a>]. The peak-to-peak tumor motion in craniocaudal directions ranged from 0.6 cm to 4.8 cm for the primary tumor and from 1.2 cm to 4.4 cm for the involved lymph nodes. To avoid geographic miss in some of these patients when using 3D-CRT, four-dimensional CT (4D-CT) treatment planning and delivery of 3D-CRT has a significant advantage for optimum coverage of the target volume over 3D-CRT planned with the conventional helical CT.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Optimal dose and fractionation schedules</strong> – Tumor size and radiation dose are important considerations for locoregional tumor control.

Importantly, this nomogram did not identify a population for whom there was no benefit from resection.

In particular, some retrospective data suggest that post-CRT FDG-PET scanning may serve to identify those patients for whom surgery might be avoided. One series included 105 patients with stage I to IVA esophageal cancer (75 percent AC) who were evaluable for a post-CRT PET response, 50 of whom received CRT alone [<a href="#rid109">109</a>]. In this cohort, those whose PET response was characterized by a post-treatment maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) ≤3 in the tumor (n = 19, 38 percent) had an excellent outcome without resection (two-year overall survival 71 versus 11 percent for those with a post-treatment tumoral SUVmax ≥3.1; the corresponding two-year rates of freedom from local failure were 75 versus 28 percent).

For those who need extra time to recuperate from CRT, surgery can be delayed.</p><p>The optimal timing between completion of neoadjuvant CRT and resection is not established. The typical interval, four to seven weeks, is arbitrary, with the intent of allowing resolution of acute inflammation and for tumor regression while minimizing chronic fibrotic changes in the surgical field. Most tumors regress slowly after RT because one of the ways in which the cells die is through mitotic death that occurs only during cell division. Increasing the interval between treatment completion and attempted resection may allow the tumor to continue to regress, thereby improving resectability, and increase the chance of observing a pCR. Studies have shown that pCRs in patients undergoing trimodality treatment for esophageal cancer predict decreased local and distant recurrence and improved survival [<a href="#rid73">73,76,86</a>]. There are some data demonstrating higher pCR rates for patients who delay surgery for 64 or more days after the completion of CRT (relative to those undergoing surgery at 45 to 63 days, pCR rates were 41 versus 13 to 23 percent), with no significant increase in surgical morbidity [<a href="#rid112">112</a>]. However, despite the higher pCR rates, delaying surgery has not translated into an improvement in overall survival [<a href="#rid78">78,112-114</a>]. Furthermore, delaying surgery beyond six to seven weeks might negatively impact the clinical outcomes of those who have residual cancer after neoadjuvant therapy, but the available data on this point are mixed. At least one analysis from the National Cancer Database suggests inferior 90-day mortality and long-term survival rates in patients who wait 65 days or longer between CRT and surgery [<a href="#rid115">115</a>].</p><p>We prefer that surgery be performed within five to seven weeks of completing CRT.

This was illustrated in a series of 590 patients who underwent esophagectomy for AC [<a href="#rid155">155</a>]. The peak interval for recurrence after esophagectomy alone was six to nine months, and more than 90 percent of the disease recurrences occurred by three years. By contrast, among patients treated with neoadjuvant CRT (ie, trimodality therapy), the peak time frame for recurrence was the first three months, and &gt;90 percent of recurrences were evident by 21 months. The pattern of recurrence was distant, locoregional, or both in 60, 30, and 10 percent of patients, respectively, and did not differ in patients treated with surgery alone. Of note, these results may be impacted by selection bias, as patients with more advanced tumors likely had an increased likelihood of receiving neoadjuvant therapy. A similar distribution of recurrences (distant, locoregional, or both in 55, 28, and 17 percent) have been reported by others following trimodality therapy [<a href="#rid156">156</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, isolated local recurrences are more frequent after definitive CRT, and salvage surgery may benefit a greater number of these patients. This was shown in a retrospective analysis of 276 patients with esophageal cancer (78 percent AC) who were treated with definitive CRT at MD Anderson Cancer Center over a nine-year period (2002 to 2011) [<a href="#rid105">105</a>]. The site of first failure was local only in 64 (23 percent); and 23 (36 percent, 8 percent of the entire cohort) of these were amenable to salvage surgery. At a median follow-up of 54 months for the entire cohort, the estimated three- and five-year overall survival rates for those undergoing salvage surgery were 61 and 45 percent, respectively. Ninety-one percent of the local recurrences developed within two years, suggesting that vigilant surveillance is more important in this time frame.

At our institutions, we perform history, physical examination, and targeted blood work (for a symptomatic patient, or if there was a serum tumor marker that was elevated preoperatively) every four months for the first three years and also perform restaging CT scans of the chest and abdomen at four-month intervals. We do not carry out surveillance endoscopy unless there was a preoperative history of Barrett's esophagus, a questionable margin at the time of surgery, or if the patient has a recalcitrant stricture that is worrisome for an occult local recurrence. More vigilant surveillance in the first two years after treatment may be warranted in patients who underwent definitive CRT.</p><p>The primary purpose of post-treatment surveillance is to implement a potentially beneficial salvage therapy in cases of locoregional failure. However, the incidence of locoregional failure is low, particularly after trimodality therapy, and the number of potentially curable recurrences that will be detected by intensive post-treatment surveillance is small.</p><p>This was demonstrated in a report of 518 patients with esophageal AC who were treated with preoperative CRT and followed for a median of 29.3 months [<a href="#rid157">157</a>]. The post-treatment surveillance strategy included CT or PET-CT every three months for the first year, every six months for two additional years, then annually for at least five years. Endoscopic examination was performed every six months for 18 months, then annually. Isolated locoregional failure developed in 27 (5 percent), only 11 of which were intraluminal. By contrast, distant metastases developed in 188 (36 percent). Twelve patients with locoregional failure had salvage CRT, and four underwent salvage surgery (three of whom later developed metastatic disease). Overall, only 10 of the 27 patients with a locoregional failure survived longer than 10 years.

They advise that follow-up visits concentrate on symptoms, nutrition, and psychosocial support.
