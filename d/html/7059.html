Radiation exposure also increases the risk of benign thyroid nodules and hypothyroidism.</p><p>This topic will review radiation-related thyroid disease, including the approach to a patient with a history of thyroid radiation exposure as well as prevention of radiation-related thyroid disease. Acute radiation injury to other organs and risk of secondary malignancy after radioiodine treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer are reviewed separately.

Occasionally, a nonfunctioning parathyroid adenoma is discovered during thyroid surgery. Whether these adenomas are related to radiation or have any clinical importance is not known.

Ionizing radiation from medical imaging now accounts for nearly one-half of the radiation exposure experienced by the population in the United States.</p><p>Concern has been raised about a potential increase in risk of thyroid cancer in children receiving frequent diagnostic radiographs, particularly computed tomography (CT) scans. Thus far, the potential risk has been calculated assuming the widely accepted, but somewhat controversial, linear extrapolation dose-response model [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. A retrospective study in Taiwanese adults (including more than 22,000 cases of thyroid cancer) found an association between prior CT scans and risk of developing thyroid cancer [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The results of ongoing, large epidemiologic studies are needed to confirm the risk of thyroid cancer from radiographs [<a href="#rid8">8-10</a>].

There is inconclusive evidence for a risk of thyroid cancer, albeit a small one, after low-dose exposure in adulthood.</p><p>The risk of thyroid nodules and cancer has been investigated in many radiation-exposed groups, including children irradiated for benign diseases (enlarged thymus glands or tonsils, hemangiomas of the face and neck, tinea capitis of the scalp) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]; survivors of atomic bombing in Japan [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]; Marshall Islanders exposed to nuclear test fallout [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]; and children living in the area of Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, or Fukushima, sites of a nuclear accident [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. Virtually all of the previous indications for external radiation treatments in this range (eg, to shrink an "enlarged" thymus gland) have been abandoned [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. However, environmental exposures largely due to accidents remain possible.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Childhood</strong> – Exposure of a cohort of children to low doses of iodine 131 (I-131; estimated mean thyroid dose of 174 mGy) over a prolonged period of time (13 years as a result of releases from the Hanford nuclear facility) was not associated with an increased risk of thyroid disease in one study [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. On the other hand, children exposed to radiation, predominantly I-131, after the Chernobyl accident have developed thyroid cancer [<a href="#rid17">17-21</a>]. Additionally, among 1494 subjects aged 16 to 20 years who were exposed to I-131 fallout from the Chernobyl accident in utero, there was an increase in thyroid cancer; this is consistent with other data, but the risk estimate was based on only eight cases and was not statistically significant [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. It is not clear how far the Chernobyl experience can be extrapolated, because other factors, such as iodine deficiency [<a href="#rid17">17</a>], which may increase the uptake of radioiodine by the thyroid gland, as well as exposure to other short-lived higher energy iodine isotopes, may come into play.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Adult</strong> – Assessment of the possible risk for thyroid cancer in exposed adults largely comes from pooled analyses, atomic bomb survivor studies, and Chernobyl liquidator studies.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In the pooled analyses described above, there was a decrease in risk of thyroid cancer with increasing age of exposure, with no demonstrable risk found above an exposure age of approximately 20 years [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In adult survivors exposed to atomic bomb fallout, the risk appears to depend on the endpoint used for the estimate. For thyroid cancers ≥10 mm, no statistically significant risk was evident [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. For papillary microcarcinomas (&lt;10 mm) identified in autopsy specimens, a dose-response relationship was found (estimated excess odds ratio/Gy 0.57, 95% CI 0.01-1.55) [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Some evidence of a risk from adult exposure comes from a study of 107 thyroid cancer cases and 423 controls among Chernobyl liquidators. The median thyroid dose was estimated to be 69 mGy, and the observed, excess relative risk (RR) at 100 mGy was 1.38 (95% CI 1.10-2.09) [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. However, studies of Chernobyl liquidators are susceptible to ascertainment bias.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7803546"><span class="h3">High-dose exposure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>High-dose exposure in childhood increases the risk of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].

Even though radiation can cause the entire range of possible mutations, those resulting in breakage and rejoining of the DNA chain are most important [<a href="#rid36">36,37</a>].</p><p>These assumptions about radiation carcinogenesis are supported by work on the papillary thyroid cancers found in children in the aftermath of the nuclear power plant accident at Chernobyl in 1986 [<a href="#rid37">37-39</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In some papillary thyroid cancers, a translocation of the <em>RET</em> gene occurs, resulting in its constitutive expression and activation; this gene is not expressed in normal thyroid cells. The <em>RET</em> translocation has been found in a higher proportion of Chernobyl-related cancers than those not associated with radiation. Similarly, the frequency of <em>RET</em> translocations is increased in thyroid cancer cases associated with external radiation treatment for benign and malignant conditions [<a href="#rid40">40,41</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The specificity of <em>RET</em> and other translocations is illustrated by the observation that point mutations in the <em>BRAF</em> gene, the other common genetic driver in papillary thyroid cancer, are rarely found in radiation-related cases [<a href="#rid42">42,43</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7819.html" rel="external">"Oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in thyroid nodules and nonmedullary thyroid cancer", section on 'Papillary thyroid cancer'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The effects of radiation on these alterations is more pronounced at younger ages of exposure. Proliferative activity of normal human thyroid cells decreases with increasing age [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. This could explain, in part, the higher risk of radiation-related thyroid cancer in children rather than adults. Some people may have increased susceptibility to radiation effects related to a polymorphism upstream to the <em>FOXE1</em> (TTF-2) gene on chromosome 9q22 [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. In a large study of people with Chernobyl-related thyroid cancers, three polymorphisms have been tentatively identified, including at 9q22, as associated with this susceptibility [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Thus far, it is not clear whether radiation-related papillary thyroid cancers containing translocations behave differently from cancers without them. Also, it is still not possible to use patterns of somatic mutations to distinguish radiation-related from sporadic thyroid cancers [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1937510"><span class="h1">APPROACH TO THE PATIENT WITH A HISTORY OF THYROID RADIATION EXPOSURE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H185791528"><span class="h2">Who might benefit from surveillance?</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Individuals with a childhood history of therapeutic radiation exposure to the neck region (<strong>high dose</strong>) or environmental radiation exposure (<strong>low dose</strong>) are candidates for long-term surveillance for thyroid cancer.

In retrospect, this was in keeping with guidelines for its use as the thyroid radiation doses were almost universally below the threshold levels. In large part, this was due to keeping radioiodine out of the food chain, in contrast with Chernobyl. This substantial mitigation of the dose has led to a reconsideration of when and how to use potassium iodide following an accident [<a href="#rid92">92</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H137003329"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a class="local">'Radiation exposure'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>External radiation</strong> – External radiation includes therapeutic radiation for the treatment of cancer or historical use of external radiation to treat a wide variety of nonmalignant conditions. Cranial, nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, neck, cervical spine, upper chest, mantle, mediastinal, and total body irradiation expose the thyroid to sufficient radiation to increase the risk of radiation-related disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Internal radiation</strong> – Internal radiation exposure may be due to ingestion of foods or liquids contaminated with radioactivity or by inhalation of radioactive gases or particles. Exposure may be due to nuclear fallout from testing and accidents at operating nuclear power plants, or above ground nuclear explosive testing.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Magnitude of exposure</strong> – The risk of thyroid cancer is related to age (greater for children exposed early in life) and radiation dose to the neck  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105234" href="/z/d/graphic/105234.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).

(See <a class="local">'Approach to the patient with a history of thyroid radiation exposure'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Physical examination</strong> – Annual thyroid examination as part of routine clinical care for all patients with low-dose or high-dose exposure during childhood. (See <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Thyroid function tests</strong> – Annual thyroid function testing for all patients with high-dose exposure during childhood. For patients with radiation confined to the neck area alone, measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is sufficient. For patients with a history of cranial or nasopharyngeal irradiation (who are at risk for both thyroid nodules and central hypothyroidism), we measure TSH and free thyroxine (T4). (See <a class="local">'Surveillance for functional thyroid abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Thyroid ultrasound</strong> – Use of thyroid ultrasound to detect nonpalpable nodules in radiation-exposed patients is controversial. In the absence of data, the use of surveillance ultrasonography should be individualized, guided by shared clinical decision-making after an assessment of each patient's risk factors, as well as a discussion regarding the harms and benefits of ultrasound screening. (See <a class="local">'Surveillance for structural thyroid abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thyroid surveillance, adult exposure</strong> – Individuals with high- or low-dose exposure as adults are at lower risk of thyroid cancer than those exposed as children, and there is no convincing rationale for thyroid cancer screening beyond routine medical care. Such patients with high-dose exposure should be monitored annually for hypothyroidism. (See <a class="local">'Who might benefit from surveillance?'</a> above and <a class="local">'Surveillance for functional thyroid abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong> – The clinical characteristics, evaluation, and management of radiation-related thyroid nodules (discovered by palpation or through ultrasound screening) are similar to those of thyroid nodules in nonexposed patients. Patients with radiation-related thyroid cancer should be treated in the same way as nonexposed patients with thyroid cancer. (See <a class="local">'Management'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7890.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to and treatment of thyroid nodules"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prevention of radiation-related thyroid disease</strong> – In the event of a nuclear accident, potassium iodide tablets can decrease thyroid uptake of radioiodine. Potassium iodide can almost completely protect the thyroid if administered within 12 hours <strong>before</strong> radioiodine exposure or up to two hours after; after two hours, the degree of protection declines (80, 40, and 7 percent after 2, 8, and 24 hours, respectively).
