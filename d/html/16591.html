Most cases have an NK cell phenotype, but a small minority are derived from cytotoxic T cells. The tumor cells are latently infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). ENKL was formerly called lethal midline granuloma or angiocentric lymphoma.</p><p>ENKL causes vascular damage and tissue destruction. It usually presents in the upper aerodigestive tract (nasopharynx), but it may also involve other extranodal sites (extranasal ENKL). </p><p>The topic discusses the treatment of ENKL.</p><p>The clinical presentation, pathologic features, and diagnosis of ENKL are presented separately.

(See <a class="local">'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p>ENKL is classified as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Localized disease</strong> – Localized disease includes nasal ENKL with stage I and contiguous stage II disease.

For patients presenting with non-nasal lesions, it is important to exclude occult nasal involvement (by examination, endoscopy, random biopsies, and imaging, as described above) to substantiate the diagnosis of extranasal ENKL [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1441644809"><span class="h1">PROGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prognostic index of natural killer lymphoma (PINK) and PINK-E systems are useful for assessment of prognosis in patients with ENKL. The CNS-PINK model has been created to predict risk for central nervous system (CNS) recurrence of ENKL. (See <a class="local">'Prognostic scoring systems'</a> below.)</p><p>Assessment of prognosis is an aid in pretreatment discussion of goals of care. (See <a class="local">'Goals of care'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4008682217"><span class="h2">Prognostic factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prognosis is largely related to the location and stage of disease at diagnosis. Numerous studies, using various treatment approaches, have reported that localized disease is associated with better outcomes than advanced disease [<a href="#rid8">8-14</a>]. In general, the prognosis of ENKL, nasal type is superior to that of ENKL, non-nasal type [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Some studies have identified performance status, presence of constitutional symptoms, and other clinical or biochemical features as prognostic factors, but these models were generally based on therapies that would not currently be considered optimal [<a href="#rid1">1,14-16</a>]. </p><p>Other risk factors for inferior outcomes in patients with ENKL include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) – Levels of EBV in the plasma or bone marrow correlate with patient outcomes and may serve as an indirect measure of tumor burden. As an example, in a prospective study of 69 patients with localized ENKL treated with primary radiation therapy (RT), with or without chemotherapy, patients with pretreatment plasma EBV DNA levels &gt;500 copies/mL had lower estimated three-year progression-free survival (PFS; 52 versus 79 percent) and overall survival (OS; 66 versus 97 percent) compared with patients with lower levels of EBV DNA [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. After completing therapy, patients with undetectable EBV DNA had higher estimated rates of three-year PFS (78 versus 51 percent) and OS (92 versus 70 percent) than patients with detectable EBV DNA. In a study of patients treated with SMILE chemotherapy, those with high pretreatment plasma EBV DNA levels (&gt;100,000 copies/mL) showed lower response to SMILE, poorer prognosis, and a higher rate of adverse events [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Other studies also report an association between EBV biomarkers and adverse outcomes [<a href="#rid19">19-21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other biomarkers – A retrospective study identified elevated serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor as a strong predictor of short OS and PFS [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. In other studies, expression of cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) or cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), and loss of expression of granzyme B protease inhibitor 9 (PI9) have each been associated with worse outcomes [<a href="#rid23">23-25</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1344366522"><span class="h2">Prognostic scoring systems</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Useful prognostic scoring systems for ENKL are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prognostic index of natural killer lymphoma (PINK) </strong>– PINK is a prognostic index for ENKL useful for patients treated with non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. In a retrospective analysis of 527 patients, the following were identified as adverse prognostic factors: age &gt;60 years, stage III or stage IV disease, distant lymph node involvement, and non-nasal type disease. PINK assigns one point for each risk factor and stratified patients into three risk groups, with different rates of three-year OS:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Low risk (0 point) – 81 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Intermediate risk (1 point) – 62 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>High risk (≥2 points) – 25 percent</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>PINK-E</strong> – EBV DNA (detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) was identified as an additional adverse prognostic factor, in a subset of 328 patients in the above study who had data for EBV DNA [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. PINK-E (for patients with EBV DNA data) stratifies patients into three categories, with different rates of three-year OS:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Low risk (0 to 1 point) – 81 percent </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Intermediate risk (2 points) – 55 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>High risk (≥3 points) – 28 percent </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>CNS-PINK</strong> – The CNS-specific prognostic index (CNS-PINK) model was developed to assess risk of CNS involvement, based on the extent of extranodal involvement and the PINK score, using a training cohort of 399 patients and a validation cohort of 253 patients [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].
