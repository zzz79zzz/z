High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a life-threatening non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and the most common fatal manifestation of severe high-altitude illness [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>The pathophysiology, clinical presentation, treatment, and prevention of HAPE are reviewed here. Other forms of high-altitude illness are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/182.html" rel="external">"Acute mountain sickness and high-altitude cerebral edema"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/181.html" rel="external">"High-altitude illness: Physiology, risk factors, and general prevention"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6590.html" rel="external">"High-altitude disease: Unique pediatric considerations"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>HAPE is the abnormal accumulation of plasma and some red blood cells in the lung air sacs due to a breakdown in the pulmonary blood-gas barrier, triggered by hypobaric hypoxia. This breakdown develops from a number of maladaptive responses to the hypoxia encountered at higher altitudes, including poor ventilatory response, increased sympathetic tone, exaggerated and uneven pulmonary vasoconstriction (pulmonary hypertension), inadequate production of endothelial nitric oxide, overproduction of endothelin, and inadequate alveolar fluid clearance, many of which are genetically determined [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. The end result is a patchy accumulation of extravascular fluid in the alveolar spaces that impairs gas exchange and can, in severe cases, prove fatal.</p><p>Genetics clearly play an important role in the risk of HAPE, as suggested by the marked variability in individual susceptibility, the higher rates of recurrence among some individuals, familial groupings, and the pathophysiologic factors mentioned above. However, HAPE genetic studies are conflicting, and clear conclusions are elusive. Genes associated with HAPE have included those in the pathways for nitric oxide, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), heat shock protein (HSP 70), pulmonary surfactant proteins A1 and A2, aquaporin-5, and the BMPR2 gene that is associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension [<a href="#rid2">2,4,5</a>].</p><p>High mean pulmonary artery pressure, in excess of 35 to 40 mmHg, appears to be the initiating event. However, while elevated pulmonary artery pressure is essential for HAPE, this by itself is insufficient. The other essential factor is uneven vasoconstriction. Specific segmental and subsegmental capillary beds with relatively less vasoconstriction are disproportionately exposed to elevated microvascular pressures (&gt;20 mmHg) that arise from the elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure. This uneven vasoconstriction and regional overperfusion result in failure of the alveolar-capillary barrier and patchy pulmonary edema [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>As disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier progresses, high molecular weight proteins, cells, and fluid leak into the alveolar space. Eventually, basement endothelial and epithelial cell membranes are disrupted, leading to alveolar hemorrhage.</p><p>A striking feature of HAPE is the rapid reversibility of this process with descent or simply the administration of oxygen. Pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure drop immediately and return to normal within days after treatment or descent to low altitude.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>HAPE is divided into two types:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Classic HAPE, involving acute ascent of those normally residing at low altitude</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Re-entry HAPE, involving re-ascent of those normally residing at high altitude after a stay at low altitude</p><p></p><p>Another category has been suggested for children living at high altitude who develop pulmonary edema with respiratory infection but without a change in altitude [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>HAPE generally occurs above 2500 meters (8000 feet) and is uncommon below 3000 meters (10,000 feet) (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63999" href="/d/graphic/63999.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef50199" href="/d/graphic/50199.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. The risk depends upon individual susceptibility, altitude attained, rate of ascent, and time spent at high altitude. In those without a history of HAPE, the incidence is 0.2 percent with ascent to 4500 meters (14,800 feet) over four days but 6 percent when ascent occurs over one to two days. In those with a history of HAPE, recurrence is 60 percent with an ascent to 4500 meters over two days. At 5500 meters (18,000 feet), the incidence ranges between 2 and 15 percent, again depending upon rate of ascent.</p><p>Symptoms of acute mountain sickness develop in a high percentage of those with HAPE [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. HAPE and high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) may also occur concomitantly due to the severe hypoxemia of HAPE. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/182.html" rel="external">"Acute mountain sickness and high-altitude cerebral edema"</a>.)</p><p>Factors associated with an increased incidence of HAPE include male sex, cold ambient temperatures, pre-existing respiratory infection, and vigorous exertion [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Pre-existing conditions or anatomic abnormalities that lead to increased pulmonary blood flow, pulmonary hypertension, or increased pulmonary vascular reactivity may predispose to HAPE, even at altitudes below 2500 meters. These include pulmonary hypertension of any etiology, congenital absence of one pulmonary artery, and intracardiac shunts, such as atrial septal defects and ventricular septal defects.</p><p>A patent foramen ovale (PFO), in the setting of rising pulmonary vascular resistance during hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, may reverse the direction of blood flow, shunting blood from right to left and further exacerbating hypoxemia. PFO is four times more common among HAPE-susceptible individuals. Larger PFOs correlate directly with increased arterial hypoxemia and a trend toward an increased risk of developing HAPE. However, PFO does not cause a greater rise in pulmonary artery pressure [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Whether PFO contributes to HAPE or is merely a marker of increased vascular reactivity and susceptibility remains unknown. There is currently no indication for closing PFO in susceptible persons in hopes of preventing HAPE.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H163127937"><span class="h2">Presentation in adults</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3730939139"><span class="h3">Symptoms and signs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>HAPE generally begins with a subtle, nonproductive cough, and shortness of breath with exertion, often when walking uphill [<a href="#rid9">9,13</a>]. Such nonspecific symptoms are easily mistaken for a benign upper respiratory tract infection or attributed to normal breathlessness at high altitude or exhaustion. Initial symptoms typically appear two to four days after arrival at a new altitude. Occasionally, HAPE develops precipitously. This occurs more often at night or after severe exertion. HAPE almost never develops after a week at the same altitude.</p><p>As HAPE progresses, dyspnea becomes noticeable at rest and severe with any attempt at exertion. Even walking on a level surface becomes an effort. A cardinal clinical feature of HAPE is the early progression from dyspnea with exertion to dyspnea at rest. In about 50 percent of cases, HAPE is accompanied by acute mountain sickness [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/182.html" rel="external">"Acute mountain sickness and high-altitude cerebral edema"</a>.)</p><p>As symptoms progress, the cough can become productive of pink, frothy sputum and may produce frank blood. Severely restricted exercise tolerance becomes debilitating, and severe hypoxemia may become life threatening without prompt descent or supplemental oxygen. Severe hypoxemia may cause drowsiness or concomitant high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE).</p><p>On physical examination, tachycardia, tachypnea, and low-grade fever (up to 38°C) are common. Inspiratory crackles may be more prominent in the right middle lobe initially but become bilateral and diffuse as HAPE progresses. Auscultation of the right middle lobe is best performed at the mid-lateral chest wall. Persons with blunted carotid body function, genetic or acquired (eg, carotid endarterectomy, neck radiation), may present without respiratory symptoms and instead with drowsiness, confusion, and other central nervous system symptoms and findings that might more commonly be associated with HACE.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4198938350"><span class="h3">Oxygen saturation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pulse oximetry reveals saturation values (SpO<sub>2</sub>) at least 10 points lower than expected for the altitude, and absolute values may be as low as 40 to 50 percent. Typically, the patient appears better than expected given the severity of hypoxemia, and the oxygen saturation improves promptly (usually within 10 to 15 minutes) in response to supplemental oxygen. This rapid correction of the SpO<sub>2</sub> and clinical status with supplemental oxygen in the setting of a severe infiltrative lung process seen on radiograph are virtually pathognomonic for HAPE, as this does not occur with other pulmonary processes (eg, pneumonia, acute decompensated heart failure) capable of causing such severe hypoxemia and associated with diffuse crackles or rhonchi.</p><p>Thus, pulse oximetry is often a useful tool for distinguishing HAPE from other conditions. However, expected SpO<sub>2</sub> values vary with a number of factors, including the altitude, degree and rate of acclimatization, patient's hypoxic ventilatory drive, and method of measurement (eg, variation among pulse oximeters); and therefore should be interpreted carefully. SpO<sub>2</sub> is lowest on the first day at high altitude and rises over four days to a near-maximum value, usually 3 to 5 points higher than day one. Although expected values can vary widely in normal individuals at any given altitude, comparing SpO<sub>2</sub> measurements with others in the same travel group who arrived at high altitude together can help to establish a relative "normal" range. The following figures provide approximate average values for SpO<sub>2</sub> and other parameters at a range of altitudes (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56808" href="/d/graphic/56808.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef98575" href="/d/graphic/98575.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Presentation in children</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In children, HAPE typically presents as increasing respiratory distress over one to two days but may develop more precipitously. Young children may manifest only pallor or cyanosis and depressed consciousness, though most will have tachypnea, hypoxemia, and crackles [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. In infants, increased pulmonary artery pressure and fetal shunting, without HAPE, can cause severe hypoxemia. (See <a class="local">'Pathophysiology'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6590.html" rel="external">"High-altitude disease: Unique pediatric considerations"</a>.)</p><p>HAPE alone does <strong>not</strong> cause an elevation in body temperature over 38.3°C (101°F), and young children with a higher temperature should be assessed for other causes of fever. Respiratory infection and HAPE can coexist. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6075.html" rel="external">"Fever without a source in children 3 to 36 months of age: Evaluation and management"</a>.)</p><p>The differential diagnosis in children includes pneumonia, undetected intracardiac shunts, and (in infants) opening of fetal shunts in response to high-altitude pulmonary hypertension. Some authors suggest that children who develop HAPE should be evaluated for structural heart problems [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5773.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology of left-to-right shunts"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5787.html" rel="external">"Isolated ventricular septal defects (VSDs) in infants and children: Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5754.html" rel="external">"Isolated atrial septal defects (ASDs) in children: Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5986.html" rel="external">"Community-acquired pneumonia in children: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">IMAGING STUDIES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H101254974"><span class="h2">Plain radiograph, computed tomography, and echocardiography</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As with acute mountain sickness and high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), the diagnosis of HAPE is based upon the history and physical examination. However, chest radiography is useful and reveals characteristic patchy alveolar infiltrates, predominantly in the right central hemithorax, which become more confluent and bilateral as the illness progresses (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80267" href="/d/graphic/80267.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). However, in some cases, the infiltrates may start in the left lung [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Rarely, the edema is entirely unilateral even when severe, which suggests a pulmonary artery agenesis or obstruction [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p>Although the radiographic appearance of HAPE may mimic that of infectious infiltrates, we often find a significant discrepancy between the extensive infiltrates on radiograph and the patient's clinical status. The patient with HAPE often does not appear as severely ill as one would expect based on the radiograph findings and steadily improves with oxygen therapy. In contrast, a patient with a comparable chest radiograph due to pneumonia typically appears critically ill and often requires tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.</p><p>Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, while rarely indicated, reveals a patchy lobular ground-glass appearance and consolidative opacities, reflecting heterogeneous alveolar filling (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67452" href="/d/graphic/67452.html" rel="external">image 2</a>). Echocardiography reveals increased pulmonary artery pressure and sometimes right heart dysfunction and paradoxical septal motion [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H101254987"><span class="h2">Ultrasound</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Observational studies suggest that ultrasonography is a highly sensitive and semi-quantitative means of detecting increased extravascular lung water [<a href="#rid18">18-20</a>]. If traditional chest radiography is unavailable (eg, at a remote clinic or in the field), chest sonography is a practical and useful tool for identifying HAPE.</p><p>In the appropriate clinical setting, namely ascent to high altitude by an unacclimatized person who develops typical signs and symptoms and an abnormally low oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), HAPE can be confirmed by the presence of ultrasound lung comets (ULCs) (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71143" href="/d/graphic/71143.html" rel="external">image 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef64485" href="/d/graphic/64485.html" rel="external">movie 1</a>). ULCs are sonographic artifacts originating from water-thickened interlobular septa fanning out from the lung surface. They are caused by the air-fluid interface in the presence of increased extravascular lung water. ULCs may be referred to as B-lines or "comet tails" and are the sonographic equivalent of radiographic Kerley B-lines, which are described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6979.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of diffuse lung disease by conventional chest radiography", section on 'Linear'</a>.)</p><p>While the quantity of ULCs corresponds closely to clinical and oximetry findings, it is not yet known what number of ULCs is an appropriate diagnostic threshold for HAPE, as opposed to subclinical pulmonary edema. Nevertheless, the technique for identifying ULCs is easily performed and may be useful in the proper clinical setting, such as when the cause of dyspnea is unclear despite a careful history and physical examination [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>].</p><p>Drawbacks to using ultrasound to diagnose HAPE include a lack of specificity and questions about its utility. Ultrasound cannot differentiate HAPE from cardiogenic pulmonary edema and other causes of increased extravascular lung water. In addition, ultrasound findings may not be clinically relevant at high altitude, as clinically insignificant ULCs are commonly seen in recreational climbers who are asymptomatic and do not develop HAPE [<a href="#rid22">22-24</a>]. Finally, ultrasound findings may not add to what is already known from examination findings and oximetry.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H101254908"><span class="h1">LABORATORY TESTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>No laboratory test demonstrates adequate specificity to aid in the diagnosis of HAPE. In patients with HAPE, the white blood cell count may be modestly elevated. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and related tests (eg, pro-BNP) may be slightly elevated at high altitudes, and troponin may be elevated in the setting of HAPE associated with right heart strain. However, such results are not helpful in distinguishing among potential diagnoses (eg, acute coronary syndrome, acute decompensated heart failure) and may not be elevated in the patient with HAPE. The results of other readily available tests are also nonspecific and unhelpful in diagnosing HAPE. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3510.html" rel="external">"Heart failure: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis in adults", section on 'Natriuretic peptide'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H163127988"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>HAPE is typically diagnosed clinically on the basis of the history and examination findings. The initial symptoms typically begin two to four days after arrival at high altitude and include a subtle nonproductive cough, shortness of breath on exertion, and difficulty walking uphill. Symptoms can develop more precipitously in children. Over one to two days, the cough often becomes productive. Early progression from dyspnea with exertion to dyspnea at rest is a cardinal feature. Prominent examination findings include tachycardia, tachypnea, low-grade fever (up to 38°C), and pulmonary crackles. Oxygen saturation is lower than expected for a given altitude. Treatment with supplemental oxygen and rest can lead to rapid improvement. Characteristic findings on imaging studies, when available and indicated, help to confirm the diagnosis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h1">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2481879695"><span class="h2">Diagnoses confused with HAPE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pneumonia heads the list of differential diagnoses that can be confused with HAPE, but others to consider include pulmonary embolism, acute decompensated heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, bronchitis, reactive airway disease, and exercise-associated hyponatremia [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>]. Of note, HAPE and infection can coexist. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7032.html" rel="external">"Clinical evaluation and diagnostic testing for community-acquired pneumonia in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8261.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3497.html" rel="external">"Approach to diagnosis and evaluation of acute decompensated heart failure in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/52.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2290.html" rel="external">"Exercise-associated hyponatremia"</a>.)</p><p>Differentiating HAPE from such ailments as pneumonia or acute decompensated heart failure can be difficult, particularly in older patients with comorbid conditions. In such patients, HAPE is a diagnosis of exclusion, and alternative diagnoses should be worked up in standard fashion. HAPE is associated with marked weakness and often severe hypoxemia (oxygen saturation [SpO<sub>2</sub>] of 50 to 75 percent; partial pressure of oxygen [PaO<sub>2</sub>] of 25 to 40 mmHg). While ill appearing, such patients with HAPE generally look better than would be expected given their extreme hypoxemia and improve rapidly with supplemental oxygen therapy.</p><p>More commonly, the diagnosis of HAPE is entertained in otherwise healthy patients with a characteristic history and examination findings. Rapid response over one to two hours of oxygen therapy strongly suggests the diagnosis of HAPE in this setting.

The presence of marked hypoxemia (common with HAPE), extensive infiltrates on chest radiograph, and modest elevations of the white blood cell count (10,000 to 15,000/microL) frequently influence clinicians treating HAPE to administer empiric antibiotics for the possibility of concomitant bacterial pneumonia. While the decision to treat HAPE with empiric antibiotics based on such concerns remains clinical and subjective, many cases of pneumonia (when in fact present) in this setting are of viral etiology and do <strong>not</strong> warrant antibiotic administration.</p><p>There is little published, high-quality evidence that can help to distinguish reliably between isolated HAPE and HAPE with concomitant pneumonia, but a number of clinical findings can provide some insight. Purulent sputum (particularly if a properly performed gram stain is positive for bacteria), temperature &gt;38°C (100.5°F), elevated white blood cell count (&gt;15,000/microL with a left shift, ie, predominately bands), elevated procalcitonin (&gt;0.25 mcg/L) or highly elevated C-reactive protein, positive polymerase chain reaction respiratory panel, and a history of respiratory tract infection in the two to three days preceding the development of HAPE are consistent with an infectious process, and the authors believe that treatment with empiric antibiotics is appropriate in this setting.</p><p>Conversely, in otherwise healthy patients with a characteristic history of HAPE and examination findings consistent with the diagnosis, antibiotics are typically not necessary. In such cases, a rapid response over several hours to oxygen therapy strongly suggests the diagnosis of HAPE. In contrast, symptoms and signs of pneumonia require several days before clinical improvement. Rapid improvement with descent to lower altitude is another important diagnostic clue suggesting the diagnosis of HAPE without pneumonia.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h1">TREATMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">General approach to treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Early recognition of HAPE and prompt intervention are critical to assuring a favorable outcome [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Unlike high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), immediate descent is not mandatory in all treatment settings. Instead, treatment of HAPE varies depending upon a number of factors, including severity of illness, available treatments, setting, clinician experience, and patient preference. As examples, management of a resort skier at 2500 meters may consist solely of supplemental oxygen and rest, while management of a mountaineer camping in a remote location at 5500 meters and without access to supplemental oxygen requires immediate descent.</p><p>The key principle in successful treatment of HAPE, regardless of the setting or patient age, is prompt reduction of pulmonary artery pressure. Means to achieve this end include limiting physical exertion and cold exposure, providing supplemental oxygen via tank or concentrator, and, when indicated, evacuation to a lower altitude or simulating descent using hyperbaric therapy. Descent (simulated or actual), supplemental oxygen, or the two combined are effective and appear to be superior to any pharmacologic therapy.</p><p>Because of ethical considerations, no trials have been performed in patients with HAPE that directly compare treatment with oxygen and descent versus pharmacologic therapy alone. In the one uncontrolled study in which <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9700" href="/d/drug information/9700.html" rel="external">nifedipine</a> alone was used for treatment, clinical outcomes were poor relative to those reported in studies where treatment consisted of oxygen and descent without medications [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. Nevertheless, if supplemental oxygen is unavailable and descent difficult or impossible, medication could be lifesaving [<a href="#rid2">2,30</a>].</p><p>When oxygen and/or descent are employed, the addition of medication may not be necessary. In a trial with 113 HAPE patients, adding <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9700" href="/d/drug information/9700.html" rel="external">nifedipine</a> to descent and oxygen provided no additional benefit [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. In a trial performed with the Indian military, 153 HAPE patients showed no additional benefit from either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a> or nifedipine given with oxygen compared with those treated with oxygen alone [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Nonpharmacologic interventions</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Oxygen</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Supplemental oxygen is first-line therapy for HAPE and should be provided in all treatment settings when available [<a href="#rid34">34-37</a>].

Supplemental oxygen immediately increases partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) and reduces both the heart and respiratory rates.</p><p>Based on the authors' field experience, when supplies are limited, low-flow oxygen given for a longer duration is preferable to high flow and short duration. Supplemental oxygen combined with descent (or hyperbaric therapy) is the ideal treatment. </p><p>In the hospital setting, supplemental oxygen and rest are generally sufficient therapy [<a href="#rid34">34,37</a>]. A common regimen in North American hospitals near ski resorts (elevation approximately 2500 to 3000 meters) is to treat with high-flow supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula or face mask for several hours until the patient's oxygen requirement is ≤3 L/min, with the oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) maintained at 90 percent or higher. If the patient is clinically improved and appropriate for outpatient therapy, they may be sent home with an oxygen concentrator to be used continuously and strict instructions to rest. The patient's condition and SpO<sub>2</sub> are rechecked daily until an ambulatory SpO<sub>2</sub>, measured while the patient breathes room air, is ≥90 percent. The usual duration of oxygen therapy is two to three days. At this point, supplemental oxygen can be discontinued. The patient is advised to return to activity <strong>gradually</strong> over the following one to three days. Descent is not mandatory but is always an option in this setting.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h3">Rest and warmth</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Strenuous physical exertion and cold stress both elevate pulmonary artery pressure and can exacerbate HAPE. Thus, limiting exertion and avoiding exposure to cold are fundamental aspects of treatment. A patient with HAPE, for example, should not carry a pack while descending. The role of bedrest is unclear. A study with 36 patients with mild to moderate re-entry HAPE at 3750 meters in Peru showed that while bedrest alone resulted in complete recovery, bedrest with oxygen was more effective [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. Most subsequent studies have used the combination of bedrest and oxygen [<a href="#rid32">32,33,36</a>].

HAPE can progress rapidly, and the opportunity for evacuation may be lost if there is delay. At higher elevations (&gt;4000 meters), descent is mandatory, in part because of the risk of developing HACE. Ideally, immediate evacuation is undertaken to a hospital below 3000 meters that is capable of providing high-flow oxygen.</p><p>Nevertheless, in practice, scores of HAPE patients are treated successfully in remote clinics or base camps with modest descent and rest, sometimes in combination with portable hyperbaric therapy, low-flow supplemental oxygen, and medication. Many remote clinics are located only 500 to 1000 meters below the elevation of HAPE onset. When HAPE is diagnosed early and treated in the manner described, many climbers go on to reascend slowly after three days or more of recovery [<a href="#rid38">38</a>].

The incidence depends upon individual susceptibility, altitude attained, rate of ascent, and time spent at high altitude. Symptoms of acute mountain sickness develop in approximately 50 percent of those with HAPE. High-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) may occur concomitantly. (See <a class="local">'Pathophysiology'</a> above and <a class="local">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/182.html" rel="external">"Acute mountain sickness and high-altitude cerebral edema"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Pre-existing conditions or anatomic abnormalities that lead to increased pulmonary blood flow, pulmonary hypertension, or increased pulmonary vascular reactivity may predispose to HAPE, even at altitudes below 2500 meters. Such conditions include pulmonary hypertension of any etiology and intracardiac shunts, such as atrial septal defects and ventricular septal defects. Additional risk factors are described in the text. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical presentation in adults</strong> – HAPE generally begins with a subtle, nonproductive cough, shortness of breath with exercise, and difficulty walking uphill. Symptoms typically appear two to four days after arrival at higher altitude. As HAPE progresses, dyspnea becomes noticeable at rest and severe with any attempt at exertion. Tachycardia, tachypnea, and low-grade fever are common. A cardinal clinical feature of HAPE is the progression from dyspnea with exertion to dyspnea at rest over a relatively brief period. Oxygen saturation values are at least 10 points below normal for altitude and usually range from 50 to 75 percent. (See <a class="local">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical presentation in children</strong> – In children, HAPE presents as increasing respiratory distress over one to two days but may develop more precipitously. Young children may manifest only pallor and depressed consciousness or other nonspecific symptoms.

(See <a class="local">'Presentation in children'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic imaging</strong> – Chest radiography usually reveals characteristic patchy alveolar infiltrates, predominantly in the right central hemithorax, which become more confluent and bilateral as the illness progresses. A significant discrepancy often exists between the extensive infiltrates on radiograph and the clinical status of the patient, who often does not appear severely ill and steadily improves with oxygen therapy. Ultrasound can detect increased extravascular lung water, which can help to confirm the diagnosis of HAPE. Other commonly available tests are nonspecific.

In such patients, HAPE is a diagnosis of exclusion. In general, HAPE is associated with marked weakness and hypoxemia that is more severe than that associated with most cases of pneumonia. Rapid improvement over hours in response to oxygen therapy or descent strongly suggests the diagnosis of HAPE.

In the hospital setting, supplemental oxygen and rest are generally sufficient treatment. In remote high-altitude settings, descent should begin as soon as HAPE is suspected. Adjunctive medical therapies may be helpful and are discussed in the text. (See <a class="local">'Pharmacologic interventions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prophylaxis</strong> – For patients with no history of medical problems at high altitude, the risk of HAPE is low, and routine prophylaxis is not warranted. We suggest prophylaxis with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9700" href="/d/drug information/9700.html" rel="external">nifedipine</a>, rather than other pharmacologic therapy (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a>), for individuals with a history of HAPE or with known predisposing factors who must ascend to altitudes above 2500 meters without adequate time for acclimatization (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). In such circumstances, we give nifedipine (30 mg of a slow-release formulation every 12 hours). Additional adjunct medications for prophylaxis are discussed in the text.
