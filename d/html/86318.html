         Epithelial cancers of ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal origin exhibit similar clinical characteristics and behavior. As such, these are often combined together and define epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) in clinical trials and clinical practice. This topic will consider all three histologies under the heading EOC.
        </p>
        <p>
         EOC is the most common cause of death among women with gynecologic malignancies and the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States. Approximately 75 percent of women have stage III (disease that has spread throughout the peritoneal cavity or that involves lymph nodes) or stage IV (disease spread to more distant sites) disease at diagnosis. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3238.html" rel="external">
          "Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Clinical features and diagnosis"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         For most patients, EOC is treated surgically and followed by adjuvant platinum- and taxane-based chemotherapy. However, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) prior to definitive surgery is an alternative option in selected patients. This topic will review the rationale and administration of NACT for EOC. Other relevant topics in the treatment of EOC include:

         NACT refers to the administration of systemic therapy before surgery. Typically, three to four cycles of NACT are administered, after which resectability is assessed by imaging  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131639" href="/z/d/graphic/131639.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). For those who are candidates, interval cytoreduction is performed, followed subsequently by further cycles of chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting. For those who do not have resectable disease after the initial cycles of NACT, primary medical therapy is offered, without surgery.
        </p>
        <p>
         The goal of NACT is to reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality and increase the likelihood of a complete resection of disease at the time of cytoreductive surgery. Despite the potentially improved surgical outcomes that result from NACT, clinical studies have shown that survival is not improved with NACT followed by surgery versus standard surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3

          OUTCOMES RELATIVE TO PRIMARY DEBULKING SURGERY

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Available data suggest that for selected women with stage III or IV EOC, NACT and interval cytoreduction, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy are similar to primary cytoreduction and adjuvant chemotherapy, with respect to overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), and are associated with less perioperative morbidity and mortality [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In a Cochrane review including three randomized trials enrolling 1521 women with stage III/IV ovarian cancer, those randomly assigned to NACT followed by debulking surgery experienced a similar OS as those assigned to primary debulking surgery followed by chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.95, 95% CI 0.84-1.07) [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Among four randomized trials evaluating PFS in such women, results for PFS were also similar between the groups (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87-1.07). NACT was, however, associated with lower postoperative mortality (relative risk 0.18, 95% CI 0.06-0.54). Rates of infection, need for stoma formation, and bowel resection were also lower in the NACT group. Similar results were seen in the phase III SCORPION trial [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         NACT also permits the assessment of the effectiveness of chemotherapy prior to surgery, which may help to inform subsequent treatment. Patients who progress on NACT are unlikely to benefit from surgery because of intrinsically chemoresistant disease.

         Those with advanced EOC (eg, stage IIIC or IV) with clinically apparent, unresectable disease who are unlikely to become complete or optimally cytoreduced (ie, no residual cancer or &lt;10 mm of residual disease at the end of surgery, respectively) if taken to the operating room at the time of presentation [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5

         ]. (See

         Those with EOC (of any stage) who are initially poor operative candidates, but who are likely to tolerate surgery after chemotherapy.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         For those who are unlikely to tolerate surgery at any point due to poor functional status, we proceed with chemotherapy alone, with the goal of tumor control. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3239.html" rel="external">
          "First-line chemotherapy for advanced (stage III or IV) epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Attempts to identify the subset of patients most likely to benefit from NACT are under active investigation [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. For example, an exploratory analysis that included patients treated on the European Organisation and Research for the Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 55971 trial sought to determine if baseline characteristics could identify patients most appropriate to undergo NACT rather than primary surgery [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Women with stage IV disease had higher five-year overall survival rates following NACT compared with primary surgery (22 versus 5 percent, respectively). However, other markers including age, performance status, tumor grade, and histology did not suggest a benefit from NACT versus primary surgery, or vice versa. These data suggest that clinical features could help define those patients most likely to benefit from NACT. Further data are required.

         The decision on whether to proceed with NACT is based on the clinical status of the patient and whether or not disease is resectable at the time of presentation. Therefore, all patients require clinical staging. At our institution, this requires baseline imaging (eg, computed tomography [CT] of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis) to determine if the disease is resectable or not, and possible diagnostic laparoscopy.

         It is often difficult to preoperatively assess whether women with advanced EOC can be optimally cytoreduced at the time of primary surgery [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, for women with stage III or IV EOC in whom it is not clear if complete cytoreduction is possible, we obtain a diagnostic laparoscopy to visually assess for resectability. If the surgeon conducting the assessment feels disease is resectable, primary surgery should be performed. If complete resectability is unlikely, NACT can be administered.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a meta-analysis of 18 studies (including 1563 participants), including one randomized trial, laparoscopic assessment suggested that disease was suitable for optimal debulking (no macroscopic residual disease or residual disease &lt;1 cm) in approximately 70 to 100 percent of women [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. In the two studies in which all women underwent surgery irrespective of laparoscopy findings, none of the women with laparoscopy suggestive of unresectable disease subsequently experienced optimal debulking (ie, there were no false-positive laparoscopies).
        </p>
        <p>
         Guidelines to determine the accuracy of laparoscopic assessment for primary debulking have been developed [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. This scoring system assigned a score of 2 (positive/extensive) or 0 (absence/limited) to the following factors:

        <p>
         The reported accuracy of debulkability of these factors ranged from 82 (bowel infiltration) to 94 percent (omental caking). In a prospective validation of this assessment, a score of 8 or higher resulted in a zero probability of optimal resection, and such patients should be advised to proceed with NACT.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, some women have suboptimal primary debulking surgery, despite laparoscopy predicting optimal debulking. Complete cytoreduction does not solely depend upon the patient's and tumor's characteristics, but also depends on surgical expertise and an institution's infrastructure. In multidisciplinary cancer centers with advanced expertise in gynecologic oncology, optimal debulking rates in excess of 70 percent have been reported even for patients with bulky stage IIIC disease (ie, patients with evidence of abdominal metastases ≥20 mm preoperatively) [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15

         ]. We strongly advocate that a gynecologic oncologist be involved in surgical decision-making and treatment in these circumstances.

        <p>
         Despite the potential benefit of diagnostic laparoscopy, some experts prefer to proceed with neoadjuvant treatment in patients who appear to have unresectable disease based on imaging alone. In patients who do not have a laparoscopy, either a CT-guided biopsy or cytology must be obtained before beginning treatment to confirm Müllerian malignancy.

         Patients with disease progression at any point, as well as those who have had an insufficient response after three cycles of therapy for optimal cytoreduction to be feasible, represent a group with chemoresistant disease. Subsequent surgery is likely to introduce morbidity with unclear benefit. As such, we treat these patients with medical therapy similar to the treatment of women with platinum-resistant EOC and typically do not pursue surgical options. However, we recognize that the approach in such situations is variable, and that other experts consider further rounds of neoadjuvant treatment and re-evaluation for surgery for those who have had some response to NACT [

         Definitive surgical cytoreduction after NACT is attempted if there is a reasonable chance of resecting macroscopic tumor (preferred goal) or at least of achieving an optimal cytoreduction (ie, &lt;10 mm residual disease), preferably gauged by a surgeon with training in gynecologic oncology [

In the intention-to-treat analysis, at a median follow-up of 4.7 years, fewer patients had died in the HIPEC group (50 versus 62 percent). The HIPEC group had a longer median recurrence-free survival (14 versus 11 months; HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.48-0.83) and median overall survival (45 versus 33 months; HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53-0.92) [

         In a separate trial, among 184 patients with stage III or IV ovarian cancer who underwent primary cytoreductive surgery or interval cytoreductive surgery after NACT, with &lt;1 cm residual tumor, HIPEC versus control resulted in similar progression-free survival (PFS; 20 versus 19 months, respectively) [

However, in the subgroup of 77 patients who had interval cytoreductive surgery after NACT, HIPEC improved median PFS and overall survival relative to control (median PFS 30 versus 24 months, HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37-0.99; median overall survival 62 versus 48 months, HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.29-0.96). This study had several limitations, including the small sample size, particularly in the subgroup who got interval cytoreduction after NACT; moreover, enrollment in the trial was not stratified by primary or interval cytoreductive surgery, and there may have been possible imbalance between the groups. The 2018 trial, designed specifically to evaluate HIPEC at the time of interval cytoreduction after NACT, provides stronger support for its use [

         Although there are now two randomized trials showing an advantage when HIPEC is used at the time of interval cytoreduction, the technical expertise required for peritoneal stripping and subsequent HIPEC may limit its application in many centers. In addition, it is still not clear if the additional dose of chemotherapy, the IP administration, or the heating was responsible for the benefit [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21

         While we typically treat women who have received NACT with adjuvant IV therapy due to toxicity considerations, intravenous (IV)/intraperitoneal (IP) treatment may be an appropriate alternative for a select group of patients. For example, we may offer IV/IP treatment after interval cytoreduction to patients who received NACT due to a high initial preoperative risk and subsequently underwent optimal cytoreduction (eg, for a patient who presented with a large pulmonary embolism, which was subsequently treated). However, we would rarely utilize IV/IP therapy for patients who underwent neoadjuvant treatment due to extensive extra-abdominal disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although several adjuvant therapy trials have suggested improvements with IV/IP chemotherapy over IV chemotherapy in patients with optimally debulked disease, data are mixed [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24-27
         </a>
         ], and there are only limited data to inform the benefits and risks of adjuvant IV/IP treatment in women who received NACT prior to surgery. The phase II OV21/PETROC study evaluated IV versus IV/IP therapy, but did not show conclusive differences between the two approaches [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. In this study, approximately 200 women who had been treated with NACT and underwent an optimal cytoreduction were randomly assigned to a 21-day cycle regimen consisting of IV
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9202" href="/z/d/drug information/9202.html" rel="external">
          carboplatin

          paclitaxel
         </a>
         (administered on days 1 and 8) or to IP carboplatin plus IV/IP paclitaxel. There was a trend towards improved progression-free survival (PFS) at nine months among those receiving IV paclitaxel/IP carboplatin compared with those receiving IV treatment only (25 versus 39 percent), but this was not statistically significant. Although the trial was not powered to detect differences in median survival, IV paclitaxel/IP carboplatin was associated with nonsignificant trends in improved median PFS (13 versus 11 months) and overall survival (59 versus 38 months).
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, it remains unclear whether IV/IP therapy should be standard treatment for patients who have received neoadjuvant treatment and optimal cytoreduction, particularly given mixed results from previous studies regarding its tolerability in this subset of patients [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29-31
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, OV21/PETROC was a phase II study, and there is no planned phase III study underway, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions regarding relative efficacy. Finally, rather than a dose-dense or every-three-week schedule of

         Overall, available data suggest that IP chemotherapy after NACT is feasible, although they are not definitive. Still, on the basis of these results, IV/IP treatment appears to be a reasonable alternative in select women who undergo optimal cytoreduction following NACT. Further discussion on the role of IP therapy for EOC among patients who did not receive neoadjuvant treatment is discussed separately. (See

          Overview and rationale
         </strong>
         – Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) refers to the administration of systemic therapy before definitive surgery. The goal of NACT is to reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality and increase the likelihood of a complete resection of disease at the time of cytoreductive surgery. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Overview and rationale'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Patient selection
         </strong>
         – For patients with clinically apparent, unresectable epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) who are unlikely to undergo optimal cytoreduction, we offer NACT  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131639" href="/z/d/graphic/131639.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). We also offer NACT to patients with EOC who are poor operative candidates because of medical comorbidities or a poor performance status, but who are likely to tolerate surgery after chemotherapy  (

         ). (See

         <strong>
          Role of diagnostic laparoscopy
         </strong>
         – For women with stage III or IV EOC in whom it is not clear if complete cytoreduction is possible, we obtain a diagnostic laparoscopy to determine resectability. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Role of diagnostic laparoscopy'

         <strong>
          Choice of chemotherapy
         </strong>
         – For women who will undergo NACT, we suggest intravenous (IV) platinum-based chemotherapy rather than other regimens (

          Assessment while on NACT and next steps
         </strong>
         – Although there are no formal guidelines regarding the ideal assessment strategy for women receiving NACT, in our practice we perform serial evaluations, which consist of an interim history and physical examination, complete blood count, serum chemistries (including liver and renal function tests), and cancer antigen (CA) 125 measurement prior to the start of each cycle. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Choice of regimen'

         We evaluate for treatment response after three NACT cycles.
        </p>

         We proceed with a surgical cytoreduction in patients in whom there is a chance of resecting all residual disease (or achieving an optimal cytoreduction). We advocate for this procedure to be performed by a fellowship trained gynecologic oncology surgeon.

         </span>
         For patients who undergo NACT and subsequently have an optimal surgical result (ie, residual disease &lt;1 cm), we suggest HIPEC at the time of cytoreduction (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">
          Grade 2B
         </a>
         ), provided that technical expertise is available. Omission of HIPEC is also acceptable, particularly in centers lacking the appropriate expertise or resources. (See

         </span>
         For patients who experience disease progression during NACT, or continue to be unlikely to have an optimal cytoreduction after three cycles of NACT, we suggest medical therapy (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ), rather than further rounds of NACT followed by surgery. We utilize a regimen similar to the treatment of women with platinum-refractory EOC. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3240.html" rel="external">
          "Medical treatment for relapsed epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer: Platinum-resistant disease"

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent3">
         However, other experts consider further rounds of neoadjuvant treatment and re-evaluation for surgery for those who have had some response to NACT.

          Treatment following surgery
         </strong>
         – Following surgery, we suggest adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy rather than no further treatment (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
