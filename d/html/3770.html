         Proper utilization of antiretroviral therapy (ART) requires ongoing patient monitoring to assess the therapeutic response and to identify adverse events related to chronic administration of medications. Failure to respond to a recommended ART regimen is almost always a result of suboptimal adherence or, less commonly, viral resistance.
        </p>

         This topic will focus on the approach to monitoring in patients receiving ART. Discussions related to selection and modification of ART, as well as primary care management of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are found elsewhere. (See

         Most patients who are started on antiretroviral therapy (ART) should have follow-up within four weeks of starting treatment; however, earlier follow up may be needed for those with advanced HIV disease, especially if they are being treated for a concurrent opportunistic infection. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         We review the patient's understanding of their regimen (eg, if there are any drug or food interactions that impact how the regimen is administered) as well as their adherence to the regimen and any adverse effects. We also do laboratory testing to monitor the virologic and immunologic response and for evidence of toxicity. (See
         <a class="local">
          'What to assess'
         </a>

         </span>
         After the initial visit, we typically see patients every three to six months, depending upon how they are tolerating their regimen and their virologic response. Once the patient is clinically stable on their regimen with viral suppression, visit frequency and laboratory testing can typically decrease to every six months thereafter. Some experts further reduce their visits to once yearly for select patients who have been stable for many years; however, this decision must be made on a case-by-case basis. (See

          'Frequency of monitoring'

        </p>
        <p>
         Some patients may require a change in their regimen due to side effects, concern for toxicity, a desire to simplify their regimen, or virologic failure. Additional follow-up is typically needed in these settings. (See

         Patient monitoring in those receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) primarily focuses on evaluating the efficacy (virologic and immunologic response) and the tolerability of the regimen as well as the patient's ability to take their medications as prescribed. Although immune activation and inflammation are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of certain long-term consequences of HIV infection (eg, non-AIDS-defining cancers, cardiovascular disease), these markers are not routinely monitored in clinical practice. (See

         Plasma HIV RNA should be measured in all patients at baseline and regularly during therapy since it is the most reliable indicator of response to ART and is useful in predicting clinical progression [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2

         ]. The goal of ART is viral load suppression below the limits of assay detection. The assays most commonly in use have lower limits of detection between 20 and 40 copies/mL. The time to achieve an undetectable viral load depends on the agents used in the regimen and the baseline viral load.

         When monitoring a patient's viral load on therapy, several terms are used. Clinicians should be proactive about defining what these terms mean to help avoid unnecessary anxiety and confusion when these terms are used.

          Virologic suppression
         </strong>
         – The term "virologic suppression" includes both a viral load that is "not detected" as well a viral load that is "detected, but is below the limit of quantification." The most commonly used assays have lower limits of detection between 20 and 40 copies/mL. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3743.html" rel="external">

        </p>

         It is important to clarify these terms to avoid concerns about potential virologic failure or transmission risk if the viral load is detected below the level of quantification.

         <strong>
          Undetectable viral load
         </strong>
         – The term "undetectable" can have different meanings depending upon the context (risk of HIV transmission versus efficacy of HIV ART).

         In the context of reducing the risk of transmission to others (popularized as "U=U" or undetectable = untransmittable), "undetectable" refers to a viral load that is &lt;200 copies/mL. In high quality clinical trials, HIV transmission has not been observed when individuals with HIV have a viral load &lt;200 copies/mL [

         However, for the purposes of monitoring the efficacy of ART, an undetectable viral load means that no virus is detected. (See

         In contrast to reducing the risk of transmission to others, persistent HIV RNA values below 200 copies/mL but above the lower limit of detection (ie, low-level viremia) may still indicate there is a potential risk of virologic failure. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Viral blips
         </strong>
         – Viral "blips" refer to an isolated low-level of detectable HIV RNA, typically 20 to 200 copies/mL, that occurs during long-term monitoring of patients with a suppressed viral load on ART (ie, HIV RNA below the limits of assay detection) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. Viral blips are not uncommon and in themselves do not indicate a risk of virologic failure [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9-11
         </a>
         ]. (See

         <strong>
          Persistent low-level viremia
         </strong>
         – Patients with persistent low-level viremia have persistent quantifiable viremia at a low copy count. We typically define persistent low-level viremia as a viral load between 20 and 200 copies/mL on two or more occasions spaced in time (generally more than one month apart). However, these terms are imprecisely defined in the literature, and HIV RNA values between 50 to 200, up to 500, or up to 1000 have variably been used as falling within this definition.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Patients with persistent low-level viremia likely represent a different population than those who experience a rare blip, described above. In addition, those with persistent low-level viremia may encompass two types of patients:

          Patients with optimal adherence
         </strong>
         – Patients with persistent low-level viremia despite optimal adherence typically have a high baseline viral load, representing a large HIV reservoir. In such patients, low-level viremia likely arises from periodic clonal expansion of long-lived cellular reservoirs of virus released into the blood and detected by viral load assays [

         <strong>
          Patients with intermittent adherence
         </strong>
         – In patients struggling with adherence, persistent low-level viremia may represent intermittent viral breakthrough due to subtherapeutic drug levels [

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Studies evaluating the risk of resistance in patients with low-level viremia are conflicting. Although available data suggest most patients with low-level viremia do not develop resistance [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,15
         </a>

         <a href="#rid16">
          16-18
         </a>

          Virologic failure

         We perform HIV RNA testing approximately four weeks after initiating ART and then at four- to eight-week intervals until the level falls below the assay's limit of detection (&lt;20 to 50 copies/mL by most commercial assays). Patients typically achieve viral suppression 8 to 12 weeks after ART initiation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Expected virologic response'

         <span class="glyph">
          •

         Once the viral load is below the level of detection, virologic monitoring can be performed every three to four months.

         <span class="glyph">

         If the viral load remains suppressed for one year, virologic monitoring can be reduced to every six months for those who are able to take their regimen as prescribed.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Patients who have a suboptimal decrease in viral load could be confused about how to take their regimen and/or be nonadherent. Thus, providers should talk with such patients to ensure they are taking their medications properly (eg, dosing, avoiding drug or food interactions) and counsel them on adherence.

         – For virologically suppressed individuals changing their ART regimen (eg, due to side effects or to reduce the risk of toxicity or frequency of dosing), HIV RNA should be monitored within two to eight weeks after a change is made to ensure viral suppression has been maintained [
         <a href="#rid7">

         For patients receiving injectable therapy after a stable switch from an oral regimen, visit frequency depends on the dosing interval (monthly or every-other-month). We generally pair clinician visits with patients' scheduled injections and see patients one to two months after switching to injectable therapy (at their visit for their second injection) and then every six months, paired with an injection visit.

         For those who switch regimens due to virologic failure, closer monitoring may be required. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         Our approach to virologic monitoring is generally in agreement with United States Guidelines (The United States Department of Health and Human Services [DHHS] and The International Antiviral Society-USA [IAS-USA] panels) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,19
         </a>
         ]. However, their recommendations for the frequency of monitoring vary slightly.
        </p>
        <p>
         The DHHS Panel recommends HIV load testing at two to eight weeks after initiating ART and then every four to eight weeks after that until the viral load falls below the assay's limit of detection [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. The viral load can then be measured every three to four months. The interval for viral load monitoring may be extended to every six months for adherent patients who have a suppressed viral load (ie, below the assay's level of detection) for more than a year.
        </p>
        <p>
         The IAS-USA expert panel recommends measurement of plasma HIV RNA within the first six weeks of starting ART and every three months after treatment is initiated until a nondetectable viral load is confirmed [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. The interval for viral load monitoring can be extended to every six months in patients with dependable adherence once the viral load has been suppressed for a year.

         Patients initiating ART should achieve substantial (2 log or more) viral load declines by weeks two to four of treatment, with anything less than this suggestive of poor adherence. The viral load should be near or below the level of detection by 8 to 24 weeks, regardless of prior treatment experience, with patients who start with the highest viral loads taking the longest to reach this threshold [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,19-24
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The speed of the viral load decline depends primarily upon the agents used in the regimen [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25-27
         </a>
         ]. The most rapid declines occur with integrase strand transfer inhibitor-based regimens; non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based therapies are intermediate, and protease inhibitor treatments are the slowest.
        </p>
        <p>
         Acute illness and vaccinations can cause a transient increase in the viral load. However, because of biologic variability, sequential HIV viral load measurements must exceed a threefold change or 0.5 log 10 copies/mL to be considered significantly different [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Unanticipated results should be verified with a repeat test before making changes in antiretroviral therapy.

          Viral blips

         – Most viral blips are not clinically significant and are thought to represent laboratory variation or release of virions from the viral reservoir not related to active viral replication [

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         If no concerning drug interactions are found and adherence is confirmed by self-report (and pharmacy refill information, if available), we simply repeat the test at the next scheduled monitoring visit. We do not modify antiretroviral treatment for patients who have a viral blip unless the viral load is sustained at &gt;200 copies/mL, at which point we also recommend sending a resistance genotype.

         There are two main causes for virologic failure: drug resistance and/or subtherapeutic drug levels. The latter is almost always due to problems adhering to the drug regimen, with less common causes being drug interactions or altered pharmacology due to host factors (eg, malabsorption). Detailed discussions of the evaluation and management of patients with virologic failure are presented separately and summarized below. (See

         – For patients who initiate ART at a CD4 count above 500 cells/microL, CD4 count monitoring is not needed if the viral load remains undetectable. While DHHS guidelines say that CD4 monitoring is optional after two years on ART with consistently suppressed viral load and a CD4 count &gt;500 cells/microL, they note that data have not shown clinical benefit to monitoring at higher CD4 counts [

         – In patients with low baseline CD4 counts (eg, &lt;300 cells/microL), we obtain a CD4 cell count three months after initiating therapy. Repeating the CD4 sooner is not indicated. Although the viral load decline occurs quickly due to the direct effect of antivirals, the CD4 rise is a slower process of innate immune reconstitution. Thus, a meaningful CD4 rise in that period of time may not be seen and should not affect clinical management. (See

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         We continue to monitor the CD4 count every three to six months until the CD4 count is ≥300 cells/microL. This allows us to assess immunologic recovery and the need for prophylaxis to prevent opportunistic infections. (See

         If the CD4 count remains ≥300 cells/microL on a stably suppressive ART regimen for at least a year, the frequency of testing can be reduced further. In this setting, we monitor the CD4 count annually until the CD4 count is &gt;500 cells/microL; after that, CD4 count testing is optional. As outlined below in more detail, DHHS and IAS-USA guidelines differ on exact monitoring protocols. (See

         More frequent CD4 count monitoring (every three to six months) should be initiated (or reinitiated) in patients who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy as well as those who develop an opportunistic infection or have evidence of virologic failure. (See

         Prior to the introduction of effective ART, CD4 counts were routinely monitored every three to six months.

As an example, in a retrospective cohort study evaluating 832 patients with HIV receiving ART, those with an HIV RNA &lt;200 copies/mL and a CD4 count ≥300 cells/microL had a nearly 100 percent probability of maintaining a CD4 count ≥200 cells/microL over four years when non-HIV causes of CD4 lymphopenia were excluded [

         The IAS-USA states that once viral suppression is achieved in patients receiving ART, CD4 counts should be measured every six months until they are greater than 250 cells/microL for at least one year; after that, CD4 counts do not need to be measured unless there is evidence of virologic failure or the patient experiences an immunosuppressive condition [

After two years of suppressive ART, CD4 count monitoring can be reduced to every six months for patients whose CD4 counts remain &lt;300 cells/microL and every year for patients whose CD4 counts are between 300 and 500 cells/microL. After two years, CD4 testing is optional for those with CD4 counts &gt;500 cells/microL.

        <p>
         Viral suppression is usually accompanied by an increase in CD4 count of ≥50 cells/microL at four to eight weeks, followed by slower incremental increases of 50 to 100 cells/microL per year [

          35
         </a>
         ]. (See

        <p>
         CD4 cell counts may increase even in patients who cannot maintain viral suppression. These "discordant results" were seen most commonly in patients with extensive drug resistance to ART when fewer drug classes were available [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36
         </a>
         ]. Various hypotheses for this observed immunologic benefit in the face of ongoing viremia have been proposed, including decreased replication capacity of resistant strains, decreased immune activation, and preservation of non-syncytium-inducing strains [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. However, this immunologic benefit was usually lost when the HIV RNA returned to the pretreatment baseline [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. With the current availability of a wide range of HIV treatments with activity against resistant viruses, most patients are able to achieve virologic suppression.
        </p>
        <p>
         By contrast, rarely, patients may obtain viral suppression without any significant improvement in absolute CD4 cell counts, or paradoxically, even a decline [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. Although the cause of this suboptimal CD4 response is usually not known, risk factors include advanced age and low nadir CD4 count. This observation has also been noted in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis and those treated with the combination of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9351" href="/z/d/drug information/9351.html" rel="external">

         , which is no longer recommended.
        </p>
        <p>
         The CD4 count can be affected by inter-laboratory variability, acute illness, medications that suppress the bone marrow, and diurnal variation. For these reasons, results that are unexpectedly different from prior ones should be confirmed with a repeat test. A significant difference between two test results is generally defined as a 30 percent change in the absolute CD4 count or a change in CD4 cell count percent by three percentage points [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7

         Patients receiving ART should be monitored clinically for side effects (eg, nausea, diarrhea). These side effects usually resolve on their own or with supportive care after a few doses. However, on rare occasion they can persist, and patients should be instructed to follow up with their clinician if resolution does not occur.
        </p>
        <p>
         Laboratory tests should also be obtained at baseline and then periodically thereafter to monitor for toxicity related to ART. Hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity are rare but can occur, even in the absence of symptoms. Specific laboratory monitoring is outlined in the table  (

        <p>
         If side effects or laboratory abnormalities are detected and persist, a change in the ART regimen may be required.

          Assessing adherence
         </strong>
         – At each visit, patients should be interviewed regarding medication adherence in a nonjudgmental manner. Adherence can vary over time and can be impacted by factors such as depression and substance use [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. Although current antiretroviral medications are less affected by changes in adherence than treatments used in the early years of combination ART, it is still important that patients minimize missed doses.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In many patients, adherence can be difficult to assess. As an example, one study demonstrated that clinicians incorrectly predicted adherence in 41 percent of patients [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ]. In addition, patients often exaggerate adherence to their provider. If adherence is uncertain (eg, a patient who endorses optimal adherence but has virologic failure), pharmacy records are useful to help track compliance when refills are obtained from a single pharmacy source.

        </p>

          Strategies to enhance adherence
         </strong>
         – To enhance adherence, patients should understand the link between adherence and drug resistance. (See

          "Interpretation of HIV drug resistance testing", section on 'Factors contributing to resistance'

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In addition, it is useful to discuss medication schedules with patients to help them link pill-taking behaviors to other daily activities (eg, brushing teeth). If the patient admits to difficulties with adherence, potential barriers could involve the number and timing of doses, sizes of pills, food restrictions, stigma, and treatment-limiting side effects. The patient should also be advised to notify the provider if there is an anticipated problem with adherence, such as elective surgery or a prolonged intercurrent illness. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13978.html" rel="external">

         Whether and how injectable therapy may be an alternative treatment option for patients who struggle with adherence to daily oral therapy is being actively investigated. The currently approved injectable regimens of

          Goals of monitoring
         </strong>
         – Proper utilization of antiretroviral therapy (ART) requires ongoing patient monitoring to assess the therapeutic response and to identify adverse events related to chronic administration of medications. Failure to respond to a recommended ART regimen is almost always a result of suboptimal adherence or, less commonly, viral resistance. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Frequency of follow up
         </strong>
         – Most patients who are started on ART should have follow-up within four weeks of starting treatment; however, earlier follow up may be needed for those with advanced HIV disease, especially if they are being treated for a concurrent opportunistic infection. (See
         <a class="local">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         After the initial visit, we typically see patients every three to six months, depending upon how they are tolerating their regimen and their virologic response. Once the patient is clinically stable on their regimen with viral suppression, visit frequency and laboratory testing can typically decrease to every six months. (See

          Virologic monitoring
         </strong>
         – Plasma HIV RNA should be measured in all patients at baseline and regularly during therapy since it is the most reliable indicator of response to ART and is useful in predicting clinical progression. The goal of ART is viral load suppression below the quantifiable limits of assay detection (eg, &lt;20 to 40 copies/mL). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Virologic response'

         <strong>
          Frequency of testing
         </strong>
         – We perform HIV RNA testing approximately four weeks after initiating ART and then at four- to eight-week intervals until the level falls below the assay's limit of detection. Patients typically achieve viral suppression 8 to 12 weeks after ART initiation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Frequency of monitoring'
         </a>
         above and

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Once the viral load is below the level of detection, virologic monitoring can be performed every three to four months. If the viral load remains suppressed for one year, virologic monitoring can be reduced to every six months for those who are able to take their regimen as prescribed. (See

          Viral blips and persistent low-level viremia
         </strong>
         – Viral blips and low-level viremia refer to low-levels of detectable HIV RNA, typically 20 to 200 copies/mL. When low-level viremia is detected, we review adherence and drug-drug/drug-food interactions. In most cases, no further intervention is needed as low level-viremia is not usually associated with virologic failure. However, additional testing (eg, archived genotype) is reasonable if low-level viremia is persistent (eg, &gt;6 months). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Approach to viral blips and persistent low-level viremia'

         <strong>
          Virologic failure
         </strong>
         – Virologic failure occurs when a patient is unable to achieve a viral load &lt;200 copies/mL within 24 weeks of initiating ART or if they have a sustained recurrence of viremia to &gt;200 copies/mL (ie, on two consecutive measurements) after initial viral suppression. The management of virologic failure is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Virologic failure'

         <strong>
          CD4 count monitoring
         </strong>
         – The approach to CD4 count monitoring after ART initiation depends upon the baseline CD4 count, and guideline panels differ in their approach. In patients with low baseline CD4 counts (eg, &lt;300 cells/microL), we obtain a CD4 cell count three months after initiating therapy. We then continue to monitor the CD4 count every three to six months until the CD4 count is greater than 300 cells/microL. If the CD4 count remains &gt;300 cells/microL on a stably suppressive ART regimen for at least a year, we monitor the CD4 count annually until the CD4 count is &gt;500 cells/microL; after that, CD4 count testing is optional. (See
         <a class="local">
          'CD4 count'

         above.)

         <strong>
          Adverse event monitoring
         </strong>
         – Patients receiving ART should be monitored for side effects (eg, nausea, diarrhea) and managed accordingly. In addition, laboratory tests should be obtained at baseline and then periodically thereafter to monitor for toxicity related to ART. Specific monitoring is outlined in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef96776" href="/z/d/graphic/96776.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). If side effects or laboratory abnormalities are detected and persist, a change in the ART regimen may be required. (See

         <strong>
          Adherence monitoring
         </strong>
         – Optimal adherence to an ART regimen (ie, taking all medication doses at the time intervals prescribed) is important to help patients achieve and maintain virologic suppression. At each visit, patients should be interviewed regarding medication adherence in a nonjudgmental manner. Adherence can vary over time and can be impacted by factors such as depression and substance use. (See
         <a class="local">
          'ART Adherence'
