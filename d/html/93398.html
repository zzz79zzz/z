         Alcohol and other drug use (including prescription drugs) can impair a physician’s ability to practice medicine proficiently, putting patients at risk of harm. As a result, substance use disorders (SUDs) in physicians have been the subject of considerable clinical and regulatory attention. In the past, physicians with SUDs were described as "impaired physicians," a term that was also applied to physicians with psychiatric, cognitive, behavioral, or general medical problems with potential to adversely affect their ability to perform specific duties. More recently, the terminology has evolved to “physicians with potentially impairing conditions,” to more accurately reflect the reality that not all physicians with a diagnosable SUD demonstrate workplace impairment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most of the data published on this subject are limited to physicians in the United States, where treatment of physicians with SUDs is typically overseen by a physician health program (PHP); however, the information may be relevant to other types of clinicians [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ] and other countries [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-12
         </a>
         ]. PHPs in the United States, Canada, Australia, and elsewhere provide coordination, monitoring, and expertise in the care of impaired physicians (and sometimes other health care professionals) [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. The PHP care, combined with participation in high-quality SUD treatment, is associated with high rates of sustained remission and return to medical practice among physicians [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14-19

         This topic addresses the assessment, treatment, and oversight of physicians impaired by SUDs. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, identification, and engagement of physicians impaired by SUDs are discussed separately. Prescription drug misuse and continuing care for addiction are also discussed separately. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of specific SUDs are also discussed separately:

         In the United States and other countries, physician health programs (PHP) monitor the care, recovery, and return to work of physicians with potentially impairing conditions, such as SUDs. [

         </a>
         ]. PHPs also provide coordination and monitoring of physicians impaired by general medical conditions, behavioral problems, cognitive decline, and psychiatric disorders other than SUDs. Nearly all of the data on treatment and outcomes for physicians with SUD that have been published in English-language medical journals come from PHPs or similar programs in the United States, Australia, and Canada. PHPs typically do not directly treat these physicians, but are often involved in each stage of the physicians’ recovery, including (see

         When a physician has a potentially impairing condition, regulatory agencies or their proxies determine whether to change the status of the physician’s license to practice medicine (eg, whether the license is revoked or suspended, whether and under what terms the physician can return to work, and whether the physician’s status is publicly disclosed).
        </p>
        <p>
         Regulatory agencies in some countries and in some states in the United States rely on recommendations from the physician’s substance use disorder (SUD) treatment team or physician health program (PHP) when deciding whether to impose sanctions, and which would be most appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Apart from these consultative relationships, most PHPs in the United States operate independently from state medical boards. This allows the PHP to serve as a confidential buffer between the state board and the physician. PHPs tend to consider
         <strong>
          severe
         </strong>
         sanctions (eg, permanent license revocation) as counterproductive, because the threat of such sanctions may discourage physicians from reporting a colleague or from accepting help for themselves [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. In some states in the United States (eg, Maryland), separate programs exist to provide alternative processes [
         <a href="#rid27">

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Sanctions are generally utilized to protect patients from exposure to an impaired physician after other options have been exhausted. PHPs or treating clinicians sometimes use the prospect of such sanctions as “leverage” (ie, to motivate a recalcitrant physician to participate in needed SUD treatment). Research has suggested that retaining one’s medical license can be an effective component of contingency management to encourage sustained abstinence among physicians with SUDs [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. Though concerns have been raised regarding the ethics of this practice and the potential for conflicts of interest between PHPs and evaluation/treatment programs [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ], others have noted that medical licensure exists specifically to support the “social contract” that requires protecting patients from the possibility of harm due to physician impairment [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. Most physicians who are involuntarily referred to PHPs generally have positive clinical outcomes [

         ] and express satisfaction with their participation in the PHP [

         Physician health program (PHP) care coordination may include contact with colleagues of the physician who expressed concern about a potential substance use disorder (SUD), referral of the physician to qualified addiction specialists for assessment and treatment, acting as an intermediary between the physician and the state medical board, advocating on behalf of physicians who adhere to their monitoring agreements, and working with the physician’s employer, colleagues, and/or staff to facilitate the physician’s return to work.
        </p>
        <p>
         PHP monitoring of the physician’s behavior is ongoing during and after treatment, and continues following the physician’s return to work. During treatment it involves regular contact with treating clinicians and review of their written reports. Contact with the physician’s employer, colleagues, and/or staff occurs before and after the physician’s return to work. Monitoring of the physician may include phone/e-mail/teleconferencing contacts, attendance at a weekly or monthly monitoring meeting, reports from the physician’s health care providers (eg, therapist, primary care provider, outpatient addiction specialist), and/or a workplace practice monitor who observes the physician and provides regular reports regarding their functioning on the job.

         Routine random toxicology tests are conducted to verify the physician’s abstinence from alcohol and other mood-altering substances. Urine testing typically includes an expanded “health care specific” panel and initially occurs about weekly. Frequency of testing typically decreases when good results have been reliably attained. Random toxicological testing may also include blood (PEth), hair/nails, saliva, and/or video-monitored breath testing to verify the physician’s abstinence. This is an evolving science/technology. Recent research has suggested that PEth may be the most sensitive biomarker for documenting abstinence from alcohol among physicians in recovery from alcohol use disorder [

         Physicians participating in a PHP are typically asked to enter into a formal monitoring agreement, which outlines the expectations of the physician and related contingencies. PHP monitoring agreements for physicians with moderate to severe SUD are typically about five years in duration [

         The monitoring agreement between a physician and PHP is viewed as a contract and provides the basis for the PHP’s subsequent actions. As an example, the physician’s failure to attend the weekly group meeting would be regarded as a violation of the agreement, and could trigger immediate extra toxicology testing. Serious violations (eg, positive or missed toxicology tests, use of unapproved narcotic medication) would likely warrant re-evaluation by an addiction specialist to determine whether further formal treatment is needed.

         </span>
         The physician with a substance use disorder (SUD) is optimally evaluated and treated by an addiction specialty team, composed of an addiction medicine specialist, psychiatrist or psychologist, nurse, and/or addiction counselor [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. This team needs to be adept at assessing for SUDs and co-occurring medical and/or psychiatric conditions, and additionally cognizant of medical practices, licensure issues, and physician work environments.
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinicians who have had a collegial relationship or friendship with the physician-patient should not participate in the evaluation or treatment of the physician with a SUD. This may require that clinical care be performed outside of the physician’s own medical community to protect the patient’s confidentiality and to avoid issues of transference [
         <a href="#rid36">

         The physical examination in physicians with SUDs is most often normal, although there may be evidence of intoxication or withdrawal.
        </p>
        <p>
         Neuropsychological testing is helpful in the assessment of physicians with SUDs, particularly when there are concerns about cognitive impairment [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. Neuropsychological testing can determine the type and severity of neurologic damage. As an example, given the safety-sensitive nature of medical practice and specific specialties (eg, anesthesiology, surgery), “minor” deficits in processing speed and fine motor coordination may adversely impact the physician’s ability to practice with reasonable skill and safety. Results can also be used in confronting denial and determining fitness for return to practice.
        </p>
        <p>
         Comprehensive toxicology testing is an important part of the assessment when used to validate the physician-patient’s history of substance use and to confront denial. This typically includes urine tests, blood tests (eg, PEth), and may include hair and/or nail testing. (See

         After the physician has signed a release allowing communication, the assessment should include collateral information from supervisors, colleagues, and staff in the physician’s workplace about their behavior, functioning, and appearance.
        </p>
        <p>
         Examination of the physician’s medical practice records may show inadequate or inaccurate documentation. However, poor record keeping is rarely the critical piece of information that confirms an impairment issue. In the case of prescription drug misuse by a physician, a good starting point is to review a sample of medical records of patients to whom they have prescribed controlled substances. Findings of interest would include alterations of the medical record related to these prescriptions, inadequate documentation of clinical indications for the prescriptions, excessively high doses, or prescribing controlled substances for office personnel or family members.

         Owing to the safety-sensitive nature of their work and the public safety interest in preventing return-to-use or relapse, published data suggest that physicians treated for a SUD often receive longer, more intensive treatment (ie, residential care) than nonphysicians. A study of 802 physicians with SUD participating in 1 of 16 physician health programs (PHP) found that a majority of physicians received residential treatment, with a median length of stay of 12 weeks [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. The overall period of acute treatment for physicians is typically three to six months.
        </p>

         Factors favoring more intensive levels of care among physicians include:

         An additional factor contributing to the discrepancy in intensity and length of treatment for physicians compared with nonphysicians in countries with PHPs is that PHPs do not consider insurance constraints an acceptable rationale for limiting treatment. Insurers’ refusal to pay for higher levels of SUD care often creates an impediment to receiving recommended treatments for the general population.

         An example is a physician with an isolated incidence of driving under the influence after a weekend party and without other risk factors. Appropriate treatment could be outpatient motivational enhancement and brief intervention, with a sustained period of monitoring via random toxicology testing to ensure the problem is not more severe than initially believed.

         Participation in a weekly group of physicians in treatment for SUD, led by an addictions counselor – This exposure to other recovering physicians may reduce shame and promote self-disclosure. Physicians may feel more confident of confidentiality in a group of professional peers [

As an example, a study of 85 physicians who participated in such groups, either by their own volition (33 percent) or as a component of their PHP monitoring contract, found that most (72 percent) had a positive experience [

         For patients in PHPs, conditions for a physician’s return to medical practice are typically spelled out in the monitoring agreement between the physician and the PHP. Most state regulations specify only that the physician’s return to work should be based on their ability to practice medicine with “reasonable skill and safety,” leaving the judgment in individual cases up to the treatment team and the PHP. The Federation of State Physician Health Programs has issued guidelines for recommended monitoring agreement elements and return-to-work requirements [

         Returning to work is often a staged process. Restrictions may be placed on the physician’s practice, at least initially, to protect the physician and patients. For example, the physician may have limits placed on their work hours, tasks, shift time, or clinical settings. Specifically, the physician may be prohibited from the operating room, not permitted to take overnight shifts (when fewer staff are present to observe behavior), or face restricted access to controlled medications. Many physicians are required to have a workplace “monitor” who is in contact with the PHP, with a valid, signed release for communication in effect at all times. The number of settings at which a physician may practice might also be limited to provide easier monitoring and better accountability. There may be restrictions placed on the physician’s medical license by a regulatory agency or medical board that must be satisfied prior to their return to work.
        </p>
        <p>
         Preparing for return to work includes developing an accountability system for dispensing and administering controlled medications to the physician’s patients. This will likely involve another person overseeing or, ideally, handling these processes. It may include:

         Available data on outcomes of physicians treated for a substance use disorder (SUD) are largely limited to United States physicians receiving SUD treatment under the oversight, coordination, and monitoring of physician health programs (PHP). A meta-analysis was conducted on 29 outcome studies of health care professionals (mainly physicians) monitored by a PHP, including 26 United States studies, and 1 study each from Canada, Australia, and Spain. Results from 3027 total participants demonstrated pooled success rates of 72 percent for abstinence (95% CI 63 to 80 percent), with better outcomes in studies where abstinence monitoring was initiated

          after

         treatment discharge (ie, 79 percent). When the outcome was work retention (n = 1728), the pooled success rate was 77 percent (95% CI 61 to 90 percent) [

        <p>
         Retrospective studies of PHPs in the United States have found that between 75 and 90 percent of physicians and other health care professionals completed SUD treatment, returned to work, and remained working at five-year follow-up [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,31,45,46
         </a>
         ]. As is common in SUD treatment outcome studies, results from the PHP studies may underestimate the relapse rate of physicians by omitting patients lost to follow-up and depending on random toxicology testing as the primary indicator of abstinence [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47

Among the 153 residents who attempted to return to anesthesia following SUD treatment, 40 percent ultimately switched to another residency; nine residents died during a return-to-use episode.

         A survey of 106 anesthesiology department chairs in Australia and New Zealand identified 61 cases of anesthesiologists who were treated for an SUD [

         ]. Incidence was higher among trainees than consultants (1.5 per 1000 trainee years versus 0.7 per 1000 consultant years). Thirty physicians (68 percent) returned to work in some form. Twenty-four physicians (55 percent) returned to anesthesiology. Four physicians returned to work in an alternative medical field. Two others worked in nonmedical positions. Three of the physicians retired early, and five were no longer licensed. Eight physicians died during the reporting period (three by suicide and five by overdose).

         Interventions have been implemented to varying extents across the United States to address factors contributing to the misuse of prescription opioids, in particular, by anesthesiologists. These include anti-diversion policies, mandatory pharmacotherapy with

         Physicians are often initially skeptical that addiction is a disease, in many cases due to their lack of familiarity with the concept. Some physicians respond negatively to talk of spiritual principles in twelve step programs, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, possibly due to their medical training. In our experience, these barriers to acceptance of treatment diminish with time in a significant proportion of physicians.

          Overview
         </strong>
         – The management of physicians with substance use disorder (SUD) can be conceptualized as three categories of activity: regulation, coordination/monitoring, and assessment/treatment. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Overview'

         <strong>
          Physician health programs (PHP)
         </strong>
         – In the United States and other countries, PHPs provide coordination and monitoring of physicians with potentially impairing conditions. PHPs may be involved directly in regulatory activities or serve as an intermediary between the physician and the state medical board. PHPs may refer the physician to a clinical team and/or have input into the physician’s assessment and treatment, but generally do not directly provide assessment and treatment. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Physician health programs'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         PHPs in some states in the United States oversee care for other health care professionals (eg, nurses, pharmacists, and veterinarians) in addition to physicians. Other states have separate programs for other types of clinicians.

         <strong>
          Regulation
         </strong>
         – When a physician has a potentially impairing condition, regulatory agencies or their proxies determine whether to change the status of the physician’s license to practice medicine (eg, whether the license is revoked or suspended, whether and under what terms the physician can return to work, and whether the physician’s status is publicly disclosed). (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Coordination and monitoring
         </strong>
         – PHP care coordination may include contact with colleagues of the physician who expressed concern about a potential SUD and referral of the physician to qualified addiction specialists for assessment and treatment. Additionally, PHP care coordination may act as an intermediary between the physician and the state medical board by advocating on behalf of physicians who adhere to their monitoring agreements, and working with the physician’s employer, colleagues, and/or staff to facilitate the physician’s return to work.

         Physicians with an SUD typically enter into a monitoring agreement with the PHP of approximately five years duration, in which the physician agrees to conditions including abstinence, treatment, and extended monitoring in return for a pathway to recovery and eventual return to medical practice.

         <strong>
          Assessment
         </strong>
         – The physician with an SUD is optimally evaluated by an addiction specialty team, composed of a physician (typically specializing in addiction medicine or addiction psychiatry) with expertise in substance use issues of health care professionals, psychologist, nurse, and addiction counselor. This team needs to be adept at assessing SUDs, and additionally cognizant of medical practices, licensure issues, and physician work environments. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Initial assessment'

         <strong>
          Treatment
         </strong>
         – SUD treatment for physicians, like any patient, consists of addiction counseling, mutual help groups, medication, and/or psychotherapy. Other aspects of treatment may be specific to physicians, such as addressing risks a physician with SUD may pose to their patients, exposure to other physicians with SUDs (including physicians with long-term sobriety), and learning drug refusal skills aimed at managing their access to controlled medications at work. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Outcomes of PHP
         </strong>
         – Supervised SUD treatment are generally considered to be exceptionally good, with between 75 and 90 percent of physicians and other health care professionals found to complete SUD treatment, return to work, and remain working at five-year follow-up. Outcomes of physicians treated/monitored in non-PHP models have not been studied. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Outcomes of physician health programs'
         </a>

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Rates of SUDs, in particular opioid use disorders, are higher among anesthesiologists compared to physicians in other specialties. Anesthesiologists who participate in PHPs appear to have outcomes similar to other physicians. Anesthesia residents with an SUD, however, have been found to have significant rates of relapse and mortality after PHP completion, particularly among those who return to an anesthesia residency program. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Return to work
         </strong>
         – Factors considered in assessing a physician’s readiness to return to practice include completion of treatment for SUD and co-occurring conditions, sustained abstinence, their ability to manage stressors and triggers, and motivation to follow the continuing care plan. Most physicians are required to have a workplace monitor and processes that address the physician’s access to medications. (See
