Postrenal AKI may also be associated with severe unilateral hydronephrosis in a solitary kidney. In males, the most common diagnosis is posterior urethral valves with additional findings of a dilated bladder and posterior urethra  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73308" href="/d/graphic/73308.html" rel="external">image 1</a>).

It is used to document the presence of one or two kidneys, and delineates kidney size and shape. The absence of bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter or unilateral findings in a solitary kidney, and a normal size bladder with normal emptying typically rules out urinary tract obstruction (postrenal AKI). Simultaneous Doppler examination allows assessment of renal blood flow and helps diagnose occlusion of the major renal vessels (eg, renal arterial or venous thrombosis).

This intervention is used to identify infants with prerenal AKI due to hypovolemia. It should be administered to all infants with AKI and oliguria except those with hypertension or other clinical signs of intravascular volume overload (heart failure, respiratory distress, or edema)  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112889" href="/d/graphic/112889.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>The fluid challenge consists of an intravenous (IV) administration of 10 to 20 mL/kg of isotonic <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12796" href="/d/drug information/12796.html" rel="external">saline</a> given over one to two hours. Saline is effective as a fluid challenge and avoids complications associated with colloid administration, including the risk of infection and leakage of protein into the lungs leading to pulmonary edema [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. We do <strong>not</strong> infuse colloid such as albumin or fresh frozen plasma, except when clearly indicated (eg, fresh frozen plasma for a bleeding diathesis or albumin for hypoalbuminemia with increased risk for third spacing).</p><p>A positive response is any urine output in an anuric patient, an increase in urine output to ≥1 mL/kg per hour in an oliguric patient, or improvement of serum creatinine (SCr)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111831" href="/d/graphic/111831.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), is indicative of a prerenal cause due to hypovolemia (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4989.html" rel="external">"Neonatal acute kidney injury: Pathogenesis, etiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis", section on 'Serum creatinine'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4989.html" rel="external">"Neonatal acute kidney injury: Pathogenesis, etiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis", section on 'Prerenal disease'</a>). For infants who respond, continued efforts are focused on achieving and maintaining adequate hydration by replacing deficits and ongoing losses.<em> </em>(See <a class="local">'Fluid management'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients who develop clinical signs of fluid overload (elevated blood pressure, respiratory rate, and/or heart rate), the evaluation should focus on evidence of cardiac disease or intrinsic renal AKI. Respiratory symptoms may occur in conditions that cause altered distribution of fluid from the vascular space into the interstitium referred to as third spacing. Neonatal conditions associated with third spacing include nephrotic syndrome, hepatic failure, sepsis, hypoalbuminemia, and hydrops fetalis.</p><p>The fluid challenge should be repeated in infants who do not respond to the initial infusion and do not have clinical signs of fluid overload. Absence of a response to a repeated challenge generally indicates intrinsic kidney disease. For this subset of patients, a comprehensive review for evidence of nephrotoxin exposure, prenatal asphyxia, or hyporenal perfusion, and an evaluation for sepsis should be performed. Conservative treatment, including fluid restriction, careful monitoring of fluid balance and serum electrolytes, and renal replacement therapy (RRT) are provided for these patients.

In neonates, peritoneal dialysis and continuous KRT (CKRT) are the two most commonly used modalities.

Peritoneal dialysis can be initiated immediately after the dialysis catheter is placed and can be performed as soon as three days after major abdominal surgery [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. It is less efficient in altering blood solute composition and in fluid removal than the other modalities, but it can be applied continuously and is therefore well tolerated by hemodynamically unstable patients.

For infants who are hemodynamically unstable, CKRT may be preferable to HD as fluid shifts are more gradual with CKRT. In patients with inborn errors of metabolism, clearance of ammonia and branched-chain amino acids are similar for CKRT and HD.

(See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – Once a diagnosis of neonatal AKI is made, evaluation is performed to determine the underlying cause  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112889" href="/d/graphic/112889.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Elements of the evaluation include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>History – Directed history to uncover an obvious risk factor or cause for neonatal AKI. This includes reviewing the results of a prenatal ultrasound if available, and a history for nephrotoxic exposure, perinatal asphyxia, or hypovolemia. (See <a class="local">'History'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Physical examination – Key findings that may be associated with AKI include edema, elevated pressure, palpable kidneys suggesting enlargement, distended bladder, and other nonrenal anomalies associated with AKI (eg, critical congenital heart disease). Excessive weight loss is suggestive of hypovolemia and prerenal AKI, whereas excessive weight gain suggests impairment of water excretion seen in patients with intrinsic and postrenal disease. (See <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Imaging – A renal ultrasound is obtained to document the presence of one or two kidneys, the shape and size of the kidney(s), and detects congenital anomalies or vascular abnormalities. In particular, severe bilateral hydronephrosis or severe unilateral hydronephrosis in a solitary kidney is suggestive of postrenal disease due to obstructive uropathy. A renal ultrasound also identify patients with chronic congenital disease (eg, cystic renal disease, renal hypodysplasia) who present in a similar manner to neonates with AKI. (See <a class="local">'Renal ultrasound'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Fluid challenge – Administration of a fluid challenge can identify patients with prerenal disease due to hypovolemia. (See <a class="local">'Fluid challenge'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Laboratory testing – Laboratory evaluation is not as helpful in identifying the etiology of AKI in neonates due to the functional and developmental immaturity of the neonatal kidney, especially in preterm infants. (See <a class="local">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prevention</strong> – Preventive measures include (see <a class="local">'Prevention'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Dose adjustment of renally excreted drugs that are potentially nephrotoxic based on the infant's kidney function.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Renal function (serum creatinine [SCr]) is monitored for patients at risk for AKI.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Careful attention to fluid management to avoid hypovolemia and hypervolemia. For patients cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit, fluid and electrolyte management is readjusted by changes in the infant's fluid status determined by frequent measurement of weight, accurate intake and output, and serum sodium.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Specific treatment of the underlying cause. (See <a class="local">'Directed therapy based on etiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Fluid therapy is determined by the underlying cause of the AKI and the fluid status of the infant. Fluid administration is adjusted based on weight changes (obtained every 12 hours), a review of the infant's intake and output, and changes in serum sodium. (See <a class="local">'Fluid management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13329" href="/d/drug information/13329.html" rel="external">Furosemide</a>, a loop diuretic, is ototoxic and does not alter the course of neonatal AKI. Furosemide may be given as a trial to induce a diuresis in neonates with AKI who have signs of fluid overload. (See <a class="local">'Furosemide'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Drug management includes avoiding nephrotoxic drugs if possible and readjusting the dose of renally excreted drugs based on the infant's estimated glomerular filtration rate. (See <a class="local">'Medications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The nutritional intake is targeted to provide a minimum of 100 kcal/kg per day. For infants who are able to take enteral feedings, human milk or formula that has a low renal solute load and phosphate content is recommended. For infants who receive parenteral nutrition, the daily recommended intake of amino acids is up to a maximum of 1.5 g/kg per day and intravenous (IV) lipid solution up to a maximum of 2 g/kg per day.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Electrolyte abnormalities are common complications of AKI. They include hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyponatremia. (See <a class="local">'Electrolyte and acid-base management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hypertension is a common in neonates with AKI, primarily due to fluid overload. The indications and approach for initiation of pharmacologic therapy are the same as those used for infants without AKI. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16308.html" rel="external">"Management of hypertension in neonates and infants", section on 'Who should be treated?'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Indications for kidney replacement therapy (KRT) include clinically significant fluid overload; hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis that are unresponsive to medical therapy; and to provide adequate nutrition for anuric or oliguric patients. Available modalities for the neonates include hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis, and hemofiltration (with or without dialysis). (See <a class="local">'Kidney replacement therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Outcome</strong> – AKI increases the risk of mortality and morbidity for neonates. Neonates at increased risk include very low birth weight infants (birth weight &lt;1500 g), those who undergo cardiac surgery, infants supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or infants who were exposed to perinatal asphyxia.
