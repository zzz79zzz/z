         Children are more vulnerable to blunt abdominal injury than adults because they have (see

        <p>
         Among all children with blunt torso trauma, intra-abdominal injury (IAI) occurs in approximately 5 to 10 percent of patients [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Up to 25 percent of prepubertal children with multisystem injury who undergo additional testing have significant abdominal injury [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. Motor vehicle crashes, auto-pedestrian injury, and falls are the major causes of blunt abdominal injury in children; bicycle injuries, all-terrain vehicle injuries, and child abuse also contribute [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/103420.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The most common structures injured in pediatric blunt abdominal trauma are solid organs, with liver and spleen being the most commonly injured, followed by kidneys. Hollow viscus injuries are the next most common form of injury, followed by injuries to the abdominal vasculature [
         <a href="#rid7">

         Mortality after blunt abdominal trauma is rare, occurring in &lt;1 percent of patients with blunt torso trauma [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. The mortality due to blunt abdominal trauma in children is directly related to the number and type of structures injured: it is less than 20 percent in isolated liver, spleen, kidney, or pancreatic trauma; increases to 20 percent if the gastrointestinal tract is involved; and increases to 50 percent if major vessels are injured [

         The initial management of children with suspected intra-abdominal injury (IAI) should proceed in a systematic fashion and adhere to the Advanced Trauma Life Support guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of immediately life-threatening injuries  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64241" href="/z/d/graphic/64241.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6571.html" rel="external">
          "Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child", section on 'Initial approach'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Children with hemodynamic instability due to intra-abdominal bleeding should receive blood transfusion as soon as possible. Isotonic crystalloid fluid is acceptable if blood is not immediately available. Indications for emergency laparotomy include any of the following: non-response to crystalloid infusion (40 to 60 mL/kg, maximum volume: 3 L); blood transfusion (no response after 20 mL/kg [relative indication]; blood transfusion of approximately half of the patient's estimated blood volume [strong indication]).
        </p>
        <p>
         During stabilization, children with signs of IAI and hemodynamic instability that do not respond to fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion warrant emergency laparotomy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Laparotomy'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         After the patient has been assessed, resuscitated, and stabilized, the patient should receive ongoing care directed by a pediatric surgeon with trauma expertise, whenever possible. Because optimal care and outcomes occur when the critically injured child is initially resuscitated and subsequently managed in a pediatric trauma center (PTC), it is preferable to provide initial care in such facilities from the outset, whenever possible, or to arrange transfer to a PTC for ongoing management.

         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6571.html" rel="external">

         In hemodynamically stable children, evaluation for blunt intra-abdominal injury (IAI) should take place as part of the secondary survey. This evaluation may disclose other indications for observation, laboratory evaluation, imaging, or laparotomy. (See

         Unlike penetrating trauma, which is usually apparent upon inspection, blunt abdominal trauma must be suspected from historical information, particularly the mechanism of injury, and careful physical examination [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,9-11
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Mechanisms of blunt injury that are associated with IAI include isolated, high-energy blows to the abdomen (eg, fall from a bicycle on to the handlebar  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef117447" href="/z/d/graphic/117447.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         )) and high-risk trauma mechanisms including motor vehicle collisions, seat belt usage  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef117444" href="/z/d/graphic/117444.html" rel="external">
          picture 2
         </a>
         ), and falls from a height greater than 10 feet or two to three times the patient’s height  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57293" href="/z/d/graphic/57293.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,12-14
         </a>
         ]. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients who report abdominal pain after blunt torso trauma are also at significant risk of intra-abdominal injury. As an example, in a large, prospective multicenter trial of 10,176 children two years of age or older with blunt torso trauma, any reported abdominal pain was associated with a 13 percent risk of IAI compared to a 2 percent risk of IAI in patients with a Glasgow coma scale of 15 and no pain or tenderness on physical examination [

         Children with blunt abdominal trauma warrant a complete physical examination as part of the secondary survey and consistent with the principles of Advanced Trauma Life Support. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6571.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         During the secondary survey, the clinician should pay close attention to signs of hemorrhagic shock such as tachycardia, narrowed pulse pressure, prolonged capillary refill time, pallor, or altered mental status. Although not definitive, these findings may indicate ongoing intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Significant intra-abdominal hemorrhage in children can be masked by their ability to maintain normal systolic blood pressure despite large volume blood loss. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6389.html" rel="external">

         In patients with vomiting, abdominal distension, or suspicion for significant abdominal injury, a nasogastric or, in patients with maxillofacial trauma, an orogastric tube should be placed before abdominal examination. Gastric decompression may facilitate accurate examination in these selected patients and minimize risk of aspiration of gastric contents if vomiting occurs [

          8,17
         </a>
         ]. Abdominal tenderness may be especially difficult to determine in young children who are frightened and cannot clearly communicate and in older children who are uncooperative or neurologically impaired [

         Abdominal injury can also be difficult to identify in children with concurrent extra-abdominal injury (eg, head trauma, thoracic trauma, or extremity fracture) or impaired neurologic status (eg, traumatic brain injury or substance use) [

          15,20

         The seat belt sign was first described as part of a trio of findings consistent with "seat belt syndrome," which included vertebral chance fracture  (

         ). Abdominal wall ecchymosis in a linear pattern across the abdomen in restrained children who are injured in a motor vehicle collision (seat belt sign) is strongly and independently associated with significant IAI, especially hollow viscus injuries [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,14
         </a>
         ]. Thus, most patients with a seat belt sign warrant definitive determination of IAI (computed tomography [CT] of the abdomen and pelvis in stable patients or laparotomy in unstable patients who do not respond to fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion). Alert patients without abdominal tenderness who have the seat belt sign still have a significant risk of IAI and, at a minimum, warrant continued observation and laboratory evaluation [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Abdominal and pelvic CT is often still necessary in these patients to identify or exclude IAI.

         The following observational studies support the association between the seat belt sign and IAI in restrained children who are injured in motor vehicle collisions:

         In a retrospective study of a large database of almost 150,000 children, aged 4 to 15 years, who were restrained passengers, children with abdominal bruises were 232 times more likely to have IAI than those without bruising (95% CI, 76-710) [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Abdominal bruises had a sensitivity and specificity for IAI of 74 and 99 percent, respectively. Among patients without abdominal wall bruising, the negative predictive value for IAI was 99.9 percent. Among all patients, significant IAI was present in 0.2 percent (309 children) and abdominal bruising in 1.3 percent (1967 patients).

         In a multicenter, prospective, observational study of 1864 children injured in a motor vehicle collision who underwent definitive determination of the presence of an IAI by CT, laparotomy, or autopsy, IAIs occurred more frequently in children demonstrating a seat belt sign than those who did not (19 versus 12 percent, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. A greater number of hollow viscus or mesenteric injuries in children with a seat belt sign accounted for the difference in rates of IAI between the groups. The seat belt sign was independently associated with IAI after adjustment for vomiting, hypotension, altered mental status, evidence of thoracic trauma, and abdominal or costal margin pain (risk ratio [RR] 1.8, 95% CI 1.3-2.4). Among patients with normal or near-normal mental status and

         While digital rectal exams are not routinely helpful in the evaluation of pediatric trauma patients, they should be performed if the mechanism of injury or examination indicate possible spinal cord injury.

         In hemodynamically unstable patients, hemoglobin and hematocrit should be measured frequently. A decline in these values over time indicates profuse hemorrhage. In hemodynamically stable patients with abdominal pain or tenderness after significant blunt trauma, hemoglobin and hematocrit should be followed serially (every four to six hours until measurement is unchanged) because the initial hemoglobin and hematocrit in a patient with acute blood loss can be normal if equilibration of intravascular volume has not yet occurred. An initial hematocrit of less than 30 percent suggests severe blood loss. (See

         Type and cross for packed RBCs permits efficient transition to type specific blood product transfusion if crystalloid fluid resuscitation does not reverse shock. The emergency clinician should order a blood type and crossmatch for any victim of significant blunt abdominal trauma in anticipation of the need for transfusion. For the patient with evidence of a potentially life-threatening intra-abdominal hemorrhage, O negative uncrossmatched packed RBCs should be given emergently. Consideration should also be given to transfusing with whole blood, if available [

         Urinalysis is usually performed as a screening test for genitourinary and renal trauma and to assess the need for imaging. Observational studies suggest that CT of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous (IV) contrast is only indicated in children with gross hematuria, microscopic hematuria ≥50 RBCs per high-powered field, vertical deceleration injuries (eg, falls &gt;20 feet), and/or physical signs of renal injury (eg, flank pain or ecchymosis) [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24,25
         </a>

         Hematuria is variably present in patients with serious renal injury and may be transient. Thus, the first urine sample obtained from the patient should be tested for blood.

         Extended focused assessment with sonography for trauma (e-FAST) is a rapid ultrasound examination of four abdominal locations (right upper quadrant, left upper quadrant, subxiphoid region, and pelvis) performed at the bedside of the injured patient. The primary utility of this examination for the unstable trauma patient is the detection of hemopericardium and/or intraperitoneal fluid secondary to IAI. Unstable children with blunt abdominal trauma and intraperitoneal fluid on e-FAST may warrant operative intervention in lieu of CT of the abdomen and pelvis.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a hemodynamically stable child with blunt abdominal trauma, a positive e-FAST by a trained and experienced physician indicates that IAI is likely, while a negative e-FAST should not exclude further workup for IAI because e-FAST has inadequate sensitivity and specificity, especially for solid organ or hollow viscus injury. For example, in a meta-analysis of eight prospective studies (2135 children), e-FAST examinations for IAI had a pooled sensitivity of 35 percent and specificity of 96 percent [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>

         Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is an emerging alternative or complementary imaging modality for evaluation of pediatric trauma, particularly in low-energy blunt abdominal trauma. CEUS is more sensitive compared with baseline ultrasound and nearly as sensitive as CT in characterizing solid organ trauma [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36
         </a>
         ]. A meta-analysis showed that CEUS had 98 percent sensitivity for detecting solid organ injuries [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. CEUS can avoid the use of ionizing radiation and is particularly useful in monitoring known injuries for patients managed nonoperatively [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. However, further study is needed to establish appropriate guidelines for pediatric trauma.

         Abdominal and pelvic CT with IV contrast is the preferred diagnostic imaging modality to detect IAI in hemodynamically stable children who have sustained significant blunt abdominal trauma. CT is both sensitive and specific in diagnosing liver, spleen, and retroperitoneal injuries. It is, however, less sensitive in identifying hollow viscus injuries. (See

         We suggest that hemodynamically stable children undergoing CT of the abdomen and pelvis after blunt trauma receive only IV contrast, rather than both IV and oral contrast. In a preplanned subanalysis of a multicenter, prospective observational study of 5276 children undergoing CT with IV contrast of whom 1010 also received oral contrast, the sensitivity for identifying intra-abdominal injury was
         <strong>
          not

         significantly different with or without oral contrast (99 versus 98 percent, respectively) [

          40
         </a>
         ]. The specificity for IAI was 4 percent greater among those patients who received oral contrast (85 versus 81 percent). Trauma centers that only use IV contrast report similar detection of abdominal injuries during the initial evaluation of children with blunt abdominal trauma when compared to centers that continue to use oral and IV contrast.

         In the above subanalysis, patients who received oral contrast had a significantly longer delay (median 12 minutes) in undergoing CT compared with children who received IV contrast alone. This delay in determination of intra-abdominal injury in the stable pediatric trauma patient is of great concern, especially in patients with time sensitive injuries to other parts of the body such as the head, chest, or extremities.

         Initial CT alone is less sensitive in detecting injuries of the pancreas, intestinal tract, and bladder. In particular, the presence of blunt hollow viscus injury is often subtle and may not be identified on the first abdominal and pelvic CT, and recognition may require a high index of suspicion and hospital observation over time to make the diagnosis.

         The absolute risk of IAI for the 5034 children who met all seven of these criteria was 0.1 percent. However, 23 percent of these patients underwent abdominal and pelvic CT. The six very low-risk patients who did have IAI had other features commonly associated with IAI (eg, hematuria, elevated liver enzymes, a distracting injury, or ethanol intoxication). Thus, implementation of this rule, if validated, has significant potential to reduce the number of abdominal and pelvic CTs in children. The authors note that failure to meet the very low-risk criteria derived in this study is
         <strong>
          not

         Abdominal CT is performed instead of DPL in the hemodynamically stable child because DPL is less injury- and organ-specific, cannot detect retroperitoneal injury, and has potential risks, including the introduction of air or fluid into the abdomen, peritoneal irritation, and false positive results that may lead to exploratory surgery when clinical observation would be the more appropriate treatment [

         Definitive management of children with intra-abdominal injury (IAI) after blunt trauma should be determined by a pediatric surgeon with trauma expertise, whenever possible. In regions in which such expertise is not available, a trauma surgeon with pediatric expertise is also acceptable. Most hemodynamically stable children with IAI can be managed nonoperatively.

         Careful observation without operative intervention for hemodynamically stable children with solid organ injuries from blunt abdominal trauma, in a facility with operative capability and surgical expertise, is a standard practice that is safe and improves patient outcome and resource utilization. In addition, preservation of the spleen in children with splenic injuries avoids the infectious risks associated with splenectomy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13899.html" rel="external">
          "Liver, spleen, and pancreas injury in children with blunt abdominal trauma", section on 'Principles of nonoperative management'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, whenever possible, initial care for children with blunt abdominal trauma should occur in pediatric trauma centers (PTC). When this option is not available, consultation with and transfer to a PTC for ongoing management is strongly encouraged. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6571.html" rel="external">

         Despite the proven advantages of nonoperative management for solid organ injuries from blunt abdominal trauma, observational studies document that children cared for in general hospitals are significantly more likely to undergo splenectomy than those cared for in children's hospitals [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50-53
         </a>
         ]. Thus, strategies need to be created to increase compliance with guidelines for the nonoperative management of solid organ injury in children that target clinicians and other clinicians in general hospitals, where the majority of injured children receive care.

         Preoperative bedside ultrasonography (extended focused assessment with sonography for trauma [e-FAST]) is useful for the rapid, early evaluation of hemodynamically unstable children with potential blunt abdominal trauma (see

          'Ultrasonography'
