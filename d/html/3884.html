         A number of factors are important when administering vaccines to healthy adults. These issues include the type of immunization to be used, safety, the responsibilities of the individual giving the vaccination, and proper storage.

         Most vaccinations induce active immunity by promoting the development of antibody in the recipient, a response which is expected to be durable. Passive immunization, which usually involves the administration of a globulin product, produces transient immunity for a specific exposure through the transfer of antibody directly.

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The goal of active immunization of a vaccine or toxoid is to stimulate the host to produce a primary immune response (usually by inducing B-cell proliferation, antibody response, and T-cell sensitization). If an individual is subsequently exposed to the pathogen against which the vaccine is directed, the exposure results in a secondary response that includes increased proliferation of B cells and formation of antibodies. The secondary response protects the individual from developing disease, ideally for life.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some vaccines require boosters to sustain protection. Vaccines used for active immunization are derived from whole killed bacteria, live attenuated bacteria or viruses, or antigenic subunits of organisms. Toxoids used for active immunization are bacterial toxins that are modified to render them nontoxic. Toxoids induce the formation of antitoxin antibody. If the host is exposed to the bacterial toxin after immunization, the antitoxin antibody binds to the bacterial toxin, thereby preventing toxin-mediated disease.

         derived from pooled human serum or antitoxin derived from serum harvested from immunized animals). Passive immunization offers short-term protection to people who have been or will be exposed to a specific pathogen and is typically used by immunocompromised patients who are unable to produce an effective immune response with active immunization. Passive immunization is not routinely recommended for healthy adults because the majority of adults are capable of producing a durable immune response through active immunization. Passive immunization is occasionally used for health care workers, pregnant women, and international travelers. (See appropriate topic reviews).

         The recommended method of storage, preparation, and route of administration of each vaccine is described in the package insert; these instructions must be followed precisely  (

         Recommendations regarding practical issues, such as vaccination spacing and timing, injection techniques, and storage and handling, are also available in the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines, which are available at the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's)

         While every effort should be made to adhere to the recommended immunization schedule, it is not necessary to restart the series of any vaccine, even when the interval between doses is prolonged. Subsequent immunizations should continue on the originally recommended immunization schedule.

         Most adult vaccines are administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously, usually in or over the deltoid muscle. Anticoagulation is not a contraindication to vaccination. One study evaluated the safety of influenza vaccine administered either subcutaneously or intramuscularly and found no greater adverse effects, including hemorrhage, with the intramuscular route [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Even though vaccination is recommended, the ACIP suggests that a 23-gauge or smaller caliber needle be used for intramuscular vaccination of patients with bleeding disorders or those taking anticoagulants. Firm pressure should be applied to the vaccination site, without rubbing for two minutes [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Deltoid intramuscular injections should be administered at the midpoint of the muscle, two to three fingers' width below the acromion process  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114648" href="/z/d/graphic/114648.html" rel="external">
          figure 3
         </a>
         ). The injection should be administered at a 90° angle; no aspiration is needed. In addition, the correct needle length should be used, which depends on weight and sex. The objective is to inject into the muscle, rather than through it (which can increase risk for bursitis). The CDC recommends needle lengths of 5/8 inch for individuals &lt;60 kg, 1 inch for individuals 60 to 70 kg, 1.0 to 1.5 inch for women 70 to 90 kg and men 70 to 118 kg, and 1.5 inch for women &gt;90 kg and men &gt;118 kg [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Subcutaneous injection should be given with a 23 to 25 gauge needle with a needle length of 5/8 to 3/4 inch.
        </p>
        <p>
         In general, gluteal administration should be avoided for standard immunizations. The immunogenicity of the hepatitis B vaccine is diminished when given in the buttock. (See

         Most vaccines can be administered simultaneously at different sites without compromising efficacy. For adults of all ages, coadministration of the pneumococcal and influenza vaccine appears safe and does not compromise efficacy of either vaccine. In a Finnish study of 9336 individuals ages 65 years and older, the group of 4755 who received simultaneous pneumococcal and influenza vaccines experienced approximately double the number of mild local reactions and fevers compared to the 4581 receiving influenza vaccine alone (441 per 1000 vaccinations versus 284 per 1000 for local reactions and 10 per 1000 versus 24 per 1000 for fever) [

         Live virus vaccines should either be administered on the same day or subsequent immunization with live virus vaccines should be delayed one month to avoid the theoretical concern that the immune response to one or both might be impaired.

         The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 requires that health care providers who administer vaccines to adults or children follow vaccine directives, maintain records, and report adverse events.
        </p>
        <p>
         All providers are expected to provide vaccine information statements (VIS) to their patients prior to administering a vaccine. VIS statements are created by the CDC and can be found at the following link:

         Most vaccines are safe to administer, causing only minor side effects. The more common problem with immunization is the missed opportunity to vaccinate based in part upon public misconceptions about the safety of immunization. Many vaccines and toxoids cause side effects such as fever, local reactions at the site of injection, or even serum sickness-like reactions. These adverse reactions can be caused by the immunogenic moiety in the vaccine or by trace amounts of antibiotics, preservatives, stabilizers, and residual animal proteins [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8

         There have been marked improvements in immunization rates in adults 65 years and older. The national goals of Healthy People 2020 focus on increasing immunization rates and reducing preventable infectious diseases in adults as well as children. Specific goals directed at adults include increasing coverage of 17 vaccines administered across the life span [

Medicare Part B reimburses for both the influenza and pneumococcal vaccine. Despite the institutional support for immunization, vaccine delivery to adults is poor.

          Immunization rates

         – Pediatric immunization programs in the United States have been very successful; the majority of preschool children are immunized against targeted diseases and few children die annually of vaccine-preventable diseases. There have also been marked improvements in immunization rates in adults 65 years and older, although the rates are lower than in children. Immunization rates for younger adults at risk for pneumococcus and influenza remain unacceptably low. (See

         – Most vaccinations induce active immunity by promoting the development of antibody in the recipient, a response which is expected to be durable. Passive immunization, which usually involves the administration of a globulin product, produces transient immunity for a specific exposure through the transfer of antibody directly. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Type of immunization'
         </a>
         above.)

          Administration of vaccine
         </strong>
         – The recommended method of storage, preparation, and route of administration of each vaccine is described in the package insert; these instructions must be followed precisely  (

          Reporting of adverse events
