Chronic diarrhea can be caused by a wide variety of disorders, ranging from an intolerance to a specific food (or component, eg, lactose) to a symptom of a broader multisystem condition. Many children with mild or intermittent symptoms can ultimately be classified as having functional diarrhea after an appropriate clinical evaluation.</p><p>This review describes a clinical approach to evaluating children with chronic diarrhea that first presents after six months of age. Other aspects of chronic diarrhea in children are presented separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5877.html" rel="external">"Overview of the causes of chronic diarrhea in children in resource-abundant settings"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/117487.html" rel="external">"Approach to chronic diarrhea in neonates and young infants (&lt;6 months)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H348834680"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diarrhea</strong> – Objective definitions of diarrhea are based on stool weight or volume. However, because assessment of daily stool weights/volumes is difficult in the outpatient clinic setting, changes in the frequency and consistency of stool compared with baseline can also be used as a convenient indicator of diarrhea. Thus, diarrhea can be defined by one or both of the following measures:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Stool weight</strong> – Daily stool weight greater than 250 g in children that weigh more than 10 kg is considered diarrhea. In young children (&lt;10 kg), stool in excess of 20 g/kg/day is abnormal.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Stool consistency</strong> – The Bristol stool chart helps define stool consistencies [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. Diarrheal stools typically correspond to types 6 and 7 on the Bristol stool chart [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. However, if the stool volume is low, isolated loose stools are not a significant predictor of underlying disease in the absence of weight loss, dehydration, or significant changes in biochemical/nutritional indicators [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chronic diarrhea</strong> – Chronic diarrhea is generally defined as diarrhea lasting more than four weeks [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. This timeline is selected to distinguish between the acute diarrheal episode, which tends to be self-limited, and more prolonged diarrheal disease that warrants further evaluation and possibly intervention.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Persistent diarrhea</strong> – Persistent diarrhea is sometimes defined as diarrhea lasting longer than two weeks, but, other times, this term is used interchangeably with chronic diarrhea.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF THE CAUSES OF CHRONIC DIARRHEA IN CHILDHOOD</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The causes of chronic diarrhea in children are shown in the table, grouped by the underlying mechanism  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56837" href="/d/graphic/56837.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). These include several common and benign causes, including excessive sugar intake; physiologic lactase nonpersistence (hypolactasia); diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D); and drug-induced, infectious, and postinfectious diarrheas. Other less common causes include immune-mediated conditions, alterations in pancreatic function, and neuroendocrine abnormalities. These causes are discussed in more detail in a separate topic review. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5877.html" rel="external">"Overview of the causes of chronic diarrhea in children in resource-abundant settings"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">INITIAL EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Chronic diarrhea is typically evaluated in an outpatient setting. Selected patients with warning signs may require more extensive or urgent evaluation, sometimes in the inpatient setting.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Warning signs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The first step is to identify any warning signs or symptoms suggesting a rapidly progressive or severe systemic disorder  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef134916" href="/d/graphic/134916.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Children with warning signs may require hospital admission and an expedited evaluation. Key warning signs are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fever</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Gross blood in stool</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Growth faltering or weight loss</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nausea, vomiting</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Severe abdominal distension or tenderness</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hepatosplenomegaly or mass</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3049550549"><span class="h2">History and physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The next step is to perform a focused history  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81662" href="/d/graphic/81662.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) and physical examination  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef134917" href="/d/graphic/134917.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) to investigate common causes of chronic diarrhea.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1300487532"><span class="h2">Initial laboratory testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In addition, perform basic laboratory screening:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Celiac disease</strong> – All children with chronic diarrhea should be screened for celiac disease by measuring immunoglobulin A antibodies to tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTg-IgA), usually in conjunction with total IgA to exclude the possibility of IgA deficiency. This screen is only valid if the child's diet includes gluten. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5899.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/100553.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of celiac disease in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5907.html" rel="external">"Management of celiac disease in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other tests</strong> – Other tests depend on the child's presenting characteristics and prior testing, as outlined in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef134918" href="/d/graphic/134918.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). For most children, we include a complete blood count and fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin at this stage of the workup, often with stool cultures and <em>Clostridioides</em> <em>difficile</em> testing if not already done.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1966935036"><span class="h1">PROVISIONAL DIAGNOSIS AND INITIAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>After the above evaluation, the cause of the diarrhea usually can be narrowed to one of the following categories  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef134919" href="/d/graphic/134919.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2017733641"><span class="h2">Celiac disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A provisional diagnosis of celiac disease can be made based on positive IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase antibodies (tTG-IgA).

Several enteric pathogens cause acute inflammatory diarrhea, but these infections are rarely chronic unless the patient is immunocompromised. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5877.html" rel="external">"Overview of the causes of chronic diarrhea in children in resource-abundant settings", section on 'Persistent or recurrent infection'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)</strong> – Children with inflammatory diarrhea should also be evaluated for IBD, starting with a clinical evaluation and basic laboratory screening, including a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein, and albumin. Children with abnormal results suggesting IBD or severe symptoms should undergo a full evaluation, including small bowel contrast radiographs, colonoscopy, and upper endoscopy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5879.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H487916872"><span class="h2">Drug-related diarrhea</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A history that the onset of diarrhea coincided with antibiotic or other drug use should prompt consideration of diarrhea due to drug side effect. The initial evaluation should include an empiric trial of drug removal/dose reduction if possible. Drugs that are commonly associated with diarrhea are summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71449" href="/d/graphic/71449.html" rel="external">table 6</a>) and discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5877.html" rel="external">"Overview of the causes of chronic diarrhea in children in resource-abundant settings", section on 'Drug-induced causes'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4246965058"><span class="h2">Diet-induced diarrhea</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Diet-induced diarrhea refers to diarrhea that is caused or exacerbated by osmotic load in the intestinal lumen. The primary cause may be a specific dietary component or impaired digestion and absorption of nutrients, including food protein-induced intestinal injury  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef134921" href="/d/graphic/134921.html" rel="external">algorithm 3</a>).</p><p>Clues that diarrhea is diet induced (ie, related to the osmotic load in the intestinal lumen) include mild or moderate severity and predominantly postprandial pattern. Conversely, diarrheal symptoms that persist while asleep (nocturnal diarrhea) suggest that a component of the watery stools is secondary to abnormal electrolyte absorption and intestinal secretion and less dependent on the osmotic load provided by luminal nutrients. One exception is that young children with functional diarrhea sometimes have very low-volume nocturnal episodes of diarrhea.</p><p>Supportive evidence from the dietary history may include  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81662" href="/d/graphic/81662.html" rel="external">table 3</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Onset coincided with a change in diet, such as changing from formula to unmodified cow's milk or calorically denser formulas or an increase in dietary sugars.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Excessive consumption of fruit juice or other source of simple sugars (fructose) or poorly absorbed carbohydrates (<a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12801" href="/d/drug information/12801.html" rel="external">sorbitol</a> or xylitol) and/or episodes of diarrhea coincide with ingesting certain foods, including lactose or common allergens.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diarrheal symptoms associated with the consumption of sucrose (and/or starch) may be attributable to congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. Although this defect is present from birth, it does not become apparent until sucrose or starches are introduced into the diet (eg, in some infant formulas or in solid foods introduced in later infancy).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unexplained aversion to certain foods that most children like.</p><p></p><p>If a dietary trigger seems likely, initial testing should include an empiric dietary elimination trial and, potentially, a more detailed diet history and food diary. Specifically, a brief two- to three-day trial of a low-lactose diet should be routinely suggested because new-onset lactose intolerance is a common cause of chronic diarrhea in school-aged children; this may be physiologic lactase nonpersistence (hypolactasia) or postinfectious. (See <a class="local">'Dietary changes'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H859402626"><span class="h2">Postinfectious diarrhea</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Diarrhea that began abruptly after an acute enteric infection is often related to residual mucosal damage, causing temporary loss of lactase and other abnormalities that cause malabsorption. Therefore, postinfectious diarrhea often has a diet-induced component (eg, exacerbated by lactose). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5877.html" rel="external">"Overview of the causes of chronic diarrhea in children in resource-abundant settings", section on 'Postinfectious malabsorptive diarrhea'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2248451459"><span class="h2">Functional diarrhea</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A functional gastrointestinal disorder is likely if the above causes are ruled out and if the symptoms are mild or intermittent.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In young children, mild or intermittent diarrhea that is otherwise unexplained is often considered functional, although it may be exacerbated by excessive fructose or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12801" href="/d/drug information/12801.html" rel="external">sorbitol</a> consumption [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. This pattern is common in this age group and is sometimes known as "toddler's diarrhea." A selective dietary elimination plan to limit the child's intake of fructose and sorbitol (primarily in fruit juices) often improves the symptoms and serves to confirm the diagnosis [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Dietary changes'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5877.html" rel="external">"Overview of the causes of chronic diarrhea in children in resource-abundant settings", section on 'Functional diarrhea in young children'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In older children, a functional diarrheal disorder (termed irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS-D) is suggested by the presence of inconsistent, intermittent, and/or mild symptoms; abdominal pain; and no evidence of systemic disease or warning signs. The focus should shift to empiric management trials with diet or, occasionally, with medications. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5877.html" rel="external">"Overview of the causes of chronic diarrhea in children in resource-abundant settings", section on 'Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients and their caregivers should be counseled regarding the benign nature of functional disease.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/112.html" rel="external">"Functional abdominal pain in children and adolescents: Management in primary care"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2981865570"><span class="h1">FURTHER TESTING IF THE DIAGNOSIS IS UNCLEAR</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If the etiology of the diarrhea remains unclear and the diarrhea is severe or has features suggesting a pathogenic (rather than functional) disorder  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56837" href="/d/graphic/56837.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), further evaluation may include  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef134918" href="/d/graphic/134918.html" rel="external">table 5</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Endoscopic evaluation</strong> – Endoscopic evaluation of the upper gastrointestinal tract and/or colon with biopsies may provide useful insight into the cause of the diarrhea.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Key findings on endoscopic biopsies include the architecture and relative compositions of epithelial and immune cells and evidence of inflammation. As an example, celiac disease is characterized by duodenal biopsies with shortened villi, long crypts, and expanded numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by diffuse or patchy inflammation, often with ulceration. Several rare disorders may be diagnosed on endoscopy, including eosinophilic gastroenteritis, microscopic colitis, cutaneous and systemic forms of mastocytosis, and polyglandular autoimmune syndrome. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5877.html" rel="external">"Overview of the causes of chronic diarrhea in children in resource-abundant settings", section on 'Immune-mediated causes'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mucosal enzyme tests</strong> – In children with diet-induced diarrhea that remains unexplained after a focused history and dietary trials, endoscopic small bowel mucosal biopsy samples can be used to measure mucosal enzymes (lactase, sucrase, maltase, isomaltase [palatinase], and glucoamylase enzyme activity). The results can support the diagnosis of primary or secondary lactase and/or sucrase-isomaltase deficiency [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. However, the sensitivity and specificity of these tests is limited, likely due to inadequate sampling and/or degradation during storage or processing.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Breath tests</strong> – Lactase deficiency (eg, postinfectious or physiologic lactase nonpersistence) and congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency are usually diagnosed clinically but also may be diagnosed or confirmed by hydrogen breath testing [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is primarily a clinical diagnosis based on the presence of risk factors (eg, dysmotility or anatomic abnormalities that predispose to stasis) with suggestive signs and symptoms (steatorrhea, abdominal bloating, and macrocytic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency); <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13405" href="/d/drug information/13405.html" rel="external">lactulose</a> breath testing may be used to support the diagnosis but is not a definitive test.

A few general approaches are discussed below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19"><span class="h2">Malnutrition</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Chronic diarrhea associated with impaired growth and/or nutritional status should always be considered a serious disease in infants and young children, and therapy should be initiated promptly [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Sufficient calories should be provided to allow for catch-up weight gain. When oral intake is inadequate, or malabsorption precludes the necessary intake, continuous enteral feedings or parenteral nutrition may be required. Parenteral nutrition should be undertaken as soon as other less invasive nutritional approaches have been shown to be unsuccessful.</p><p>Micronutrient and vitamin supplementation are part of nutritional rehabilitation. Children with chronic diarrhea and malnutrition are often deficient in vitamin A, zinc, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13322" href="/d/drug information/13322.html" rel="external">folic acid</a>, copper, and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="98778" href="/d/drug information/98778.html" rel="external">selenium</a> [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Deficiencies in these micronutrients can impair the function of the immune system and have a direct effect on the structure and function of mucosa. Zinc deficiency is a particular risk because of increased losses through the gastrointestinal tract during chronic diarrhea, and empiric replacement of zinc is recommended for children with diarrhea and malnutrition. Zinc deficiency may also impair mucosal recovery as well as appetite, further exacerbating growth failure.</p><p>In resource-abundant settings, nutritional rehabilitation can be accomplished by empiric supplementation with these micronutrients via food or supplements, as well as selective testing and replacement if a specific deficiency is suspected. In resource-limited settings, empiric zinc supplementation is recommended for children with acute or persistent diarrhea.
