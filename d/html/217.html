         Proximal humeral fractures occur most commonly in older adults, and their incidence is increasing. Fractures of the humerus can occur proximally, in the shaft (diaphysis), or distally. The majority of both proximal and midshaft humeral fractures are nondisplaced and can be treated conservatively (ie, nonsurgically). Complex fracture patterns pose greater challenges for treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Proximal fractures of the humerus will be reviewed here. Other injuries around the proximal humerus and shoulder girdle, and other related issues, are discussed separately:

         The humerus is the largest bone in the upper extremity. The proximal humerus articulates with the glenoid of the scapula to form the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81764" href="/z/d/graphic/81764.html" rel="external">
          figure 1

          figure 3
         </a>
         ). The muscles and tendons of the rotator cuff, the acromion, and ligamentous attachments, such as those between the coracoid process of the scapula and the acromion, stabilize the glenohumeral articulation and provide for the shoulder's wide range of motion. The distal humerus articulates with the radius and ulna at the elbow.
        </p>
        <p>
         According to the Neer classification, the proximal humerus is divided into four sections: the anatomical neck, the surgical neck  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67781" href="/z/d/graphic/67781.html" rel="external">
          figure 4
         </a>
         ), the greater tuberosity, and the lesser tuberosity  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67578" href="/z/d/graphic/67578.html" rel="external">
          figure 5
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">

         below.)

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The anatomical neck is at the base of the widened articular surface of the humeral head.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The surgical neck is located at the constriction distal to the humeral head and tuberosities  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67781" href="/z/d/graphic/67781.html" rel="external">
          figure 4
         </a>
         ). The surgical neck is where the articular capsule attaches and several penetrating arteries enter to provide part of the vascular supply to the humeral head.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The greater and lesser tuberosities are the sites of attachment for the tendons of the rotator cuff muscles  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72027" href="/z/d/graphic/72027.html" rel="external">
          figure 6
         </a>
         ). The greater tuberosity is located lateral to the humeral head on the superior aspect of the humerus. It provides the attachment for three of the rotator cuff muscles: supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor. The lesser tuberosity is located on the anterior surface of the humerus and provides the attachment for the subscapularis muscle.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The humeral shaft supplies the attachment for a number of powerful muscles  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef134080" href="/z/d/graphic/134080.html" rel="external">
          figure 7
         </a>
         ). The pectoralis major inserts on the proximal shaft  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105077" href="/z/d/graphic/105077.html" rel="external">
          figure 8
         </a>
         ), while the deltoid muscle attaches to the midshaft. The biceps brachialis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59976" href="/z/d/graphic/59976.html" rel="external">
          figure 9
         </a>
         ) and triceps muscle  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108295" href="/z/d/graphic/108295.html" rel="external">
          figure 10
         </a>
         ) groups attach more distally.
        </p>
        <p>
         The tendon of the long head of the biceps brachialis muscle passes between the lesser and greater tuberosities as it courses in a shallow groove on the anterior surface of the humerus  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98022" href="/z/d/graphic/98022.html" rel="external">
          figure 11
         </a>
         ). The long head tendon attaches to the scapula on the superior portion of the glenoid where its fibers merge with those of the fibrocartilaginous superior glenoid labrum.
        </p>
        <p>
         The proximal humerus receives its blood supply from branches of the axillary artery. Two branches, the anterior and posterior humeral circumflex arteries, originate distal to the anatomic neck and travel proximally to supply the humeral head  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71903" href="/z/d/graphic/71903.html" rel="external">
          figure 12
         </a>
         ). Thus, fractures occurring at the anatomic neck can disrupt the blood supply and result in osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis) of the humeral head. The humeral shaft is supplied by the axillary and the brachial artery, which branches distally to become the radial and ulnar arteries. This vascular supply can be disrupted by a humeral shaft fracture if there is considerable displacement of fragments.
        </p>
        <p>
         Proximity of the humerus to the axillary nerve and brachial plexus accounts for the risk of neurologic injury complicating humeral fractures  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71903" href="/z/d/graphic/71903.html" rel="external">
          figure 12
         </a>

          figure 14
         </a>
         ). Nerve injuries are more likely if there is a proximal humeral fracture that is significantly displaced or a concomitant humeral dislocation [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The axillary and suprascapular nerves are most often affected. Radial nerve injuries may occur with significant displacement of mid to distal shaft fractures. Median and ulnar nerve injuries are uncommon.

         Proximal humeral fractures account for 4 to 5 percent of all fractures [

         ] and are the third most common fracture in older adult patients after those of the hip and distal radius. The incidence of proximal humeral fractures increases with age, with more than 70 percent occurring in patients over 60 years of age and the highest incidence among 73- to 78-year-olds [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4

         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The major risk factors are frequent falls and low bone density [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-7
         </a>
         ]. In many older patients, proximal humeral fractures impair the ability to perform activities of daily living.

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         In older adult individuals, falls are the most common cause of proximal humeral fractures; approximately 87 to 93 percent of fractures occur after a fall from standing [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4,6,7
         </a>
         ]. Less often, these fractures occur from a direct blow or violent muscle contraction (eg, seizure). Anterior or posterior dislocations of the humeral head can occur in association with proximal humeral fractures.

          SYMPTOMS AND EXAMINATION FINDINGS

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Patients with proximal humeral fractures present with moderate to severe shoulder pain that increases with shoulder movement. Patients tend to hold the affected arm adducted against their side. Swelling and ecchymosis may be apparent shortly after injury. Gross shoulder deformities can occur, particularly if the fracture is associated with an anterior or posterior dislocation of the humeral head.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are no specific examination tests for the diagnosis of proximal humeral fractures. Suspect this fracture in older adult patients who have fallen and present with the symptoms or findings described here. Although overlying musculature makes palpation difficult, patients typically have focal tenderness at the proximal humerus.
        </p>
        <p>
         Distal pulses and nerve function must be evaluated, although assessment of motor function is often limited due to pain. Neurovascular injury occurs most often with displaced fractures or fracture-dislocations and usually involves the axillary or suprascapular nerve [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,8
         </a>
         ]. Axillary nerve injury manifests as deltoid muscle weakness and diminished sensation over the mid-deltoid region. Suprascapular nerve injury can manifest as supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscle weakness (ie, weakness with initiation of abduction and external shoulder rotation, respectively).

         Plain radiographs of the shoulder that include a true anteroposterior (AP) view  (

          image 3
         </a>
         ) should be obtained if a proximal humeral fracture is suspected. This is the standard trauma series of radiographs. A Velpeau view, in which the patient's arm is held in internal rotation and the radiograph is oriented superior to inferior while the patient leans backward, is acceptable if an axillary view is unobtainable  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71805" href="/z/d/graphic/71805.html" rel="external">

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         A computed tomography (CT) scan with three-dimensional reconstructions is recommended if the trauma series of plain radiographs described above is nondiagnostic or if further information is necessary regarding the amount of displacement or rotation of a fracture fragment [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9

         </span>
         There are a number of classification systems used to describe proximal humeral fractures. Given the complexity and variety of fracture patterns involved, it is not surprising that both interobserver and intraobserver agreement for classification and treatment is relatively low, regardless of the imaging modality used or the experience of the physician. Of the many classification systems proposed for proximal humeral fractures, the AO and Neer classification schemes are used most often [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. Of these, the Neer system is used most often in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
         The AO classification system distinguishes three basic groups of fractures (and divides these into 27 subtypes): (A) extra-articular unifocal, (B) extra-articular bifocal, and (C) articular. Type C fractures are considered to be higher risk due to the limited vascular supply to the articular segment and the increased risk of avascular necrosis [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. The Neer classification scheme is based on the biomechanical forces involved and the resulting displacement patterns, and it is discussed below.

         Patients with two- to four-part proximal humeral fractures or those with anatomic neck fractures should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon to review treatment options, which are based upon the fracture type, patient characteristics, and surgeon experience. Emergency (ie, immediate) referral is indicated for all nerve and vascular injuries, open fractures, and fracture dislocations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Approximately 80 percent of proximal humeral fractures are nondisplaced or minimally displaced (ie, one-part) and can be treated conservatively (ie, non-operatively) by primary care or other clinicians who are knowledgeable about fracture management [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,12
         </a>
         ]. However, fractures of the anatomic neck have a high rate of subsequent osteonecrosis, and patients with this type of fracture should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon even if there is no significant displacement of the fragments [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13

         Surgical intervention may be needed for significantly displaced, multi-part fractures; thus, all displaced fractures should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon for evaluation. Treatment options include minimally invasive osteosynthesis, percutaneous pinning, open reduction and internal fixation  (

         The results of multiple randomized trials and observational studies suggest that conservative management may be as effective as surgery for many non- or minimally displaced two, three, and four-part surgical neck fractures and for non- or minimally displaced greater tuberosity fractures [

        </p>
        <p>
         A 2001 systematic review of 24 studies limited to three- or four-part fractures found that patients treated conservatively experienced more pain and greater loss of motion [

          25
         </a>
         ]. A subsequent systematic review found high- to moderate-certainty evidence that surgery does not result in better functional outcomes at one and two years after injury compared with non-surgical treatment for people with displaced proximal humeral fractures (two-thirds were three- or four-part fractures) [

         Both reviews determined that there is insufficient evidence from high-quality randomized trials to determine which interventions are best for the management of specific types of proximal humeral fractures. In addition, evidence is limited for patients under 60 years of age, two-part tuberosity fractures, less common fractures (eg, fracture dislocations, articular surface fractures), and injuries sustained from high-energy trauma. Therefore, the best approach in these clinical settings remains unclear.

         The Proximal Fracture of the Humerus Evaluation by Randomization (PROFHER) trial involving 250 patients with a displaced proximal humeral fracture reported no difference in overall shoulder function (as determined by the Oxford Shoulder Score [OSS]) at two- and five-year follow-up between patients treated surgically and those treated nonoperatively [

         ) can be used for pain control but are otherwise not necessary unless the shoulder is unstable. A coaptation splint, which wraps around the humerus lengthwise from the axilla to the top of the shoulder, may provide more support and reduce symptoms for the patient with severe pain. Ice can be used to reduce pain and swelling; pain medications are generally necessary for the first week of treatment. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Patients generally prefer to sleep semirecumbent (eg, in a reclining chair or propped up with pillows or a wedge in bed) with a sling. Repeat clinical evaluation and radiographs are performed at one week. Careful attention should be paid to the skin, especially in older adult patients with swelling and ecchymosis.

         Shoulder rehabilitation after proximal humeral fractures is important; however, the optimal timing for beginning rehabilitation remains uncertain. Multiple randomized trials report no significant harm and possibly improved mobility among patients whose initial immobilization is two weeks or less and who begin gentle mobility exercises at that time. For patients with nondisplaced or minimally displaced one- or two-part fractures, a shorter period of immobilization, perhaps as little as one week, does not adversely affect fracture healing and may be associated with better short-term pain control and shoulder function [

         The first of a series of two-week follow-up visits focuses on pain control and upper extremity range of motion. Patients are encouraged to discontinue their sling within two to four weeks of the injury and to perform gentle, passive range of motion exercises of the elbow and shoulder. Pendulum  (

         ) exercises should be done at least twice daily. If patients are unable to perform these exercises, a referral to physical therapy for assistance improving passive range of motion is necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
         The goal of shoulder rehabilitation is to restore strength and mobility, including abduction, flexion, extension, and rotation. Exercises in which the patient places their hand on a wall or holds a ball against a wall to improve motion can begin within two to four weeks. Patients can initiate these motions against gravity at four weeks and progress to elastic band or resistance exercises once adequate motion has been achieved and there is sufficient evidence of healing by radiographs. The details of rehabilitation for proximal humeral fractures are beyond the scope of this monograph, but the systematic review cited here emphasizes the importance of early mobilization and outlines a program suitable for most patients [
         <a href="#rid31">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         After eight weeks, the time between visits may be increased to every three to four weeks. The focus of these visits is to further improve shoulder range of motion and overall function. Functional measures of motion include the ability to touch the neck and lower back and to abduct the arm overhead.
        </p>
        <p>
         Over subsequent weeks, the patient follows a progression of exercises designed to maximize shoulder mobility and strength. Most patients with nondisplaced or minimally displaced fractures of the proximal humerus who adhere to a well-designed rehabilitation program regain over 90 percent of the function and 85 percent of the motion of their unaffected shoulder [

         Loss of shoulder motion and function is more likely to develop in patients who do not perform range of motion exercises during recovery. (See

         Severely displaced or angulated fractures can cause neurovascular injury, most commonly to the circumflex artery and the axillary or suprascapular nerve. One prospective study of 142 patients with proximal humeral fractures found evidence of some denervation using an electromyogram in 67 percent of patients [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Injury to the axillary nerve accounted for 58 percent of cases, while injury to the suprascapular nerve accounted for 48 percent. All patients recovered full function of the nerve and muscles.

         Proximal humeral fractures are sometimes associated with dislocations of the humeral head or rotator cuff tears, which can cause significant loss of motion or instability. Studies using dynamic ultrasound have found that 20 to 50 percent of patients with proximal humeral fractures have associated rotator cuff tears [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32,33
         </a>
         ]. A prospective study involving magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reported that 71 percent of patients had rotator cuff abnormalities and 40 percent had at least one torn or avulsed tendon [

         Although osteonecrosis of the humeral head is not common, it can occur, especially in fractures involving the anatomic neck or severely displaced fractures. Other complications include nonunion and impingement from avulsed fracture fragments. A study of 160 patients managed nonoperatively reported delayed union or nonunion in 7 percent of patients [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In a study of 2230 older adult patients with a proximal humeral fracture, researchers evaluated a tool with 19 elements (proximal humeral assessment of risk of nonunion model; PHARON) to assess healing and the risk for nonunion [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. The overall nonunion rate was 10.4 percent at 24 weeks. A head-shaft angle (HSA) of &gt;140 degrees or a valgus malalignment of the fracture were independent variables associated with a low nonunion rate (0.8 percent; n = 3). If the HSA was &lt;140 degrees, the risk of nonunion was increased among patients who were smokers or whose fractures had increased head-shaft translation (HST) or varus alignment. The prevalence of nonunion was low (1 percent) in cohorts with both an HSA of 90 to 140 degrees and HST of &lt;50 percent, whereas the risk was much higher (83.7 percent) in the 8.3 percent with an HSA of &lt;90 degrees and HST of &gt;50 percent. Further validation of this assessment tool is warranted.

         Return to work typically occurs two to three weeks after a proximal humeral fracture, provided the patient can return in the sling and the job does not require full use of the affected arm. Patients whose jobs include two-handed labor or lifting will likely not be able to return for 8 to 12 weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
         Criteria for return to work include adequate range of motion and strength as well as stable callus formation on radiographs. The same criteria are used to determine the return to sports. Cardiovascular fitness after a proximal humeral fracture can be maintained by low-impact activities such as walking or use of an elliptical trainer or stationary bike.

          Epidemiology and mechanism
         </strong>
         – Proximal humeral fractures account for 4 to 5 percent of all fractures, and the incidence increases with advancing age. They often occur as a result of falling from a standing height. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Epidemiology and risk factors'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Presentation and examination
         </strong>
         – Swelling and ecchymosis may be apparent soon after the injury. Gross deformity of the shoulder suggests an associated anterior or posterior dislocation. Concomitant neurologic or vascular injury should be suspected and neurovascular integrity carefully assessed. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Symptoms and examination findings'

          Classification

          Initial care and indications for orthopedic referral

         – Complex proximal humeral fractures (ie, Neer two-part to four-part fractures;  (

          figure 16
         </a>
         )) and fractures that involve the anatomical neck should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon. These are initially managed with immobilization using a standard sling or, if unstable, a sling and swathe. Closed reduction of the fracture is
         <strong>
          NOT
         </strong>
         recommended prior to orthopedic referral.

         Orthopedic referral is not required for one-part fractures unless the fracture involves the anatomic neck, there are neurovascular complications, there is a concomitant shoulder dislocation, or the treating clinician is not experienced in fracture management. (See

         <strong>
          Nonoperative management of one-part fractures
         </strong>
         – Approximately 80 percent of proximal humeral fractures are impacted or nondisplaced (Neer one-part fractures) and are amenable to closed, nonoperative management. Initial care consists of immobilization with a standard or collar and cuff sling, ice, and analgesics. Neither splinting nor casting is required. We suggest that early mobilization with gentle pendulum exercises be performed in the sling beginning one to two weeks after the injury. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Initial treatment'

         <strong>
          Follow up care of one-part fractures
         </strong>
         – Periodic follow-up visits allow assessment of range of motion, strength, and function. Generally, the first appointment occurs one week following the injury, with subsequent follow-up every two weeks for two months, followed by visits every three to four weeks until complete radiographic healing is documented.

         <strong>
          Return to activity
         </strong>
         – Return to work can be expected in two to three weeks if the patient can perform the required duties while in a sling. Return to occupations that require full use of the shoulder or to sports is not advised until strength and range of motion are acceptable and stable healing is apparent on radiographs. (See
