However, most children with out-toeing have variations of normal lower-extremity development that will improve spontaneously and can be monitored by the primary care provider.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of lower-extremity rotational development, common causes of out-toeing, pathologic causes of out-toeing that must be excluded, and an approach to the evaluation and management of the child with out-toeing. In-toeing is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14481.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with in-toeing"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H141828373"><span class="h1">NORMAL PHYSIOLOGIC ALIGNMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An understanding of the normal growth and development of the lower extremity is essential in evaluating a child's rotational alignment and helps to elucidate the mechanism of out-toeing. Rotational alignment of the lower extremity is determined by the alignment of the foot, the rotation of the tibia in relation to the transcondylar axis of the femur (tibial torsion), and the rotation of the neck of the femur in relation to the transcondylar axis of the femur (femoral anteversion)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56825" href="/d/graphic/56825.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). In-toeing and out-toeing may be accentuated between six months and five years, when children are developing their walking and coordination skills [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Normal growth and improved coordination typically lead to spontaneous resolution of rotational variations  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64901" href="/d/graphic/64901.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>Intrauterine positioning has an important influence on the rotational alignment of the legs. At the seventh week of gestation, the lower limb rotates medially (internally), followed by external (lateral) rotation of the upper leg. For the remainder of gestation, the tibiae and feet are medially (internally) rotated, and the hips and femora are laterally (externally) rotated, resulting in an external rotation contracture at the hip joint  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79381" href="/d/graphic/79381.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Normal newborn posture reflects intrauterine positioning. The hips are flexed and externally rotated, with the patellae pointing outward. The tibiae and feet remain relatively internally rotated, but this is overshadowed by the external rotation contracture at the hip [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Out-toeing due to external rotation contracture of the hip usually resolves by the time the child begins walking [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H141829701"><span class="h1">COMMON CAUSES OF OUT-TOEING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common causes of out-toeing are external rotation contracture of the hip, external tibial torsion, and femoral retroversion  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80335" href="/d/graphic/80335.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Concomitant occurrence of these conditions is uncommon.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H141829708"><span class="h2">External rotation contracture of the hip</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The normal intrauterine position of flexed and externally rotated hips results in an external rotation contracture of the hips. This causes out-toeing when the young child is lying down as well as when they begin to stand and walk. When combined with physiologic tibia vara, hip external rotation contracture may accentuate the appearance of bowed legs. External rotation contracture of the hip is typically bilateral and symmetrical.</p><p>Characteristic examination features include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bilateral and symmetrical out-toeing</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When standing and walking, both the patella and feet point away from the midline (external foot progression angle and external patella progression angle) (see <a class="local">'Observation of gait'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased hip external rotation compared with internal rotation (see <a class="local">'Focused examination of the lower extremities'</a> below)</p><p></p><p>Out-toeing due to external hip rotation contracture usually resolves around 12 months of age when the child begins to walk [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The management of external rotation contracture of the hip is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'External rotation contracture of the hip'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H141829715"><span class="h2">External tibial torsion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>External tibial torsion is likely a result of intrauterine positioning but is usually discovered in late childhood (four to seven years of age) or early adolescence [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. It may be more common in preterm infants secondary to prone positioning in the neonatal period [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. It is often unilateral and is more common on the right side [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>Characteristic examination features include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When standing and walking the foot points outward relative to the patella (external foot progression angle) (see <a class="local">'Observation of gait'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The medial malleolus is anterior to the lateral malleolus (with the child seated with the thigh directly in front of the hip joint and the knee pointed straight ahead) (see <a class="local">'Focused examination of the lower extremities'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the prone position the thigh foot angle is external  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68556" href="/d/graphic/68556.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>) (see <a class="local">'Focused examination of the lower extremities'</a> below)</p><p></p><p>Since normal development of the tibia causes external rotation, external tibial torsion often does not improve spontaneously, and out-toeing due to external tibial torsion may worsen over time. Despite this, external tibial torsion rarely causes pain or functional abnormalities. Problems associated with external tibial torsion may include difficulty in parallel skiing [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], patellofemoral instability, and patellofemoral pain [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Knee pain from external tibial torsion is most common when associated with increased femoral anteversion (also known as "miserable malalignment," "torsional malalignment syndrome," or "malignant malalignment syndrome") [<a href="#rid6">6,10,11</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/204.html" rel="external">"Patellofemoral pain", section on 'Malalignment'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H141829722"><span class="h2">Femoral retroversion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Femoral retroversion is a rare cause of out-toeing. It is associated with increased external rotation and decreased internal rotation at the hip joint. It is more commonly observed in obese children [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6554.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H141829729"><span class="h1">UNCOMMON PATHOLOGIC CAUSES OF OUT-TOEING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Uncommon, pathologic causes of out-toeing may include slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease (LCP, idiopathic osteonecrosis of the hip), and neuromuscular disorders. Although these etiologies are uncommon, they must be considered in the evaluation of a child with out-toeing because they do not resolve spontaneously and may result in long term disability. They can generally be excluded through history, physical examination, and radiographs.</p><p>SCFE and LCP may result in proximal femoral deformity causing a derangement in hip rotation with resultant out-toeing. Children with SCFE or LCP most commonly have limited hip internal rotation. They may present with acute or chronic pain in the hip, thigh, or knee with a limp and out-toeing, which is usually unilateral. Examination may demonstrate painful range of motion of the hip with decreased internal rotation and increased external rotation. Anteroposterior and frog leg (lateral) pelvis radiographs should be obtained in children with suspected SCFE or LCP. Referral to an orthopedic surgeon is also warranted in such children. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2856.html" rel="external">"Approach to hip pain in childhood", section on 'Legg-Calvé-Perthes and secondary avascular necrosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6554.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE)", section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Mild hemiplegic cerebral palsy rarely may present with an out-toeing gait [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Spasticity secondary to cerebral palsy may result in over-pull of the evertors of the foot, which may cause an asymmetric, unilateral out-toeing gait. Asymmetry is a red flag. The history may reveal perinatal problems or abnormal developmental milestones. Examination may demonstrate spasticity of the gastro-soleus, hamstrings, peroneal muscles, and hip adductors [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Such findings should prompt referral to a specialist (eg, neurologist, physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist) for evaluation for cerebral palsy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6167.html" rel="external">"Cerebral palsy: Classification and clinical features"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H141830149"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The presenting complaints for a child with out-toeing may include concerns about appearance of the legs or foot, excessive falling, awkward running style, and uneven shoe wear.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H141830452"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The objectives of the evaluation are to identify caregiver concerns (eg, cosmesis, frequent falling, permanent disability, interference with sports performance), identify the cause of out-toeing, and exclude pathologic etiologies.

The examination should include observation of gait, focused examination of the lower extremity, and neurologic examination. In some cases, evaluation of the parental rotational profile also may be helpful.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H141830473"><span class="h3">Observation of gait</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If the child is ambulatory, the child's gait should be observed as the child walks toward and away from the examiner [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The presence or absence of a limp should be noted. </p><p>The foot progression and patellar progression angles should be noted. These angles describe the alignment of the foot and patella, respectively, as they relate to the direction that the patient is moving.<strong> </strong>An external foot progression angle describes a foot that points away from the midline as the patient walks forward  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75796" href="/d/graphic/75796.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). An external patellar progression angle describes a patella that points away from the midline as the patient walks forward. External rotation hip contracture, external tibial torsion, and femoral retroversion generally have external foot and patellar progression angles, although the patellar progression angle may be neutral in external tibial torsion  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80335" href="/d/graphic/80335.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p>The child should also be observed while running [<a href="#rid6">6,18</a>]. Running may accentuate neurologic dysfunction and rotational variations. Unilateral limp while walking or running should raise suspicion of pathologic causes of out-toeing.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H141830480"><span class="h3">Focused examination of the lower extremities</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Examination of the rotational alignment of the lower extremities is best done with the patient lying prone on the examination table [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The caregivers should be encouraged to stand with the examiner next to the patient so that they can appreciate the findings as the examination is performed. The examination should progress through the three main sites for rotational variations: foot, tibia, and femur/hip. This can be accomplished by making the following measurements:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Thigh-foot angle – The thigh-foot angle is measured with the knee flexed and the ankle dorsiflexed so that the plantar surface of the foot is parallel to the ceiling. Allow the foot to fall into a neutral position. A visual line is approximated along the long axis of the thigh and a second line along the long axis of the heel. The angle between these two lines is the thigh-foot angle  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68556" href="/d/graphic/68556.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). If the line of the heel points away from the midline relative to the thigh, it suggests external torsion of the tibia. If the line of the heel points toward the midline relative to the thigh, it suggests internal torsion of the tibia. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Normal values for the thigh-foot angle were determined in a study of 1000 limbs of 500 subjects (all White) ranging in age from &lt;1 to 70 years [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. The average thigh-foot angle at birth is -5 degrees (internal) and increases to 15 degrees (external) at maturity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hip rotation – Hip rotation is measured with the knees flexed  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71765" href="/d/graphic/71765.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>). Internal rotation is measured by rotating the leg away from the axis of the body (rotating the hip internally). External rotation is measured by rotating the leg towards the axis of the body (rotating the hip externally).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Normal values for hip rotation were determined in a study of 1000 limbs of 500 subjects (all White) ranging in age from &lt;1 to 70 years  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71765" href="/d/graphic/71765.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. The average amount of internal hip rotation during childhood ranges between 40 and 50 degrees. The average amount of external hip rotation during childhood ranges between 40 and 70 degrees.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with femoral retroversion will have increased external rotation (to almost 90 degrees) and very little internal rotation [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Conversely, patients with increased femoral anteversion may have as much as 90 degrees of internal rotation, allowing the legs to rotate flat against the examination table. Similarly, they will have a decreased amount of external rotation, often only to neutral.</p><p></p><p>Other aspects of the lower-extremity examination that may be helpful in identifying associated conditions and excluding pathologic causes of out-toeing include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assessment for associated angular variations (knock-knees are associated with external tibial torsion) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6285.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with bow-legs", section on 'Physiologic varus'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6290.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with knock-knees", section on 'Physiologic valgus'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decreased hip internal rotation that is painful or associated with a limp (may indicate SCFE; other clues include unilateral out-toeing and hip, thigh, or knee pain) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6554.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE)"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H141830487"><span class="h3">Parental rotational profiles</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Femoral retroversion and external tibial torsion tend to run in families.

This is of particular importance when there is a family history of out-toeing. Parents and grandparents may recall a time when rotational variations were considered serious problems and were treated with interventions now known to be ineffective (eg, special shoes, orthotics). A brief explanation of how our understanding of these problems has evolved can help reassure families.</p><p>To demonstrate the benign nature of out-toeing, one simple exercise is to have the family member sit down in a public place and observe people walking past.

External rotation contracture of the hip is present in less than 5 percent of children by age 18 months [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].

When combined with increased femoral anteversion ("miserable malalignment syndrome"), patients may develop patellofemoral pain and instability.</p><p>Most children with external tibial torsion can be managed with observation and caregiver reassurance that long term sequelae are rare. Bracing and splinting are ineffective.

These include  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80335" href="/d/graphic/80335.html" rel="external">table 2</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>External rotation contracture of the hip – Physiologic external rotation contracture of the hip is caused by intrauterine positioning and present in children from birth until they begin to walk. External rotation contracture of the hip is characterized by external foot and patella progression angles, increased external rotation, and decreased internal rotation. It usually resolves when children begin to walk. (See <a class="local">'External rotation contracture of the hip'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>External tibial torsion – External tibial torsion is external (lateral) rotation of the tibia in relation to the transcondylar axis of the femur. It may be associated with prematurity and prone positioning. It is characterized by an external foot progression angle and neutral or external patella progression angle, and medial malleolus even with or anterior to the lateral malleolus. External tibial torsion usually does not correct spontaneously and may increase with growth. Although most patients with external tibial torsion remain asymptomatic, there may be an increased risk of patellofemoral pain or instability and knee arthritis. Symptomatic patients may require derotational osteotomy. (See <a class="local">'External tibial torsion'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Femoral retroversion – Femoral retroversion is a rare cause of out-toeing. It is characterized by a decreased angle of rotation of the femoral neck in relation to the transcondylar axis of the femur; gait with outward facing feet and knees; and increased hip external rotation and decreased internal rotation. Femoral retroversion does not improve spontaneously and may be associated with hip or knee arthritis, stress fracture, and slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). (See <a class="local">'Femoral retroversion'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pathologic causes of out-toeing</strong> – Pathologic conditions that must be considered in the evaluation of a child with out-toeing include SCFE, Legg-Calvé-Perthes (LCP) disease (idiopathic osteonecrosis of the hip), and neuromuscular disorders. Among these, SCFE is the most important to exclude. Anteroposterior and frog leg (lateral) radiographs of the pelvis should be obtained in children with unilateral out-toeing associated with hip, thigh, or knee pain and decreased internal rotation of the hip. Children with radiographs suggestive of SCFE should be urgently referred to an orthopedic surgeon. (See <a class="local">'Uncommon pathologic causes of out-toeing'</a> above and <a class="local">'Evaluation'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6554.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management of common causes of out-toeing</strong> – Most children with rotational variations of the lower extremity can be followed in the primary care office. The most important aspect of management of rotational causes of out-toeing is caregiver reassurance that most "deformities" correct spontaneously and that, even in persistent cases, adverse long-term sequelae are rare. Nonoperative interventions (eg, shoe inserts, braces, twister cables, casting) are ineffective in the treatment of internal and external tibial torsion, increased femoral anteversion, and femoral retroversion. These interventions should be avoided.
