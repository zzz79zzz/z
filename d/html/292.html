         Dyspnea is the perception of an inability to breathe comfortably [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Acute dyspnea in the adult patient presents challenges in diagnosis and management. The emergency clinician must provide appropriate initial treatment for a potentially life-threatening illness while working through a wide differential diagnosis. Airway, breathing, and circulation are the emergency clinician's primary focus when beginning management of the acutely dyspneic patient. Once these are stabilized, further clinical investigation and treatment can proceed.
        </p>
        <p>
         In this topic, we use the term "dyspnea" to encompass all disordered or inadequate breathing and provide a stepwise approach to the initial evaluation and management of the life-threatening and common causes of dyspnea in the adult, describe important historical and clinical findings that can help to narrow the differential diagnosis, and discuss common diagnostic studies. Detailed discussions of pathophysiology and focused evaluations of dyspnea are reviewed separately:

         </span>
         The respiratory system maintains homeostasis with respect to gas exchange and acid-base status. Derangements in oxygenation and/or acidemia can lead to dyspnea via a complex pathway generally involving stimulation of a variety of mechanoreceptors throughout the upper airway, lungs, and chest wall; and chemoreceptors at the carotid sinus and the medulla. The pathophysiology of dyspnea is discussed in detail separately. (See

         Dyspnea is a common chief complaint among emergency department (ED) patients, accounting for approximately four million visits (3 percent) annually in the United States [
         <a href="#rid2">

         Stridor occurs when there is airway obstruction. Inspiratory stridor suggests obstruction above the vocal cords (eg, foreign body, epiglottitis, angioedema). Expiratory stridor or mixed inspiratory and expiratory stridor suggests obstruction below the vocal cords (eg, croup, bacterial tracheitis, foreign body).

         Patients with signs of upper airway obstruction may need emergency airway management, although angioedema from anaphylaxis often improves with medical therapy (eg,

         – Angioedema can cause significant swelling of the lips, tongue, posterior pharynx, and most dangerously the larynx; this can occur over minutes to hours and may cause severe dyspnea. Etiologies include idiopathic, allergic (ie, anaphylaxis), medication-related (eg, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug [NSAID], angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker), and complement-related (eg, C1-esterase inhibitor deficiency or a nonfunctional allele). Patients who receive IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for acute ischemic stroke are also at risk for developing angioedema, which tends to be hemilingual and contralateral to the ischemic hemisphere [

          Cardiac tamponade
         </strong>
         – Cardiac tamponade can be caused by trauma, malignancy, uremia, drugs, or infection and can present with acute dyspnea. The classic triad of hypotension, distended neck veins, and muffled heart tones suggest the diagnosis but are often absent. The ECG generally shows sinus tachycardia and low voltage and only rarely reveals electrical alternans. Bedside cardiac ultrasound can identify pericardial effusion and often diagnose tamponade  (

         <strong>
          General historical features
         </strong>
         – Ask about the events leading up to the episode, particularly any recent symptoms or specific triggers for the acute dyspnea. As examples, noncompliance with medications or diet may lead to an episode of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), exposure to cold or an allergen may trigger an asthma flare, acute dyspnea immediately following a meal suggests an allergic reaction, a new productive cough suggests a pulmonary infection, recent surgery or immobilization increases the risk for pulmonary embolism (PE), and recent trauma may have caused a pneumothorax or pulmonary contusion.

         <strong>
          Past history
         </strong>
         – Determine whether the problem is new or recurring. Ask about pre-existing medical conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or PE, or ischemic heart disease and whether the patient has experienced similar acute episodes before. Ask about vaccination status, such as against SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), influenza, and pneumonococcus. If dyspnea resembles prior episodes, the current problem is often an exacerbation of a pre-existing illness. The medical record and medication list can provide important diagnostic clues.

          Prior intubation

         – Patients with a history of endotracheal intubation for medical conditions have a higher risk for severe disease and the need for subsequent intubation. As an example, patients who have required intubation for a severe asthma exacerbation are at increased risk for subsequent episodes of near-fatal asthma attacks. Similarly, prior tracheostomy indicates significant prior illness, in addition to potential anatomic difficulties with future endotracheal intubation. (See

          Pregnancy
         </strong>
         – A number of physiologic changes occur during pregnancy that affect respiratory function, including an increase in minute ventilation, a decrease in functional residual capacity, a decrease in hematocrit, and elevation of the diaphragm. Approximately two-thirds of pregnant individuals experience dyspnea during the course of normal pregnancy.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         However, pregnancy also increases the risk for several potentially life-threatening conditions that may manifest with dyspnea, notably PE. Pulmonary edema may be identified in the setting of a number of diseases associated with pregnancy, including preeclampsia, amniotic fluid embolism, and cardiomyopathy. (See

         Most patients with acute dyspnea should receive supplemental oxygen, an important and readily available treatment for many causes of dyspnea. Some patients with normal oxygen saturation (95 percent or greater) and normal vital signs may not need supplemental oxygen and the above general measures (eg, young patients with no comorbidities and patients with typical exacerbations of chronic disease such as asthma). Supplemental oxygen can be started at 2 liters per minute (LPM) via nasal cannula with a target oxygen saturation of 94 to 98 percent. Other oxygen delivery systems and targets are discussed elsewhere. (See

         withhold oxygen from patients with COPD, but lower the target saturation to 90 to 94 percent, with the understanding that this may reduce ventilatory drive and cause hypercarbia. However, failure to oxygenate the patient may have profoundly adverse consequences. If a clinician determines that a COPD patient requires endotracheal intubation, oxygen delivery should be maximized without regard to the target oxygen saturation or hypercarbia. (See

         Testing should be performed in the context of the history and examination findings. Random testing without a clear differential diagnosis can mislead the clinician and delay appropriate management. A plain chest radiograph (CXR), an electrocardiogram (ECG), and laboratory tests are routinely obtained in most ED patients with acute dyspnea. Bedside emergency physician-performed ultrasound is an effective and rapid tool for investigating several important causes of acute dyspnea but requires equipment and operator proficiency. (See

         The routine use of dyspnea panels (ie, biomarker panels that include troponin, myoglobin, creatinine kinase, D-dimer, and B-type natriuretic peptide) does not appear to improve accuracy beyond clinical assessment and focused testing [

          Arterial blood gas
         </strong>
         – The role of arterial blood gas in the diagnosis and treatment of the acutely dyspneic patient is limited. The decision to perform tracheal intubation is based on clinical assessment and not on the arterial blood gas. Oxygenation is easily assessed using transcutaneous pulse oximetry. If there is any concern about pulse oximetry accuracy  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107546" href="/z/d/graphic/107546.html" rel="external">
          table 5
         </a>
         ), we obtain an arterial blood gas. Acid-base status can be assessed using a venous blood gas and the serum bicarbonate. We do not routinely use arterial or venous blood gas for monitoring unless there is a discrepancy with pulse oximeter or capnography. (See

          Chest MDCT
         </strong>
         – Even though chest MDCT will diagnose multiple problems, including malignancy, pneumonia, and pulmonary edema, it is most useful in dyspneic ED patients with trauma or concern for PE and when plain chest radiograph is inconclusive. MDCT does entail some risks, including contrast-induced nephropathy, allergic reaction to contrast, and radiation-related malignancy. MDCT should be performed when it is needed to establish an important diagnosis, even in patients with compromised kidney function since contrast-related kidney injury is relatively uncommon. (See

          ADHF
         </strong>
         – Signs of ADHF that may appear on a CXR include cardiomegaly, cephalization of blood vessels, interstitial edema (eg, "Kerley B" lines, peribronchial cuffing), vascular congestion  (

         ), and pleural effusions. Radiographic findings can lag behind the clinical picture, and approximately 20 percent of patients admitted with ADHF have a nondiagnostic CXR [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. ADHF and pneumonia can have a similar appearance on CXR, but ADHF is generally associated with hypertension (except in cardiogenic shock), often responds to aggressive early therapy, and is associated with an elevation in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). Lung ultrasound is more sensitive than CXR in diagnosing ADHF and should be used if the operator is proficient and resources are available [

         Symptomatic ADHF can be caused by volume overload, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF [previously known as "diastolic dysfunction"]), heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF [previously known as "systolic dysfunction"]), or outflow obstruction (eg, aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, severe systemic hypertension). Myocardial ischemia and arrhythmia are common precipitants. Symptoms range from mild dyspnea on exertion to severe pulmonary edema. Common findings include tachypnea, pulmonary crackles, jugular venous distension  (

         ]. Volume depletion may also lead to a negative initial CXR. Contrary to past teaching, the appearance of the CXR (lobar versus diffuse disease) does not accurately predict the nature of the pneumonia (eg, "typical" versus "atypical" organisms). Pneumonia and ADHF can have a similar appearance on CXR, but pneumonia is more often associated with a normal or low blood pressure, does not respond to early therapy, and is generally

          Pleural effusion, hemothorax

         – A moderate to large pleural effusion or hemothorax, which appear similar on CXR, can cause acute dyspnea. Common etiologies include infection, ascites, pancreatitis, cancer, heart failure, pneumonia, iatrogenic vessel transection, PE, and trauma. These are evaluated by cross-sectional imaging studies (eg, blood has high attenuation/Hounsfield units on CT) or by analysis of the pleural fluid. (See

         Airway trauma can present with acute dyspnea. Blunt or penetrating injuries of the head or neck can cause hemorrhage, swelling, and anatomic distortion. A laryngeal fracture should be suspected in patients complaining of dyspnea in the setting of severe neck pain and dysphonia following blunt trauma. Patients who have sustained facial burns or smoke inhalation are at risk for rapidly progressive airway edema and compromise. Management depends on the etiology and is reviewed separately. (See

         Pulmonary infections such as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) can present with productive cough, fever, dyspnea, hypoxia, and pleuritic chest pain, although these are insensitive signs. Dyspnea is generally subacute in onset unless underlying chronic pulmonary disease is present. Mild CAP deemed appropriate for outpatient treatment does not need any microbiologic testing (with exception of COVID-19 testing during the pandemic and possibly testing for respiratory viruses, particularly for influenza, during respiratory virus season). Selection of appropriate tests is discussed elsewhere. (See

         The diagnosis of PE should be considered in any patient with acute-onset dyspnea. Risk factors include a history of deep venous thrombosis or PE, prolonged immobilization, recent trauma or surgery (particularly orthopedic), pregnancy  (

         ), malignancy, stroke or paresis, oral contraceptive or other estrogen use, smoking, and a personal or family history of hypercoagulability. Many patients have no known risk factor at the time of diagnosis. Presentation varies widely, but dyspnea at rest and tachypnea are the most common signs. Other embolic phenomena include fat embolism, especially after a long bone fracture or associated with the acute chest syndrome of sickle cell disease, and amniotic fluid embolism. Although most patients with dyspnea secondary to a PE demonstrate some abnormality on CXR or ECG, there are no pathognomonic findings in either test. (See

         – Echocardiogram can diagnose cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, or ruptured chordae tendinae, which can present with acute dyspnea and a new murmur. Since a murmur is not always present with valvular disease, echocardiogram can be helpful in patients with acute dyspnea after other nonvalvular etiologies have been excluded. (See

         Tachypnea and dyspnea can occur from respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis, which is suggested by a low bicarbonate concentration (often defined as &lt;23 mEq/L) on the serum chemistries. Evaluation includes confirmation with a blood gas and testing for specific causes  (

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         A venous blood gas is generally sufficient (as compared with arterial blood gas) to confirm presence and assess degree of metabolic acidosis. Laboratory evaluation for specific causes is discussed elsewhere. (See

          Peak flow and pulmonary function tests (PFTs)
         </strong>
         – The peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) can be helpful in distinguishing pulmonary and cardiac causes of dyspnea and determining the severity of bronchoconstriction in cases of severe asthma. Normal PEFR varies with sex, height, and age  (

         ]. During acute asthma exacerbations, PEFR measurements provide a screening tool for the presence of hypercapnia and obviate the need for routine blood gases. In the absence of respiratory depressant medications (eg, opioids or sedatives), hypercapnia is rarely present until the PEFR falls below 25 percent of normal or 200 L/minute. (See

         In some instances, the cause of dyspnea cannot be determined with certainty in the ED. Treatment should still be provided based upon available data (eg, broad-spectrum antibiotics when serious infection is suspected). In a patient who is going to be admitted, consultation with the appropriate specialist (eg, cardiologist, intensivist, pulmonologist), which can occur during the hospitalization, may help establish a diagnosis.

        <p>
         Hyperventilation from anxiety is a diagnosis of exclusion in the ED. Even among young, healthy patients with a known anxiety disorder, it is prudent to perform a history and physical examination to screen for medical causes of dyspnea. To complicate matters, anxiety is common among patients with severe medical disease. As an example, COPD patients have a threefold increase in the prevalence of anxiety disorders compared with the general population [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. In such patients, it is best to assume that an exacerbation of their underlying medical disease is the cause of dyspnea until proven otherwise.

         The patient's condition, preliminary diagnosis, and risk assessment determine disposition. Patients at risk of rapid deterioration require close monitoring and should be admitted to an intensive care setting. Patients who do not improve sufficiently during ED treatment, have significant comorbidities, or are deemed high-risk should be admitted to the appropriate hospital ward. High-risk dyspneic patients include older adults, those with immunocompromise, severe underlying lung or heart disease, or those who demonstrate unexplained abnormal vital signs.

        <p>
         Stable patients whose evaluation has ruled out significant disease or are deemed to have acceptably low risk for such disease may be discharged. Patients being discharged must have a clear understanding of their discharge diagnosis, written discharge instructions, and planned follow-up with clear instructions to return to the emergency department if their condition worsens.
