         Urethritis, or inflammation of the urethra, is a common manifestation of sexually transmitted infections among males.
        </p>
        <p>

         Infectious urethritis is typically caused by a sexually transmitted pathogen; thus, most cases are seen in young, sexually active men.
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          Neisseria gonorrhoeae
         </em>
         and
         <em>
          Chlamydia trachomatis
         </em>
         are commonly identified in cases of urethritis.
         <em>
          Mycoplasma genitalium
         </em>
         has also been strongly associated with urethritis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because
         <em>
          N. gonorrhoeae
         </em>
         is easily visualized on Gram stain, which has classically been the primary mode of evaluating urethral discharge in males, urethritis is traditionally classified as gonococcal versus nongonococcal in settings where microscopy is performed. While useful for clinical management, particularly as it relates to limiting unnecessary antibiotic exposure, the lack of available point-of-care microscopy in most settings renders this distinction less relevant.
        </p>
        <p class="headingAnchor" id="H22228515">
         <span class="h2">

         </span>
         <em>
          N. gonorrhoeae
         </em>
         is a relatively common cause of urethritis in the United States and Europe, especially in urban areas and sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics, although a large proportion of cases are diagnosed in private practices or health maintenance organizations [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In a study of 768 males screened for STIs at 11 different clinic settings in the United States in 2012, the prevalence of
         <em>
          N. gonorrhoeae
         </em>
         ranged from 21.6 percent among symptomatic to 1.4 percent among asymptomatic males [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. The overall incidence of gonorrhea cases among males reported in the United States was 224.4 cases per 100,000 males in 2019, reflecting a 5.9 percent increase since 2018 and a 60.6 percent increase since 2015 [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. These rate increases may be secondary to increased transmission, more comprehensive screening (ie, extragenital screening), or both [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. However, incidence varies substantially by race and geographical region. As examples, gonorrhea rates are disproportionately higher among non-Hispanic Black males compared with non-Hispanic White males and are generally highest in the South compared with other regions in the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         The burden of gonococcal urethritis may be even higher in certain regions of the developing world. As an example, in a study from South Africa,
         <em>
          N. gonorrhoeae
         </em>
         was detected in 62 percent of males with symptoms of urethritis [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Of note, coinfections with other sexually transmitted pathogens are common. In a study of more than 3800 heterosexual males and females attending an STI clinic, chlamydial coinfection was demonstrated in 20 percent of males and 42 percent of females with gonorrhea [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          Neisseria meningitidis
         </em>
         has also been reported as a cause of symptomatic urethritis clinically and microscopically similar to gonococcal urethritis in males [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6-8
         </a>
         ]. In such cases, the source of the infection may be from asymptomatic carriage of the organism in the throat of an oral sex partner.

         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         is generally the most commonly identified cause of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU), with
         <em>
          M. genitalium
         </em>
         the second most common; however, almost half of all cases of NGU do not have a specific etiology identified.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the United States, reported cases of
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         in males have increased every year between 2000 and 2019, with the exceptions of 2012 and 2013 [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The reported rate increased by 5.5 percent from 2018 to 2019. The increases may be due to increases in testing (including extragenital testing), increases in transmission, or both.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, among NGU cases for which a pathogen is identified, the proportion caused by
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         may be decreasing [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Historically,
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         was estimated to be responsible for approximately 50 percent of cases of NGU [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ], although other studies have reported that chlamydia accounts for only 15 to 30 percent of NGU cases [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11-14
         </a>
         ]. This observation is likely a reflection of the use of a more diverse and sensitive set of diagnostic assays to detect other urethral pathogens, such as
         <em>
          M. genitalium
         </em>
         and
         <em>
          Trichomonas vaginalis
         </em>
         .
         <em>
          M. genitalium
         </em>
         is estimated to cause approximately 15 to 25 percent of NGU cases [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The proportion of cases of NGU attributable to different organisms varies by study and geographic region. A study of 329 males in Australia with symptoms of urethritis conducted between March 2004 and March 2005 detected
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         (20 percent),
         <em>
          M. genitalium
         </em>
         (9 percent), adenoviruses (4 percent), herpes simplex virus (HSV; 3 percent), and no pathogen (65 percent) [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. In a trial of 305 males with symptomatic NGU in the United States conducted between November 2006 and April 2009, much higher prevalences were reported for
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         (43 percent),
         <em>
          M. genitalium
         </em>
         (31 percent), and
         <em>
          T. vaginalis
         </em>
         (13 percent) [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ].
         <em>
          T. vaginalis
         </em>
         is an important cause of NGU in heterosexual males in Africa, where the organism has been reported in up to 20 percent of cases [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16-18
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Certain pathogens may be associated with specific demographic or behavioral features, and sexual practices may contribute to differences in causative agents of NGU in men who have sex with men (MSM) compared with MSW [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,20
         </a>
         ]. As examples, in the Australian study described above, HSV and adenovirus were detected more frequently among men who have sex with men and in association with a history of insertive oral sex [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,21
         </a>
         ]. In contrast,
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         and
         <em>
          M. genitalium
         </em>
         were associated with sex with women and unprotected vaginal sex. Insertive oral sex was also a significant risk factor in pathogen-negative NGU, suggesting that oropharyngeal microbiota may be a significant source of other bacterial and viral pathogens. Some studies suggest an association between NGU in men who have sex with women (MSW) and the bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Other organisms that can infrequently cause symptoms of urethritis include
         <em>
          Treponema pallidum
         </em>
         , as an endourethral syphilitic chancre may also lead to clinical urethritis, and
         <em>
          Haemophilus influenzae
         </em>
         , which may be transmitted through respiratory secretions from a carrier during oral sex [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23,24
         </a>
         ]. The role of
         <em>
          Ureaplasma urealyticum
         </em>
         and
         <em>
          Ureaplasma parvum
         </em>
         as urethral pathogens is unclear since these organisms can also be found as commensals in hosts with no evidence of disease. Several studies have identified an association between
         <em>
          Ureaplasma

         spp and NGU [

         Dysuria, or discomfort with urination, is usually the chief complaint in males with urethritis and is reported in the majority of males with gonorrhea and over half of patients with nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. Other complaints include pruritus, burning, and discharge at the urethral meatus. Urethral discharge can range from mucoid or watery to frankly purulent and may be present throughout the day or may be scanty and only present on the first morning void. Some males notice grossly visible mucous threads in their morning urine stream. The incubation period is variable, but is typically four to seven days after exposure for gonococcal urethritis and five to eight days for NGU [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         However, not all males with laboratory evidence of urethritis have symptoms. Five to 10 percent of cases of laboratory-documented gonococcal urethritis and up to 42 percent of males with NGU are asymptomatic [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31,32
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         On exam, discharge may be grossly evident or may only be detectable after gentle "stripping" or "milking" of the penis. The urethra can be milked from the base to the meatus by placing a gloved thumb along the ventral surface of the base of the penis and the forefinger on the dorsum, applying gentle pressure, and moving the hand slowly toward the meatus to expel any discharge for specimen collection [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,33
         </a>
         ]. The meatus may appear inflamed or edematous. Gram stain of the urethral discharge typically demonstrates an elevated number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes  (

         below.)

         Certain clinical features can suggest distinct microbial etiologies; however, specific testing is required to identify the causative pathogen:

         – If Gram, MB, or GV stain is not an available option at the presenting visit, diagnosis depends on the presence of at least one of the following objective findings of urethritis (mucopurulent discharge on exam, leukocyte esterase on dipstick, or ≥10 WBC on spun sediment of the first-void or first-catch urine). Urine NAATs should still be performed for specific identification of organisms (eg,

         If any of these objective findings of urethritis are present, the presumptive diagnosis of urethritis can be made. These patients should be treated for urethritis with therapy that provides coverage for both gonococcal and chlamydial infections. If the presumptive diagnosis is made on the presence of urine leukocyte esterase or WBC alone, the possibility of urinary tract infection or prostatitis should also be considered, although this should not delay empiric therapy for urethritis among sexually active young males.

         who are unlikely to return for follow-up, empiric treatment to cover both gonococcal and nongonococcal etiologies before availability of NAAT results is reasonable.

         Gram stains performed on male urethral swabs can play an important role in defining nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) and guiding empiric therapy as a point-of-care test, especially in clinics dedicated to the management of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A specimen for Gram stain can be collected from expressed urethral discharge or from inside the urethra. A swab should be inserted gently at least 2 cm into the urethra and rotated 360 degrees while making contact with the urethral mucosa, taking care not to force the tip past an obstruction. The swab can then be rolled across a clean microscope slide for air drying and Gram stain evaluation. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2746.html" rel="external">
          "Approach to Gram stain and culture results in the microbiology laboratory", section on 'Procedure'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The Gram stain should be examined for the presence of WBCs (also specified as polymorphonuclear neutrophils [PMNs]) and any organisms. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests using a lower threshold (≥2 WBC per high powered field [hpf]) for urethritis diagnosis in high prevalence settings (eg, sexually transmitted infection clinics) than low prevalence settings (≥5 WBC/hpf); the lower threshold is more sensitive for urethritis caused by
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,34,35
         </a>
         ]. In a retrospective study that compared over 13,000 urethral Gram stain findings to NAAT results in males presenting with suspected urethritis, the rate of
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         positivity by NAAT increased with increasing number of WBC observed (5 percent for 0 WBC/hpf to 44 percent for 10 WBC/hpf) [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. Using a threshold of 5 WBC/hpf would have missed 16 percent of males with
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         , whereas a threshold of 2 WBC/hpf misses only 7 percent. Of the males with
         <em>
          N. gonorrhoeae
         </em>
         , only 2 percent had &lt;10 WBC/hpf. Guidelines from other locations may use different diagnostic criteria. As an example, European guidelines recommend a threshold of 5 WBC/hpf for the diagnosis of urethritis in all settings [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36,37
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The presence of PMNs without any visible organisms is consistent with NGU  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56547" href="/z/d/graphic/56547.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ), whereas gonococcal urethritis may be diagnosed by the demonstration of gram-negative intracellular diplococci in the urethral exudate  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50351" href="/z/d/graphic/50351.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Using an MB or GV stain can also identify WBC and gonococcal forms on urethral swab specimens and can be performed more rapidly than the Gram stain. Results correlate with those of a Gram stain, although
         <em>
          N. gonorrhoeae

         appear as dark purple on the MB or GV stain [

         Urethritis is suggested by a positive leukocyte esterase on dipstick or the presence of ≥10 WBC/hpf on microscopy of first-void or first-catch spun urine. Inspection for WBCs can be performed by spinning 10 to 15 milliliters of urine and examining the sediment microscopically. This urine sample is also used for nucleic acid amplification testing for identification of the involved pathogen. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Determining the microbial etiology'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The optimal urine sample is the first-void urine, which refers to the initial portion of the first urinary stream after awakening, collected without pre-cleaning the urethral meatus. However, collection of the first-void urine at the point-of-care is impractical, so most practitioners request a first-catch urine, which refers to the initial portion of the urinary stream (generally the first 10 to 20 mL), collected without pre-cleaning the urethral meatus and ideally at least one hour after the previous micturition. Some small studies suggest that urine collected 20 minutes post-void has near-equivalent sensitivity for
         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         by nucleic acid amplification testing as one hour post-void samples [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The volume of urine collected affects the sensitivity of NAAT-based diagnostic tests. In one study, a device that allowed collection of 4 to 5 mL of first-catch urine yielded a specimen with a sixfold higher
         <em>

         A urethral Gram, MB, or GV stain that demonstrates intracellular diplococci is highly specific for gonococcal urethritis. However, there have been reports of
         <em>
          N. meningitidis
         </em>
         causing symptomatic urethritis and being initially mistaken for
         <em>
          N. gonorrhoeae
         </em>
         on Gram, MB, or GV stain [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7,42
         </a>
         ]. In such cases, NAAT for
         <em>
          N. gonorrhoeae
         </em>
         , if performed, is negative. Definitive identification of
         <em>

        </p>
        <p>
         Even if intracellular diplococci are seen on Gram, MB, or GV stain and gonococcal urethritis is presumed, NAAT for
         <em>
          C. trachomatis

         <em>
          T. vaginalis

         in the setting of urethritis is somewhat difficult. NAAT performed on urine or urethral specimens for
         <em>
          T. vaginalis
         </em>
         is the optimal diagnostic test, as it is highly sensitive (74 to 100 percent, depending on the specimen and reference standard) and specific (97 to 100 percent) [

         <em>
          T. vaginalis
         </em>
         are less useful in males. Although wet mount preparations for trichomonads can be useful in females, microscopy is very insensitive in males [
         <a href="#rid1">

         Urethritis can occur in conjunction with other infectious processes of the lower urogenital tract, including epididymitis or prostatitis. Males with urethritis should be questioned about and evaluated for the presence of fever, testicular pain and swelling, obstructive urinary symptoms (dribbling or hesitancy), perineal or pelvic pain, which may suggest involvement of the epididymis or prostate. Gentle digital rectal exam is warranted in males who have symptoms suggestive of underlying prostatitis. (See

         Additionally, other anatomical sites, such as the pharynx or rectum, may be affected by sexually transmitted infections, and pharyngitis, proctitis, or (more commonly) asymptomatic infection at these extragenital sites may accompany urethritis. Patients should be questioned about oral or rectal sexual exposures. NAAT is the test of choice at these sites, and the FDA cleared the first diagnostic tests for extragenital testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea in May 2019 [

         Other infectious diagnoses to consider among males presenting with dysuria include cystitis, epididymitis, and prostatitis. Clinical findings such as growth of uropathogens from urine culture or acute scrotal pain suggest these other processes. However, these conditions may also coexist with urethritis, so even if findings are consistent with one of these alternate diagnoses, the possibility of urethritis is not necessarily ruled out. These conditions are discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See

         Noninfectious etiologies may also lead to inflammation of the urethra. These include chemical irritation (eg, from spermicides and soaps) and repeated vigorous stripping of the urethra by the patient, which may occur during masturbation. While history may be able to identify such possibilities, the diagnosis of infectious urethritis should first be thoroughly evaluated and excluded.

         Recurrent or persistent symptoms are common following therapy for urethritis. Possible causes include poor adherence to the regimen, reinfection, antimicrobial resistance (particularly in the case of
         <em>
          N. gonorrhoeae

         ), and involvement of other organisms inadequately treated by the empiric regimen (in particular,

         Males with persistent or recurrent symptoms of urethritis should be evaluated for objective evidence of urethritis (mucopurulent discharge on exam, leukocyte esterase positive urine, or ≥10 white blood cells [WBC] on spun sediment of the first-void or first-catch urine, and/or ≥2 to ≥5 WBC/high power field [hpf; depending on the prevalence of urethritis in the setting] on Gram,

        <p>
         For males with objective evidence of persistent urethritis, we recommend repeat NAAT for
         <em>
          N. gonorrhoeae
         </em>
         and
         <em>

         and
         <em>
          T. vaginalis
         </em>
         with urine-based NAAT, if available. For males with prior gonococcal urethritis, a primary concern is the possibility of antimicrobial resistance and treatment failure. Evaluation and management for this is discussed elsewhere. (See

        <p>
         In some cases, empiric therapy can be given while awaiting testing results. Males who were not adherent to the initial antibiotic course or were re-exposed to an untreated partner can be retreated with the same initial regimen. Men who have sex with women and who were adherent and not re-exposed can be presumptively treated for
         <em>

         ; specific regimens are discussed elsewhere.

         Otherwise, therapy should ideally be based on results of microbiologic testing.
         <em>
          M. genitalium
         </em>
         is a common cause of persistent nongonococcal urethritis. If testing for
         <em>
          M. genitalium
         </em>
         is unavailable, it is reasonable to empirically treat for this organism in males with persistent nongonococcal urethritis who have tested negative for other organisms. Treatment of
         <em>
          M. genitalium

         Herpes simplex virus (HSV) can also be a causative agent of persistent urethritis, although HSV is often distinguished from other pathogens by characteristic physical examination findings.

         A test of cure is a microbial diagnostic test (eg, culture or NAAT) that is performed one to three weeks following treatment, regardless of symptom resolution, to document eradication of the pathogen.

         Most cases of urethritis are seen in young, sexually active men.
         <em>
          Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis,
         </em>
         and
         <em>
          Mycoplasma genitalium
         </em>
         are the most commonly associated organisms.
         <em>
          Trichomonas vaginalis
         </em>
         and herpes simplex virus (HSV) are also recognized causes. (See

         <strong>
         </strong>
         Dysuria, or painful urination, is usually the chief complaint. Other complaints include pruritus, burning, and discharge at the urethral meatus. Acute onset of frankly purulent discharge suggests
         <em>
          N. gonorrhoeae

         <em>
          C. trachomatis
         </em>
         , and painful genital ulcers suggest HSV. However, syndromes of gonococcal and nongonococcal urethritis cannot be reliably distinguished on clinical grounds only. (See
