         It is estimated that 1.5 to 4.5 billion passengers travel by air each year [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Flying at a high altitude can induce significant hypoxemia in patients with underlying lung disease, despite pressurization of airliner cabins. A large number of air travelers have underlying medical conditions, including pulmonary disease, and are at risk for adverse cardiopulmonary effects related to oxygen desaturation [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-5
         </a>
         ].

        <p>
         The evaluation of patients for potential in-flight hypoxemia and the prescription of supplemental oxygen for air travel are reviewed here. General assessment and counseling prior to air travel and the prescription of long-term supplemental oxygen are discussed separately. (See

         In-flight medical events (IFMEs) have been reported to occur at a rate of approximately 15 to 100 per million passengers [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. The precise incidence of IFMEs is unknown because there is no mandatory reporting system. Deaths (all cause) are estimated to occur at a rate of 0.1 to 1 per million passengers [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6-9
         </a>
         ]. Respiratory events are estimated to account for 12 percent of IFMEs [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Changes in atmospheric pressure and oxygen tension are thought to contribute to these events. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/185.html" rel="external">
          "Management of inflight medical events on commercial airlines", section on 'Epidemiology'

         Commercial aircraft typically operate at cruising altitudes of 30,000 to 40,000 feet (9144 to 12,192 meters) [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,10
         </a>
         ]. As altitude increases, ambient air pressure decreases, leading to a decrease in the oxygen tension (also known as the partial pressure of oxygen) of inspired air  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77616" href="/z/d/graphic/77616.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Pressurization of cabins on commercial airliners limits the decrease in air pressure, allowing the airplane or jet to cruise at altitudes up to 40,000 feet (12,192 meters) without inducing extreme hypobaric stress in the passengers [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Regulatory government agencies, such as the Federal Aviation Administration, require that airliner cabins be pressurized to simulate an altitude (so-called cabin altitude) below 8000 feet (2438 meters) and allow only brief diversions to a cabin altitude of 10,000 feet (3048 meters) for safety (eg, to avoid adverse weather).

         Individuals with normal cardiorespiratory function typically experience a decrease in PaO

         from above 95 mmHg (12.7 kPa) to between 53 and 75 mmHg (7.1 to 10.0 kPa) when going from sea level to a cabin pressure that simulates an altitude of 8000 feet (2438 meters) [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13-15

         ]. This change in PaO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         is on the upper, flat portion of the oxyhemoglobin curve, so the decrease in oxygen saturation is only 3 to 4 percent and not associated with symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients who have a PaO
         <sub>

         below 95 mmHg at sea level, the decrease in PaO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         at a cabin altitude of 8000 feet (2438 meters) is on the steeper portion of the oxyhemoglobin saturation curve  (

          figure 1
         </a>
         ), so it will be associated with a greater fall in oxygen saturation [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. As an example, a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a PaO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         of 70 mmHg (9.33 kPa) at sea level would be likely to have a decrease in PaO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         to 53 mmHg (7.06 kPa) and a decrease in oxyhemoglobin saturation to 84 percent at a cabin altitude of 8000 feet [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ], which may be associated with symptoms, ranging from mild cognitive dysfunction to marked dyspnea, chest pain, or confusion.
        </p>
        <p>
         Air travelers are usually sedentary during flight, thus reducing the likelihood of symptoms associated with a lower PaO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         . However, even modest exercise under hypobaric conditions may be associated with substantial worsening of hypoxemia. In a study of 24 patients with various lung diseases, more than 80 percent experienced a decrease in PaO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         to less than 50 mmHg (6.67 kPa) during exercise in a chamber simulating a cabin altitude of 8000 feet [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite this degree of hypoxemia, patients with COPD who are exposed to high altitude for several hours are unlikely to experience adverse clinical events [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,17
         </a>
         ]. Possible reasons for the low morbidity associated with air travel are that patients compensate for decreased oxygen tension by hyperventilating and are relatively inactive in-flight [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Another consequence of the decrease in ambient pressure is that gas in trapped spaces (eg, paranasal sinuses, abdominal viscera, lung bullae, and pleural space) expands  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77616" href="/z/d/graphic/77616.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Expansion of air within a bulla can cause tissue separation, leading to a pneumothorax. Thus, in addition to the direct effects of decreased oxygen tension, hypoxemia may be caused by barotrauma. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6705.html" rel="external">

         Patients who require supplemental oxygen at rest are at risk for in-flight hypoxemia. If the oxygen requirement at rest is &gt;4 L/minute, it may be difficult to ensure adequate supplemental oxygen in flight. For such patients, the clinician must assure that the battery life (including back-up batteries) is sufficient for the entire flight duration, allowing extra time for in-flight delays, or advise against air travel.

         For patients whose oxygen requirement is ≤4 L/minute at rest, guidelines advise increasing the oxygen flow by 1 to 2 L/minute while in flight [

         Various methods have been suggested for selection of patients who need specific testing for in-flight hypoxemia, such as hypoxia altitude simulation testing (HAST; also called hypoxic challenge test). The BTS guidelines suggest using a combination of a resting SpO

         &lt;95 percent at sea level and risk factors that would increase the likelihood of in-flight hypoxemia to guide the need for HAST [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5

         92 to 95 percent and none of these risk factors desaturated during HAST [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. An alternative is to assess oxygenation during a 6MWT and use the results to guide referral for HAST  (

         Patients with cystic fibrosis tend to have few symptoms related to oxygen desaturation at altitude, possibly due to chronically lower oxygen saturation at sea level. The consequences of brief periods of asymptomatic hypoxemia in these relatively young patients without concomitant heart disease are not known. In the absence of clear data, the same guidelines for supplemental oxygen are used for patients with cystic fibrosis as for other patients. (See

None of the patients had symptoms at rest and only one patient experienced light-headedness with exercise, even with hypoxemia. Patients with a baseline PaO

         Patients with cystic fibrosis who anticipate a long flight may need to bring a portable, battery-powered nebulizer for administration of medication in-flight. All medications and spacer devices should be carried in hand luggage. The use of a portable nebulizer in-flight often requires prior permission from the airline. (See

        <p>
         In the absence of simulation testing, provision of supplemental oxygen in-flight is reasonable for those with a mean pulmonary artery (PA) pressure of 35 mmHg or higher or a systolic PA pressure of 50 mmHg (6.67 kPa) or higher [

         Patients with more severe pulmonary hypertension may need to completely avoid air travel, although minimal data are available to guide the clinician in this decision. It has been suggested that patients with New York Heart Association Class III and IV disease  (

         Travelers should ensure easy access to necessary medications (eg, inhalers), in case of travel delays or lost luggage, by keeping these medications in carry-on luggage. It is prudent to carry an extra copy of prescriptions for necessary medications and an emergency supply of "contingency" medications (perhaps a course of an antibiotic and a systemic glucocorticoid, as appropriate). A list of clinicians in locations along the travel route is also helpful.
        </p>

         As noted above, patients with cystic fibrosis may need access to a portable nebulizer for delivery of medication in-flight. (See

         Exposure to respiratory viruses and influenza can be a particular problem for patients with lung disease. Hand hygiene, seasonal influenza vaccination, and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can mitigate the risk of infection. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7007.html" rel="external">

         The exact risk of pneumothorax for patients with cystic or emphysematous lung disease is not known, but is thought to be low except in patients with a prior pneumothorax who have not undergone surgical or video-assisted thoracoscopic pleurodesis. Pneumothorax with a persistent air leak is considered a contraindication to air travel, and recent pneumothorax needs individualized assessment. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical effects'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6705.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Air travel increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), especially with prolonged travel (eg, more than four to six hours), although the absolute risk remains low in the absence of other risk factors. Thromboprophylaxis with general measures, such as avoidance of dehydration and frequent ambulation or flexion-extension of the ankles and knees, are adequate for most patients with lung disease other than prior VTE. Graduated compression stockings may be beneficial in patients at higher risk. Pharmacologic prophylaxis is usually reserved for travelers at particularly high risk and is described separately. (See

         For those who need further assessment, hypoxia altitude simulation testing (HAST), which involves breathing 15.1 percent oxygen for 20 minutes, is preferred as it is reasonably accurate and broadly available. Hypobaric chamber testing is most accurate, but has limited availability. Regression equations that incorporate baseline oxygenation and pulmonary function test parameters are not sufficiently accurate. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Further assessment to determine in-flight need for oxygen'

         For patients who require long-term supplemental oxygen at baseline, we suggest using an increased liter flow while in-flight (

          Grade 2C

         For patients who do not require supplemental oxygen at baseline, resting pulse oximetry at sea level and assessment of the underlying lung disease are used to screen for likelihood of in-flight hypoxemia  (

To identify the minority of such patients who are at risk of in-flight hypoxemia, such as those with prior in-flight symptoms or baseline exertional dyspnea, a six-minute walk test (6MWT) can be performed.

         For patients who are predicted to require supplemental oxygen during air travel, the oxygen flow rate required to prevent hypoxemia can be determined during a repeat HAST with supplemental oxygen administered by nasal cannula.

         Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rules prohibit travelers from carrying their own oxygen tanks (cylinders) aboard commercial aircraft. Airlines landing in the United States are now required to allow use of FAA-approved, battery-powered, portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) throughout the flight. However, a prescription is needed from the clinician  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71862" href="/z/d/graphic/71862.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ) and prior approval is needed from the airline. Outside the United States, airline practices about in–flight oxygen are not standardized, and patients will need to obtain information for the specific country and airline. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Arranging for portable oxygen during flight'
