          INTRODUCTION

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         </span>
         A woman's childbirth experience is vitally important, and her birthing memories endure [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Major factors that influence the quality of this experience include personal expectations, the quality and amount of support she receives, the quality of the caregiver-patient relationship (eg, communication, continuity of care, empathy, respect), her involvement in decision making, her clinical risk, and pregnancy outcome [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Much of the preparation for labor and birth happens naturally as pregnancy progresses. Physical changes occur: her breasts and abdomen enlarge and contractions become noticeable. She becomes attached to her baby as the baby makes his or her presence known with kicks and movement. She begins to tire of being pregnant and often gets a burst of energy to prepare the home for the upcoming newborn before going into labor ("nesting") [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Although women have always prepared for childbirth, the process has become more formal. The development of structured educational programs in preparation for childbirth came about when the location of the birth moved from the home to the hospital. Birth became a medical event; mothers, sisters, and other lay women knowledgeable about birth were no longer in attendance, and cultural and family rituals associated with birthing were lost [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. In the early years of formal childbirth education, the focus was on the basic anatomy, the physiology of labor and birth, and simple strategies to cope with the pain of contractions, such as relaxation techniques and controlled breathing. Childbirth education has evolved from this initial curriculum as we now know more about the role of pain [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ], the hormonal physiology [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ], the wide and ever increasing number of ways that women can find comfort [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10-14
         </a>
         ], and the importance of continuous emotional and physical support [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15-17
         </a>
         ] during labor and birth. Contemporary curricula highlight additional care practices that facilitate the physiologic process of birth, including waiting for the spontaneous onset of labor start [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ] and keeping the mother and newborn together [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ].

         This topic will review goals and activities that can help prepare women for an optimal childbirth experience. Other issues related to this experience, such as doula support, obstetric management, and nonhospital sites for delivery are discussed in more detail separately.

         Good preparation can optimize the experience of childbirth, even if complications develop and medical interventions are needed [

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Birth preparation helps women achieve some degree of comfort during labor by addressing modifiable factors that help alleviate labor pain. Such factors include controlling the labor and birth environment, learning coping strategies, and discussing expectations and anxiety about the birth experience [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. Although most pregnant women are concerned about the pain associated with childbirth, they often report that pain and its relief do not play a major role in their satisfaction with their childbirth experience [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,23
         </a>
         ]. In part, this is because birth preparation helps women understand the role pain plays in normal labor and birth [

         Prepregnancy or early pregnancy childbirth preparation classes can provide information that helps women to make the initial decisions of choosing a health care provider and place of birth and to learn about common issues of the first and second trimesters. In the third trimester, childbirth preparation classes provide an opportunity to meet with other pregnant women; share stories; obtain knowledge about pregnancy, labor, birth, and postpartum issues; devote time to focusing on preparation for birth; and address fears, anxieties, and concerns. Fear of childbirth has been associated with longer labor duration, need for psychiatric care, and presence of symptoms of traumatic stress [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Formal childbirth preparation, both hospital and community based, not only helps women know what to expect during labor and birth, but provides a forum for ultimately making choices within the context of contemporary maternity care and developing a personal plan for birth. In addition, hearing birth stories and talking with other women helps foster feelings of connection and provides valuable information about ways that women manage the challenges of labor, birth, and early parenting [
         <a href="#rid25">

          28,29

The requirements of each organization's program vary dramatically.
        </p>
        <p>
         The childbirth educator should be knowledgeable about the normal, natural process of birth, including strategies to facilitate labor and birth. They should be up to date with research about birth and maternity care practices and their effect on the physiologic process of birth [

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         For some families, preparing for labor and birth involves creating a written birth plan [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20,21
         </a>
         ]. Ideally, written birth plans reduce conflicts and misunderstandings between women and their providers surrounding the birth by making agreements in advance about what will be done in a normal delivery and what might be necessary if an emergency arises.
        </p>
        <p>
         In general, the written birth plan:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Provides an opportunity for discussion between the woman and her partner or support team, as well as between the health care provider and the woman, to ensure that all important issues are addressed. The provider and the support team learn what is personally important to the woman and what she needs to feel safe, supported, and confident in labor.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Encourages the family to be actively involved in making decisions, which is an important component of childbirth satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Provides a framework for developing a collaborative relationship between the health care provider and the woman. In some instances, it helps to resolve inconsistencies between the woman's expectations and what is considered best practice (for instance, if she has an epidural anesthetic, she will need an intravenous line). It helps care providers (including nurses) get to know the woman in a more personal way.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Serves as documentation of the agreement between the provider and woman. It changes as circumstances change, acknowledging that medical interventions based on best evidence may be necessary if complications ensue.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The effect of the birth plan on pregnancy outcome has not been well-studied. Some studies reported no difference between women with and without a birth plan in their overall birth experiences (control, fear, pain), some report women with birth plans had improved childbirth experiences, and some report women with birth plans were less satisfied with their birth experience than those without birth plans [
         <a href="#rid47">

         The strategies the pregnant woman develops in the birth plan to meet her goals will be different depending on her personal preferences and where she will give birth (eg, hospital, birthing center, home). Typically, the written birth plan covers the items listed in the table  (

         Choosing one or more individuals for support during childbirth appears to have both psychological and medical benefits. In a meta-analysis of 27 trials including over 15,500 women, the continuous presence of a support person reduced the likelihood of medication for pain relief, assisted vaginal birth, cesarean birth, and dissatisfaction with the birth experience [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Continuous support was also associated with a slight reduction in the length of labor and improvement in maternal satisfaction (eg, coping during labor, level of personal control during childbirth). These data are reviewed in detail separately. (See

         As an alternative to a conventional hospital birth, healthy women with low-risk pregnancies may choose to give birth in a birth center or in a home-like environment that has been created in some hospitals. Giving birth at home is another alternative [

        <p>
         Choosing to give birth in a home-like birth environment appears to have beneficial effects. In a meta-analysis of randomized trials of alternative versus conventional institutional settings for birth, low-risk women giving birth in a bedroom-like, ambient, or Snoezelen room used less analgesia, had fewer operative deliveries, and were more satisfied with their birth experience and more likely to be breastfeeding two months postpartum [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51,52

         The term "natural childbirth" is sometimes used to describe a method of childbirth where medical intervention for management of pain or labor is minimized. Various methods of natural childbirth are available. Some of the more common approaches are summarized below. The distinctions between these methods have blurred over time.

         Grantly Dick-Read believed that childbirth is not an inherently painful event. He described a "fear-tension-pain" syndrome in which fear produced tension in the myometrium leading to pain [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53
         </a>
         ]. The educational program that he designed attempts to minimize fear and thus diminish the fear-tension-pain cycle. It also includes an exercise regimen to prepare women for the exertion of labor.

         Lamaze originated in France. Fernand Lamaze combined the concepts of preparation/education to reduce fear and conditioning to diminish the pain reflex (psychoprophylaxis) [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ]. The key features of the original Lamaze method were controlled deep breathing, light massage, concentrating on a focal point, active support by a labor coach, and the woman's control over her body and labor management.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Contemporary Lamaze is quite different. The cornerstone of Lamaze preparation is a philosophy that affirms that birth is normal and natural, women have the inherent ability to give birth, birth is important in women's lives, and the health care provider and place of birth affect women's birth experiences [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. Breathing is only one of many comfort strategies taught in contemporary Lamaze classes. Women are now encouraged to work with their labors, find comfort in response to their contractions, and push in response to the urge to push, rather than letting the labor control their bodies [
         <a href="#rid55">

         Hypnobirthing is based on the belief that when a woman is prepared physically, mentally, and spiritually, she can experience the joy of birth in an easier, more relaxed, and potentially pain-free manner [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57
         </a>

          Goals
         </strong>
         <strong>
          of childbirth preparation
         </strong>
         – The primary goal of childbirth preparation is to reduce fear and anxiety of a potentially stressful and life-changing event. Classes early in pregnancy can help women make decisions about choosing a health care provider and place of birth. Other goals are to enable women to labor and give birth confidently, comfortably, and supported by the people around them. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Goals'

         <strong>
          Quality of the childbirth experience
         </strong>
         – Major factors that influence the quality of the mother's childbirth experience include personal expectations, the quality and amount of support she receives, the quality of the caregiver-patient relationship (eg, communication, continuity of care, empathy, respect), her involvement in decision making, and her clinical risk.

         <strong>
          Childbirth education
         </strong>
         – Childbirth preparation classes provide an opportunity to meet with other pregnant women/couples; share stories; obtain knowledge about pregnancy, labor, birth, postpartum, newborn, and parenting issues; address fears and concerns; and devote time to focus on preparing for birth. This information helps women/couples know what to expect during labor and birth and provides a forum for ultimately making choices within the context of modern maternity care and developing a personal plan for birth.

         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Birth plan
         </strong>
         – Written birth plans reduce conflicts and misunderstandings between women and their providers surrounding the birth by making agreements in advance about what will be done in a normal delivery and what might be necessary if an emergency arises. Typically, a written birth plan covers items listed in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79039" href="/z/d/graphic/79039.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Writing a birth plan'

         <strong>
          Support persons
         </strong>
         – Choosing one or more individuals for continuous support during childbirth appears to have both psychological and medical benefits. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Choosing support people'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Birth location
         </strong>
         – Choosing to give birth in a home-like birth environment appears to have beneficial effects. In addition to the home, home-like environments for giving birth are available for low-risk women in birth centers and in many hospitals. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Choosing the site for delivery'

         <strong>
          Consideration of natural childbirth
         </strong>
         – The term "natural childbirth" is sometimes used to describe a method of childbirth where medical intervention for management of pain or labor is minimized with the intent to interfere as little as possible with the natural, physiologic process of labor and birth. Various methods of natural childbirth are available. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Choosing a natural childbirth method'
         </a>
         above.)
