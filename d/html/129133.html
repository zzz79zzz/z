         Elective or emergency tracheal surgical procedures are performed to remove pathology, improve tracheal patency, or repair loss of tracheal integrity. Anesthetic challenges include managing abnormal airway anatomy, use of specialized endotracheal tubes and other airway devices to meet evolving intraoperative conditions, and need for changes in the mode of ventilation (eg, jet ventilation [JV], intermittent ventilation) during periods when the trachea is open or obstructed.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will discuss anesthetic management of adult patients undergoing open or robotic tracheal resection and reconstruction. Anesthetic management of other tracheal procedures is discussed separately. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         A major goal of the preanesthetic evaluation is to determine whether the tracheal lesion could cause airway obstruction during induction of anesthesia, or subsequently during surgical manipulation and/or resection. Details regarding evaluation of central airway obstruction are available in a separate topic. (See

         Observe breathing at rest and, if possible, during mild exertion. In patients with tracheal stenosis, determine whether increased work of breathing and dyspnea on exertion are present. These symptoms reflect a reduction in luminal diameter that is ≥50 percent [

         Observe the breathing pattern relative to posture. Patients naturally choose their resting position to optimize tracheal patency. Look at their chosen position on the stretcher and then see if the patient can assume a supine posture without increased breathing difficulty. Ideally, the induction position should be the patient's preferred posture.

         Auscultate for respiratory phase-specific noises that suggest location and degree of airway pathology. Inspiratory stridor is associated with at least a 50 percent reduction in diameter at the glottis or periglottis. Expiratory or biphasic stridor is associated with pathology located below the vocal cords. Such findings suggest critically narrowed central airways with risk of acute airway obstruction during induction of general anesthesia due to tracheal wall collapse, secretions, or airway swelling.

         If the tracheostomy device in place needs to be changed for the procedure, device selection and techniques depend on several factors including stomal maturity, ventilation goals during the procedure, intraoperative positioning, and need for aspiration protection. The final device to be placed at the end of the tracheal surgical procedure should also be available and in the operating room. (See

         All types of tracheostomy devices are used in mature stomas, including cuffed devices. Confirm the date of stomal creation.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         If the patient has a history of frequent and uneventful decannulations, then the stomal device can be changed out for an appropriately sized armored endotracheal tube (ETT) (see
         <a class="local">
          'Endotracheal tubes and supraglottic airways'
         </a>
         below). Whether tube exchange occurs before or after induction depends on condition of the tracheostomy and the clinical situation, as discussed in a separate topic. (See

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         If there is no history of decannulation, then we use a Seldinger technique from the device in place to an armored ETT. A tube exchanger is placed through the device and into the trachea, and is held in place while the device is slid out. Then a lubricated armored ETT is gently advanced over the tube exchanger into position.

         – If a stent is present, never manipulate or pull out the device. The surgical team managing the current tracheal procedure will remove the stent if this is necessary to perform the procedure, and will replace it with a cuffed armored ETT. In some cases, a supraglottic airway (SGA) may be used in a patient with a stent device in place while further tracheal surgery is performed. (See

         Re-evaluation of the patient on the day of surgery is necessary since some tracheal lesions can rapidly progress to effect patency. Optimal condition of pulmonary status must be confirmed before elective surgery. If change(s) in status are noted, consult the surgical team regarding potential impact of new findings on planned surgical and anesthetic management. (See
         <a class="local">

        <p>
         If the patient is having a tracheal resection that results in a shortened trachea, they are reminded of the need to awaken calmly. They are told to expect a possible retention "chin-stitch" running from their chin to upper chest that holds their head and neck in flexion during the postoperative period (to offload tracheal tension). This position will be maintained for a few days after surgery.

         A double-lumen ETT (DLT) with only the endobronchial cuff inflated after it has been advanced into the mainstem bronchus on the side of the lung that will be ventilated. In addition, an optional bronchial blocker can be passed into the bronchial lumen of the nonventilated lung to isolate it. (See

         If a DLT is too bulky, then an extra-long ETT may be advanced into the mainstem bronchus of the lung that will be ventilated. However, some long ETTs are floppy with a tendency to dislodge from an endobronchial position  (

         ). However, this requires preparation time that includes careful and thorough sanding/smoothing of the cut edges, and it is difficult to cut off the tracheal lumen. Careful maintenance of the integrity of the ETT cuff and pilot balloon is essential during use of such an improvised long ETT alternative. Reconfirm integrity just prior to use.

         Combining two regular ETTs. The larger of the two is used distally, with a preserved cuff and pilot balloon. The smaller ETT is used as an extension within the larger one. The two ETTs are joined together after wiping the connecting surfaces with alcohol to improve bonding  (

         Also, management of the contralateral/unintubated mainstem bronchus is necessary after planned mainstem bronchial intubation. For example, a bronchial blocker may be passed into the bronchial lumen of the contralateral lung to isolate it if this lung will not be ventilated. An alternative strategy is JV of the contralateral lung via a jet ventilator catheter.

         Changes in tracheal diameter – Positive intrathoracic pressure causes inward projection of the membranous back wall of the trachea, while negative pressure causes an outward bowing of the back wall. If tracheomalacia is present, high positive intrathoracic pressure (eg, during forced exhalation or coughing) is avoided as this may cause complete tracheal obstruction. Reopening can be achieved with either spontaneous inhalations or applied positive pressure ventilation.

         Changes in tracheal length – Strained inspiratory efforts result in added tracheal tension and should be avoided after a tracheal repair with a fragile suture line. Head or neck extension also places cephalad pull on the trachea and can alter the length by a few centimeters, while flexion reduces tension on the trachea and pushes the extrathoracic trachea down into the mediastinum. This mobility may be used to facilitate optimal surgical exposure of the trachea or to reduce tension on suture lines with retention "chin" stitches running from their chin to upper chest to hold the head and neck in flexion.

         In some cases, up to 50 percent of tracheal length is surgically resected. Laryngeal or hilar release may be performed to add 2 to 3 cm of additional tracheal length and mobility, reducing tension on anastomotic sites [

          Before beginning the procedure
         </strong>
         – Flexible bronchoscopic inspection of the glottis and trachea is often performed before surgery begins to define current anatomy and pathology, confirm that the planned surgical procedure is appropriate, and rule out the presence of a new acute process that could be improved with therapy [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,11
         </a>
         ]. Typically, a flexible bronchoscope is inserted transorally in an awake patient using local anesthetic topicalization of the vocal cords and trachea with optional or no sedation, particularly if it is necessary to have an awake and cooperative patient while the surgeon observes the dynamic nature of the tracheal lesion. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91913.html" rel="external">
          "Anesthesia for adult bronchoscopy", section on 'Topical airway anesthesia with sedation'

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In other cases, a flexible bronchoscope is inserted after induction of general anesthesia through an endotracheal tube (ETT) or a supraglottic airway (SGA). During the examination, intravenous (IV) rather than inhalation anesthetic agents are used since frequent suctioning of the trachea causes interruptions in delivery of inhalation anesthetic agents.

          Before beginning the procedure

         – Rigid bronchoscopy may be necessary to dilate the trachea in some patients with critical airway stenosis. The surgeon may insert a small diameter rigid bronchoscope immediately after anesthetic induction to establish a reliable airway and to gently dilate the stenotic area. This may be followed by serial dilations via sequential reintubations with bronchoscopes of increasing diameter to facilitate a traumatic passage of a 5.5 or 6.0 mm cuffed ETT though the dilated area.

         In patients with tracheal narrowing, conditions for ventilation may vary as dilation is accomplished. For example, a small-caliber rigid bronchoscope may be passed through a tracheostomy stoma, with ventilation via the side-port of the bronchoscope. The tight fit of the rigid bronchoscope against the narrowed segment of the trachea allows PPV. However, leakage of gases around the bronchoscope occurs as the stenotic tracheal segment becomes progressively dilated, or when the bronchoscope is not fully engaged with the stricture. High flows of oxygen may be administered to compensate for the leaked airway gases. Chest rising is observed and continuous pulse oximetry is monitored to ensure adequate gas delivery and oxygenation [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Notably, capnography is not a useful monitor during administration of high gas flows, and measurements of end-tidal anesthetic agents will not be inaccurate.

         </strong>
         Deep general anesthesia and neuromuscular relaxation is necessary during rigid bronchoscopy because of noxious airway stimulation and extreme discomfort and to avoid injury to the trachea due to movement. We usually select a total IV anesthetic (TIVA) technique to maintain general anesthesia, and we administer a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) to induce complete muscle relaxation. We avoid administration of inhaled anesthetic agents since leakage of gases around and through the bronchoscope will contaminate the operating room. Furthermore, if JV is employed, TIVA is the only anesthetic choice since inhalation anesthetics cannot be administered via a JV system. (See

         If a right thoracotomy is planned, postoperative pain management is typically achieved with either thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) or paravertebral block (PVB). The epidural or paravertebral catheter is placed before induction of anesthesia to provide intraoperative as well as postoperative analgesia. Alternative analgesic techniques are offered if neither TEA nor PVB is appropriate, or if attempted catheter placement is unsuccessful. These are discussed separately. (See

         As the ventilation mode shifts from spontaneous negative pressure breathing to applied positive pressure ventilation (PPV) during induction of anesthesia, the presence of a tracheal or extrinsic mass may result in airway collapse and inability to achieve adequate mask ventilation. Administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) may not improve or may worsen the clinician's ability to ventilate the patient.

         We usually select a total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) technique with

          remifentanil

         . This is appropriate if the procedure will involve unreliable delivery and inaccurate end-tidal measurements of inhaled anesthetic gases (eg, during JV, intermittent ventilation, or when frequent suctioning of the airway is necessary). Also, a TIVA technique avoids pollution of the atmosphere when a significant leak of inhaled anesthetic gas is expected, such as when the airway is opened by a tracheal incision [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,11,28

         Since intermittent manipulation of the airway during surgery is highly stimulating, the IV anesthetic agents must be frequently adjusted to rapidly change anesthetic depth. For these reasons, we typically select

         In some cases, JV is used as a supplemental ventilation technique to augment standard PPV or intermittent ventilation. Examples include use of JV to provide independent oxygenation of targeted lobes or distal airway segments if tracheal reconstruction involves the distal trachea or carina.

         We usually initiate JV using 100 percent oxygen, a low frequency respiratory rate (RR) of 15 breaths/minute, and a low driving pressure of 15 pounds/square inch (PSI). That driving pressure is likely to be a safe starting point for most small adults.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Almost immediately after initiating JV, driving pressure is adjusted upward to a mid-to-high pressure of 20 PSI until visible rising of the chest is clearly observed. The RR may be increased, but must always allow for full chest recoil and exhalation before the beginning of the next breath. Although each delivered breath may be right on the tail end of exhalation, sequential breaths should never overlap. In the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, reaching full end-expiration may be challenging. In those cases, the RR is kept low, but the duration of each breath is slightly increased.

         Airway management strategies include oral intubation, or rigid bronchoscopy may be used after anesthetic induction to dilate a critical airway stenotic lesion before intubation (see

          'Rigid bronchoscopy'

If the tracheal diameter will not allow use of a DLT even after dilation, then a single lumen tube may be placed through the stoma, with plans to use a bronchial blocker for lung isolation. In some cases, it may be necessary to insert a long single lumen endotracheal tube (ETT) into the left main bronchus to achieve lung isolation. (See

         Similar to open tracheal resection and reconstruction, at a critical point in the surgery, ventilation through the oral ETT stops, and cross-field ventilation is initiated (see

          'Airway management'

Then ventilation is resumed after robotic re-intubation of the distal trachea. This process requires careful communication between the surgical and anesthesia teams to ensure proper timing of repositioning of the oral ETT to avoid unintended oral extubation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Later in the surgery, cross-field ventilation is stopped, the transthoracic ETT is removed from the chest, and the oral ETT is readvanced through the partially closed tracheal anastomosis so that positive pressure ventilation (PPV) can be resumed.

         Supplemental oxygen is administered before and after extubation. Secretions pooled in the oropharynx are suctioned before deflation of the cuff to withdraw the ETT. Close observation of airway patency is necessary during and immediately after emergence and extubation. Communication with the patient is essential, including ongoing evaluation and reassurance.

         For patients with a potentially tenuous airway, the surgeon should remain immediately available. Development of airway obstruction is more likely in patients with intraoperative airway bleeding or excessive secretions since even a small clot or mucous plug may compromise a narrowed airway. Equipment such as flexible and rigid bronchoscopes are kept immediately available in the operating room. Prompt intervention is necessary to treat symptoms or signs of respiratory distress such as:

         If symptoms similar to laryngospasm become apparent, the possibility of vocal cord edema or recurrent laryngeal nerve dysfunction should be ruled out. Phonation is checked and the vocal cords are inspected with diagnostic laryngoscopy or flexible bronchoscopy. If the cords are in continuous apposition at the midline, bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury is suspected. Attempt to gently mask ventilate, while preparations are made for emergency tracheostomy. We consider reintubation only if the view of the cords is clear with likely ease of passage of a small ETT. However, reintubation attempts are usually avoided since they are often traumatic and unsuccessful. (See

         This ETT or jet ventilator catheter is directly connected to a sterile breathing circuit (or jet ventilator tubing) on the surgical field, then is passed over the surgical drapes to achieve cross-field ventilation. After partial reconstruction of the trachea, the oral ETT is readvanced through the new anastomosis and ventilation through that ETT is resumed for the duration of the surgery. (See

         Strategies include oral intubation, or use of rigid bronchoscopy to dilate critical airway stenosis (before intubation but after anesthetic induction). Ideally, a DLT is advanced through the tracheal lesion to achieve lung isolation. If the tracheal diameter will not allow passage of a DLT, then a long single lumen ETT is inserted into the left main bronchus to achieve lung isolation. (See

         At a critical point in the surgery, the oral ETT is retracted, and cross-field ventilation is established by passing another ETT through the closed chest via a small thoracic incision, with robotic re-intubation of the distal trachea. Later, the transthoracic ETT is removed, and the oral ETT is readvanced through the partially closed anastomosis to resume ventilation through that tube. (See

         The surgeon often repeats flexible bronchoscopy to inspect and clean the trachea, either via the retracted ETT or through an SGA inserted shortly before emergence. Most patients emerge from general anesthesia with the ETT or SGA in place, and are extubated in the operating room. (See
