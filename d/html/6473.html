(See <a class="local">'Clinical applications'</a> below.)</p><p>The primary aim is to provide information about the patient's physical working capacity. The information gained from an aerobic exercise test is helpful in determining:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Whether a patient can perform daily activities within his or her functional capacity</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Whether a patient is responding appropriately to an exercise intervention program</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Whether chronic disease progression is affecting the patient's physical capacity</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Contraindications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Exercise testing can be performed safely in most children.

Patients with symptoms of exercise intolerance and those with underlying cardiac or pulmonary conditions can be categorized as lower or higher risk for adverse events during testing, using the risk stratification schema put forth by the American Heart Association, which is summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53217" href="/z/d/graphic/53217.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>In many cases, the benefits of evaluating the child in a controlled environment before allowing him or her unrestricted activity outweigh procedure-related risks. The procedure should be performed in an environment with appropriate safety equipment and personnel. A clinician should be available in case of unforeseen complications [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Equipment'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3423279836"><span class="h2">Criteria for stopping the test</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Exercise testing should be terminated if any of the following occur [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diagnostic findings have been established and further testing would not yield any additional information</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Monitoring equipment fails</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Signs or symptoms indicate that further testing may compromise the patient's well-being</p><p></p><p>Indications for terminating pediatric exercise testing before reaching maximal voluntary capacity level are summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57123" href="/z/d/graphic/57123.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H304898414"><span class="h2">Limitations in young children</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In young children, exercise testing can be challenging due to poor cooperation with the test protocol. In addition, interpretation of exercise testing results in young children (&lt;7 years) is challenging because normative reference values are largely lacking [<a href="#rid3">3</a>], though there are some reference values for four- and five-year-old children using the Bruce treadmill protocol [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>The responsibility of the technologist and interpreting clinician when exercise testing is performed in younger children requires a careful balance of kindness, the ability to encourage and exhort the child to a maximal and consistent effort, and the ability to discern the quality of the overall performance. Behaviorally mediated submaximal performance will lead to inaccurate diagnostic implications.</p><p>There is no consensus regarding the age at which formal exercise testing is generally feasible, and there is great variability among different children at the same age and even in the same child on separate occasions. In our experience, most children can cooperate with exercise testing beginning at around the age of five to six years. A cycle protocol may be easier to administer and may increase the likelihood that the child completes the test. We have used the McMaster cycle protocol in children as young as six years; however, normative values are lacking. The Bruce treadmill protocol has also been used in young children [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Equipment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A clinical pediatric exercise testing unit should include, at minimum, the following equipment [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Treadmill</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cycle ergometer</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Indirect calorimeter</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Electrocardiographic equipment</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Spirometer</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pediatric resuscitation cart (including defibrillator)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pulse oximeter</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Doppler flow detectors</p><p></p><p>Motorized treadmills and cycle ergometers are the most common exercise modalities used in aerobic exercise testing  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef121130" href="/z/d/graphic/121130.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The treadmill is used in children who are old enough to follow the required safety precautions. Treadmill running provides a more accurate indication of cardiorespiratory fitness because it uses greater and more diverse muscle mass than the cycle ergometer, which relies primarily on the quadriceps muscle group. When using the cycle, acute leg fatigue may limit performance slightly before the true cardiorespiratory limit has been reached. Thus, the values for peak aerobic capacity measured on a cycle ergometer are typically 5 to 10 percent lower than those obtained during treadmill testing [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>Nonetheless, the cycle ergometer is a viable testing option, particularly if the child's medical condition or cognitive abilities preclude treadmill testing. Certain physiologic measurements, such as electrocardiogram and blood pressure, are easier to assess and of better quality using a cycle ergometer. The cycle is the preferred exercise testing modality if serial blood samples, blood pressure measurements at high workloads, or arterial oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) saturation measurements are to be obtained.</p><p>Indirect calorimetry units (or metabolic systems) with a computer interface have become more portable (and affordable) over the years. All metabolic systems measure the volume and the fractional concentrations of O<sub>2</sub> and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in expired air. More expensive units also can measure lung volume, arterial O<sub>2</sub> saturation, and cardiac output (via indirect methods). The internal computer calculates the variables of interest, including the volume of O<sub>2</sub> consumed (VO<sub>2</sub>), volume of CO<sub>2</sub> produced (VCO<sub>2</sub>), minute ventilation (VE), tidal volume, and respiratory rate. Depending upon the type of metabolic system, measurements can be made on a breath-by-breath basis, or every 20 to 30 seconds.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Protocols</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A detailed discussion of exercise testing protocols is beyond the scope of this review but is available in reference [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. As a general rule, the exercise test should begin at a low workload so that the child becomes accustomed to the exercise and surroundings. In some cases, the child may need to practice before beginning the test. Exercise testing protocols may be continuous or discontinuous. When comparing results of two tests performed on an individual patient (eg, pre- and postexercise training), it is important to perform both tests using the same protocol and exercise modality.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Continuous</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Test protocols are usually continuous (ie, without rest periods) and have either ramped or incremental stages.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ramped protocols begin at a given speed or power output and increase in intensity throughout the following minute; a metabolic steady state is never achieved during testing. Ramped protocols are preferred when the clinician is primarily interested in subtle metabolic or respiratory responses, such as ventilatory threshold, that occur with increasing exercise intensity up to a maximal level.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Incremental protocols increase the workload at the end of stages that typically last between one to three minutes, depending upon the information being collected. Stages are usually longer if it is important to determine the child's steady state response to a given submaximal workload in addition to his or her maximal exercise values. Incremental protocols permit more time for the clinician to obtain submaximal blood pressure and blood lactate measurements.</p><p></p><p>Total test time for both ramped and incremental protocols should average between 9 and 14 minutes. Longer tests, particularly in young children, may result in acute leg fatigue and volitional exhaustion before a true maximum VO<sub>2</sub> is achieved.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Discontinuous</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In discontinuous exercise protocols, children are permitted to rest between stages. As an example, each exercise stage might last two to three minutes, with one to two minutes of rest in between. Discontinuous protocols may be preferred when more invasive measures, such as fingerstick or venous blood sampling (eg, for glucose and/or lactate analysis), are required or when blood pressure must be measured soon after high workloads. Discontinuous protocols also may be more appropriate for children who are unfit and have low exercise tolerance.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Treadmill</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When a motorized treadmill is used, exercise usually begins with a walk at a slow pace of approximately 2 miles per hour. The workload becomes more challenging as a result of increasing speed (usually 0.5 to 1 miles per hour per stage), treadmill elevation (usually 2 to 3 percent per stage), or both. Depending upon the patient's ability, later test stages may involve running. For children who are physically fit, peak VO<sub>2</sub> estimates obtained with running protocols may be somewhat higher than those obtained from walking tests [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. This occurs because acute leg fatigue may precede true maximum cardiorespiratory effort during an extended walking protocol that involves long steps up a steep hill. Walking protocols may be more appropriate for overweight or unfit children.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">Cycle</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For cycle tests, the pedal speed should be set at a comfortable rate for the child, usually between 50 to 90 revolutions per minute. The initial power output is typically set at approximately 25 watts and increases by increments of 12.5 to 25 watts per stage, depending upon the age and fitness level of the child. Greater increments may be used if the patient is extremely fit.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h1">MEASUREMENTS OF AEROBIC CAPACITY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H716551442"><span class="h2">Physiologic principles</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Aerobic capacity is the maximum volume of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) consumed (VO<sub>2</sub>max) by the body during an exercise challenge. VO<sub>2</sub>max is considered to be the best overall measure of the cardiorespiratory fitness of a healthy individual [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. </p><p>The physiologic components that make up VO<sub>2</sub> are illustrated by the following rearrangement of the classic Fick equation  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57900" href="/z/d/graphic/57900.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>):</p><div class="formulaContainer"><div class="formula"><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>VO<sub>2</sub> = Heart rate (HR) × stroke volume (SV) × (CaO<sub>2</sub> – CvO<sub>2</sub>)</p></div></div><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Where (CaO<sub>2</sub> – CvO<sub>2</sub>) is the difference in O<sub>2</sub> content between arterial and mixed venous blood</p><p></p><p>Thus, the VO<sub>2</sub>max can be affected by both central (cardiac output) and peripheral (CaO<sub>2</sub> and CvO<sub>2</sub>) factors. Maximum cardiac output is limited by HR and SV, which are affected by age, cardiac structure, and cardiac function. The peripheral factors that limit VO<sub>2</sub>max include aerobic enzyme activity, mitochondrial density, hemoglobin concentration, and capillary density in the exercising musculature. These factors are affected by normal biology, heredity, body size, and illness. Acute or chronic disease usually results in lower-than-normal VO<sub>2</sub>max. In contrast, heredity or chronic aerobic exercise training can increase VO<sub>2</sub>max to above-normal levels.</p><p>The unit of measure for VO<sub>2</sub>max in the Fick equation is mL/min. However, it is common practice to divide this value by the body weight (in kg) of the individual who is being tested, resulting in a value that is expressed in mL/kg per min. This is done because most daily activities, and many sports and exercises, are "weightbearing" (ie, the child must move his or her body weight against gravity). The adjustment for weight permits the clinician to compare the individual patient's VO<sub>2</sub>max with normal or population-specific values.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Maximum effort</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>VO<sub>2</sub>max is considered to be the best overall measure of the cardiorespiratory fitness of a healthy individual [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. However, many children are unable or unwilling to achieve a "true" VO<sub>2</sub>max during exercise testing. Thus, the term "VO<sub>2</sub>peak" is often used rather than "VO<sub>2</sub>max" when measuring O<sub>2</sub> consumption during exercise in children [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. "VO<sub>2</sub>peak" refers to a measure of endurance performance without implying that maximal O<sub>2</sub> uptake was achieved. Whether a child is able to provide a maximal effort during exercise testing is dependent upon the child's age, developmental status, cognitive ability, motivation, and disease state. To obtain a "true" VO<sub>2</sub>max, the patient must exercise to volitional exhaustion that is limited by O<sub>2</sub> delivery to, and extraction in, the working muscles, and many children (particularly young children) are unwilling and/or unable to do so.</p><p>When VO<sub>2</sub> is lower than expected for a particular patient, the clinician must decide whether the patient put forth maximal or at least near-maximal effort. This is particularly true in patients who are being tested for fatigue. The following criteria can be used to help determine whether a maximal or at least near-maximal effort has been given:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>VO<sub>2</sub> plateau</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>HR maximum (HRmax)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Respiratory exchange ratio maximum (RERmax)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">VO2 plateau</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The VO<sub>2</sub> plateau occurs when a patient continues to exercise after his/her VO<sub>2</sub>max has been reached, even though the exercise intensity continues to increase  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65149" href="/z/d/graphic/65149.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>) [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. Exercise is able to continue through the contribution of anaerobic metabolism.</p><p>The VO<sub>2</sub> plateau is often considered the "gold standard" criterion for VO<sub>2</sub>max and has been used as such since the mid-1950s [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Unfortunately, however, a plateau does not always occur when testing children, even if they are healthy and exercising to maximal effort [<a href="#rid1">1,7,8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h3">Heart rate maximum</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The achievement of HRmax is another criterion for maximal effort. In adults, HRmax decreases as a function of age and can be predicted by various equations [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. HRmax in adults is usually predicted as follows [<a href="#rid11">11</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1433.html" rel="external">"Exercise physiology"</a>):</p><div class="formulaContainer"><div class="formula"><p class="bulletIndent1">HRmax (beats per minute [bpm]) = 220 – age (in years)</p></div></div><p></p><p>The average HRmax in children and adolescents is considered to be 200 bpm, with a wide range of individual values [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. In our experience, the average HRmax of young adolescents is 197 bpm, with a range of 181 to 231 bpm. This is similar to the findings of other investigators. HRmax may vary by 5 to 10 bpm within an individual child performing different protocols. Most researchers accept an exercise test to be a maximal effort if the child's HRmax is greater than 95 percent of predicted HRmax (ie, HR ≥190 bpm).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h3">Respiratory exchange ratio maximum</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The respiratory exchange ratio maximum (RERmax) is another criterion that is used to evaluate the maximum effort. The RERmax is calculated as the ratio of the volume of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) produced (VCO<sub>2</sub>) to the VO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>When an individual is in a metabolic steady state, the RER (or respiratory quotient) ranges from 0.70 at rest to close to 1.00 during vigorous exercise, primarily because of fat and carbohydrate metabolism, respectively. At maximal workloads, the ratio increases (usually to above 1.00) because of respiratory compensation for the metabolic acidosis of exercise. In addition, children may have an unusually high RER during the pre-exercise period. This is usually caused by anxiety, which results in increased respiratory rate and depth of breathing. The RER returns to a normal value once the exercise begins.</p><p>In one study, the average RERmax among 453 girls who underwent maximal treadmill testing was 1.15±0.09; only 4 percent had RERmax below 1.00 [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Many experts consider an RERmax value &gt;1.00, combined with an adequate HRmax and/or VO<sub>2</sub> plateau, sufficient evidence of a maximal effort in children.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h2">Normal capacity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Reviews of "normal" VO<sub>2</sub>peak during childhood and adolescence have been published [<a href="#rid5">5,14</a>]. In boys, VO<sub>2</sub>peak appears to be fairly constant throughout childhood and adolescence, with reported values averaging between 50 to 55 mL/kg per min. In contrast, in girls, VO<sub>2</sub>peak is highest in early childhood at approximately 50 mL/kg per min and declines steadily throughout adolescence by approximately 1 mL/kg per min per year. It is not well understood if this is mainly the result of onset of puberty, decline in physical activity, or both.</p><p>Although VO<sub>2</sub>peak decreases or plateaus with increasing age, the time to volitional exhaustion typically increases. This is because exercise economies (ie, the VO<sub>2</sub> used per kg of body weight at a given workload) usually increase with age and growth, decreasing the amount of energy required to perform a given exercise task.</p><p>It is important to choose the correct standard when comparing aerobic capacity with the norm. As an example, a 12-year-old girl who has breathlessness and lightheadedness during soccer practice may have a normal VO<sub>2</sub>peak compared with other 12-year-old females but a low VO<sub>2</sub>peak compared with other 12-year-old female soccer players.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h2">Submaximal capacity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Very few activities require a sustained maximal aerobic effort. However, many activities, sports, and other endurance exercises require extended work at a high submaximal level. Thus, for research on aerobic fitness in children, we suggest that VO<sub>2</sub>peak and submaximal VO<sub>2</sub> (or VO<sub>2</sub> at a given workload) be used as outcome measures.</p><p>The ability for a child to perform at a high percentage of his or her VO<sub>2</sub>max is usually estimated by calculating either the lactate or ventilatory thresholds.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17"><span class="h3">Lactate threshold</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>At low to moderate exercise intensity, lactate production and clearance are matched and blood lactate does not increase significantly. However, as exercise intensity increases, production exceeds clearance and lactate concentration increases exponentially. The lactate threshold occurs just before the exponential rise  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66757" href="/z/d/graphic/66757.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). The closer this threshold comes to VO<sub>2</sub>max, the greater an individual's potential for high-level endurance performance. Many coaches believe aerobic training should occur at an intensity level just prior to the point where the onset of the lactate threshold occurs in order for an athlete to derive maximum benefit from a workout.</p><p>It is possible to increase the lactate threshold by performing vigorous aerobic training that might result in little change in VO<sub>2</sub>max  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81861" href="/z/d/graphic/81861.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>). Although the effect of aerobic training on lactate threshold has been studied thoroughly in adults, few investigators have examined this issue in children [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>].</p><p>Most experts agree that lactate threshold protocols should be incremental, with at least three- to four-minute stages. [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. For logistic reasons, unless a discontinuous protocol is used, cycle exercise is preferred over treadmill. The clinician should find the most suitable protocol for his or her laboratory and perform all tests in the same manner. This will increase the internal validity of the measurements. (See <a class="local">'Protocols'</a> above.)</p><p>Blood lactate values can be obtained from simple fingerstick samples. However, some clinicians would prefer not to perform any invasive measure that is not absolutely necessary on a child. They may prefer to use the ventilatory threshold to estimate submaximal performance.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18"><span class="h3">Ventilatory threshold</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ventilatory threshold is the intensity at which ventilation during exercise begins to rise in excess of VO<sub>2</sub>. It is best demonstrated by plotting VE/VO<sub>2</sub> and VE/VCO<sub>2</sub> on the same graph, where VE is the minute ventilation (ie, the volume of gas expired in L/min), VO<sub>2</sub> is the volume of O<sub>2</sub> consumed (L/min), and VCO<sub>2</sub> is the volume of CO<sub>2</sub> produced (L/min). The ventilatory threshold is the point just before VE/VO<sub>2</sub> begins to rise without a similar rise in VE/VCO<sub>2</sub>  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52387" href="/z/d/graphic/52387.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>).</p><p>Given the subtleties associated with respiratory changes during exercise, the best ventilatory threshold results usually are obtained when using ramped protocols. Either the treadmill or the cycle may be used. The clinician should find the most suitable protocol for his or her laboratory and perform all tests in the same manner. This will increase the internal validity of the measurements.</p><p>The use of the ventilatory threshold to measure the ability of a child to perform at a high percentage of his or her VO<sub>2</sub>max is controversial [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. However, some investigators believe that it provides information similar to that gained from the lactate threshold [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. The advantage to the ventilatory threshold is that it is noninvasive. The main disadvantage is that respiration may be affected by many factors during exercise in addition to metabolism. Thus, the ventilatory threshold is usually considered to be less reliable than the lactate threshold measure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19"><span class="h2">Training effects</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In previously sedentary adults, aerobic exercise training increases VO<sub>2</sub>max by approximately 20 percent on average [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. However, studies of the effect of training on VO<sub>2</sub>max in normal healthy children have inconsistent results [<a href="#rid20">20-22</a>].</p><p>It appears that exercise training has a limited effect on VO<sub>2</sub>max in children [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Some authors contend this is because of insufficient training regimens [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>]. In one meta-analysis of the effects of exercise training on VO<sub>2</sub>max in prepubescent and peripubescent children, including studies with both cross-sectional and pretest-posttest designs, the reported changes in VO<sub>2</sub>max in children were small to moderate [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Nonetheless, the average effect size indicated a difference in VO<sub>2</sub>max between trained and untrained athletes, though possible sources of confounding data were identified in the cross-sectional studies (eg, subject self-selection). Analysis of the subset of studies with pretest-posttest designs indicated that on average, training resulted in a 2 mL/kg per minute increase in VO<sub>2</sub>max and was not affected by the sufficiency of the training protocol [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. These results support the "trigger hypothesis" that the trainability of children is low until after puberty [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, cross-sectional studies have shown that child and adolescent athletes have significantly higher VO<sub>2</sub>max values compared with their less athletic peers [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>]. Values of 60 to 70 mL/kg per min are not unusual in endurance-trained child and adolescent runners [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p>In one study, VO<sub>2</sub>max, SV, cardiac output, left ventricular dimensions, arterial pressure, and systemic vascular resistance were compared between prepubertal trained and untrained children [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. VO<sub>2</sub>max was greater among the trained children (58.5±4.4 versus 45.9±6.7 mL/kg per min). Cardiac output during exercise and at rest was also higher in the trained children. The increased cardiac output was explained by increased SV since HR at rest and during exercise were similar between groups. In addition, diastolic and systolic left ventricular dimensions and the pattern of systemic vascular resistance were similar for both groups. These findings suggest that the higher maximal SV in the trained children results from factors that influence resting SV (eg, cardiac hypertrophy, augmented myocardium relaxation properties, expanded blood volume), indicating that genetics may play a role in the determination of VO<sub>2</sub>max values.</p><p>The most convincing evidence of a genetic influence was provided in a comparison of VO<sub>2</sub> variability between monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Monozygous twins had much less variability in VO<sub>2</sub>max than dizygous twins and non-twin brothers. The authors concluded heredity was responsible for between 25 to 50 percent of the variance in the boys' VO<sub>2</sub>max values.</p><p>In contrast with its moderate impact on children's VO<sub>2</sub>max, exercise training may have a greater effect on submaximal exercise performance.

However, it is important to remember that many children with these conditions are sedentary, either because of inability to exercise or advice from doctors and/or parents/caregivers who encourage inactivity [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. In most cases, physical activity can be prescribed for children with these conditions and will result in increased fitness and/or decreased symptoms.

In addition, approximately 8 to 10 percent of children with no apparent history of asthma have EIB [<a href="#rid31">31-33</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/533.html" rel="external">"Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction"</a>.)</p><p>Exercise testing is a useful tool in the diagnosis of EIB and for evaluating the exercise capacity and cardiopulmonary response to exercise in the child with asthma [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. Children with EIB commonly present with postexercise coughing and chest pain; wheezing and dyspnea also may be present. Exercise testing can help to differentiate EIB from other causes of exercise-induced dyspnea in children and may be particularly helpful in those who have no other signs or symptoms of asthma and who do not respond to pretreatment with bronchodilators [<a href="#rid34">34,35</a>]. Other causes of exercise-induced dyspnea may include normal physiologic exercise limitation, restrictive abnormalities, and vocal cord dysfunction.</p><p>The standard exercise protocol for children with EIB is motorized treadmill running at 80 to 90 percent of the child's age-predicted maximal heart rate (HRmax) for six to eight minutes. In the Michigan State University laboratory, this is typically accomplished by setting the treadmill speed at approximately 6 miles per hour, with a 5 to 6 percent elevation. A positive test is one in which the child's postexercise forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) decreases more than 15 percent from pre-exercise level [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p>In children and adolescents who have EIB, the development of bronchoconstriction during exercise and the presence of preexisting obstruction can profoundly alter exercise test performance and the ventilatory responses to exercise.

In contrast with children without EIB, respiratory mechanics and lung capacity in children with EIB may limit aerobic performance and they may quit the exercise test before achieving a true HRmax.

Because of the inherent pulmonary limitations, the time to "exhaustion" will be significantly shorter for CF patients than for healthy children [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. The steep ramp test, an alternative cycle ergometer test that measures peak work rate and does not require the use of respiratory gas analysis, has also been studied in patients with CF and, in one series, was found to correlate well with VO<sub>2</sub>peak measurements obtained using standard cardiopulmonary exercise tests [<a href="#rid38">38</a>].</p><p>In one study of 36 children with CF who were between 6 and 19 years of age, mean VO<sub>2</sub>peak values were more than one standard deviation below the mean for healthy children (31.6±6.1 mL/kg per min) [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2742.html" rel="external">"Treatment of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2278981669"><span class="h2">Congenital heart disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Exercise testing in patients with congenital heart disease is discussed separately.

The information gained from an aerobic exercise test is helpful in determining  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78644" href="/z/d/graphic/78644.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) (see <a class="local">'Purpose of testing'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Whether a patient can perform daily activities within their functional capacity</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Whether a patient is responding appropriately to an exercise intervention program</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Whether chronic disease progression is affecting the patient's physical capacity</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Contraindications</strong> – Exercise testing can be performed safely in most children. Absolute contraindications to exercise testing include acute myocardial or pericardial inflammatory disease and severe outflow tract obstruction requiring surgical intervention. Additional relative contraindications are summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53217" href="/z/d/graphic/53217.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Purpose of testing'</a> above and <a class="local">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Reasons to stop the test</strong> – Exercise testing should be terminated if any of the following occur  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57123" href="/z/d/graphic/57123.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) (see <a class="local">'Criteria for stopping the test'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Diagnostic findings have been established and further testing would not yield any additional information</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Monitoring equipment fails</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Signs or symptoms indicate that further testing may compromise the patient's well-being</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Equipment </strong>– Motorized treadmills and cycle ergometers are the most common exercise modalities used in aerobic exercise testing  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef121130" href="/z/d/graphic/121130.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Treadmill running generally provides a more accurate indication of cardiorespiratory fitness and is used for exercise testing in children who are old enough to follow the required safety precautions. The cycle ergometer is another viable testing option, particularly if the child's medical condition or cognitive abilities preclude treadmill testing. Certain physiologic measurements, such as electrocardiogram and blood pressure, are easier to assess and of better quality using a cycle ergometer. (See <a class="local">'Equipment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Maximum effort</strong> – Aerobic capacity is the maximum volume of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) consumed (VO<sub>2</sub>max) by the body during an exercise challenge. VO<sub>2</sub>max is considered to be the best overall measure of cardiorespiratory fitness. Whether a child is able to provide a maximal effort during exercise testing is dependent upon the child's age, developmental status, cognitive ability, motivation, and disease state. Because many children (particularly young children) are unable or unwilling to attain a true VO<sub>2</sub>max during exercise testing, many experts use the term "VO<sub>2</sub>peak," which refers to a measure of endurance performance without implying that maximal O<sub>2</sub> uptake was achieved. (See <a class="local">'Maximum effort'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Normal capacity</strong> – In boys, VO<sub>2</sub>peak appears to be fairly constant throughout childhood and adolescence, with reported values averaging between 50 to 55 mL/kg per min. In girls, VO<sub>2</sub>peak is highest in early childhood at approximately 50 mL/kg per min and declines steadily throughout adolescence by approximately 1 mL/kg per min per year. (See <a class="local">'Normal capacity'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical applications</strong> – Exercise testing may be helpful in the diagnosis or prognosis of chronic medical conditions, including (see <a class="local">'Clinical applications'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) (see <a class="local">'Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction'</a> above)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Cystic fibrosis (CF) (see <a class="local">'Cystic fibrosis'</a> above)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Growth hormone (GH) deficiency (see <a class="local">'Growth hormone deficiency'</a> above)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>HIV infection (see <a class="local">'HIV infection'</a> above)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Cancer survivors (see <a class="local">'Cancer survivors'</a> above)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) (see <a class="local">'Congenital diaphragmatic hernia'</a> above)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Down syndrome (see <a class="local">'Down syndrome'</a> above)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Arthritis (see <a class="local">'Arthritis'</a> above)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Neuromuscular disease (see <a class="local">'Neuromuscular disease'</a> above)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Chronic fatigue syndrome (see <a class="local">'Chronic fatigue syndrome'</a> above)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Congenital heart disease (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95296.html" rel="external">"Physical activity and exercise in patients with congenital heart disease", section on 'Exercise testing'</a>)</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Paridon SM, Alpert BS, Boas SR, et al.
