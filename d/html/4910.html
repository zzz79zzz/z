Normal gait requires a delicate balance among multiple interacting systems, including three major afferent sensory systems (visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive senses), a locomotor efferent system (including nerves and muscles), and the strict surveillance by several structures of the central nervous system [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>In older adults, gait disorders are a major cause of functional impairment, diminished quality of life, morbidity, and even mortality due to their connection with falls and resulting major fractures or head trauma. In any adult, a gait disorder may be the initial presentation of a wide range of neurologic disorders.</p><p>Most gait disorders are multifactorial and have both neurologic and non-neurologic components. Outside of the nervous system, other structures that play an important role in gait physiology include bones, joints, tendons, and the cardiovascular system (providing hemodynamic stability while standing). A defect at any level of control can result in a gait disorder.</p><p>This topic will review the causes and evaluation of gait disorders, with an emphasis on neurologic causes. Falling in older adults is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3012.html" rel="external">"Falls in older persons: Risk factors and patient evaluation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3014.html" rel="external">"Falls: Prevention in community-dwelling older persons"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Gait disorders are common in adults, and the prevalence increases with age. Approximately 30 percent of community-dwelling adults age 60 years and older have a gait disorder [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Among adults age 80 years and older, the prevalence is as high as 60 to 80 percent [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. Gait disorders are more common in hospitalized older adults and in nursing home populations [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>].</p><p>In a population-based study of 488 community-dwelling older adults, neurologic, non-neurologic, and combined gait disorders were present in 24, 17, and 9 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Among subjects classified as having neurologic gait disorders, the most common involved multiple neurologic causes, often labeled a "multifactorial gait disorder," followed by peripheral sensory neuropathy and parkinsonism. In other studies, myelopathy and a history of multiple strokes are also common neurologic culprits [<a href="#rid3">3,7</a>].</p><p>It is estimated that approximately 15 percent of falls in older adults can be attributed to balance or gait disorders, including leg weakness [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Other contributing factors are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3012.html" rel="external">"Falls in older persons: Risk factors and patient evaluation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H801193097"><span class="h1">CLINICAL GAIT PATTERNS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several classifications of neurologic gait disorders have been proposed. An early classification grouped disorders hierarchically into lower-level (eg, neuromuscular conditions), middle-level (eg, parkinsonian gait), and higher-level disorders (eg, gait apraxia) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Other classifications have been based on anatomy (eg, cerebellar), etiology (eg, vascular), or dominant clinical phenomenology [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>The gait patterns below are organized primarily by clinical phenomenology. An alternative, partially overlapping organization based on the most prominent abnormal sign can be particularly useful in guiding the differential diagnosis at initial presentation [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Sign-based diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H994457801"><span class="h2">Predominant motor dysfunction</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Spasticity with weakness</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Spasticity (increased velocity-dependent tone) is usually accompanied by some degree of weakness resulting from upper motor neuron (UMN) dysfunction in the spinal cord and/or higher central motor pathways in the brain. The combination of UMN leg weakness and increased tone produces a recognizable gait pattern.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gait pattern</strong> – The spastic gait is typically slow; when there is unilateral UMN involvement, the gait is slow and asymmetric. In subclinical cases, asking the patient to walk faster can elicit the typical stiff appearance of one or both legs.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with bilateral spasticity in the legs often have a narrow, scissoring gait in which the thighs and knees are pulled close together by increased adductor tone, sometimes to the point of crossing. The toes turn in and scrape on the floor with each step, producing a scuffing sound and asymmetric wearing of the shoe soles at the tips. This may be more prominent because the hip flexors are weak, preventing compensatory lifting of the feet to clear the ground. Especially when weakness is unilateral (as in a hemiparetic gait), the strategy of circumduction at the hip helps with toe clearance, and weakness or posturing in the ipsilateral arm (flexion at the elbow) is often also evident.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other examination findings</strong> – The typical distribution of UMN leg weakness involves hip flexion, foot and toe dorsiflexion, leg flexion at the knee (hamstrings), and thigh abduction. The other muscles in the legs may be slightly weak, but not to the same extent as the UMN muscles. Hyperreflexia and extensor plantar responses are typically present.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Bladder dysfunction may accompany a UMN gait due to spinal cord dysfunction in the form of frequency, urgency, and urgency incontinence (ie, a small-capacity, spastic, and overactive bladder). Hesitancy and retention suggest bladder dyssynergia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Localization and causes</strong> – Unilateral UMN weakness and spasticity usually indicate involvement of higher motor pathways in the brain or brainstem, although slowly progressive cervical spine stenosis can sometimes cause unilateral weakness. Common causes of a hemiparetic gait include prior focal brain injury due to ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In adults, bilateral UMN leg weakness and spasticity usually localize to the spinal cord (myelopathy). Most myelopathies in older adults are compressive, related to cervical spondylitic/degenerative changes, traumatic or insufficiency fractures, or tumors originating in bone or soft tissue. Intrinsic disorders of the spinal cord, including inherited or neurodegenerative disorders (eg, adrenomyeloneuropathy, hereditary spastic paraplegia), vascular disease, copper deficiency, demyelinating disease, and intramedullary tumors, are less common. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5093.html" rel="external">"Disorders affecting the spinal cord"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4820.html" rel="external">"Cervical spondylotic myelopathy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Other nonspinal causes for bilateral UMN leg weakness are neurodegeneration of the UMN (eg, primary lateral sclerosis), falcine meningiomas, and the long-term sequelae of cerebral palsy (so-called "diplegic gait"). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5136.html" rel="external">"Clinical features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other forms of motor neuron disease", section on 'Primary lateral sclerosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5220.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, pathology, clinical features, and diagnosis of meningioma"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6167.html" rel="external">"Cerebral palsy: Classification and clinical features", section on 'Spastic subtypes'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H159747100"><span class="h3">Stiffness without weakness</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While spasticity is usually accompanied by weakness, rarer conditions can cause a stiff gait in the absence of weakness. Such walking patterns may be mistaken for spasticity.</p><p>Stiff-person syndrome is an autoimmune condition characterized by impairment of inhibitory transmission within the spinal cord. Stiff leg syndrome is a milder variant where only legs, even asymmetrically, are involved. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5131.html" rel="external">"Stiff-person syndrome"</a>.)</p><p>Dystonia, a movement disorder characterized by involuntary twisting postures and movements of different body parts, can also involve the lower limbs (generalized dystonia) and thus cause a stiff gait. The triggering/worsening during specific movements (task specificity) or movements in general (overflow) as well as the transient amelioration with certain other actions (sensory tricks) are specific to dystonia. As an example, some patients might have a transient resolution of the dystonic gait during motor activities other than straight normal walking, such as backwards walking, running, or climbing stairs. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4886.html" rel="external">"Etiology, clinical features, and diagnostic evaluation of dystonia", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1872948318"><span class="h3">Neuropathic gait</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Weakness due to pathology in the spinal motor neurons, nerve roots, or peripheral nerves is referred to as lower motor neuron (LMN) weakness, or neuropathic weakness. LMN dysfunction often involves focal or asymmetric weakness (eg, ankle dorsiflexion weakness, or foot drop) and normal or reduced tone.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gait pattern</strong> – In patients with LMN foot drop, the gait is high stepping because the hip flexors are strong and compensate for the weakness to allow foot clearance. There may be an audible slap as the foot hits the ground ("steppage").</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Observation of the patient during toe and heel walking is an easy way to assess for dorsiflexion and plantar flexion weakness at the ankles. Patients can also be observed attempting to stand on toes or heels.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other examination findings</strong> – The pattern of leg weakness is variable depending on the particular roots or peripheral nerves involved. Predominant quadriceps weakness is often LMN in origin; the knee fails to lock and this causes falls. Toe flexion and foot plantar flexion weakness also usually suggest an LMN cause. Tone is normal or reduced. Deep tendon reflex loss can be used to help localize LMN weakness.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">It may be difficult to separate an LMN foot drop from a UMN lesion, as both can affect foot extension strength; wasting of extensor digitorum brevis, weakness of foot inversion, and sparing of iliopsoas argue for LMN pathology. Alternatively, a pattern similar to foot drop or knee buckling can be seen in patients with dystonia or chorea; normal power and reflexes argue against a LMN cause in such cases.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Bladder dysfunction is relatively uncommon with LMN leg weakness. An exception is with acute bilateral cauda equina lesions, which may cause urinary retention along with LMN weakness.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Localization and causes</strong> – Among older adults, common causes of weak gait with evidence of an LMN weakness on examination include lumbar radiculopathy secondary to degenerative spine disease, hereditary or acquired sensorimotor polyneuropathies, and peroneal mononeuropathy due to compression, trauma, or diabetes. A common cause of bilateral LMN weakness is spinal stenosis, which can often cause neurogenic claudication manifested by back pain, paresthesias, and gait involvement brought on by prolonged standing and/or walking. Distal weakness with mixed LMN and UMN signs may be seen in motor neuron disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5278.html" rel="external">"Overview of lower extremity peripheral nerve syndromes"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5262.html" rel="external">"Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5284.html" rel="external">"Overview of polyneuropathy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5136.html" rel="external">"Clinical features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other forms of motor neuron disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4149684795"><span class="h3">Myopathic gait</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most myopathies involve leg weakness that is symmetric and affects proximal more than distal muscle groups.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gait pattern</strong> – The myopathic gait is classically described as waddling based on the way that hip girdle weakness causes an abnormal pelvic tilt with each step. To isolate hip girdle strength, patients may be asked to bear weight on one leg to detect the pelvis tilting down on the contralateral side because of weakness of gluteus medius (a positive Trendelenburg test).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other examination findings</strong> – Hip flexor weakness can be detected by testing straight leg raise against resistance. A common test of proximal leg strength is to ask the patient to stand up with arms crossed in front of them. Patients with proximal muscle weakness will have difficulty standing up from a seated position without using their arms to push off (Gower's maneuver). Neck flexor weakness is often present in myopathies. The history may reveal difficulty with other tasks that require proximal strength, such as descending and ascending stairs. Tone in the legs is normal.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Myopathic weakness can be challenging to distinguish from LMN weakness at the bedside. Signs that favor myopathic weakness include symmetry, involvement of proximal muscles in the upper body (eg, neck, shoulders), and lack of sensory symptoms, as well as relative preservation of reflexes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5173.html" rel="external">"Muscle examination in the evaluation of weakness"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Localization and causes</strong> – Among older adults, particularly those in nursing homes, the most common cause of muscle weakness and altered gait is deconditioning and loss of muscle mass.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The major categories of primary muscle disease include inflammatory disorders, endocrinopathies, metabolic myopathies, drugs and toxins, infections, and various causes of rhabdomyolysis. Drug-induced myopathies (eg, statins, glucocorticoids) and endocrinopathies (eg, Cushing syndrome, hypothyroidism) are among the treatable causes in older adults. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5155.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with muscle weakness"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Disorders of the neuromuscular junction can also present with a gait characterized by proximal weakness. Myasthenia gravis is an uncommon but important cause of acquired proximal muscle weakness in older adults that may be suspected based on a fluctuating or fatigable pattern of weakness as well as diplopia, ptosis, dysarthria, and dysphagia. Proximal leg weakness is also common in Lambert-Eaton syndrome, a rare paraneoplastic myasthenic syndrome characterized by progressive improvement of strength with movement, the opposite of what seen in myasthenia gravis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5170.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5174.html" rel="external">"Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H125204762"><span class="h3">Parkinsonian gait</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Parkinsonism refers to a clinical syndrome of various combinations of bradykinesia, rest tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. Parkinson disease (PD) and other causes of parkinsonism are a significant cause of gait and posture dysfunction and balance problems in older adults.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gait pattern</strong> – The parkinsonian gait is slow and narrow-based. It is classically described as shuffling because the stride length is reduced, and the feet barely clear the floor. Cadence might be increased to compensate for the reduced stride length. There is a stooped posture, and the natural arm swing that occurs with casual walking is reduced or absent. In PD, the disease process almost always begins asymmetrically, and a difference in arm swing (one side reduced, one side moving freely) can often be observed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In more severe cases, flexion at the elbows becomes prominent. The center of gravity is thrown forwards, and the patient takes increasingly faster, short (petits pas) steps that give the appearance of hurrying or "festinating." Some have described it as "chasing one's shadow."</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Freezing of gait is a common feature of PD and other causes of parkinsonism. Freezing is defined as paroxysmal episodes in which the person cannot step effectively, despite attempting to do so. Manifestations of freezing range from start/turn/destination hesitation to complete akinesia [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Start hesitation is observed when a patient has difficulty initiating gait and takes a few preliminary steps in place before takeoff. When patients step through a doorway or initiate a sudden turn, walking may stop altogether [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Visual or auditory cues can transiently ameliorate freezing of gait.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">When patients are asked to turn rapidly, turning is accomplished by making a series of small steps while keeping the neck and trunk rigid ("en bloc" turning). Importantly, patients tend to always turn in the same direction, pivoting on the most affected leg. Asking the patient to make a 360° turn in one direction and then the other is a useful test to elicit freezing of gait in the clinic.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other examination findings</strong> – When tremor is a component of the syndrome, the more affected arm is usually extended at the elbow, and the typical pill-rolling tremor in the hand becomes more prominent with walking.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Postural instability often accompanies other aspects of the parkinsonian gait. This can manifest as retropulsion, when a patient is easily displaced backwards with a tug of the shoulders and takes a few steps backwards to stabilize themselves. Interestingly, patients with PD have preserved medio-lateral stability, meaning that they can often have a normal tandem gait test (walking one foot in front of the other, as though on a tightrope) and have preserved ability to ride a bicycle [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Localization and causes</strong> – Parkinsonism generally localizes to the dopaminergic pathways of the basal ganglia. PD is the most common cause of neurodegenerative parkinsonism; other degenerative causes include dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal syndrome  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef141072" href="/z/d/graphic/141072.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Early involvement of gait and balance is typical in all of these conditions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4904.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Parkinson disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A parkinsonian gait can also be due to secondary causes, including drug-induced parkinsonism due to dopamine receptor-blocking agents (eg, first- or second-generation antipsychotic agents, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9642" href="/z/d/drug information/9642.html" rel="external">metoclopramide</a>)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120110" href="/z/d/graphic/120110.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/117672.html" rel="external">"Drug-induced parkinsonism"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Cerebrovascular disease in particular often preferentially affects the lower body and thereby the gait [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. This has been referred to as lower-body parkinsonism, which can also be seen in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), although features overlap with higher-level gait disorders, as discussed below.

Vision, hearing, and blood pressure should also be examined.</p><p>Key aspects of the gait examination include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Assess lower limbs</strong> – To examine tone in the legs, patients should be lying supine with legs extended. The examiner first rotates the relaxed leg from side to side at or above the knee. If the foot moves en bloc with the leg, increased tone is present. The examiner then suddenly jerks the leg up at the popliteal fossa. The normal response is for the knee to flex and the heel to slide proximally along the table. If the leg jerks and the heel lifts upwards off the table before relaxing, spasticity is present.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Examine postural control</strong> – Postural control along the antero-posterior axis can be examined by a pull test (standing in back of the patient and exerting a sudden tug on the shoulders, and watching for a corrective step backwards). A variant of the test that is less prone to habituation and compensation is the "push-and-release" test. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Observe walking</strong> – Most examination rooms are too small for an adequate gait assessment, and patients should be observed while walking the length of a hallway, when possible. Some abnormalities are apparent with casual, undisturbed walking, while others are brought out by challenging tasks (eg, walking on heels and toes to bring out foot dorsiflexion weakness; marching in place with eyes closed to bring out rotation/deviation due to vestibular dysfunction; heel-toe walking to bring out cerebellar dysfunction). Asking the patient to do a cognitive task while walking (eg, reciting months of the year backwards), referred to as a dual-task gait test, can also help to identify motor phenotypes, especially in the setting of mild cognitive impairment [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Walking should be assessed at the preferred pace, but asking patients to walk faster can elicit freezing of gait or increased tone in case of spasticity. By contrast, asking patients to slow down can worsen vestibular imbalance or orthostatic tremor. If safe, gait should be assessed without walking aids as well. For example, using a walker narrows the base of support in the case of medio-lateral instability (eg, cerebellar ataxia).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Arm swing should be observed during casual walking, with attention paid to whether there is a symmetric or asymmetric reduction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Additional maneuvers</strong> – A variety of additional maneuvers during examination can help elicit and differentiate key features, as summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef142469" href="/z/d/graphic/142469.html" rel="external">table 7</a>).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1342277965"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H32934056"><span class="h2">Recognizable gait pattern present</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In some cases, a gait pattern is apparent from the neurologic examination, and further testing and diagnosis is guided by the pattern.

For patients with evidence of increased tone or spasticity in the lower limbs (with or without frank weakness), MRI of the cervical spine is a good first test to look for cervical spondylopathy or other causes of cervical myelopathy. Thoracic and lumbar MRI may be needed to exclude a compressive lesion if cervical spine imaging is unremarkable; in addition, patients with cervical spondylosis often have multilevel disease. Brain imaging should always be considered when weakness is asymmetric, when it involves the face and/or arm as well as leg, or when there are other cortical signs.

(See <a class="local">'Spasticity with weakness'</a> above and <a class="local">'Stiffness without weakness'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Neuropathic gait</strong> – Lower motor neuron (LMN) dysfunction often involves focal or asymmetric weakness, muscle atrophy, normal or reduced tone, and loss of reflexes. The pattern of leg weakness is variable depending on the particular roots or peripheral nerves involved. (See <a class="local">'Neuropathic gait'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Myopathic gait</strong> – Most myopathies cause lower extremity weakness that is symmetric and predominantly proximal. Patients with proximal muscle weakness have difficulty standing up from a seated position without using their arms to push off, and the gait may appear waddling as the pelvis tilts with each step. (See <a class="local">'Myopathic gait'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Parkinsonian gait</strong> – Basal ganglia disorders result in a variety of movement disorders: Dystonia causes a stiff gait while parkinsonian gait is characterized by small steps, decreased arm swing, stooped posture, and retropulsion. Parkinson disease (PD) is one of the most common causes of parkinsonism in older adults  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef141072" href="/z/d/graphic/141072.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Parkinsonian gait'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Higher-level gait disorders</strong> – "Higher-level gait disorder" refers to a failure of motor programming, in which basic motor and sensory functions are intact. Patients often have a slow gait with short stride length, disequilibrium, issues navigating obstacles, and fear of falling. (See <a class="local">'Higher-level gait disorder'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Predominant imbalance or unsteadiness</strong> – Disorders of the sensory, cerebellar, and vestibular system result in gait disorders marked by imbalance and unsteadiness  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef142466" href="/z/d/graphic/142466.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See <a class="local">'Sensory ataxia'</a> above and <a class="local">'Cerebellar ataxia'</a> above and <a class="local">'Vestibular gait'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Antalgic gait</strong> – Gait disorders are frequently multifactorial in origin. Pain and rheumatologic disorders commonly contribute to abnormal gait. Antalgic gait is slow and often asymmetric, as the affected individual tends to reduce the weight shift on the affected limb. (See <a class="local">'Antalgic gait and other non-neurologic causes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation and diagnosis</strong> – The goal of the history and examination is to characterize the clinical gait pattern or most prominent abnormal sign, which narrows the etiologic diagnosis and directs further investigations  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef142467" href="/z/d/graphic/142467.html" rel="external">table 6</a>). (See <a class="local">'History'</a> above and <a class="local">'Examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Recognizable pattern present</strong> – In some cases, a gait pattern is apparent from the neurologic examination, and further testing and diagnosis is guided by the pattern  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82835" href="/z/d/graphic/82835.html" rel="external">table 8</a>). (See <a class="local">'Recognizable gait pattern present'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Sign-based diagnosis</strong> – A fully recognizable gait pattern may not present at the time of initial evaluation, either because the patient is presenting early in the course, or because subtle accompanying features are overlooked due to time constraints or a superficial examination. In such cases, a sign-based approach is helpful to narrow the differential diagnosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef142469" href="/z/d/graphic/142469.html" rel="external">table 7</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef142471" href="/z/d/graphic/142471.html" rel="external">table 9</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef142472" href="/z/d/graphic/142472.html" rel="external">table 10</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef142473" href="/z/d/graphic/142473.html" rel="external">table 11</a>).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1037392811"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges Ryan R Walsh, MD, PhD, FAAN, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Fasano A, Bloem BR.
