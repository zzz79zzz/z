They are nonblanching and nonpalpable. They typically occur in dependent areas of the body (lower legs in ambulatory individuals, sacral area in recumbent individuals). Petechiae can be seen in severe thrombocytopenia and with skin fragility or glucocorticoid use. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6676.html" rel="external">"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Bleeding'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Purpura</strong> – Purpura results from coalesced petechiae. Dry purpura describes purpura in the skin. Wet purpura describes hemorrhagic blisters in mucous membranes. Purpura due to thrombocytopenia is flat and nonblanching and is usually seen in dependent areas of the body. Purpura due to vasculitis is usually palpable and may be pruritic, and the distribution does not follow dependent areas. Wet purpura is the most predictive of serious bleeding in individuals with thrombocytopenia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bruise</strong>/<strong>ecchymosis</strong> – A bruise (also called an ecchymosis) is a subcutaneous accumulation of extravasated blood. The skin is flat. The color evolves over time from purplish blue to reddish brown to greenish yellow, reflecting breakdown of hemoglobin to biliverdin and bilirubin. Bruises are generally considered significant when five or more are seen [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Bruises of the same age are consistent with a single traumatic event, whereas bruises of different ages are consistent with an ongoing process.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hematoma</strong> – A hematoma is a collection of blood in the extravascular space. A subcutaneous hematoma may raise the skin profile; hematomas in deep tissues (muscle, retroperitoneal) may be suspected due to pain, a drop in hemoglobin, or a fluid collection on imaging studies. Hematomas and hemarthroses (joint bleeding) are typical of coagulation factor deficiencies.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bleeding challenge</strong> – A bleeding challenge is an event that would normally cause bleeding, such as a dental extraction, surgery, delivery, or trauma.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Primary and secondary hemostasis</strong> – Primary hemostasis refers to the initial steps in clot formation, which mostly rely on the integrity and elasticity of the vessel wall and interactions between the vessel wall, platelets, and von Willebrand factor (VWF). Secondary hemostasis refers to the subsequent formation of the fibrin-based clot, which mostly relies on coagulation factors. Disorders of primary hemostasis often present with mucocutaneous bleeding or petechiae, whereas disorders of secondary hemostasis present with deep tissue hematomas or joint bleeding. von Willebrand disease (VWD) may have features of both. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1371.html" rel="external">"Overview of hemostasis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bleeding diathesis</strong> – A bleeding diathesis (hemorrhagic diathesis, bleeding tendency, bleeding disorder) refers to an inherited or acquired disorder affecting primary or secondary hemostasis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Major bleeding</strong> – A variety of definitions have been used in clinical trials. Typically, major bleeding is defined as bleeding that results in death, affects a critical organ such as the brain or a large joint, causes a fall in hemoglobin level of 2 g/dL or more, or requires transfusion of two or more units of red blood cells [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) includes bleeding that is more than expected for the circumstances and that requires some intervention (hospitalization, medication, face-to-face discussion) but is not severe enough to constitute major bleeding [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bleeding assessment tool (BAT)</strong> – A BAT, also called a bleeding score, is used to quantify bleeding by site and severity as a means for predicting the likelihood of a bleeding disorder and/or to codify bleeding in clinical studies. (See <a class="local">'Bleeding score'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H72714571"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF THE EVALUATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1094511141"><span class="h2">Actively bleeding patient</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Individuals with active bleeding and a suspected (but not previously diagnosed) bleeding disorder are especially challenging to manage because they may require interventions for bleeding before a specific diagnosis is established. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A search for an anatomic or surgical lesion responsible for the bleeding (tumor, nicked blood vessel) should be made, especially if the bleeding appears to be limited to a single site. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A prothrombin time (PT) activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), platelet count, fibrinogen level, and blood smear are reviewed, with additional tests based on the clinical scenario. This may include evaluation for a platelet disorder with platelet function analyzer (PFA-100) and von Willebrand factor testing or testing for an acquired factor VIII inhibitor in individuals with no prior bleeding history who present with a prolonged aPTT. (See <a class="local">'Clinical vignettes'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Early involvement of the consulting hematologist should be sought for those with evidence of hemostatic perturbations, both to assist with the evaluation and determination of likely causes as well as to help in obtaining and dosing hemostatic products if needed. (See <a class="local">'Indications for hematologist referral'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4222616725"><span class="h2">Interventions for bleeding during the evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following may also be appropriate:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Platelet transfusions</strong> – Individuals with active bleeding and thrombocytopenia should receive platelet transfusions to raise the platelet count to at least 50,000/microL (100,000/microL for central nervous system bleeding or bleeding into a closed compartment). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7918.html" rel="external">"Platelet transfusion: Indications, ordering, and associated risks", section on 'Actively bleeding patient'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Platelet transfusions may also be appropriate if there is concern that impaired platelet function is contributing to bleeding (eg, use of antiplatelet medications, abnormal platelet morphology, uremia, diabetes mellitus, or certain other disorders). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6675.html" rel="external">"Inherited platelet function disorders (IPFDs)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">There have been reports that certain disorders may be exacerbated by platelet transfusions (eg, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [TTP], disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC], heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [HIT]). Despite this, platelets should <strong>not</strong> be withheld for severe bleeding; in such cases, the risk of fatal bleeding outweighs the theoretical increased risk of thrombosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7918.html" rel="external">"Platelet transfusion: Indications, ordering, and associated risks", section on 'TTP or HIT'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fibrinogen or </strong><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9771" href="/d/drug information/9771.html" rel="external">vitamin K</a> – Individuals with active bleeding and prolonged clotting times (PT and aPTT) may have vitamin K deficiency; a low fibrinogen level; or deficiency of factor II (prothrombin), X, or V. The thrombin time (TT) will be normal with factor II, X, or V deficiency and prolonged in individuals with a low fibrinogen level. The fibrinogen level should be checked (along with D-dimer if DIC is suspected) and vitamin K may be administered if deficiency is suspected. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9082" href="/d/drug information/9082.html" rel="external">Fibrinogen concentrate</a> (or cryoprecipitate) should be administered to actively bleeding individuals to maintain the fibrinogen level &gt;100 mg/dL (&gt;200 mg/dL during pregnancy). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1306.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in adults", section on 'Prevention/treatment of bleeding'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/130462.html" rel="external">"Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) during pregnancy: Management and prognosis", section on 'Management of hemodynamically unstable patients'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clotting factor products</strong> – Clotting factor products such as a prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) are generally reserved for specific indications such as reversal of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> anticoagulation for the former or treatment of hemophilia with an inhibitor with either product. However, in a potentially fatal situation, these products may be administered. Some PCCs contain heparin and are contraindicated in individuals with HIT. Input from the consulting specialist is advised as some of these products are potentially thrombogenic. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7925.html" rel="external">"Plasma derivatives and recombinant DNA-produced coagulation factors", section on 'Clotting factor products'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Antifibrinolytic agents</strong> – Antifibrinolytic agents such as epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10011" href="/d/drug information/10011.html" rel="external">tranexamic acid</a> (TXA) have been used to treat mucosal bleeding in patients with congenital bleeding disorders. TXA is also licensed to treat heavy menstrual bleeding and has been shown to improve mortality when given early in trauma or in women with postpartum hemorrhage. These agents are contraindicated in individuals with upper pole urinary bleeding (due to the risk of ureteral blockage and hydronephrosis) and in individuals with DIC.</p><p></p><p>Acute bleeding can produce changes in the hemostatic system, and the full evaluation may need to be completed in the outpatient setting after the individual has recovered.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2459371734"><span class="h2">Patient not actively bleeding</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The first step in an individual who is not actively bleeding is to determine whether the individual actually has a bleeding disorder. This may be challenging because the bleeding history is fraught with diagnostic uncertainty. Descriptions of bleeding severity can be subjective, not all individuals have been exposed to bleeding challenges, and clinical presentations may be quite variable even among individuals with the same bleeding disorder. Many individuals with inherited bleeding disorders report minimal bleeding; conversely, many individuals with normal hemostasis report exaggerated bleeding [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>].</p><p>The variability in perceptions among different individuals and the lack of a uniform clinical measure of bleeding severity make the bleeding history even more important [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Patient history'</a> below and <a class="local">'Bleeding score'</a> below.)</p><p>Once the bleeding history is obtained and quantified and the physical examination performed (see <a class="local">'Targeted physical examination'</a> below), screening laboratory testing is performed with subsequent testing based on the initial results.

Typically this is done using a bleeding assessment tool (BAT; also called bleeding score). (See <a class="local">'Bleeding score'</a> below.)</p><p>The goal is to determine the likelihood that a bleeding disorder is present, and for those with a reasonably high likelihood of a bleeding disorder, to determine the most likely type of disorder (eg, associated with primary hemostasis [platelets] or secondary hemostasis [coagulation]) and whether the disorder is inherited or acquired.</p><p>Important questions focus on the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The reason for the consultation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prior bleeding events over time:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Bleeding during infancy (eg, umbilical stump bleeding) and childhood (eg, bleeding with loss of deciduous teeth).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Bleeding during adolescence and adulthood (additional questions below related to menstruation and pregnancy).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Any bleeds severe enough to require surgical intervention, nasal packing or cautery, a visit to the emergency department, or transfusion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of iron deficiency or iron-responsive anemia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Outcome of bleeding challenges:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Trauma, including severity of bleeding, need for surgical intervention, and need for transfusions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Surgical procedures, including timing and location, comments of the surgeon regarding the character of the bleeding (eg, diffuse oozing versus bleeding from a specific source), and need for transfusions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Dental procedures (eg, extractions), including timing, duration, and need for packing or additional interventions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If a woman has bled with some procedures but not others, she should be asked if she was taking oral contraceptives or hormone therapy during procedures in which she had good hemostasis, since these hormones can increase levels of von Willebrand factor (VWF) and normalize hemostasis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>History of poor wound healing.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Menstrual history, especially the presence of nighttime "flooding," passage of clots larger than approximately 2.5 cm (size of a quarter [United States coin]), duration of menses longer than eight days, development of iron deficiency, and/or heavy menstrual bleeding (previously called menorrhagia) leading to hysterectomy at a young age [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Measures such as number of pads or tampons used can be imprecise because they depend on the fastidiousness of the individual, and the volume of blood lost is nearly impossible to determine if pads or tampons are used. Scoring systems have been devised that use pictures of pads or tampons with varying degrees of saturation; a high score correlated well with the presence of heavy menstrual bleeding in some studies [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Endometriosis and hemorrhagic ovarian cysts are seen with increased frequency in women with von Willebrand disease (VWD) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pregnancy history, including bleeding with delivery or postpartum and early pregnancy loss (seen with some rare coagulation factor disorders).

Her International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) bleeding score was 14, strongly indicative of an underlying bleeding disorder. She had been told she had von Willebrand disease (VWD). Her breast biopsy was complicated by hemorrhage; her entire breast turned hard and purple, and she developed purple discoloration down to the level of her umbilicus. Coagulation testing revealed a normal prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).

Von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen and activity were both &gt;100 percent. Platelet lumiaggregation testing showed a secretion defect in response to collagen, ADP, epinephrine, and arachidonic acid. She had a defect in the secondary wave in response to epinephrine and low-dose ADP. She thus did not have VWD, but rather a qualitative platelet defect (storage pool disorder).

We start with a thorough history that includes underlying medical conditions, spontaneous bleeding, response to bleeding challenges, family history, and medication use, including over-the-counter medications and herbal preparations  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120264" href="/d/graphic/120264.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). The history also helps to determine if a disorder is likely inherited or acquired and likely due to platelet/vascular abnormalities or coagulation factor dysfunction  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77834" href="/d/graphic/77834.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The bleeding score is used to quantify the personal bleeding history.

The extent and sequence of testing are tailored to the urgency and likely cause(s). A typical evaluation begins with platelet count and morphology review, prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). For those with a bleeding history that suggests a disorder of primary hemostasis (eg, mucocutaneous bleeding), an evaluation for VWD and platelet function is warranted.
