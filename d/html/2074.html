         Severe allergic reactions to vaccines are rare and difficult to predict. An allergic reaction may be defined as an idiosyncratic reaction that is caused by an immunologic mechanism.
        </p>
        <p>
         The World Allergy Organization (WAO) has recommended categorizing immunologic reactions to drugs (including vaccines) based upon the timing of the appearance of symptoms [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. This system defines two general types of reactions: immediate and delayed. This approach is intended to distinguish immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated (type I immunologic reactions), which account for many immediate reactions, from other types because these reactions carry the risk of life-threatening anaphylaxis if the patient is reexposed  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80466" href="/z/d/graphic/80466.html" rel="external">

         ).

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Immediate reactions begin within one hour of administration and may begin within minutes. IgE-mediated reactions are most likely to present within this time period.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Delayed reactions appear several hours to days after administration. These reactions may be caused by several different mechanisms, but they are rarely IgE mediated.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic review focuses on immediate-type allergic reactions to vaccines, although delayed reactions are also discussed briefly. Of note, reactions to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines, as well as the administration of influenza vaccine to egg-allergic patients, are discussed separately (see

         </span>
         The most severe form of an IgE-mediated allergic reaction is anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is defined as a systemic allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis have been proposed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network symposium  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef72225" href="/z/d/graphic/72225.html" rel="external">

         ) [
         <a href="#rid2">

         Anaphylactic reactions to vaccines are rare, with rates from active surveillance studies ranging from 0.3 to 2.9 per million vaccine doses [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-6
         </a>
         ]. A review of reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) over 26 years from 1990 to 2016 describes eight deaths possibly caused by anaphylactic reactions to vaccination [
         <a href="#rid5">

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         </span>
         When anaphylaxis occurs after administration of a vaccine, patients generally develop symptoms within 30 minutes [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,7,8
         </a>
         ], although the onset may rarely be delayed up to several hours [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. The later-onset reactions tend to be less severe. Reactions that occur hours to days after vaccine administration could be due to delayed absorption of the allergenic component. Alternatively, some of these late reactions may not be causally related to vaccination but rather due to exposure to another allergen after vaccination.

         It is important to understand that there are other reactions to vaccines that could mimic an anaphylactic reaction, including vasovagal reactions and anxiety-related symptoms [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. While it is important to recognize and treat anaphylaxis, it is equally important not to label these other conditions as anaphylaxis, particularly when there are no objective findings. Thus, careful recording of vital signs and physical exam findings (including skin, oropharynx and lungs) and including photographs of skin findings if possible are essential. A blood sample should be obtained within four hours of an apparent anaphylactic episode for mast cell tryptase [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Although the result will not be available immediately, it is very important for subsequent evaluation where an elevated level would confirm the diagnosis of anaphylaxis, although a normal level would not exclude it.

         </span>
         Vaccine administration may elicit vasovagal reactions (fainting), particularly in patients who are prone to this response [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Vasovagal reactions are characterized by hypotension, pallor, diaphoresis, weakness, nausea, vomiting, bradycardia, and, if severe, by loss of consciousness. Vasovagal reactions can mimic anaphylaxis because both may involve hypotension and collapse. However, the cutaneous signs and symptoms are usually quite different [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. With vasovagal reactions, fainting is usually preceded by pallor, whereas anaphylaxis often begins with flushing and may also include itching, urticaria, and angioedema. In anaphylaxis, (reflex) tachycardia is more common than the bradycardia typical of vasovagal reactions.
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients who report past fainting in response to vaccinations, it is prudent to administer future vaccines while the patient is lying supine [

         Several types of delayed reactions to vaccines have been noted, including common reactions like fever or local swelling and various rare reactions. These may be immunologic or nonimmunologic in nature.

         <strong>
          Local reactions
         </strong>
         – Local reactions to vaccination, such as swelling and redness at the injection site, are common and self-limited. Symptoms usually develop a day or two after administration and may last for several days. They should not be considered reasons for avoiding administration of further doses of the vaccine [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,15
         </a>
         ]. Local reactions can be treated with cool compresses for the first hours after symptoms appear or with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">
          acetaminophen
         </a>
         or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) if pain or swelling is troublesome. However, antipyretics should not be administered empirically or prophylactically, as a few studies have found that these medications may reduce the immune response to vaccination. This issue is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2876.html" rel="external">

         It was believed that shorter intervals between certain vaccine doses were associated with increased rates of local reactions, although studies have now shown that this is not the case. The recommended interval between doses of tetanus-containing vaccines had been 10 years. New vaccines were recommended in 2006 to provide not only booster doses for tetanus and diphtheria (Td) but also to pertussis (Tdap) [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16-18
         </a>
         ]. Two subsequent studies reported rates of local reactions in patients given the new vaccine. In one, the rates of injection-site reactions to Tdap were no different among subjects who had received Td within the past two years compared with those vaccinated with Td more than two years before [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. Another study found no higher rates of injection-site reactions whether a Tdap-containing vaccine was administered one month after a Td-containing vaccine or after placebo [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. It is now recommended that Tdap be given to all adolescents and adults regardless of interval since the last Td and to pregnant women with each pregnancy [

         Gelatin, which is added to several vaccines as a stabilizer, is responsible for many anaphylactic reactions to measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), varicella, and Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccines (a new JE vaccine does not contain gelatin)  (

          28

        </p>
        <p>
         A history of allergy to the ingestion of gelatin and gelatin-containing foods (eg, marshmallows and "gummi" candies) should be sought prior to the administration of any gelatin-containing vaccine  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63833" href="/z/d/graphic/63833.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ). However, a negative history of an allergic reaction to the ingestion of gelatin does not exclude gelatin as being responsible for an allergic reaction when injected with the vaccine, and patients who have experienced a reaction to a vaccine may require testing for gelatin allergy [
         <a href="#rid25">

        </p>
        <p>
         Persons who react to gelatin on ingestion should be evaluated by an allergist prior to receipt of gelatin-containing vaccines. If the history is consistent with an immediate-type allergic reaction to gelatin and this is confirmed by skin tests or serum-specific IgE antibody tests to gelatin, it is prudent to skin test such patients with gelatin-containing vaccines prior to administration. If the vaccine skin tests are negative, the vaccine can be given in the usual manner but the patient observed for at least 30 minutes afterward. If the vaccine skin tests are positive, the vaccine can be administered in graded doses. Alternatively, gelatin-free brands of some vaccines, such as MMR and varicella, are available in some countries [

         The incidence of allergic reactions to gelatin in vaccines was particularly high in Japan, a phenomenon that was subsequently attributed, in part, to genetic characteristics of the population [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32,33
         </a>

         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. Another study evaluated the administration of yellow fever vaccine to 71 egg-allergic patients, including 24 with a history of anaphylactic reactions to egg ingestion [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. All 71 patients had negative skin prick test (SPT) results to the vaccine. Intradermal tests (IDTs) to the vaccine were performed in five patients and positive in two. One patient with a negative SPT in whom an IDT had not been performed developed facial urticaria after vaccination that resolved after treatment with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9572" href="/z/d/drug information/9572.html" rel="external">
          loratadine
         </a>
         . One patient with a positive IDT developed mild urticaria after the IDT but tolerated vaccination in divided doses without reaction. Thus, consideration can be given to administration of yellow fever vaccine to egg-allergic recipients as a single dose without prior vaccine skin testing but with a period of observation afterward. If further studies replicate the safety of this approach, as with influenza vaccine, it may not be necessary to inquire about egg allergy prior to the administration of yellow fever vaccine.

         Thimerosal, aluminum, and phenoxyethanol are added to some vaccines as preservatives, although the use of thimerosal (which contains mercury) in vaccines has decreased dramatically due to theoretical concerns about cumulative mercury exposure in children. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2846.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         These preservatives have not been documented to cause immediate-type allergic reactions to vaccines, and immediate-type skin testing is not indicated. They can cause delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions and contact dermatitis when applied topically to the skin, however:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">

         Contact sensitivity to them is not a contraindication to receiving vaccines containing them [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,15,42-44
         </a>
         ]. There is a case report of an adult who developed a generalized maculopapular rash to a thimerosal-containing influenza vaccine [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ]. This was thought to be a T cell-mediated allergic response to thimerosal because of a positive patch test to this substance. This is a rare and unpredictable complication if indeed there is actually a causal relationship.

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The ability of these agents to cause delayed local reactions after vaccination is another concern for which some limited evidence exists. One study examined 125 patients with patch test-positive contact sensitivity to thimerosal or its derivatives who were challenged with intramuscular injections of thimerosal [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. Only 4 percent (five patients) developed mild local reactions to the injection, indicating that local reactions are uncommon even in these contact-sensitized patients.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Rarely, aluminum-containing vaccines cause persistent nodules at the injection site, possibly because of delayed hypersensitivity or other immune responses to aluminum [
         <a href="#rid21">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, patch testing or any specific testing for suspected sensitivity to these preservatives for the purpose of assessing a patient's ability to tolerate a vaccine containing it is not necessary. Patch testing can be performed for the diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis, but this is not helpful in relation to vaccination. If a patient with documented contact dermatitis to one of these additives is concerned about receiving a vaccine containing the same agent, then it is prudent to administer a formulation that does not contain it, if available. Similarly, if a patient with known contact sensitivity has had a bothersome local reaction to a vaccine containing the preservative in the past and needs another, it would be prudent to give a product that is free of that preservative, if available. However, if a vaccine without the preservative is not available, the risk of any local reaction is minimal and should not preclude vaccination. (See

         Some influenza vaccines contain hen's egg protein, although not in sufficient quantity to provoke reactions in egg-allergic recipients. Reactions to the influenza vaccine in egg allergic patients are discussed in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2389.html" rel="external">
          "Influenza vaccination in persons with egg allergy", section on 'Risk of anaphylaxis to vaccines'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In Japan in 2011 and 2012, there was a three- to fivefold increase in influenza vaccine-associated anaphylaxis, which was reported in 36 children without egg allergy, of whom 19 were subsequently investigated [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59
         </a>
         ]. These 19 had abnormally high levels of IgE directed against whole vaccine and against several hemagglutinin proteins, while they did not have egg-specific IgE or IgE directed against the various excipients in the vaccines. Skin testing with full-strength vaccine was performed in just 3 patients but was positive in all 3 and negative in 10 control patients, including some with egg allergy. The patients' basophils were activated when incubated with the vaccine. These findings suggest (but do not prove) that the allergen was some component (possibly hemagglutinin) of the vaccine. Interestingly, all reactions were caused by a vaccine from one specific manufacturer, and this preparation was unique in containing the preservative 2-phenoxyethanol (2-PE). IgE to 2-PE was not detected in the patients' sera, but the authors hypothesized that 2-PE may interact with vaccine components to enhance allergenicity in some way. The manufacturer replaced the 2-PE with thimerosal, and reaction rates returned to baseline.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a subsequent Japanese study, whole vaccine-specific IgE and IgG were measured in 393 healthy children who had uneventfully received influenza vaccines [
         <a href="#rid60">
          60
         </a>
         ]. Levels were assessed before and after one dose of vaccine or two doses of vaccine administered four weeks apart. Prior to vaccination, vaccine-specific IgE was present at baseline in 30 percent of those six months to two years of age and up to 70 percent of older children, presumably due to vaccination in prior years. Some additional increase in vaccine-specific IgE was observed after vaccination in the youngest age groups. Vaccine-specific IgG was also detected in most children and at higher levels in those who also had measurable vaccine-specific IgE. Vaccine-specific IgG/IgE ratios increased following vaccination in all age groups. The authors investigated the vaccine-specific IgG/IgE ratios in a separate group of five patients who had anaphylaxis after previous influenza vaccination, and this ratio was markedly lower compared with children who had tolerated the vaccine. Thus, it would appear that it is quite common to develop both vaccine-specific IgE and IgG after influenza vaccination, likely directed at hemagglutinin protein. In most vaccine recipients, the IgG, which may function as "blocking" antibody, is sufficient to protect from IgE-induced reactions. However, patients who develop higher amounts of IgE relative to IgG may be susceptible to allergic reactions.

         Many vaccines are given as a series, yet some recipients generate an adequate response to fewer than the usual number of doses. Thus, if a prior possible reaction is concerning enough to consider withholding additional doses, it is reasonable to determine the antibody level achieved by the doses already received. Protective levels of specific antibody have been determined for many vaccines, and some are routinely available in commercial reference laboratories. If a patient has already generated a protective response, then it may not be necessary to give the remaining doses in the series. However, the level of protective antibody may not persist as long in persons vaccinated with fewer than the usual number of doses.

         If a patient with a suspected IgE-mediated reaction to a vaccine is to receive further doses, skin testing with the vaccine should be performed. Proper performance and interpretation of skin tests requires expertise in the procedure, including the use of appropriate positive and negative controls. Also, skin tests themselves can rarely cause anaphylactic reactions in highly allergic individuals. Thus, skin testing should only be performed by persons such as allergists with training in interpretation of and treatment of possible reactions to the tests and only in a setting where anaphylactic reactions can be recognized and treated quickly.

         The vaccine should first be tested by the skin prick method. Full-strength vaccine can be used, unless the history of reaction was truly life threatening, in which case it is appropriate to dilute the vaccine before skin prick testing (SPT) [

         The history of the reaction is critically important in interpreting skin tests to vaccines. Clinically irrelevant positive skin tests are possible, as with skin testing to any allergen. The presence of a positive skin test to a vaccine is not necessarily predictive of a subsequent reaction, although it must be viewed as a significant risk factor. (See

         Vaccines can induce IgE antibody production in the days to weeks after vaccination, although the clinical significance of this is unclear. Specific IgE to diphtheria (DT) and tetanus toxoids was induced by vaccination and found to persist for at least two years after immunization [
         <a href="#rid81">
          81,82
         </a>
         ]. This specific IgE was not associated with allergic reactions with subsequent vaccination.

         Irritant (false-positive) skin test reactions are also possible, particularly with IDT at concentrations of 1:10 or undiluted. One study of 20 adult volunteers without histories of vaccine reactions evaluated responses to SPT and IDT with 10 common vaccines [

         In patients who have had an apparent allergic reaction after a vaccine, skin testing with the vaccine in question is appropriate to assess whether or not the reaction was IgE mediated and to guide subsequent dosing and observation. In vitro tests (ie, specific IgE immunoassays) are not available to assess for allergy to whole vaccine solutions. In the case of a positive vaccine skin test result, additional evaluation for allergy to particular constituents is appropriate. In cases where an allergic reaction a specific vaccine is determined to be due to a particular constituent, skin testing with other vaccines that contain that constituent is appropriate prior to administration. However, vaccine skin testing should not be used to "screen" for possible allergy the other vaccines that do not contain the constituent.
        </p>
        <p>
         In most circumstances, vaccine skin testing should also not be used to "screen" for possible allergy where a patient has a known allergy to a vaccine constituent but no history of vaccine reaction, because, for the vast majority of these constituents (eg, hen's egg, cow's milk, yeast, or latex), vaccine reactions are exceedingly rare even in patients with known constituent allergy. The exception is the rare patient who has a confirmed allergy to the ingestion of gelatin, where skin testing to gelatin-containing vaccines prior to administration would be appropriate.

         If vaccine or vaccine component skin tests (to which the patient previously reacted) are positive and if a vaccine is deemed necessary, the vaccine may still be administered using a graded-dose protocol. A graded protocol is provided here and also in the footnote of the algorithm  (

          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Administration of a vaccine to an allergic person, even by such a graded-dose protocol, still carries the risk of an anaphylactic reaction and should be undertaken
         <strong>
          only after
         </strong>
         obtaining written informed consent. In addition, administration should be undertaken in a setting with personnel and equipment to recognize and treat anaphylaxis. Successful administration of vaccines to patients with positive skin tests using graded protocols has been described for several different vaccines [

         Although vaccine administration in graded doses is not considered a desensitization, the approach to management of symptoms during graded dosing would be similar, where, if symptoms that develop resolve spontaneously or are successfully treated, the protocol can be resumed. For a vaccine where usual dose is 0.5 mL, administer graded doses of vaccine at 15-minute intervals:

          Anaphylaxis after vaccination is rare
         </strong>
         – Anaphylactic reactions to vaccines are rare, although potentially life threatening. These immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated reactions are most often due to vaccine constituents rather than microbial products. Symptoms of anaphylactic reactions to vaccines are similar to those of anaphylaxis from other etiologies  (

          Implicated vaccines

         – There have been rare reports of systemic allergic reactions to nearly every vaccine, although some vaccines are more commonly implicated, including the vaccines for yellow fever, measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), and tetanus. (See

          Evaluation and management
         </strong>
         – Evaluation of a possible vaccine allergy begins with determining if symptoms and timing are consistent with an anaphylactic reaction  (

         – If skin testing with the vaccine is negative, the patient may receive the vaccine in the usual manner. For safety, such patients are usually given the vaccine under the supervision of the allergy specialist. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Administration of vaccines'

          Positive result
         </strong>
         – If skin testing to a constituent (eg, gelatin, egg) or to the vaccine is positive, it may still be possible for the patient to receive the vaccine in a graded manner  (
