Significant valvular heart disease is often first diagnosed based upon the finding of a murmur. Auscultation has a reported sensitivity of 70 percent and a specificity of 98 percent for the detection of valvular heart disease [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. However, the sensitivity and specificity vary substantially with the expertise of the examiner. The expertise and proficiency in auscultation have been waning in the modern era, which has led to a greater dependence on more expensive imaging techniques [<a href="#rid2">2-5</a>].</p><p>In clinical practice, echocardiography is the standard for establishing the cause of a murmur. As noted in major society guidelines, an echocardiogram is indicated for the diagnosis and evaluation of patients with known or suspected valve disease [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. Echocardiography is not needed in asymptomatic patients with a benign flow murmur but is appropriate in patients with cardiac symptoms and any cardiac murmur. It is also indicated in asymptomatic patients with a diastolic murmur, a grade 3 or greater systolic murmur, or a systolic murmur in association with other abnormal exam findings, such as a systolic click or reduced carotid upstroke.</p><p>This topic will review the auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults, including the maneuvers (eg, respiration, Valsalva maneuver) that can be used to differentiate one murmur from another. These maneuvers, as well as auscultation of other heart sounds, are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1080.html" rel="external">"Physiologic and pharmacologic maneuvers in the differential diagnosis of heart murmurs and sounds"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1079.html" rel="external">"Auscultation of heart sounds"</a>.)</p><p>Cardiac murmurs in infants and children are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/103723.html" rel="external">"Approach to the infant or child with a cardiac murmur"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/104883.html" rel="external">"Common causes of cardiac murmurs in infants and children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1084962072"><span class="h1">ORIGIN OF MURMURS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cardiac murmurs are the direct result of blood flow turbulence. The amount of turbulence and consequently the intensity of a cardiac murmur depend on the size of the orifice or vessel through which the blood flows; the pressure difference or gradient across the narrowing; and the blood flow or volume across the site [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>]. Murmurs are generally the loudest near the point of origin since sound radiates away from its source, and the intensity diminishes according to the inverse square law (inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source). Other factors influence this relationship including the transmission characteristics of the tissues (eg, fat and air), the distance from the location of auscultation to the origin of the murmur (eg, truncal obesity, emphysema), and the course of flow.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2088878673"><span class="h1">AUSCULTATORY TOOLS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Standard stethoscope (acoustic based)</strong> – The standard stethoscope includes both a shallow bell for low frequency and a thin, stiff diaphragm for high frequency sounds.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Electronic stethoscope (sensor based)</strong> – Auscultatory devices have been developed that utilize advanced acoustic sensor-based digital signal processing. The clinician has the choice of a bell, a diaphragm, and a wide range of frequencies for better body sound acquisition. It also allows the clinician to record the heart sounds directly onto a computer for further visualization and analysis.</p><p></p><p>There are no objective data to support the claim that the electronic stethoscope provides superior auscultatory skills over the conventional stethoscope. In a study from Norway, cardiac auscultation skills of undergraduate medical students were not impacted by being trained on either an electronic or a conventional stethoscope [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2380658103"><span class="h1">PERFORMANCE OF AUSCULTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The examination involves systematic listening to all components of the cardiac cycle in all auscultatory areas with both the bell and diaphragm. The timing of murmurs is best assessed by identifying S1 and S2, helped if needed by timing them with the carotid pulse. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1079.html" rel="external">"Auscultation of heart sounds"</a>.)</p><p>For example, in patients with marked tachycardia, a long diastolic murmur can occasionally be confused with a systolic murmur; timing with the carotid pulse upstroke avoids an incorrect diagnosis. When appropriate, patients should routinely be auscultated in the supine (including left lateral decubitus), sitting, and standing positions. It is helpful to routinely assess at least four surface anatomical areas with the stethoscope  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132689" href="/d/graphic/132689.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tricuspid area</strong> – The fourth and fifth intercostal spaces along the left sternal edge often extending to the right of the sternum as well as downward to the subxiphoid area.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pulmonary area</strong> – The second intercostal space along the left sternal border. Murmurs that are best heard in this area may also extend to the left infraclavicular area or lower along the left sternal edge to the third intercostal space.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mitral area</strong> – At the cardiac apex, which is generally at the fifth intercostal space in the midclavicular line. This area may also extend medially to the left sternal edge and also laterally to the region of the axilla.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Aortic area</strong> – Mainly centered at the second right intercostal space, but may extend to the suprasternal area, neck, and inferiorly to the third left intercostal space.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Areas remote from the heart</strong> – A systolic murmur can be audible over the anterior aspects of both lungs in patients with peripheral pulmonary stenosis. Systolic murmurs can also be appreciated over the back of the chest below or adjacent to left scapula in patients with severe mitral regurgitation. In addition, a continuous murmur can be audible in the apical region of lung on the side of created arteriovenous fistula in the arm.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">MURMUR DESCRIPTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The character of a murmur is described by several features, including intensity (grade), pitch (frequency), configuration, timing, quality, location, and radiation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Intensity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The intensity of a murmur is primarily determined by the quantity and velocity of blood flow at the site of its origin, the transmission characteristic of the tissues between the blood flow and stethoscope, the site of auscultation or recording, and the distance of transmission. In general, the intensity declines in the presence of obesity, emphysema, and pericardial effusion. Murmurs are usually louder in thin individuals. The gradation of intensity is purely subjective. However, it allows recognition of changes in the intensity of the murmur, which has diagnostic relevance.</p><p>Six grades are used to classify the intensity of a systolic murmur  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef105030" href="/d/graphic/105030.html" rel="external">table 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Grade I</strong> – Faintest murmur that can be heard.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Grade II</strong> – Soft murmur that is readily detectable.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Grade III</strong> – Louder than grade II but without a palpable precordial thrill.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Grade IV</strong> – Loud murmur associated with a palpable precordial thrill.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Grade V</strong> – Very loud murmur; audible with the stethoscope placed lightly on the chest; occurs with a palpable precordial thrill.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Grade VI</strong> – Loudest murmur; audible with the stethoscope off the chest; occurs with a palpable precordial thrill.</p><p></p><p>Four grades (I through IV) are commonly used for diastolic murmurs since louder diastolic murmurs are very rare.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Pitch</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The frequency of the murmur determines the pitch, which may be high or low. The quality can be described as harsh, rumbling, scratchy, grunting, blowing, squeaky, vibratory, and musical.

Parasternal murmurs are further characterized by the intercostal space and right or left side of the sternum [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. It is also helpful to assess the area over which the murmur is audible (radiation); for example, document if the murmur is audible in the axilla, suprasternal notch, or over inferior aspect of the left scapula.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Classification by timing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The duration of a murmur is assessed by determining the length of systole or diastole that the murmur occupies.

Acute severe MR usually causes a rapid increase in left atrial pressure leading to progressive equalization with left ventricular (LV) pressure. This hemodynamic alteration prevents regurgitant flow during the latter part of systole. Thus, the regurgitant murmur terminates before A2. Since the regurgitant flow is maximal at the beginning of systole and decreases with increasing left atrial pressure, a decrescendo configuration of this early systolic murmur is common [<a href="#rid11">11-13</a>]. Associated clinical findings include pulmonary hypertension, hyperdynamic apical impulse, a late systolic left parasternal impulse, and atrial and ventricular gallops. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8170.html" rel="external">"Acute mitral regurgitation in adults"</a>.)</p><p>In some patients with mitral stenosis, an early systolic murmur is heard and probably represents mild MR. Secondary MR in dilated cardiomyopathy is usually mild and may be early systolic in timing. Mitral annular calcification can be associated with an early systolic murmur and suggests trivial MR. Ineffective reduction of the circumference of the annulus at the beginning of systole, due to calcification, is probably the underlying mechanism for mild MR and the early systolic murmur [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2773428781"><span class="h3">Tricuspid regurgitation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Primary tricuspid regurgitation with normal right ventricular systolic pressure, as seen with infective endocarditis in individuals with substance use disorders, may be associated with an early systolic murmur with a decrescendo configuration. The mechanism is similar to that in acute severe MR. The frequency of these murmurs is usually lower than the murmurs associated with an elevated right ventricular systolic pressure, presumably due to a lower rate of regurgitation. In addition to a relatively normal S2, palpating and recording the left parasternal impulse may reveal a systolic inward movement and a diastolic outward movement, reflecting right ventricular volume changes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4254680945"><span class="h3">Ventricular septal defect</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In a large VSD with pulmonary hypertension, the murmur may be early systolic in timing, since the increasing right ventricular pressure during late systole decreases the left-to-right shunt. Findings of pulmonary hypertension are always present. An early systolic murmur may also occur in some patients with a VSD in the absence of pulmonary hypertension or increased pulmonary vascular resistance; these murmurs are more frequently localized and of shorter duration. They tend to occur with VSDs that later close spontaneously [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>Small muscular VSDs may also cause an early systolic murmur, since the defect closes soon after the onset of systole. Evidence of pulmonary hypertension is absent. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13602.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of ventricular septal defect in adults", section on 'Physical signs'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Midsystolic ejection murmurs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ejection or midsystolic murmur (MSM) is related to flow of blood across the semilunar valves; onset of the MSM coincides with the beginning of ejection and termination occurs with the cessation of forward flow. S1 occurs at the onset of isovolumic systole when ventricular pressure rises; ejection, and thus the MSM, begins at the end of isovolumic systole when the ventricular pressures exceed the semilunar valve opening pressure. The onset of an MSM is separated from S1, and the interval between S1 and the onset of the murmur is proportional to the duration of isovolumic systole  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61744" href="/d/graphic/61744.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The intensity of the MSM increases (crescendo) during acceleration of blood flow early in systole; intensity declines (decrescendo) with the later deceleration of flow, resulting in a crescendo-decrescendo (diamond-shaped) configuration. Forward flow from the ventricle stops when ventricular pressure falls below the aortic or pulmonary artery pressures, before the closure of the semilunar valves. The murmur terminates with cessation of flow, before A2 or P2, depending upon whether the murmur is left or right sided, respectively. The interval between the termination of the murmur and A2 or P2 is proportional to the aortic or pulmonic hangout time, respectively.</p><p>The most common causes of an MSM are benign (innocent) flow murmurs, an increase in flow rate across a normal semilunar valve, and aortic valve sclerosis. These physiologic murmurs need to be distinguished from the abnormal MSM in patients with fixed or dynamic outflow tract obstruction  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65728" href="/d/graphic/65728.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Innocent midsystolic murmurs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A systolic murmur is present in up to 60 percent of patients, with 90 percent being associated with a normal echocardiogram [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. These innocent or benign "flow" murmurs are typically ejection type and midsystolic in timing  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65728" href="/d/graphic/65728.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The "innocence" of an MSM should not depend upon the duration or intensity of the murmur, but on the absence of other abnormal findings. Even a short grade I/VI ejection MSM may not be innocent if there are coexisting findings such as an abnormal S2.</p><p>In young adults, an innocent MSM can be heard that has a blowing quality and is best heard over the pulmonary area. This murmur is thought to originate from vibrations of the pulmonary trunk.</p><p>In patients with the straight back syndrome who have a decreased anteroposterior diameter of the chest, a grade I to II (rarely grade III) MSM is heard over the left second interspace [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].

Low-intensity, high-pitched aortic regurgitation murmurs may not be heard unless firm pressure is applied with the diaphragm of the stethoscope over the left sternal border or over the right second interspace, while the patient sits and leans forward with the breath held in full expiration  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef77962" href="/d/graphic/77962.html" rel="external">movie 8</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef76340" href="/d/graphic/76340.html" rel="external">movie 9</a>).</p><p>The radiation of an aortic regurgitation murmur is toward the cardiac apex and the location of maximum intensity may vary considerably. It can be best heard in some patients over the mid precordium, along the lower left sternal border, or even over the cardiac apex  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef56371" href="/d/graphic/56371.html" rel="external">movie 10</a>). Radiation of the murmur to the right sternal border is more common in aortic regurgitation caused by aortic root or aortic cusp anomalies [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p>The configuration of the aortic regurgitation murmur is usually decrescendo because the magnitude of regurgitation progressively declines. The murmur is high-frequency and has a "blowing" character. Occasionally the murmur can be musical in quality (diastolic whoop); this has been attributed to a flail everted aortic cusp. The "whoop" can be mid-, late-, or pandiastolic [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p>The duration of the murmur is variable but usually terminates before S1. The duration of the murmur does not always correlate with the severity of aortic regurgitation, although mild aortic regurgitation is usually associated with a murmur of brief duration. The murmur may also be short with acute severe aortic regurgitation because of a rapid increase in LV diastolic pressure, which equalizes with aortic diastolic pressure soon after the onset of diastole. If the aortic pressure remains higher than LV pressure throughout diastole, a pandiastolic murmur may be present, even when the severity of aortic regurgitation is only moderate. Bedside evaluation of the severity of aortic regurgitation should be primarily based upon a determination of the hemodynamic consequences.

A decreased intensity of S2 does not necessarily suggest significant aortic regurgitation; however, reversed splitting of S2, which in the absence of left bundle branch block results from increased LV forward stroke volume, indirectly suggests significant aortic regurgitation. Changes in the intensity of S1 should be noted, since a reduced intensity is usually associated with an elevated LV end-diastolic pressure, which is more likely to occur in severe aortic regurgitation. Physical findings of pulmonary venous, arterial hypertension, and right-sided heart failure indicate hemodynamically significant aortic regurgitation.

The pulse pressure that was initially high may decrease, and the arterial diastolic pressure that was low may increase.

The murmur of pulmonic regurgitation associated with pulmonary hypertension is high-pitched and "blowing." It begins with an accentuated P2 of S2 and can be of variable duration. It may occupy all of diastole if there is a pandiastolic gradient between the pulmonary artery and the right ventricular diastolic pressure. The murmur has a decrescendo configuration like that of aortic regurgitation; differentiation is difficult if not impossible by auscultation alone. The murmur may increase in intensity during inspiration and can be more localized. It is best heard over the left second and third interspaces.</p><p>In contrast, the murmur of residual pulmonic regurgitation after Tetralogy of Fallot repair typically is low pitched and soft because pulmonary pressures are normal, so there is only a small diastolic pressure difference between the pulmonary artery and right ventricle.

In patients with sinus rhythm, there is frequently a presystolic accentuation of the diastolic murmur. The longer the duration of the murmur, the more severe is the mitral stenosis, provided the diastolic interval is not too short (absence of tachycardia).

This may occur in the setting of right-sided heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. Conversely, with enhanced flow across the valve, as in the high-output state of pregnancy, the intensity and duration of the murmur increase even with less severe stenosis. In these circumstances, one cannot rely on the duration of the murmur to assess the severity of mitral stenosis; other ancillary investigations, particularly echocardiographic studies, are necessary.

Middiastolic murmurs may occur in the presence of normal atrioventricular valves when the flow across the valve is markedly increased in middiastole (flow murmurs). In pure severe mitral regurgitation (MR), a larger volume of blood (due to the regurgitant volume) moves from the left atrium to the left ventricle during diastole; the etiology is a partial closing movement of the mitral valve, which occurs after it opens widely at the beginning of diastole. The rapid flow to the left ventricle continues, and thus "functional mitral stenosis" occurs, explaining the middiastolic rumble. In some patients, a middiastolic pressure gradient has been demonstrated [<a href="#rid34">34-36</a>].</p><p>With a left-to-right shunt across a ventricular septal defect or patent ductus arteriosus, antegrade blood flow across the mitral valve increases during diastole, which may be associated with a middiastolic murmur.

When the etiology is an atrial septal defect or anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, a tricuspid flow murmur can also be heard along the lower left sternal border; this is due to a partial closing movement of the tricuspid valve after its full opening in early diastole and functional tricuspid stenosis at middiastole [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].

A second proposed mechanism was premature partial closing movement of the mitral valve at middiastole due to the regurgitant flow, leading to functional mitral stenosis. However, use of M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography, color flow Doppler, and cine magnetic resonance imaging has shown that the murmur arises from the regurgitant jets that are directed at the LV free wall, thus excluding functional mitral stenosis as the etiology [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].</p><p>If the Austin Flint murmur is not recognized, a mistaken diagnosis of organic mitral stenosis can occur.
