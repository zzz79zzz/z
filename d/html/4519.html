Nevertheless, some will relapse because of residual leukemic cells that are below the limits of detection using conventional morphologic and cytogenetic assessment; such levels of residual leukemia are termed measurable residual disease (MRD; formerly called minimal residual disease). The presence of MRD is an important prognostic factor for survival in both children and adults with ALL and it may guide the use of targeted agents or immunotherapy to increase the proportion of MRD-negative responses and improve survival rates. </p><p>This topic reviews the clinical use of MRD in ALL. </p><p>Methods for detecting MRD in ALL are described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4499.html" rel="external">"Detection of measurable residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma"</a>.)</p><p>Detection and clinical use of MRD in acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia are covered separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4496.html" rel="external">"Overview of the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia", section on 'Monitoring response'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4525.html" rel="external">"Acute myeloid leukemia: Induction therapy in medically fit adults", section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4006374491"><span class="h1">GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>MRD is an important prognostic factor for outcomes in both children and adults with ALL and MRD testing is routinely incorporated into ALL management. </p><p>MRD testing is performed at various points during and after treatment in contemporary ALL protocols. Interpretation of test results involves both the level of MRD at specified time points and the trajectory/rate of decline of MRD levels. In some protocols, this is used to determine whether therapy intensity should be escalated or reduced for an individual patient. The method for detecting MRD in ALL varies according to immunophenotypic and molecular features of the leukemia and the timing for testing varies according to the treatment protocol. Methods for MRD detection in ALL are described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4499.html" rel="external">"Detection of measurable residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma"</a>.)</p><p>Bone marrow (BM) has long been considered standard for measuring MRD, but the level of MRD in peripheral blood (PB) is closely correlated with MRD in BM [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. If MRD, using next generation sequencing (NGS), is negative in both BM and PB, we consider that monitoring for relapse with blood alone is satisfactory. In other settings, we await additional studies before routinely substituting PB MRD for BM MRD. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6248.html" rel="external">"Prognostic factors and risk group stratification for acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p>A prospective study reported a strong correlation between MRD levels in PB and BM [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. MRD was measured by NGS in adults with ALL receiving allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapies. Among the 126 paired specimens, the correlation between PB and BM MRD was 0.87; compared with BM MRD, the sensitivity and specificity of PB MRD were 87 and 90 percent, respectively. PB MRD became detectable in the PB in 100 percent of patients who subsequently relapsed following HCT (median 90 days from MRD+ to clinical relapse) and in 85 percent of patients who relapsed following CAR-T cell therapy (median 60 days to clinical relapse). </p><p>Not all patients with detectable MRD will relapse clinically; in some cases, ALL cells persist after treatment but they do not progress to clinical disease. Conversely, some patients relapse despite MRD-negative results, perhaps because the recurrent disease manifests different immunophenotypic or molecular markers or because of clonal evolution. </p><p>A meta-analysis comprising 13,637 patients in 39 studies reported that for MRD-negativity, the hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival (OS) in pediatric patients was 0.28 (95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI] 0.19-0.41) and for adult patients was 0.28 (95% BCI, 0.20-0.39) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The corresponding HR for event-free survival (EFS) in pediatric patients was 0.23 (95% BCI 0.18-0.28) and 0.28 (95% BCI, 0.24-0.33) for adults. The favorable prognostic association was consistent across therapies, methods of and times of MRD assessment, threshold levels, and subsets of ALL [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">MRD IN CHILDREN</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Prognostic value</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Depending on the method used, up to 70 percent of children with ALL will have MRD detectable immediately following the completion of induction therapy [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>], with levels declining in most patients during the first six months of treatment [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Multiple studies have shown that patients with detectable MRD have significantly higher relapse rates [<a href="#rid5">5-14</a>]. The timing of MRD disappearance and reappearance appears to affect its prognostic value.</p><p>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques and multicolor flow cytometry are sufficiently sensitive, specific, and reproducible for MRD assessment in most patients. More robust techniques using multiplex PCR with deep sequencing and next-generation flow cytometry are under investigation. Multicolor flow cytometry is most commonly used in the United States. The ideal test is unknown and likely differs depending on the ALL subtype and the clinical scenario. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4499.html" rel="external">"Detection of measurable residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma"</a>.)</p><p>Published studies of MRD testing in children using PCR have had variable results, which may be ascribed to a number of factors:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>PCR testing at different times during the treatment cycle</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Differences in PCR methodologies, use of different cutoff values</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Differing sample sources (eg, fresh bone marrow versus archival material)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Considerable variation in treatment regimens</p><p></p><p>Large, prospective studies of MRD in pediatric ALL have conclusively demonstrated that the probability of long-term relapse-free survival (RFS) is directly related to the level of residual disease, both early in the course of treatment [<a href="#rid6">6,8,12,15-23</a>], and at later time points [<a href="#rid15">15,16,20,24</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h3">With conventional therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Large, independent prospective studies have conclusively demonstrated that children with detectable MRD have decreased disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) and that the level of detectable MRD correlates with relapse [<a href="#rid16">16,17,25-27</a>]. In addition to its potential to impact treatment decisions (discussed in more detail below), MRD analysis may allow for modifications in the treatment response assessment. As an example, the prognostic value of MRD status at the end of induction (using a cutoff threshold of 0.01 percent) provides independent and predictive information and thus allows for the elimination of day 14 bone marrow examinations in the vast majority of children with ALL.</p><p>The following studies illustrate the prognostic value of MRD measurements in children treated with conventional chemotherapy:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An initial study used flow cytometry of bone marrow samples to evaluate MRD in 158 children with ALL [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Samples were collected after induction therapy and during weeks 14, 32, and 56 of continuation therapy, and again at 120 weeks (end of therapy). Leukemia cells were detectable in 23, 17, 5, and 4 percent of patients after remission induction and at weeks 14, 32, and 56, respectively. None of the 65 samples examined at the completion of therapy (week 120) showed evidence of disease. At all time points, MRD detection was associated with a significantly higher rate of relapse.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Another study measured MRD by PCR on day 46 in 455 children with B cell lineage ALL treated with contemporary regimens [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. MRD was undetectable in 58 percent; &lt;0.001 percent in 11 percent; 0.001 to &lt;0.01 percent in 14 percent; and 0.01 percent or greater in 17 percent. The five-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was higher among those with MRD of 0.01 percent or greater versus MRD of &lt;0.01 percent or undetectable MRD (23 versus 6 percent). Furthermore, the five-year CIR was higher among those with MRD 0.001 to &lt;0.01 percent versus MRD &lt;0.001 percent or undetectable (13 versus 5 percent). These results suggest a prognostic impact for MRD detected below the conventional threshold of 0.01 percent.  </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a large collaborative European study (AIEOP-BFM 2000 study), 3184 children with Philadelphia chromosome negative B cell lineage ALL were risk stratified by MRD status (PCR sensitivity ≤0.01 percent) at day 33 (end of induction) and day 78 (start of consolidation with significantly different event-free survival [EFS] and OS at five years) [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Standard risk (42 percent): Those with MRD ≤0.01 percent at both time points had EFS and OS of 92 and 98 percent, respectively.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Intermediate risk (52 percent): Those with MRD &gt;0.01 percent at either time point (and &lt;0.1 percent on day 78) had EFS and OS of 78 and 93 percent, respectively.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>High risk (6 percent): Those with MRD ≥0.1 percent on day 78 had EFS and OS of 50 and 60 percent, respectively.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In an analysis of 7430 children enrolled on Children's Oncology Group (COG) studies, evaluation of MRD by flow cytometry on day 29 was highly predictive of patient outcomes [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Estimated DFS at five years was significantly higher among patients who were MRD negative (89 versus 72 percent, respectively). Among patients who were MRD negative, five-year DFS was similar regardless of whether they had morphologic evidence of disease on a day 14 bone marrow (89 versus 91 percent). Similarly, patients who had no morphologic evidence of disease on day 14, but were MRD positive on day 29, had similar five-year DFS as those who had detectable disease at either time (77 versus 72 percent). These results suggest that MRD status using a threshold of 0.01 percent at the end of induction obviates the need for analysis at day 14.   </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In another study, MRD remained detectable in the bone marrow by flow cytometry in nearly half of children on day 19 of induction therapy and was associated with a higher chance of relapse (five-year CIR 33 versus 6 percent) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. These results suggest that MRD status has prognostic value even when measured before the end of induction therapy. </p><p></p><p>These and other studies have demonstrated that either semi-quantitative PCR or flow cytometry may be used to assess MRD in childhood ALL. However, these data were derived from prospective clinical trials where special expertise was available in central research laboratories, and individual patients submitted both pretreatment and post-treatment samples. A broader discussion comparing PCR and flow cytometry for MRD detection is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4499.html" rel="external">"Detection of measurable residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">In the setting of transplantation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>MRD studies have demonstrated prognostic value when measured before and after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).</p><p>Patients with MRD <strong>prior to</strong> allogeneic HCT are more likely to relapse than those without detectable MRD [<a href="#rid30">30-32</a>]: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A study of 64 children and adolescents with ALL in morphologic remission reported two-year EFS rates of 17 and 73 percent for those with and without MRD prior to allogeneic HCT, respectively [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. While prognostic, some patients with MRD prior to HCT will have long-term DFS and some patients without detectable MRD prior to HCT may ultimately relapse. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A study of children undergoing allogeneic HCT for ALL (64 patients) or acute myeloid leukemia (58 patients) confirmed that MRD status prior to HCT is associated with RFS and OS after HCT [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Five-year survival rates increased as pre-HCT MRD levels decreased being 29, 52, and 68 percent for patients with high, low, and no MRD. These results suggest that more than half of patients with low levels of MRD prior to HCT will have long-term survival after the procedure and that detection of MRD alone should not eliminate HCT as a treatment option.</p><p></p><p>Several studies have also demonstrated an increased rate of relapse among those found to be MRD positive <strong>after</strong> allogeneic HCT [<a href="#rid33">33-37</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the prospective ALL-BFM-SCT 2003 trial, 113 children with relapsed ALL had MRD testing of the bone marrow by quantitative real-time PCR prior to and on days +30, +60, +90, +180, and +365 post-HCT [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Among those with MRD ≥10<sup>-4</sup> leukemic cells at one of these time points, the estimated cumulative incidence of relapse at three years was 38, 50, 75, 100, 100, and 100 percent, respectively. In contrast, approximately one-quarter of consistently MRD-negative patients relapsed within three years. These results suggest that MRD positivity at day +60 or beyond is highly predictive of subsequent relapse.  </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A study of 71 children reported that those who exhibited MRD during the first three months following allogeneic HCT had a ninefold higher relapse rate when compared with MRD-negative patients [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Only 1 of 35 patients in complete remission had MRD detectable more than six months following transplant.</p><p></p><p>It is not yet known how best to use MRD status to facilitate treatment decisions in patients who have undergone or are about to undergo allogeneic HCT for ALL. Potential uses include using these levels to determine the best timing of HCT, to modulate immunosuppressive therapy after HCT, or guide the use of donor lymphocyte infusions after HCT. (See <a class="local">'Using MRD to escalate therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1499930434"><span class="h3">At relapse</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among children with relapsed ALL who achieve a complete remission, MRD assessment may predict the risk of a second relapse: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a study of 35 children who experienced a second morphologic complete remission after reinduction therapy for relapsed disease, MRD ≥0.01 percent by flow cytometry was associated with an increased risk of relapse (two-year CIR 70 versus 28 percent) [<a href="#rid38">38</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In another study of 60 children with high-risk ALL who relapsed within 30 months of initial diagnosis, MRD status measured three to five weeks after starting reinduction therapy was highly predictive of EFS [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. The estimated EFS rate at three years was 73, 45, and 19 percent among those with no MRD, MRD &lt;0.01 percent, and MRD ≥0.01 percent, respectively.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Using MRD to escalate therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with detectable MRD have an increased risk of relapse after conventional therapy. The absolute risk varies depending on a number of factors including the timing of MRD evaluation, the sensitivity of the method used to evaluate MRD, and baseline characteristics of the patient and tumor. Given this increased rate of relapse, prospective trials have attempted to decrease this risk by escalating therapy in those demonstrating MRD [<a href="#rid40">40-42</a>].</p><p>In the UKALL 2003 trial, 533 patients clinically identified as having standard-risk or intermediate-risk ALL at diagnosis and who had MRD in the bone marrow at the end of induction therapy were randomly assigned to receive standard or augmented post-remission therapy [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. The augmented therapy included additional doses of pegylated asparaginase, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10045" href="/d/drug information/10045.html" rel="external">vincristine</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a>. Augmented therapy was associated with more adverse events including hypersensitivity, pancreatitis, and mucositis/stomatitis. After a median follow-up of 70 months, augmented therapy resulted in superior EFS at five years (90 versus 83 percent) and a trend toward improved survival at five years (93 versus 89 percent). These results suggest that escalating care in patients with MRD at the end of induction therapy improves clinical outcome.</p><p>In another prospective trial of 208 children with intermediate-risk ALL as determined by bone marrow morphology at diagnosis, consolidation therapy was assigned based on MRD status after induction [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. Those with an MRD level &lt;10<sup>-3</sup> were assigned to receive conventional consolidation and maintenance therapy. In contrast, for patients with MRD ≥10<sup>-3</sup>, related or unrelated HLA-matched allogeneic HCT was recommended as consolidation. In this group, 83 percent had appropriate donors and underwent HCT, while 17 percent received chemotherapy without HCT because no donor was available. EFS was higher for patients receiving HCT versus those receiving chemotherapy alone (64 versus 24 percent). These results suggest that consolidation with allogeneic HCT may mitigate some of the risk associated with MRD. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Using MRD to minimize therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As long-term survival in childhood ALL improves, more children experience late adverse effects including central nervous system impairment, decreased linear growth, cardiotoxicity, infertility, and an increased incidence of secondary cancers. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6247.html" rel="external">"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma: Outcomes and late effects of treatment in children and adolescents", section on 'Late effects'</a>.)</p><p>Given these late effects, researchers have tried to identify a group of ALL patients that may be treated with less intensive therapy without compromising survival. Ongoing trials are evaluating whether patients who demonstrate a rapid clearance of tumor cells during induction therapy resulting in no detectable MRD may be candidates for less intensive consolidation [<a href="#rid42">42,43</a>]. At this point it is unknown whether the good outcomes seen in this patient group are dependent on the use of standard induction, consolidation, and maintenance, or if they may be curable with less intensive therapy.</p><p>As an example, a multicenter randomized trial of over 3000 consecutive children and young adults (≤25 years) with newly diagnosed ALL examined the use of MRD measurements obtained after induction and consolidation therapy to minimize maintenance therapy [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. Clinical criteria were initially used to classify the disease as standard-, intermediate-, or high-risk, then MRD measurements following induction and before interim maintenance were used to further revise this classification. Patients with standard or intermediate clinical risk who achieved MRD negativity were randomly assigned to receive one or two delayed intensification treatments. When compared with those assigned to the standard two delayed intensification treatments, those assigned to a single intensification had a similar estimated EFS (94.4 versus 95.5 percent), OS (97.9 versus 98.5 percent), and rate of relapse (4.2 versus 2.3 percent) at five years.
