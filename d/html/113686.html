The diagnosis of CS is challenging and is frequently missed or delayed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4922.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis"</a>.)</p><p>Patients who have CS are at risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including death and ventricular tachycardia. However, data regarding how various therapies might mitigate this increased risk are limited.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of clinical and imaging variables used to determine the prognosis of patients with definite or probable CS and a discussion of management of CS. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of CS are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4922.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H935320055"><span class="h1">APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The management of CS often requires multidisciplinary care teams, especially when other organ involvement is present or when additional expertise regarding the use of potent antiinflammatory therapies (eg, biologic therapy) is required. In such cases, cardiologists (especially electrophysiologists and HF specialists), rheumatologists, imaging experts, and other specialists often work together to provide optimal patient management.</p><p>There are several challenges related to the management of patients with CS. First, data regarding the benefit of treatment are limited to small observational studies. Second, most of the treatments that are used (eg, immunosuppressive therapies and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators [ICDs]) have a high likelihood of adverse effects. Third, many patients may have probable (but not definitive) CS, and thus clinicians often have to decide whether or not to use various therapies in cases with an uncertain diagnosis.</p><p>The first step in managing patients with suspected CS is determining the probability of CS, as described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4922.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis"</a>.)</p><p>The main goals of patient management include preventing disease progression, avoiding the development of worsening of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, managing atrioventricular (AV) block, and managing arrhythmias and risk of sudden death. The following approach applies to patients with definite or probable CS (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115935" href="/d/graphic/115935.html" rel="external">table 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Monitoring</strong> – Patients should receive periodic clinical evaluation including echocardiography to identify changes in symptoms and cardiac function as well as to assess adverse effects of therapy (such as immunosuppression, pacemaker, and ICD). At least yearly evaluation is suggested for asymptomatic patients with CS, with more frequent evaluation in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy or with HF. Advanced imaging (cardiovascular magnetic resonance [CMR] and/or F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography [FDG-PET] imaging) should be performed when clinical evaluation (ie, symptoms, arrhythmia, brain natriuretic peptide or troponin rise, decrease in ventricular function) suggests disease activity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management of cardiovascular risk factors</strong> – Patients with CS may have an increased risk of coronary artery disease, and treatment of underlying cardiovascular risk factors, including use of statin therapy as indicated, is recommended [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1546.html" rel="external">"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention in adults: Our approach"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4549.html" rel="external">"Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering therapy in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/112841.html" rel="external">"Management of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Heart failure therapies</strong> – Patients with HF (HF with reduced ejection fraction, HF with preserved ejection fraction, or HF with mid-range ejection fraction) should receive standard therapy for these conditions, as discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3461.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prognosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/121085.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/117708.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prognosis of heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Despite case reports of reactivation of sarcoidosis following orthotopic heart transplantation, the presence of cardiac or systemic sarcoidosis should not preclude cardiac transplantation if otherwise indicated. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3528.html" rel="external">"Heart transplantation in adults: Indications and contraindications", section on 'Considerations for hypertrophic or restrictive cardiomyopathy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treatment of asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction</strong> – Patients with LV ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤40 percent who do not have HF should receive standard treatment for asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction, as discussed separately.

Immunosuppressive therapy may also decrease the burden of ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias and of HF symptoms, though data on effect on quality of life are lacking.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1587809124"><span class="h2">Indications for immunosuppression</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Expert consensus is that immunosuppressive therapy is recommended for selected patients with CS [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. However, experts use differing criteria for identifying patients with CS who are candidates for immunosuppressive therapy; the recommendations below differ from those in the 2014 Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) consensus statement [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>The following recommendations apply to patients with <strong>definite or probable CS</strong>:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients who have clinical manifestations of cardiac involvement (heart failure, LV systolic dysfunction, heart block, or ventricular arrhythmias) and definitive evidence of active myocardial inflammation (by FDG-PET or myocardial histology), we suggest immunosuppressive therapy. The goal of therapy is to reduce onset or progression of LV dysfunction or HF.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The above recommendation includes patients with evidence of focal inflammation involving the right ventricle (RV) detected by FDG-PET. As noted below, patients with RV involvement have a worse prognosis and are more likely to benefit from aggressive therapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For asymptomatic patients with normal LVEF and RV ejection fraction (RVEF), we suggest an individualized assessment of the potential risks and benefits of treatment. Such assessment may include evaluation of the burden of inflammation in the heart, as well as the burden of inflammation that may be present in other organs, as determined by a limited whole-body FDG-PET study. Patients with CS who are asymptomatic and have a preserved LVEF have a low event rate; data are lacking on immunosuppressive therapy in this population. Thus, this recommendation is based upon indirect observational evidence on immunosuppressive therapy in patients with CS and depressed LVEF.</p><p></p><p>The role of glucocorticoids in treating extracardiac disease is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4359.html" rel="external">"Treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis: Initial approach"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4834.html" rel="external">"Neurologic sarcoidosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7186.html" rel="external">"Kidney disease in sarcoidosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/841.html" rel="external">"Hypercalcemia in granulomatous diseases"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3607288026"><span class="h2">Identification of inflammation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Evidence of inflammation should generally be evaluated by the use of cardiac imaging tests or myocardial histology, as blood markers of inflammation convey the presence of systemic inflammation and are not specific to the heart.</p><p>The most robust data on the presence and severity of myocardial inflammation are provided by cardiac FDG-PET; it is recommended that this test be performed whenever immunosuppressive therapies are considered in order to determine the amount and severity of myocardial inflammation and obtain a baseline measure of disease activity for the purpose of future comparison. However, FDG uptake by the heart is not specific to CS and has been described in other conditions. The presence of a resting perfusion defect on single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or FDG-PET imaging can be used to increase diagnostic certainty, as described separately. Cardiac FDG-PET is not a test that is routinely available at most centers and often requires referral to a center that has PET availability, as well as expertise in the acquisition and interpretation of this examination. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4922.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis", section on 'FDG-PET'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4922.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis", section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Alternatively, CMR imaging may identify the presence of edema via T2-weighted imaging or T2 mapping techniques [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. However, while identification of increased T2 signal by CMR may have an adequate positive predictive value, the negative predictive value is low, and thus the absence of edema on CMR cannot be used to rule out myocardial inflammation or to determine that immunosuppressive therapy is not required. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4922.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis", section on 'Cardiovascular magnetic resonance'</a> and <a class="local">'CMR studies'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1133215589"><span class="h2">Agents</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Immunosuppressive regimens for treatment of CS are not well established. Further study is needed to better define the role of immunosuppressive therapies, including the ideal regimen, dose, and duration of therapy, as well as whether glucocorticoid-sparing agents can be used as first-line therapy, thus avoiding glucocorticoids. However, given that CS remains relatively infrequent, and since there is a wide variability in severity of disease and clinical symptoms upon presentation, such studies are difficult to conduct and require multicenter collaborations.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3268181576"><span class="h3">Glucocorticoid</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3495051931"><span class="h4">Use</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Glucocorticoid therapy is the most commonly used immunosuppressive agent in this setting, but there is lack of consensus on glucocorticoid dosing, duration of therapy, or when to use additional immunosuppressive agents in CS [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The optimal dose of glucocorticoid therapy for CS is not known, and choosing a dose requires balancing the risk of side effects with the likelihood of response [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. It is unknown whether glucocorticoid dose should be adjusted for body surface area or whether the effective dose varies among patient populations.</p><p>For a patient with CS with an indication for immunosuppressive therapy, we suggest generally starting with a dose of 30 to 60 mg/day of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> and gradually reducing this dose to a maintenance level of 10 to 15 mg/day over one year. Doses of 40 to 60 mg of prednisone daily are generally used initially to treat CS and may be combined with a steroid sparing agent, although an observational study from Japan found that there was no difference in outcome between patients treated with an initial high dose (&gt;40 mg/day of prednisone) compared with those treated with a low dose (&lt;30 mg/day) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>Patients who have complete resolution of inflammation are at risk for recurrence of disease activity. Therefore, we suggest continuing low-dose glucocorticoid therapy (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> 5 mg) for at least one year, especially if low-dose glucocorticoid therapy is well tolerated. Thus, glucocorticoid treatment should be continued for at least one to two years. In patients with significant inflammation, FDG-PET imaging at approximately six months of therapy may be reasonable to assess treatment response. If serial evaluations reveal that the disease is stable or dormant, glucocorticoids may be tapered and eventually discontinued. However, vigilance must continue for the rest of the patient's life, as relapses are common after tapering of glucocorticoid therapy. Any evidence of recurrence may be handled by reinstituting or increasing prednisone to 40 to 60 mg/day.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1134986797"><span class="h4">Outcomes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are no data from randomized trials regarding the efficacy of glucocorticoid therapy, and observational studies have generally lacked adjustment for potential prognostic differences in treated and untreated patients. With this caveat, retrospective studies suggest that glucocorticoid therapy can improve AV block. In addition, there are limited data suggesting that glucocorticoid therapy may prevent LV dysfunction, particularly if treatment is initiated before the onset of moderate or severe systolic dysfunction. A means to predict who may or may not be glucocorticoid-responsive remains unknown. The effect of glucocorticoid therapy on ventricular arrhythmias is even less certain [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>].</p><p>A systematic review of 10 studies included 257 patients treated with glucocorticoids and 42 patients not treated [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Among 57 patients with AV conduction disease treated with glucocorticoids, 47 percent had improvement in AV conduction. By contrast, 0 out of 16 patients not treated with glucocorticoids improved. Data quality was deemed too limited to draw any conclusions on the impact of glucocorticoids on mortality, LV dysfunction, or ventricular arrhythmias [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>The following observational studies illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a 1994 retrospective survey- and literature-based study of 104 cases of CS not included in the above systematic review, survival was better with glucocorticoids than with usual care (64 versus 40 percent), but the data were not adjusted for differences in baseline characteristics of treated and untreated groups [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In an observational study included in the above systematic review, 43 patients with CS were evaluated by echocardiography before and after glucocorticoid therapy [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Patients who had an initial LVEF ≥55 percent were found to have preservation of LVEF and volumes, while patients who had an LVEF between 30 and 55 percent had a decrease in LV volumes and an improvement in LVEF. However, patients who had an LVEF &lt;30 percent had no such improvement. These findings, while retrospective, support the role of glucocorticoids in preventing LV remodeling and dysfunction and also support the concept that glucocorticoids may not be as effective in later stages.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4089712361"><span class="h3">Second-line treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Due to the side effect profile of glucocorticoids, the use of glucocorticoid-sparing agents is becoming increasingly common, either as an add-on to glucocorticoids or instead of glucocorticoids. The addition of a glucocorticoid-sparing agent to glucocorticoid therapy is often helpful to minimize glucocorticoid-related toxicities [<a href="#rid5">5,13,14</a>]. Limited data, and our clinical experience, support selective use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a> as an add-on agent to glucocorticoid therapy, enabling tapering of glucocorticoid to low doses or off [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. An observational study of patients treated with glucocorticoid plus methotrexate and/or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8583" href="/d/drug information/8583.html" rel="external">adalimumab</a> is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Third-line treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H729353036"><span class="h3">Third-line treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients who do not respond to therapy with glucocorticoid and/or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a> or who cannot tolerate the side effects of such therapy, options include <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9026" href="/d/drug information/9026.html" rel="external">azathioprine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10097" href="/d/drug information/10097.html" rel="external">leflunomide</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9670" href="/d/drug information/9670.html" rel="external">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, or a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8984" href="/d/drug information/8984.html" rel="external">infliximab</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8583" href="/d/drug information/8583.html" rel="external">adalimumab</a>). Data regarding these agents remain limited, but suggest effectiveness in selected cases. Their use depends on clinical features including the severity of the disease and the experience of the clinician.
