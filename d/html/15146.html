The diaphragm is usually injured in association with other thoracic and abdominal organs. Although diaphragmatic injury can be obvious (eg, herniation of abdominal contents on chest radiograph), the injury may be subtle, and imaging studies can be nondiagnostic. A high index of suspicion needs to be maintained because delayed diagnosis is associated with an increased risk for herniation and strangulation of abdominal organs, which can be life-threatening. For patients in whom the diagnosis is uncertain, diagnostic laparoscopy, thoracoscopy, or open surgical exploration may be needed to establish the diagnosis. When identified, diaphragm injury is repaired with open surgical or minimally invasive techniques, the choice and timing of which depends upon the presence of associated injuries and the overall condition of the patient.</p><p>This topic will discuss the recognition and surgical management of blunt and penetrating injury to the diaphragm. Injuries to associated thoracic and abdominal organs are discussed in separate topic reviews. The general approach to blunt and penetrating chest and abdominal trauma is also discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/353.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13862.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of penetrating thoracic trauma in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/348.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of blunt abdominal trauma in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H43817542"><span class="h1">ANATOMY OF THE DIAPHRAGM</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diaphragm (dia: across, phragm: fence) is the musculotendinous boundary between the negative-pressure thoracic cavity and positive-pressure abdominal cavity. The diaphragm plays a significant role in respiratory mechanics, and injury to the diaphragm impairs ventilation and oxygen delivery. The normal mechanics of respiration are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4320.html" rel="external">"Chest wall diseases and restrictive physiology", section on 'Normal structure and function'</a>.)</p><p>The diaphragm is dome-shaped and attaches to the chest and abdominal walls circumferentially  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64543" href="/z/d/graphic/64543.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The liver, spleen, transverse colon, stomach, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys contact the undersurface of the diaphragm. Thoracoabdominal structures, including the aorta, inferior vena cava, thoracic duct, esophagus, vagus nerves, and phrenic nerves, traverse the diaphragm through three major apertures (ie, aortic, caval, esophageal)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77888" href="/z/d/graphic/77888.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). </p><p>The diaphragm is composed of two muscle groups, costal and crural, which are compositionally and functionally distinct. Both groups are innervated by the phrenic nerves  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52752" href="/z/d/graphic/52752.html" rel="external">figure 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52959" href="/z/d/graphic/52959.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). The costal muscle group that forms the diaphragmatic leaflets is thin, and contraction of its fibers flattens the diaphragm and lowers the ribs. The crural muscle groups are thicker but contribute minimally to the displacement of the diaphragm. The median arcuate ligament anterior to the aortic hiatus is formed by the continuation of the medial tendinous margins of the crura. </p><p>The costal and crural fibers insert into the central tendon  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64543" href="/z/d/graphic/64543.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The anterior portion of the tendon attaches to the posterior aspect of the xiphisternal junction. The posterior portion of the central tendon attaches to the first three lumbar vertebral bodies (L1-L3). Lateral insertions of the central tendon occur on the 6<sup>th</sup> rib anteriorly and the 12<sup>th</sup> rib posteriorly. </p><p>The vascular supply of the diaphragm is derived from the phrenic artery below the diaphragm and the pericardiophrenic arteries above the diaphragm  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77888" href="/z/d/graphic/77888.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). The phrenic nerve originates from the anterior rami of C3, C4, and C5 and traverses the neck and mediastinum before inserting into the diaphragm centrally  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52752" href="/z/d/graphic/52752.html" rel="external">figure 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52959" href="/z/d/graphic/52959.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). The outer rim of the diaphragmatic muscle is innervated laterally from the T7 through T12  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64543" href="/z/d/graphic/64543.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The crural group of muscles receives innervation from the vagus nerve [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H98788934"><span class="h2">Diaphragmatic injury severity scale</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Diaphragm injuries are classified according to the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) organ injury scale. Increased morbidity and mortality has been correlated with increasing injury grade for some injuries (eg, liver, spleen, kidney) but, to date, not for diaphragmatic injuries. The diaphragmatic injury severity scale is as follows: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grade I: Contusion</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grade II: Laceration ≤2 cm</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grade III: Laceration 2 to 10 cm</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grade IV: Laceration &gt;10 cm; tissue loss ≤25 cm<sup>2</sup></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grade V: Laceration and tissue loss &gt;25 cm<sup>2</sup></p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H38055088"><span class="h1">TRAUMA EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial resuscitation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of the patient with blunt or penetrating injury are based upon protocols from the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) program, established by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma. The initial resuscitation and evaluation of the patient with blunt or penetrating abdominal or thoracic trauma is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/348.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of blunt abdominal trauma in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/353.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/356.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of abdominal stab wounds in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/352.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of abdominal gunshot wounds in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13861.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of chest wall trauma in adults"</a>.)</p><p>In the setting of acute trauma, many patients cannot relate their symptoms or medical history due to altered mental status (eg, neurologic injury, intoxication) or because they are intubated and sedated. Every attempt should be made to identify preexisting medical conditions by contacting the patient's primary care physician or family members. The presence of significant medical comorbidities and medical conditions requiring antiplatelet or anticoagulation should be determined, as these may impact management decisions. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H38056485"><span class="h1">RECOGNITION OF DIAPHRAGMATIC INJURY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Studies using the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB), the largest trauma registry in the world, have found an overall incidence of diaphragm injury of 0.46 percent [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. A suspicion for diaphragmatic injury begins with the identification of the injury mechanism, physical examination of the patient, and assessment of associated injuries. Certain injury patterns increase the risk for diaphragmatic injury. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H38057037"><span class="h2">Injury mechanism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diaphragm can be injured directly, due to an impalement or missile passing through it from the abdominal cavity to the thoracic cavity or vice versa, or indirectly from blunt rupture, which is caused by a sudden increase in intra-abdominal pressure that is sufficient to overcome the strength of the diaphragmatic tissue. Blunt diaphragm rupture usually causes large radial tears of the diaphragm, while penetrating injury leads to smaller rents that approximate the size of the penetrating impalement. As such, penetrating injuries are more likely to be missed. In a review of the National Trauma Data Bank, among those with diaphragmatic injury, 33 percent had a blunt mechanism and 67 percent had a penetrating mechanism [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Compared with penetrating diaphragmatic injuries, patients with blunt injury were significantly older (44 versus 31 years) and had a higher injury severity score (33 versus 24). (See <a class="local">'Delayed presentation'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H38056649"><span class="h3">Penetrating injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Penetrating mechanisms to the thoracoabdominal region, such as stabs, gunshot, shotgun, and impalements, account for approximately 65 percent of all diaphragmatic injuries [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The diaphragm can rise as high as the fourth thoracic (T4) dermatome on the right and the fifth dermatome (T5)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53938" href="/z/d/graphic/53938.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>) on the left with expiration, and it descends to as low as the eighth thoracic dermatome (T8) with deep inspiration. The lowest level of the lateral diaphragm attachment is the base of the 12<sup>th</sup> rib. Thus, any impalement or missile that passes through the chest or abdominal wall from T4 through T12 has the potential to injure the diaphragm. Penetrating injury due to stabbing is more common on the left compared with the right, presumably because the majority of assailants are right-handed, assuming a frontal assault. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H38056656"><span class="h3">Blunt diaphragmatic rupture</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Blunt mechanisms account for the remaining 35 percent of diaphragmatic injuries and occur in 0.8 to 1.6 percent of patients sustaining blunt trauma. Motor vehicle collisions are responsible for up to 90 percent of blunt diaphragm rupture, with the remainder due to falls or crush injury, both of which can sufficiently elevate intra-abdominal pressure to rupture the diaphragm [<a href="#rid2">2,5,6</a>]. </p><p>When the diaphragm contracts, the relaxed dome-shaped diaphragm flattens, which increases the volume of the thoracic cavity, decreases the volume of the abdominal cavity, and changes intrapleural and intra-abdominal pressure. During normal quiet breathing, intraperitoneal pressure ranges from +2 to +10 cm water (H<sub>2</sub>O), and intrapleural pressure is from -5 to -10 cm water, which results in a pleuroperitoneal gradient of +7 to +20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O in the supine position. With maximal inspiration, the diaphragm is forced downward and the pleuroperitoneal pressure gradient can rise as high as +100 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. Changes in the compliance of the abdominal or chest wall alter normal mechanics. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4320.html" rel="external">"Chest wall diseases and restrictive physiology", section on 'Normal structure and function'</a>.)</p><p>The application of blunt force to the abdomen or chest can result in pleuroperitoneal gradients of +150 to 200 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, which exceeds the strength of the muscle or tendinous tissues and can rupture or avulse the diaphragm from its attachments. (See <a class="local">'Anatomy of the diaphragm'</a> above.)</p><p>The left diaphragmatic leaflet is two to three times more likely than the right leaflet to be injured with blunt trauma [<a href="#rid7">7-9</a>]. Bilateral blunt rupture of the diaphragm occurs in 2 to 6 percent of patients [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. In one retrospective study of 731 patients with traumatic diaphragm rupture, the left posterolateral region medial to the spleen was the most common site of injury [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. This is felt to be due to a congenital weakness of this region. Another explanation may be that the liver protects the right diaphragm by attenuating or preventing the transmission of force across the diaphragm. However, a tendency toward more right-sided diaphragmatic injuries is observed as collision speed increases [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H38057331"><span class="h2">Associated injuries</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>At least 50 percent of patients with diaphragmatic injury also suffer associated injuries [<a href="#rid9">9,12</a>]. </p><p>For penetrating trauma, the passage of an impalement or missile through the abdominal or chest walls rarely injures the diaphragm in isolation [<a href="#rid2">2,9</a>]. In one study, 75 percent of patients with penetrating diaphragmatic injury had an associated organ injury [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. In another study, an average of two organ injuries were present in patients who suffered stab wounds and three organ injuries in those patients sustaining gunshot wounds [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. In a study from the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB), penetrating diaphragmatic injury was associated with liver and hollow viscus injuries [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Compared with penetrating injury, patients with blunt injuries had more injuries to the thoracic aorta (2.9 versus 0.5 percent), lung (48.7 versus 28.1 percent), bladder (5.9 versus 0.7 percent), and spleen (44.8 versus 29.1 percent). </p><p>The percentage of patients with a given injury who also have a traumatic diaphragmatic rupture are: liver (48 percent), hemothorax and/or pneumothorax (47 percent), spleen (35 percent), rib fracture (28 percent), bowel (23 percent), kidney (16 percent), pelvic fracture (14 percent), closed head injury (11 percent), thoracic aorta (4 percent), and spinal cord injury (4 percent) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H38057468"><span class="h2">Clinical evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The patient's abdomen and chest should be examined for the presence of contusions or ecchymoses that might suggest that significant blunt forces have been sustained. Although diaphragmatic excursion depends upon variables such as body build, body posture, and lung volume, any bullet or stab wound between the level of the T4 and T12 dermatomes  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53938" href="/z/d/graphic/53938.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>) has the potential to cause diaphragmatic injury, particularly if penetrating wounds are found on both sides of the diaphragm. Penetrating wounds in the posterior or flank region of the trunk can also lead to diaphragmatic injury. (See <a class="local">'Anatomy of the diaphragm'</a> above.)</p><p>The presence of a rent in the diaphragm can lead to acute herniation of abdominal contents into the chest  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87089" href="/z/d/graphic/87089.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). The finding of diminished breath sounds may indicate collapse of the lung due to herniation. If the stomach has herniated, air injected into the nasogastric tube may be heard in the chest upon auscultation, although this finding is nonspecific. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15070.html" rel="external">"Inpatient placement and management of nasogastric and nasoenteric tubes in adults", section on 'Confirmation of placement'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H38057599"><span class="h3">Delayed presentation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The trauma patient may initially have no symptoms or signs to suggest an injury to the diaphragm, or associated injuries may be sufficiently severe that definitive evaluation for diaphragmatic injury is delayed. With time, the diaphragmatic defect due to injury has a tendency to become larger, and herniation of abdominal organs becomes more likely, particularly if left sided. In one small series of delayed diagnosis of traumatic diaphragm rupture, 3 of 16 patients (19 percent) had their injuries missed at initial laparotomy [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The majority of these injuries (15 out of 16) were on the left [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Small right-sided injuries may remain stable because the liver tamponades the defect preventing bowel herniation. </p><p>Patients with previous thoracoabdominal trauma who present with abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting should be evaluated for a possible missed diaphragmatic injury as a cause of gastrointestinal obstruction due to herniation  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87312" href="/z/d/graphic/87312.html" rel="external">image 2</a>). Failure to diagnose and repair the diaphragm can lead to intestinal strangulation and, potentially, death. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H38055634"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The mechanism of injury and physical exam findings may suggest the need for additional evaluation beyond initial imaging studies that are typically obtained during trauma evaluation. Specifically, trauma mechanisms that confer large amounts of force to the anterior abdomen in association with the auscultation of bowel sounds or nasogastric suction over the left thorax should prompt immediate inclusion of traumatic diaphragmatic injury among the possible injuries impacting the patient. </p><p>While a diagnosis of diaphragmatic injury is often coincidentally made while using computed tomography (CT) to rule out significant life-threatening injuries (eg, traumatic aortic rupture or visceral injuries)  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef91880" href="/z/d/graphic/91880.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>], small tears may not be seen even with sophisticated imaging techniques. Advanced imaging techniques appear promising. Nevertheless, when there is a high index of suspicion for diaphragmatic injury, but initial trauma imaging is inconclusive, we agree with guidelines from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) that recommend diagnostic laparoscopy (or thoracoscopy) for detection of diaphragmatic injury in most trauma patients [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Both diaphragmatic leaflets are typically easily seen with laparoscopy, and the overall risk of the procedure is low. Thoracoscopy may be more appropriate for posterior right-sided diaphragmatic injuries. For patients with difficult laparoscopic access due to multiple previous laparotomies, advanced imaging techniques can be used to further evaluate the diaphragm. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1146170525"><span class="h2">Findings suggestive of diaphragm injury on initial imaging</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H38055650"><span class="h3">Ultrasound</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) examination is an important component of trauma management that is used primarily to detect free intraperitoneal blood following trauma, particularly in patients who are hemodynamically unstable. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/348.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of blunt abdominal trauma in adults", section on 'Ultrasound'</a>.) </p><p>Ultrasound techniques can also be used to evaluate the diaphragm, but the use of ultrasound to identify traumatic diaphragmatic rupture is not standardized, and a negative study cannot be used to exclude the diagnosis [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>]. To perform the examination, a 5.0- to 7.5-MHz linear array transducer is placed transversely on the abdomen with the transducer directed posteriorly toward the diaphragm. The diaphragm appears as a hyperechoic (ie, white) line superior to the liver.

The discontinuity sign was the most common radiologic finding present in 95.7 percent of studies. Nevertheless, discontinuity of the posterior diaphragm can be an anatomic variant seen in at least 11 percent of individuals [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]; however, in the context of recent trauma, this finding warrants further investigation. Diaphragmatic thickening was the next most common finding in approximately 70 percent of studies. Contiguous injury was the most commonly seen in penetrating trauma and was reported in 83 percent of studies. The dependent viscera and collar signs are highly specific but are predominantly seen in patients with blunt trauma due to smaller size of defect in penetrating injuries.

However, first- and second-generation imaging studies were prone to missing centrally located radial tears. Some of the limitations of earlier scanners are being overcome with newer helical and multidetector (up to 256-slice) computed tomography (MDCT) studies, which are able to acquire volumetric data, eliminate motion artifact, and provide excellent three-dimensional reconstruction [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. However, because of the rarity of diaphragmatic injury, the sensitivity and specificity for detecting diaphragmatic injury with advanced CT technology have yet to be firmly established. We expect the accuracy to be improved due to better longitudinal and in-plane image resolution. Even with higher-resolution scans, injuries can be missed in intubated patients on positive pressure ventilation because the abdominal organs that might have herniated into the chest are pushed back into the abdomen. Sagittal reconstructions may be helpful to define the injury in these patients. Where available, multidetector CT scanning is the primary diagnostic modality for identifying patients who require repair of a diaphragmatic injury.

These data are to be interpreted with caution, since outcomes may be impacted by the packing technique used and the overall size of the penetrating wound. It is unknown whether this diagnostic approach is superior to traditional CT scanning, but it may be better for determining the wound trajectory.

After ligation and division of the falciform ligament, the right hemidiaphragm is inspected by downward traction on the liver. The liver does not usually need to be mobilized away from its coronary ligamentous attachments. Downward traction on the fundus of the stomach and dome of the spleen allows visualization of the left hemidiaphragm. The central tendon, the esophageal hiatus, and the diaphragmatic crura at the aortic hiatus should also be inspected to ensure they remain firmly attached to the lumbar vertebrae and are not torn. </p><p>When herniation of abdominal organs is present, the organs should be gently reduced from the diaphragmatic defect back into the abdominal cavity. Although gentle traction is usually always a successful approach to reducing displaced abdominal contents, occasionally injury to the spleen may become more severe with downward traction. In this setting, carefully extending the hernia defect facilitates an easier reduction of organs back into the abdomen. With chronic herniation, there is always a hernia sac with adhesions. Dissection of the hernia sac away from the abdominal contents is first necessary; then the abdominal organs can be reduced without causing injury. Any serosal or capsular tears that occur are identified and repaired. </p><p>The edges of the diaphragmatic defect are grasped with Allis clamps. This allows for caudad retraction of the injured diaphragm for better exposure during the suture repair and to ensure the safety of thoracic soft tissue structures adjacent and superior to the suture repair. The thoracic cavity is inspected through the defect for contamination or ongoing hemorrhage. If contamination exists, copious lavage is performed. Irrigation of the thoracic cavity through a laparotomy approach has been shown to be effective in controlling biliary, gastric, or enteric contamination in patients with penetrating trauma [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. </p><p>Any devitalized diaphragmatic tissue is debrided. The diaphragm is repaired with permanent suture or absorbable monofilament suture (Size 0, 1) in a running or interrupted fashion. The author prefers to use permanent monofilament suture. Gentle downward traction of the cardiac surface of the diaphragm away from the heart during the placement of sutures will avoid inadvertent cardiac injury.

In the rare instance that primary repair is not possible due to excess diaphragmatic tissue loss or chronic expansion of the defect (Grade IV or V injury), nonabsorbable prosthetic materials (eg, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyethylene) can be used, provided no colonic contamination is present. When contamination is present, the abdomen is copiously irrigated and an autologous tissue flap (eg, omentum, latissimus dorsi flap) or a bioprosthesis should be used [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H98790511"><span class="h2">Managing cardiac herniation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute cardiac herniation is usually due to high-speed motor vehicle collision [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. The heart herniates inferiorly into the peritoneal cavity due to disruption of the central tendon. The diagnosis is established with chest radiograph or FAST examination. Repair of this injury is through a laparotomy incision. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19492669"><span class="h1">MORTALITY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The mortality for diaphragmatic injury depends upon the trauma mechanism and presence of associated injuries. The National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) reports an overall mortality of 25 percent for patients with diaphragmatic injury. The immediate 24-hour mortality from diaphragmatic injuries is due to associated injuries. Mortality is higher with blunt compared with penetrating injury due to the presence of significant associated thoracic or abdominal injuries [<a href="#rid4">4,9</a>]. In the NTDB study, patients with blunt diaphragmatic injury had a significantly higher mortality rate (19.8 versus 8.8 percent) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Significantly more patients with blunt injury had pulmonary complications (14.8 versus 6.6 percent) and acute respiratory distress (7.4 versus 4.1 percent) compared with penetrating injuries.</p><p>Poor physiologic status upon presentation of the patient accompanied by continued hemorrhage is a predictor of death [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. The mortality for delayed presentation of diaphragmatic injury for the patient with incarceration of gastrointestinal contents is approximately 20 percent, increasing to 40 to 57 percent when bowel strangulation is present [<a href="#rid47">47</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H811292435"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_society_guidelines" href="/z/d/html/120372.html" rel="external">"Society guideline links: Thoracic trauma"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19492683"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>The diaphragm and diaphragmatic injury</strong> – The diaphragm is the musculotendinous boundary between the thoracic cavity and abdominal cavity and plays an important role in normal respiratory function. Diaphragmatic injury is uncommon, representing less than 1 percent of all traumatic injuries. A high index of suspicion for this injury is needed because delayed diagnosis is associated with an increased risk for herniation and strangulation of abdominal organs, which can be life-threatening. (See <a class="local">'Anatomy of the diaphragm'</a> above and <a class="local">'Recognition of diaphragmatic injury'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mechanisms of diaphragm injury</strong> – A suspicion for diaphragmatic injury begins with the identification of the injury mechanism, physical examination, and assessment of associated injuries. Direct injury to the diaphragm is due to an implement or missile passing through the diaphragm. Indirect injury is caused by a sudden increase in intra-abdominal pressure that is sufficient to overcome the strength of the diaphragmatic tissues. As such, penetrating injury leads to smaller rents that are more likely to be missed compared with blunt rupture, which typically causes large radial tears (See <a class="local">'Recognition of diaphragmatic injury'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Associated injuries</strong> – The diaphragm is usually injured in association with other thoracic and abdominal organs. Blunt traumatic injuries that are highly associated (&gt;30 percent) with diaphragmatic injury include hemothorax, liver injury, and splenic injury. Any penetrating mechanism found to involve organs on either side of the diaphragm is likely to be associated with a diaphragmatic injury. (See <a class="local">'Associated injuries'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic evaluation</strong> – The mechanism of injury and physical exam findings may suggest the need for additional studies beyond plain chest radiograph. Computed tomography (CT) is the primary imaging modality used to diagnose diaphragmatic injury. Features consistent with diaphragmatic injury on CT scan are listed above. Alternative modalities include ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Small tears, particularly right-sided penetrating injuries, may not be identified by any imaging modality. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management </strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hemodynamically stable patients with a negative physical exam and imaging studies can be observed  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef91880" href="/z/d/graphic/91880.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Small right-sided diaphragmatic injuries in hemodynamically stable patients can be managed expectantly. Patients who are being observed should be monitored for signs or symptoms that suggest herniation. (See <a class="local">'Management approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Laparoscopic or thoracoscopic exploration (with or without robotic assistance) may be needed to obtain a diagnosis (and an opportunity for repair) for those in whom a high index of suspicion for diaphragmatic injury persists despite negative imaging studies. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>All left-sided diaphragmatic injuries and most right-sided injuries should be repaired when recognized  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef91880" href="/z/d/graphic/91880.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Acute injuries of the diaphragm are repaired from the abdomen, often in conjunction with abdominal exploration to identify and repair other associated injuries. The diaphragm is repaired primarily unless a large defect is present, in which case prosthetic materials are used provided there is no colonic contamination. (See <a class="local">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mortality and complications</strong> – The overall mortality associated with diaphragmatic injury is 25 percent, primarily due to the presence of life-threatening chest or abdominal injury but can also result from complications of the injury itself. Complications of diaphragmatic injury include gastrointestinal herniation, pulmonary sequelae due to altered respiratory mechanics, diaphragm paralysis, and pleural fistula. Of these complications, gastrointestinal herniation contributes to mortality the most due to bowel ischemia and infarction. (See <a class="local">'Mortality'</a> above and <a class="local">'Complications of diaphragmatic injury'</a> above.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li class="breakAll">Trauma, 6, Feliciano, DV, Mattox, KL, Moore, EF (Eds), McGraw-Hill, 2008.</li><li class="breakAll">National Trauma Data Base.
