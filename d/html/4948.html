(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4956.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Gene mutations and clinical genetic testing"</a>.)</p><p>HCM is characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) of various morphologies, with a wide array of clinical manifestations and hemodynamic abnormalities  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58156" href="/z/d/graphic/58156.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Depending in part upon the site and extent of cardiac hypertrophy, patients with HCM can develop one or more of the following abnormalities:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>LV outflow obstruction (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4947.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Morphologic variants and the pathophysiology of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction"</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diastolic dysfunction</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Myocardial ischemia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mitral regurgitation</p><p></p><p>These structural and functional abnormalities can produce a variety of symptoms, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fatigue</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dyspnea</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chest pain</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Palpitations</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Presyncope or syncope</p><p></p><p>In broad terms, the symptoms related to HCM can be categorized as those related to heart failure (HF), chest pain, or arrhythmias. Patients with HCM have an increased incidence of both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias and are at an increased risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4926.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in adults: Supraventricular tachycardias including atrial fibrillation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4952.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Risk stratification for sudden cardiac death"</a>.)</p><p>For the majority of patients with HCM, LVH is not progressive, and HCM is compatible with normal longevity in the vast majority with a 1 percent annual mortality rate among nonreferral-based cohorts. A small subset of patients, however, remains at risk for a number of adverse disease-related complications including: sudden death, usually in the absence of symptoms; progressive HF symptoms occasionally associated with systolic dysfunction; and atrial fibrillation with risk of thromboembolic stroke.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of HCM will be reviewed here. Other issues such as the natural history and treatment of this disorder are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4916.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Natural history and prognosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4950.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Management of patients without outflow tract obstruction"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4920.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Management of patients with outflow tract obstruction"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H274510"><span class="h1">PREVALENCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prevalence of HCM in the general population, as determined from echocardiographic studies in a variety of ethnic populations around the world, is 0.2 percent (1 out of every 500 adults) [<a href="#rid1">1-6</a>]. Subsequently, newer techniques (ie, genetic testing, cardiac magnetic resonance [CMR] imaging) have increased recognition of the HCM phenotype and improved clinical diagnosis [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. In the MESA cohort of patients without known cardiovascular disease at baseline, among 4972 patients who underwent CMR screening at baseline, 67 participants (1.4 percent) were found to have unexplained LVH (eg, not related to hypertension, valvular disease, etc), supporting the principle that HCM is likely more common than the 1:500 prevalence derived from general population studies with echocardiography [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In addition, prior epidemiologic studies did not take into account autosomal dominant transmission of HCM, with often multiple affected family members for each proband identified. For these reasons, the prevalence of HCM in the general population has been estimated to be closer to 1 out of every 200 adults (0.5 percent) or perhaps even greater [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H274517"><span class="h1">HISTOLOGIC FINDINGS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Histopathology in patients with HCM reveals hypertrophied myocytes arranged in a chaotic and disorganized fashion with a varying amount of interstitial fibrosis intertwined among the myocytes. In addition, the intramural coronary arterioles are structurally abnormal with decreased luminal cross-sectional area and impaired vasodilatory capacity resulting in blunted myocardial blood flow during stress (ie, "small vessel ischemia"). Over time, repetitive bouts of small vessel ischemia lead to myocyte cell death and ultimately repair in the form of replacement fibrosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55914" href="/z/d/graphic/55914.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H274524"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many patients with HCM have no or only minor symptoms; thus, affected individuals are often diagnosed as a result of family screening, detection of a murmur during routine examination, or the identification of an abnormal ECG. However, among those who come to clinical attention at referral centers, left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradients and symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, and syncope are the most common clinical manifestations. Patients with mild to moderate limitation usually experience slow progression of symptoms with advancing age in association with a modest deterioration in LV function.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H274531"><span class="h2">Signs and symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The signs and symptoms of HCM are variable, and there is not a strong correlation between the presence or magnitude of LVOT obstruction, the extent of LV hypertrophy (LVH), and symptoms. Some patients with severe LVOT obstruction remain asymptomatic for many years, while others without LVOT obstruction may have significant limitation. </p><p>While many patients with HCM are asymptomatic, others develop one or more of the following symptoms:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dyspnea on exertion</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fatigue</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Atypical or anginal chest pain </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Presyncope and syncope, particularly during or immediately following exertion </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Palpitation</p><p></p><p>Advanced heart failure (HF) symptoms of orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and edema are uncommon. The frequency of symptoms at diagnosis varies considerably depending on whether the population being studied is a cross section of the overall population or patients at a referral center [<a href="#rid2">2,12,13</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a series of 320 patients from three referral centers, transthoracic echocardiography was performed in all patients, with subsequent stress echocardiography only in those whose LVOT gradient was &lt;50 mmHg at rest [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>169 patients (59 percent) had New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II or greater dyspnea at presentation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>119 patients (37 percent) had a resting LVOT gradient ≥50 mmHg, while 201 patients (63 percent) had a resting LVOT gradient &lt;50 mmHg (mean 4 mmHg). With exercise, 76 (24 percent) developed an LVOT gradient ≥50 mmHg, and 46 (14 percent) developed dyspnea with exertion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>95 patients (30 percent) were asymptomatic with little or no gradient (≤30 mmHg) at rest or with exertion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a study of 277 outpatients from a regional cohort (nonreferral population) who were followed for eight years, approximately 90 percent were asymptomatic at presentation [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. During the eight-year follow-up, 69 percent remained asymptomatic or had only mild symptoms, and survival in adults was similar to a normal control age-matched population. </p><p></p><p>Thus, among patients referred for evaluation of HCM, both HF symptoms and outflow gradients are common, although in many cases exercise testing may be necessary to demonstrate these abnormalities.</p><p>The clinical presentation also may be affected by sex. In a review of 969 consecutive patients from the United States and Italy, females were significantly older at presentation than males (47 versus 38 years), more symptomatic (New York Heart Association class 1.8 versus 1.4)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683" href="/z/d/graphic/52683.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), and more likely to have LVOT obstruction (37 versus 23 percent) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. At a mean follow-up of 6.2 years, females had significantly higher rates of progression to NYHA class III or IV and death from HF or stroke. </p><p>Symptoms can be induced by a variety of mechanisms which may include LVOT obstruction, impaired myocardial function, brady- or tachyarrhythmias, or impaired filling due to diastolic dysfunction [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. The importance of these mechanisms may change with time and stage of disease. Some patients, for example, are initially symptomatic because of obstruction. As the myocardial disease worsens over time, the heart may enlarge, obstruction lessens, and symptoms are primarily due to systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4947.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Morphologic variants and the pathophysiology of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction", section on 'Pathophysiology and evolution of LVOT obstruction'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H274552"><span class="h3">Heart failure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>HF, most commonly manifesting as dyspnea on exertion, is the most common presentation in persons with HCM, occurring in over 90 percent of symptomatic patients [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Dyspnea can result from a variety of mechanisms: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diastolic dysfunction due to myocardial hypertrophy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Impaired LV emptying due to LVOT obstruction, resulting in increased LV end-diastolic pressure</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mitral regurgitation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Systolic dysfunction in a patient with more extensive myocardial involvement</p><p></p><p>Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea are uncommon presenting symptoms.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H274559"><span class="h3">Chest pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Typical exertional chest pain (ie, angina) occurs in 25 to 30 percent of patients with HCM, usually in the setting of a normal coronary arteriogram [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. Some patients also complain of prolonged episodes of atypical chest pain [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. This chest pain is commonly precipitated or worsened by heavy meals. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6832.html" rel="external">"Outpatient evaluation of the adult with chest pain"</a>.)</p><p>Several of the pathophysiologic features of HCM predispose to the development of microvascular angina, which may be induced by an increase in myocardial oxygen demand or a reduction in myocardial blood flow and oxygen supply [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Factors that increase myocardial oxygen demand include myocyte hypertrophy and increased muscle mass, myocyte disarray  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73467" href="/z/d/graphic/73467.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>), and LVOT obstruction and increased wall stress due to elevated diastolic pressures. Factors that reduce myocardial blood flow in HCM, particularly with exertion, include impaired vasodilator reserve, myocardial bridging with systolic and early diastolic compression of intramural vessels, small vessel disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55914" href="/z/d/graphic/55914.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) and microvascular dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, and increased capillary separation and inadequate capillary density [<a href="#rid17">17,19-24</a>].</p><p>Many studies have shown that, during pacing or pharmacologic stress, myocardial blood flow is abnormal in patients with HCM and often associated with metabolic evidence for myocardial ischemia [<a href="#rid16">16,19,23,25,26</a>]. Myocardial perfusion in patients with HCM can be assessed using exercise or pharmacologic stress testing. (See <a class="local">'Exercise testing'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with HCM who have an acute myocardial infarction appear are more likely to present with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) rather than STEMI, although patients with HCM who develop STEMI appear to have a lower risk of mortality compared with patients without HCM [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H274566"><span class="h3">Arrhythmias</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Both supraventricular arrhythmias, primarily atrial fibrillation (AF), and ventricular arrhythmias occur in HCM. Patients with an arrhythmia may present with palpitations, increasing dyspnea, presyncope, or syncope, with occasional patients presenting with sudden cardiac death due to sustained ventricular arrhythmias.</p><p>The arrhythmias associated with HCM, as well as their treatment, are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4926.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in adults: Supraventricular tachycardias including atrial fibrillation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4952.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Risk stratification for sudden cardiac death"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H274573"><span class="h3">Syncope</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Approximately 15 to 25 percent of patients with HCM report at least one syncopal episode.

Physical examination findings typically include severe hypotension, sinus tachycardia, thready double-impulse peripheral arterial pulse, auscultatory and radiographic evidence of cardiac failure, and systolic murmurs of LV obstruction and mitral regurgitation.</p><p>Acute hemodynamic collapse in HCM is usually precipitated by events that acutely increase outflow obstruction, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decreased preload due to dehydration, diuretics, or an acute reduction in blood volume (eg, hemorrhage, sepsis, peripheral venous pooling, post epidural)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decreased afterload due to administration of a vasodilator</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Supraventricular tachycardia, AF, or sinus tachycardia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute mitral regurgitation due to flail mitral valve leaflet or endocarditis</p><p></p><p>LVOT obstruction is confirmed by urgent echocardiography, which characteristically demonstrates hyperdynamic LV function with a small (underfilled) LV cavity, and systolic anterior motion (SAM) with prolonged SAM-septal contact associated with mitral regurgitation (usually posteriorly directed). (See <a class="local">'Echocardiography'</a> below.)</p><p>Conventional treatment of HF with nitrates, diuretics, and vasodilators may result in further hemodynamic deterioration. The management of acute hemodynamic collapse is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4920.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Management of patients with outflow tract obstruction", section on 'Therapies to avoid'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3944632839"><span class="h3">End-stage disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The majority of patients with HCM present with the classic manifestations of HCM, including asymmetric LVH, normal LV systolic function, LVOT obstruction, and related signs and symptoms. However, there is a small subgroup of patients with HCM (approximately 5 to 8 percent) who develop adverse LV remodeling resulting in systolic dysfunction (LV ejection fraction &lt;50 percent) and which can be associated with wall thinning and chamber dilation. This is often referred to as the end-stage (or "burned out") phase of HCM. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4916.html" rel="external">"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Natural history and prognosis", section on 'HCM with LV systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction &lt;50 percent)'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H59914624"><span class="h3">Relationship of symptoms to pressure gradient</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A pressure gradient between the LVOT and aorta is present in the majority of patients with HCM (75 percent), either at rest or following provocation  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef65202" href="/z/d/graphic/65202.html" rel="external">waveform 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef126211" href="/z/d/graphic/126211.html" rel="external">waveform 2</a>). Outflow tract gradients in HCM are dynamic, characterized by spontaneous variability on a day-to-day (or even hourly) basis, and influenced by factors that alter myocardial contractility and loading conditions (eg, dehydration, ingestion of alcohol, or heavy meals). As such, for patients who do not have evidence of LVOT obstruction under resting conditions, an attempt should be made at provoking gradients as the presence of LVOT obstruction will affect management decisions.

In the majority of these instances, echocardiography overestimated maximal LV wall thickness most often due to inclusion of the crista ventricular RV muscle in the short-axis transdimensional measurement of the basal ventricular septum.

Hyperdynamic LV function results in more vigorous ejection of blood from the heart at a higher velocity than normal, leading to an intracavitary gradient which may be mistaken for an increased LVOT gradient. An intracavitary gradient is usually suspected from the clinical scenario (eg, hypotension, tachycardia, other signs of hypovolemia) and almost always disappears following fluid resuscitation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5796708"><span class="h3">Subaortic stenosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Fixed subvalvular aortic stenosis (AS) is a congenital abnormality typically caused by a thin membrane of tissue in the LVOT which is typically seen on two-dimensional echocardiography as well as both color and spectral Doppler echocardiography. Fixed subaortic stenosis can usually be distinguished from HCM and valvular AS by echocardiography or invasive cardiac catheterization.</p><p>Unlike the dynamic LVOT obstruction seen in persons with HCM, there is typically no evidence of systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, and the ventricular wall thickness is normal (although long-standing LV hypertension due to a significant gradient across the membrane can lead to concentric LVH). Unlike valvular AS, the aortic valve leaflets are usually normal (although long-standing high-velocity turbulent flow across the membrane over years to decades may result in aortic valve damage).

In approximately 50 percent of these individuals, the ECG will be abnormal. Although these patients have no increased wall thickness, a number of observations have suggested that the myocardium may still not be structurally normal. For example, abnormalities such as myocardial fibrosis by contrast-cardiac magnetic resonance, collagen biomarkers, mitral leaflet elongation, diastolic dysfunction, and blood-filled myocardial crypts have all been shown to occur in gene carriers [<a href="#rid104">104</a>]. </p><p>The likelihood of developing clinical evidence of HCM with LVH in family members who have a sarcomere mutation is uncertain. Estimates on the likelihood of phenotypic conversion range from annual rates of less than 1 percent to 5 percent. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among one cohort of 38 patients at risk for developing HCM but without phenotypic evidence of HCM at their initial evaluation (include 12 genotype-positive, phenotype-negative patients and 26 relatives of an HCM proband in whom gene testing did not identify a specific disease-causing mutation) who had serial follow-up evaluations over a mean of 12 years, two patients (6 percent) subsequently developed phenotypic evidence of HCM [<a href="#rid85">85,105</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a cohort of 203 genotype-positive, phenotype-negative patients with serial follow-up over a mean of six years, 21 patients (10 percent) subsequently developed phenotypic evidence of HCM [<a href="#rid106">106</a>]. However, 20 percent of the study patients had achieved &gt;50 years of age without development of LVH, including 5 percent over age 60. In addition, over a mean follow-up of 6 years, no adverse cardiovascular events occurred in the study cohort. These data suggest that it is possible for many genotype-positive, phenotype-negative patients to achieve normal longevity without developing LVH or incurring HCM-related complications.</p><p></p><p>Clinical follow-up with longitudinal screening should continue based on the current screening recommendations. (See <a class="local">'Screening of first-degree relatives'</a> below.) </p><p>The risk of sudden death in gene carriers is also unknown but considered to be very low, and therefore consideration for prophylactic ICD should be resolved on an individual case basis. However, current society guidelines do not recommend excluding genotype positive/phenotype negative HCM family members from participating in organized competitive sports [<a href="#rid107">107-109</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H31"><span class="h1">SCREENING OF FIRST-DEGREE RELATIVES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>HCM is an autosomal dominant disorder, and most (but not all) mutations have a high degree of penetrance. As a result, first-degree family members of an affected individual should be evaluated for possible inheritance of the disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef126987" href="/z/d/graphic/126987.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). We agree with the recommendations of others that the components of family screening should include history, physical examination, electrocardiography (ECG), and echocardiography [<a href="#rid38">38,40,110</a>]. Screening is not routinely recommended before the age of 12 years unless the child has a high-risk family history or is participating in intense competitive sports. We do not recommend routine genetic screening of first-degree relatives unless a definite HCM-causing mutation has been identified in the index case. Additionally, while some experts recommend genetic testing in first-degree relatives for the pathogenic mutation identified in the proband prior to performing clinical evaluation with ECG and echocardiography, UpToDate experts recommend only offering cascade genetic testing of family members after initial comprehensive clinical evaluation to determine if HCM is present.</p><p>Among first-degree adult relatives of patients with HCM, otherwise unexplained echocardiographic and ECG abnormalities identified during screening examinations have a high probability of reflecting the expression of HCM [<a href="#rid111">111</a>]. First-degree relatives who are children, however, may have HCM identified at a younger age, in particular when a family member has had a childhood presentation with HCM. In a cohort of 1198 consecutive children ≤18 years of age (mean age 8 years, 80 percent who were ≤12 years of age) referred for screening following diagnosis of HCM in a first-degree relative, 57 patients (4.8 percent) were diagnosed with HCM at a mean age of 10 years, either at initial screening (n = 32) or during serial evaluations (n = 25) [<a href="#rid112">112</a>]. However, whether earlier routine screening with echocardiography in pre-adolescent family members ultimately improves clinical outcomes remains unresolved. </p><p>Family members who have a normal evaluation should not necessarily be assumed to be free of risk:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Because hypertrophy usually develops during adolescence, clinical evaluation should be repeated annually from 12 to 18 years of age.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Due to the possibility of delayed-onset hypertrophy, it is recommended that adult family members with normal ECGs and echocardiograms who are over the age of 18 be reevaluated approximately every five years. There may be a role for tissue Doppler echocardiography in such patients, where abnormalities in contraction and relaxation velocities can suggest pre-clinical myocardial dysfunction [<a href="#rid113">113-115</a>]. However, these abnormalities are not considered diagnostic for HCM and rarely precede the development of ECG abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>The identification of gene mutations for HCM has led to interest in the development of DNA-based testing of patients with HCM and screening of family members. Genetic screening may accurately define the risk of disease development, but it is not universally available and presents additional possible concerns. Additionally, not all persons with a genotype-positive mutation will have the HCM phenotype identified by ECG or echocardiography.

The prevalence of HCM in the general population may be as common as 1 in 200 adults. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above and <a class="local">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Histologic findings</strong> – Histopathology in patients with HCM reveals disorganized myocyte architecture, including hypertrophied myocytes in a disarray pattern with bizarre-shaped nuclei, abnormal intramural coronary arteries, and interstitial as well as replacement fibrosis  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55914" href="/z/d/graphic/55914.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Histologic findings'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical manifestations</strong> – While many patients with HCM remain asymptomatic, it is not uncommon for patients to develop one or more of the following symptoms: dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, chest pain, palpitations, presyncope/syncope, postural lightheadedness, fatigue, or edema. (See <a class="local">'Signs and symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The physical examination in HCM may be normal or may reveal nonspecific abnormalities such as a fourth heart sound, systolic murmur, and/or an LV lift. Patients with LV outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction may have a harsh crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur, which develops slightly after S1 and is heard best at the apex and lower left sternal border. Several physical exam maneuvers can affect the degree of obstruction, resulting in a change in murmur intensity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic evaluation</strong> – The evaluation for HCM in an individual patient may be prompted by a family history of HCM, systolic ejection murmur, abnormal 12-lead electrocardiogram showing otherwise unexplained evidence of LV hypertrophy (LVH), and clinical symptoms including syncope. In addition to performing a comprehensive cardiac history and physical examination and an electrocardiogram (ECG) in all patients with suspected HCM, cardiac imaging to identify LVH should be performed. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>ECG</strong> – Although the ECG is abnormal in 90 percent of patients with HCM  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef76497" href="/z/d/graphic/76497.html" rel="external">waveform 4</a>), no specific pattern is diagnostic. Typically, the ECG shows repolarization abnormalities but also may include prominent abnormal Q waves, P wave abnormalities, left axis deviation, and deeply inverted T waves. (See <a class="local">'Electrocardiography'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Echocardiography</strong> – Two-dimensional echocardiography can be used to reliably diagnose patients with HCM when an area of increased LV wall thickness is imaged anywhere in the LV wall in the absence of another cause. Echocardiographic findings suggestive of HCM include LVH (particularly when asymmetric and involving the septum or anterolateral wall), systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets, particularly with septal contact resulting in an associated subaortic LVOT gradient. In addition, we suggest performing cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in all patients with suspected or diagnosed HCM to most reliably assess LV morphology, including maximal LV wall thickness, as well as to further inform risk stratification with assessment of extent of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). (See <a class="local">'Echocardiography'</a> above and <a class="local">'Cardiovascular magnetic resonance'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Exercise testing</strong> – The majority of patients with HCM have LVOT obstruction under resting conditions or following exercise. Because the identification of a provocable LVOT gradient may result in additional treatment options for heart failure symptoms (ie, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9378" href="/z/d/drug information/9378.html" rel="external">disopyramide</a>, septal reduction therapy), we proceed with exercise stress testing in all patients with known or suspected HCM, without resting LVOT obstruction, as part of the initial HCM evaluation. Exercise should be performed as the stress agent rather than using a pharmacologic stress agent, as a maximal treadmill or bicycle exercise stress test provides an objective measurement of functional capacity and information on the integrity of vascular responses and the risk of exercise related ischemia, arrhythmia, and obstruction. (See <a class="local">'Exercise testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Genetic testing</strong> – Genetic testing is available for clinical use but is predominately reserved for identifying patients who may have a disease which appears phenotypically similar to sarcomere HCM, such as Fabry disease or a lysosomal/glycogen storage disease, or to help identify family members who may be at risk of developing HCM. (See <a class="local">'Genetic testing for HCM'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – The diagnosis of HCM can usually be made following echocardiography and/or CMR imaging, and invasive diagnostic assessments are rarely necessary. We typically reserve invasive hemodynamic assessment using cardiac catheterization for patients with suspected HCM to exclude obstructive coronary artery disease, distinguish pericardial constriction from severe restrictive physiology, to perform endomyocardial biopsy to exclude nonsarcomeric causes of HCM, or for pre-cardiac transplant assessment. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong> – In the patient presenting with LVH, HCM must be distinguished from acquired causes of cardiac hypertrophy, including hypertension, aortic stenosis, cardiac amyloid, and athlete's heart or other genetic heart diseases which phenotypically mimic sarcomeric HCM (Anderson-Fabry and glycogen storage disease). Other than the dynamic subaortic (LVOT) obstruction seen in HCM, several other anatomic and physiologic abnormalities can be associated with increased pressure gradients between the LV and the aorta, including volume depletion, subaortic stenosis, and valvular aortic stenosis. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Testing of first-degree relatives</strong> – HCM is an autosomal dominant disorder, and some mutations have a high degree of penetrance. As a result, first-degree family members of an affected individual should be evaluated for possible inheritance of the disease. The components of family screening should include history, physical examination, electrocardiography (ECG), and echocardiography. We do not recommend routine genetic screening of first-degree relatives unless a definite HCM-causing mutation has been identified in the index case.
