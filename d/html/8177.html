They can present in childhood as congenital lesions or acquired disorders that by adulthood are quite common. Vein-related anatomic and physiologic abnormalities may or may not be symptomatic and include and/or result in a wide range of clinical signs varying from minimal dilation of superficial veins to massive varicosities, edema, chronic skin changes including discoloration or ulceration, or bleeding from varicosities or high pressure telangiectasias. Patient symptoms can also be highly variable, including pain, itching, burning, positional discomfort, and even "venous claudication." Together, the physical manifestations and symptoms of chronic venous disease have major impacts on patient quality of life [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>The Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) classification, which is an internationally recognized and the most widely used classification system for chronic venous disease, is reviewed. An overview of the clinical evaluation and management of lower extremity chronic venous disease is presented elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8181.html" rel="external">"Overview of lower extremity chronic venous disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Standard definitions for venous diagnosis have been adopted by international consensus [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Chronic venous disorders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>This term includes the full spectrum of morphological and functional abnormalities of the venous system.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Chronic venous disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The term chronic venous disease is used when morphological or functional abnormalities (venous valvular incompetence and/or venous obstruction) are present of long duration and manifested as symptoms and/or signs indicating the need for treatment and/or further investigation. Overall adverse physiologic effects of venous valvular incompetence and/or obstruction may be identified by air plethysmography, photoplethysmography, or ambulatory venous pressure measurements. However, specific sites of venous valvular incompetence are most commonly identified by duplex ultrasound as retrograde venous flow of abnormal duration. Duplex ultrasound; computed tomographic, magnetic resonance, or catheter-based contrast venography; or intravascular ultrasound are used to identify specific sites of venous obstruction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8196.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic evaluation of lower extremity chronic venous disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15223.html" rel="external">"Overview of iliocaval venous obstruction", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p>Symptoms may include but are not limited to lower extremity tingling, burning, aching, pain, tightness, skin irritation, itching, heaviness, swelling, fatigue, or muscle cramps.</p><p>Venous signs include dilated veins (eg, telangiectasia, varicose veins), leg/ankle edema, skin changes, or ulceration.</p><p>The severity of both symptoms and signs of venous disease tends to correlate with the degree of underlying venous valvular dysfunction or venous obstruction. However, minimal visible evidence of venous disease may be associated with venous valvular incompetence. Symptoms of limb aching, heaviness, and swelling can all be of venous origin even when not associated with visible or palpable varicose veins  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70438" href="/z/d/graphic/70438.html" rel="external">picture 2B</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8202.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology of chronic venous disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Chronic venous insufficiency</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The term chronic venous insufficiency is generally used to describe patients with chronic venous disease who display more advanced clinical signs, such as significant edema, skin changes, or ulceration  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56758 graphicRef71020" href="/z/d/graphic/56758.html" rel="external">picture 1A-B</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8196.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic evaluation of lower extremity chronic venous disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">CEAP CLASSIFICATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An international consensus conference initiated the Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) classification to categorize chronic venous disorders to facilitate communication between practitioners and serve as a basis for standardized reporting during scientific analysis of management alternatives  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52388" href="/z/d/graphic/52388.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The CEAP classification was developed in 1993 and widely adopted. It was updated in 1996, revised in 2004, and updated and refined again in 2020 by an ad hoc committee of the American Venous Forum to better reflect evolving understanding of the natural history of venous disease and evolving methods of diagnosis and treatment of venous disease [<a href="#rid2">2,4-8</a>]. </p><p>It is very important to remember that CEAP is a classification system, <strong>not</strong> a measure of disease severity. CEAP should not be used as a measure of the clinical severity of venous disease and is not meant to be used to measure the response to therapy. As categorical variables, components of CEAP cannot be reported as means or medians; rather, changes in CEAP in a study group or in individual limbs over time or following therapy are best reported as the distribution of CEAP classes over time for study groups or as pre- and post-therapy values for individual limbs. Measures of clinical severity are described below. (See <a class="local">'Measures of clinical severity'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Clinical signs (The "C" component of CEAP)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinical spectrum of chronic venous disorders is wide. Some individuals with minimally dilated veins  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62119" href="/z/d/graphic/62119.html" rel="external">picture 2A</a>) or even varicosities do not have significant complaints and may not find the appearance of their veins concerning  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56463" href="/z/d/graphic/56463.html" rel="external">picture 3A</a>). Others find even the smallest dilated veins cosmetically troublesome even in the absence of symptoms. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8198.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of lower extremity chronic venous disease"</a>.)</p><p>The visible signs of chronic venous disorders are categorized as C0 to C6 depending on appearance. Additionally, patients are classified as asymptomatic (a) or symptomatic (s) depending on the presence of lower extremity symptoms such as aching, pain, tightness, skin irritation, heaviness, or muscle cramps. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8198.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of lower extremity chronic venous disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">No visible or palpable signs of venous disease (C0)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the absence of symptoms, patients without significant visible evidence of venous disease are unlikely to have venous pathology [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. However, C0 patients may be symptomatic; venous obstruction and/or reflux may be identified with venous diagnostic testing. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">Telangiectasias/reticular veins (C1)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Telangiectasias are a confluence of dilated intradermal venules &lt;1 mm in diameter  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62119 graphicRef70438" href="/z/d/graphic/62119.html" rel="external">picture 2A-B</a>). Synonyms include spider veins, hyphen webs, and thread veins. Telangiectatic matting consists of typically fine, red vessels (&lt;0.2 mm) that can develop following any venous treatment (eg, laser therapy, surgical stripping, sclerotherapy).</p><p>Reticular veins are dilated bluish subdermal veins 1 to 3 mm in diameter  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62119 graphicRef70438" href="/z/d/graphic/62119.html" rel="external">picture 2A-B</a>). They are usually tortuous. Excluded are normal visible veins in persons with thin, transparent skin. Synonyms include blue veins and subdermal varices.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Varicose veins (C2, C2r)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Varicose veins are subcutaneous dilated veins 3 mm or greater in size  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56463 graphicRef68551" href="/z/d/graphic/56463.html" rel="external">picture 3A-B</a>). They may involve the great or small saphenous veins, saphenous vein tributaries, or nonsaphenous superficial leg veins. Synonyms include varix, varices, and varicosities. Recurrent varicose veins (C<sub>2r</sub>) are those that occur following intervention and were not present preintervention.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h3">Edema (C3)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The edema associated with chronic venous disease is due to an increase in the volume of fluid in the skin and subcutaneous tissues and will indent when pressure is applied  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70438" href="/z/d/graphic/70438.html" rel="external">picture 2B</a>). Lower extremity swelling due to lymphedema is often confused with that due to venous origin. Edema only related to the presence of venous disease usually occurs at the ankle and may extend to the leg but less commonly extends to the foot and toes, distinguishing it from lymphedema. In addition, edema due to venous disease alone generally resolves or greatly improves overnight when the patient sleeps (elevated legs), while lymphedema is more recalcitrant and generally persists and is still present in the morning. Phlebolymphedema is perhaps the most common form of lymphedema in Western societies and results from anatomic and physiologic changes in the lymphatic system arising secondary to advanced forms of chronic venous disease that lead to lymphatic overload [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. The evaluation and management of lymphedema is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/17013.html" rel="external">"Lower extremity lymphedema"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/755.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of peripheral lymphedema", section on 'Clinical features'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/738.html" rel="external">"Clinical staging and conservative management of peripheral lymphedema"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Pigmentation or eczema (C4a)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pigmentation related to venous disease is a characteristic brownish darkening of the skin due to hemosiderin deposition as a consequence of extravasated red blood cells  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56758" href="/z/d/graphic/56758.html" rel="external">picture 1A</a>). It usually occurs in the ankle region but may extend to the more proximal leg or to the foot.</p><p>Eczema is an erythematous dermatitis, which may progress to blistering, weeping, or scaling eruption of skin of the leg  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51553" href="/z/d/graphic/51553.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>). It is often located near varicose veins, but the presence of varicosities is not required for eczema of venous origin, and venous eczema may be located anywhere on the leg below the knee.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h3">Lipodermatosclerosis (C4b)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Lipodermatosclerosis is localized chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the skin and subcutaneous tissues of the lower leg  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65447" href="/z/d/graphic/65447.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>), sometimes associated with scarring or contracture of the Achilles tendon  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76901" href="/z/d/graphic/76901.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>). It is sometimes preceded by diffuse inflammatory edema of the skin, which may be painful and which is often referred to as hypodermatitis. The differential diagnosis includes lymphangitis, erysipelas, or cellulitis.</p><p>Atrophie blanche (white atrophy) is a localized, circular, or stellate ivory-colored depressed region of abnormal skin surrounded by dilated capillaries and sometimes hyperpigmentation  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67105" href="/z/d/graphic/67105.html" rel="external">picture 7</a>). It is prone to ulceration and a sign of severe chronic venous disease that arises spontaneously and must not be confused with a healed ulcer scar (patient history of ulceration is often lacking).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H263589145"><span class="h3">Corona phlebectatica (C4c)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Corona phlebectatica is described as a circular or fan-shaped collection, a "crown," of nonpalpable, small intradermal veins in the regions of the medial or lateral ankles, sometimes extending distally onto the foot  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86549" href="/z/d/graphic/86549.html" rel="external">picture 8</a>). It is considered by many to be an early sign of more advanced underlying venous disease and is associated with an increased risk of venous ulcer [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Synonyms include ankle flare or malleolar flare.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h3">Healed venous ulcer (C5)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Healed venous ulcerations may also exhibit atrophic skin with pigmentary changes  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56758" href="/z/d/graphic/56758.html" rel="external">picture 1A</a>). Healed venous ulcers are distinguishable by appearance and history of ulceration from atrophie blanche.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h3">Active or recurrent venous ulcer (C6, C6r)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Active venous ulcers (C6) are full-thickness defects of the skin, most frequently in the ankle region, but they can extend more proximally, and even circumferentially around the distal to mid-calf. They generally will not heal spontaneously, but they can usually be healed with proper therapy and wound care  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71020" href="/z/d/graphic/71020.html" rel="external">picture 1B</a>). Recurrent venous ulcer (C6<sub>r</sub>) is an ulcer that occurs after a period of complete ulcer healing.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h2">Etiology (The "E" component of CEAP)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>From an etiologic viewpoint, venous disorders are considered to be one of the following:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18"><span class="h3">Primary (Ep)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Primary venous disorders develop independently of other diseases. They account for the majority of cases of chronic venous insufficiency and are usually due to degeneration of venous valves or the vein wall leading to valvular reflux involving the great or small saphenous veins or their branches. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19"><span class="h3">Secondary (Es, Esi, Ese)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Secondary venous disorders develop as a consequence of another pathology, such as following venous thrombosis or trauma. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8200.html" rel="external">"Post-thrombotic (postphlebitic) syndrome"</a>.)</p><p>Intravenous causes of venous disease (E<sub>si</sub>) include venous wall and/or vein valve damage resulting from conditions that include deep vein thrombosis (DVT; especially recurrent DVT), traumatic arteriovenous fistulas, and primary intravenous sarcoma.</p><p>Extravenous causes of venous disease (E<sub>se</sub>), have no venous wall or valve damage. Symptoms are present owing to alterations in venous hemodynamics either locally or systemically, including conditions such as central venous hypertension (eg, heart failure, obesity, nutcracker syndrome, pelvic venous congestion), extrinsic compression, or muscle pump dysfunction from chronic motor disorders (eg, paraplegia, arthritis, chronic immobility). Chronic external compression of an iliac vein, most commonly the left common iliac vein by the right common iliac artery (ie, May Thurner syndrome), is also recognized as a source of chronic venous insufficiency [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H876363782"><span class="h3">Congenital (Ec)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Congenital venous disorders present at birth or noted to develop in childhood (eg, Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome).

Veins that traverse between the same system (superficial to superficial or deep to deep) are termed communicating veins, whereas veins that connect the superficial to the deep system are called perforating veins. The nomenclature of the venous anatomy of the lower extremity is standardized to eliminate confusing terminology [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. Eighteen named venous segments are used as locators of pathology and classified anatomically as superficial veins (As), deep veins (Ad), perforating veins (Ap), or venous location not specified (An)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77469" href="/z/d/graphic/77469.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22"><span class="h3">Superficial venous system (As)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The superficial veins are contained in the subcutaneous tissue of the lower extremity within a superficial space that is bounded deeply by the muscular fascia and superficially by the dermis. The major axial superficial veins of the lower extremity include the great and small saphenous veins. Other lower extremity superficial veins with more variant anatomy include the anterior, posterior, and superficial accessories of the great saphenous vein (GSV); the superficial accessory of the small saphenous vein (SSV); intersaphenous veins (communicating veins between the great and small saphenous veins); and the lateral venous system.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The GSV is one of the axial superficial veins in the lower extremity  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55019 graphicRef52340" href="/z/d/graphic/55019.html" rel="external">figure 1A-B</a>). It is the longest vein in the body, originating from the dorsal venous network of the foot and crossing anterior to the medial malleolus and coursing cephalad and medially in the lower leg and thigh to the saphenofemoral junction in the groin  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55019" href="/z/d/graphic/55019.html" rel="external">figure 1A</a>). It can vary in diameter along its course, and is generally, but not always, contained within a fascial layer. Just below the inguinal ligament, it enters the fossa ovalis and terminates in the common femoral vein at the confluence of the superficial inguinal veins at the saphenofemoral junction, the anatomy of which can be quite variable  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113245" href="/z/d/graphic/113245.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. The GSV also drains into the deep venous system through both calf and thigh perforating veins. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The SSV is another of the axial superficial veins, and it originates laterally from the dorsal venous arch of the foot, crosses posterior to the lateral malleolus, and ascends posteriorly along the midline of the calf overlying the fascia between the heads of the gastrocnemius muscle  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52340" href="/z/d/graphic/52340.html" rel="external">figure 1B</a>). In the upper calf, the SSV passes through the deep muscle fascia and terminates in the popliteal vein at the saphenopopliteal junction, which also has highly variable anatomy  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82053" href="/z/d/graphic/82053.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>) [<a href="#rid13">13-16</a>]. The SSV can join a superficial cephalad extension in the posterior thigh (vein of Giacomini), connect to both the popliteal vein and the posterior thigh vein, or join the popliteal vein with no major tributaries near the junction. Anatomic variations in the SSV have implications for SSV ablation [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The accessory saphenous veins (ASVs) are any of several venous segments that ascend parallel to the GSV.

The deep veins of the lower extremity are classified as intramuscular (within the muscle) or intermuscular (between muscle groups). The intermuscular veins are more important in the development of chronic venous disease [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Leg</strong> – The intermuscular veins of the leg include the popliteal veins and crural veins (paired anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and peroneal veins)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75219" href="/z/d/graphic/75219.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). The intramuscular veins include the gastrocnemius and soleal sinus veins.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The three paired crural veins are named after the artery they accompany. The posterior tibial veins originate from the medial foot at the medial malleolus, the anterior tibial veins from the dorsum of the foot, and the peroneal veins from venous collaterals originating between the distal tibia and fibula. The popliteal vein originates in the popliteal space as the confluence of the crural veins. The popliteal vein transitions to be renamed the femoral vein at the level of the adductor canal in the thigh. Duplication of the femoral vein in the thigh is a well-recognized anatomic variant. The popliteal vein may also be duplicated.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thigh</strong> – The intermuscular veins of the thigh include the femoral vein, deep femoral vein, and common femoral vein. The femoral vein is joined just below the saphenofemoral junction by the deep femoral vein to form the common femoral vein  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75219" href="/z/d/graphic/75219.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pelvis</strong> – The pelvic veins draining blood away from the lower extremities can, when narrowed or thrombosed, contribute significantly to the development of chronic venous disease. The main collecting veins of the pelvis include the external iliac veins, internal iliac veins, and common iliac veins.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">After passing beneath the inguinal ligament, the common femoral vein becomes the external iliac vein, which is joined by the internal iliac vein to form the common iliac vein. The right and left common iliac veins merge at the level of the umbilicus to form the inferior vena cava. Because the inferior vena cava is usually located to the right of the spine, the left common iliac vein is longer with a less vertical path to the vena cava  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75219" href="/z/d/graphic/75219.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). The left common iliac vein is crossed anteriorly by the right common iliac artery, and this results in variable degrees of compression of the left common iliac vein by the right common iliac artery. When associated with left lower extremity edema or iliac vein thrombosis, this is referred to as May-Thurner syndrome. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2678996870"><span class="h3">Perforator veins (Ap)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Perforating veins are those veins that traverse the muscular fascia to connect superficial veins with deep veins.
