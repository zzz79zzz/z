         Uterine artery embolization (UAE) was introduced for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) in 1995 [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. UAE treatment of fibroids is performed worldwide. Fibroids are a common gynecologic problem and result in symptoms that impact quality of life and may result in anemia or other adverse effects. There are many options for treatment, including hormonal therapy, hysteroscopic or abdominal myomectomy, and hysterectomy. UAE provides a minimally invasive and uterine-sparing treatment option.

         The majority of the blood supply to the uterus derives from the uterine arteries, and there is also collateral perfusion from the ovarian arteries  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54737" href="/z/d/graphic/54737.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The uterine arteries originate from the anterior division of the internal iliac arteries in the retroperitoneum  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83008" href="/z/d/graphic/83008.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). They may share a common origin with the obliterated umbilical artery, internal pudendal, or vaginal artery. The ovarian arteries arise from the abdominal aorta. The right ovarian vein returns to the inferior vena cava while the left ovarian vein returns to the left renal vein. (See

         UAE is a treatment option for patients with symptomatic uterine leiomyomas. There are many treatment options for uterine fibroids and the clinician must guide the patient through this choice. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5478.html" rel="external">
          "Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas): Treatment overview"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Ideal candidates for UAE include patients with all of the following characteristics [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5
         </a>
         ]:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">

         </span>

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">

         No desire for future pregnancy
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with these characteristics, a high symptom control rate, satisfaction, and quality of life can be achieved for up to 10 years after treatment [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-8
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Efficacy'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         If bulk-related symptoms (eg, sensation of pressure in the lower abdomen, nocturia, urinary frequency, and urinary incontinence) are the only symptoms, the efficacy of UAE is questionable [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. The embolization versus hysterectomy randomized trial (EMMY) showed no significant improvement compared with baseline in bulk-related complaints [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Some prospective cohort studies have found, however, a significant improvement in bulk-related symptoms even in the long-term [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. It is also not usually used to treat infertility related to fibroids, since a desire for future childbearing is a relative contraindication. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Efficacy'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         UAE is also a potential option for treatment of uterine adenomyosis, but the data are limited regarding efficacy for this indication [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. A literature review included 1049 patients with adenomyosis treated with UAE and reported significant improvement in symptoms in 83.1 percent of patients [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Uteri with adenomyosis combined with fibroids tend to have better results than uteri with only adenomyosis. However, these were low-quality data from series with no control group. Management of uterine adenomyosis is discussed in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5489.html" rel="external">

         There are limited data regarding prognostic factors to predict the effect of UAE on fibroid volume, symptoms, and need for reintervention. The largest studies did not show strong predictors, and some smaller studies have reported predictors, but these may be underpowered. Prognostic factors that have been described include:

          16

         Desire for future pregnancy – Myomectomy has been the standard approach for patients with symptomatic fibroids who wish to conceive. When UAE was introduced as a treatment for fibroids, a desire for future pregnancy was considered an absolute contraindication because there was concern that poor uterine perfusion following UAE would negatively impact fertility and result in obstetric complications or adverse fetal effects. There are some reassuring data from patients who have undergone UAE and then become pregnant. High-quality comparative studies are limited and mostly underpowered. (See
         <a class="local">

         We suggest
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         performing UAE in patients who desire future pregnancy. However, UAE may be reasonable in patients with severe anemia or symptoms associated with fibroids, those who have failed conservative measure and have contraindications to surgery, or those who consent to UAE within an approved research protocol. Patients should receive counseling about the potential risks of UAE to a future pregnancy.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that the effect of UAE on pregnancy remains understudied but makes no recommendation of whether desire for a future pregnancy is a contraindication [

         Postmenopausal status – The procedure is indicated primarily for premenopausal patients since fibroids tend to decrease in size and symptoms improve or resolve after menopause. An enlarging uterus after menopause should raise the suspicion of a malignancy and careful follow-up is warranted.

         Location – Previously, subserosal pedunculated fibroids with a narrow stalk (stalk &lt;50 percent in diameter in comparison with the largest diameter fibroid) were considered a relative contraindication because these fibroids may detach intraperitoneally and be associated with sterile peritonitis [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. However, these is no strong evidence that such fibroids cannot be treated with UAE, though it may be preferred to avoid UAE when only a pedunculated subserosal fibroid is present. In a meta-analysis of 11 observational studies including patients with pedunculated subserosal fibroids undergoing UAE, the risk of complication was low (1.7 percent) and the majority of such complications were classified as mild [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. Moderate (eg, torsion of the fibroid or persistent bleeding requiring surgery) and severe complications (eg, fibroid necrosis resulting in bowel obstruction) occurred in three patients. Volume reduction and satisfaction rates are similar to those that were non-pedunculated.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Similarly, submucosal fibroids treated with UAE may detach and be expelled vaginally through either bulk expulsion (losing the entire fibroid vaginally) or through sloughing (vaginal discharge until the fibroid has dissolved). Incidence is typically reported as 5 to 15 percent [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. Even though not an absolute contraindication, patients with fibroids that protrude into the uterine cavity should be carefully counseled regarding the possibility of expulsion.

         Size or number of fibroids – The volume of necrosis after UAE in a large fibroid uterus can be substantial with a proportionate level of postprocedural pain and risk of infection. However, no clear threshold for the size of the uterus or size or number of fibroids has been established as a contraindication. The only study to address this question was a case series of patients with a dominant fibroid of &gt;10 cm and/or a uterine volume of &gt;700 cm that found no increase in the risk of serious complications [

         The patient should be asked regarding fibroid-related symptoms (eg, heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, bulk-related symptoms). A medical history should be taken, including an obstetrics and gynecology history and medical and surgical history relevant to the procedure. Patients should be asked about the impact of symptoms on quality of life and what their goals and expectations for the procedure are. They should be asked whether they are planning a future pregnancy.

         The first-line imaging study to evaluate for uterine fibroids is pelvic ultrasound.
        </p>
        <p>
         Many protocols include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before UAE in order to properly determine size and location and ensure that the uterine masses are consistent with uterine fibroids. In our view, in many cases, an MRI is not necessary if ultrasound provides a clear diagnosis and can identify fibroid location according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics classification system  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91085" href="/z/d/graphic/91085.html" rel="external">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         MRI is superior in cases of large uteri where the whole uterus cannot be visualized with ultrasound. We order an MRI prior to UAE when the uterus is too large to evaluate reliably by ultrasound or an experienced pelvic sonologist is not available [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27,28
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, there is some evidence that an MRI before UAE may decrease procedure time. And also, an MRI might be used to assess for ovarian arterial flow and thus stratify those at highest risk for ovarian insufficiency [

         While pelvic imaging can characterize a lesion as likely to be a benign fibroid, imaging generally cannot exclude occult malignancy, such as leiomyosarcoma, within a fibroid.

         giving prophylactic antibiotics to prevent surgical site infection.

         There are no standard guidelines on prophylactic antibiotics for UAE. Policy on prophylactic antibiotics varies among clinics and in publications on UAE. This issue has not been evaluated in randomized trials.

          10

Also, submucosal fibroids may be more likely to become infected, due to exposure to ascending infection in the uterine cavity; however, this is a theoretical concern and has not been investigated.
        </p>
        <p>
         Given the lack of evidence and the low risk of infection, routine preoperative prophylactic antibiotics are not required. The exception to this may be in patients with large submucosal fibroids, but this issue requires further study.

         UAE is performed under local anesthesia (sometimes combined with epidural anesthesia or patient-controlled anesthesia for postoperative pain relief). Local anesthesia is injected at the planned puncture site in the groin. Sedation can be given if the patient wishes.

         The most commonly used embolic agents for UAE are nonspherical polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)  (

         ), spherical PVA, acrylamido PVA, tris-acryl gelatin microspheres, and polyzene-F hydrogel microspheres. No clear distinction in treatment efficacy can be made between the embolic materials. Most large randomized trials of UAE used mainly polyvinyl alcohol particles, but other materials were used in other studies [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4,38
         </a>
         ]. A systematic review including five randomized trials and five observational comparative studies did not find one material to be associated with superior clinical outcomes (eg, fibroid devascularization, uterine and dominant fibroid volume reduction) [

          39-41
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The embolic material is injected and is carried by the arterial blood flow to the vessels feeding the fibroid. These vessels are preferentially occluded, since they are larger and have a higher flow than myometrial branches that do not perfuse vascular lesions like fibroids. The procedure is terminated when the fibroid blood supply is occluded but there is still sluggish flow in the uterine artery.

        </p>
        <p>
         The most serious potential complications are introduction of embolic agents into inadvertent vessels, necrosis of the gluteus maximus or limb, or pulmonary embolism. Mortality after UAE is very rare, but there are several published case reports [

         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. Pain is due to necrosis of tissue and seems to be associated with fibroid volume and is usually most severe during the first 24 hours. Pain during the first 24 hours can be managed with patient-controlled analgesia, this can then be transitioned to oral pain medications, usually nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. In a small randomized controlled trial,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">
          dexamethasone

         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. Future studies are required to validate these findings.
        </p>
        <p>
         If severe pain persists, readmission for pain control may be necessary (up to 9 percent of cases) [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. A recurrence of severe pain after a period of milder pain may indicate fibroid expulsion and warrants evaluation. UAE results in more readmissions than hysterectomy or myomectomy. In a meta-analysis of seven randomized trials, UAE compared with hysterectomy resulted in a significantly higher rate of unscheduled visits or readmissions within six weeks (odds ratio [OR] 2.79, 95% CI 1.41-5.49, one trial, 157 subjects [
         <a href="#rid46">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Another complication that is also relatively common (16 to 20 percent) is vaginal discharge [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. This can last for months and is usually self-limiting, provided that the discharge is not purulent and fever is absent.
        </p>
        <p>
         If patients present with purulent vaginal discharge after UAE in combination with fever, they should be evaluated for pelvic or systemic infection with vital signs, physical examination, a white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, culture of vaginal or cervical discharge, and pelvic ultrasound [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. Ultrasound can show a prolapsing fibroid or evidence of pelvic inflammatory disease. Magnetic resonance imaging is used in rare cases where ultrasound findings are inconclusive. Blood cultures should be ordered if systemic infection is suspected, but we have rarely seen a patient with positive blood cultures after UAE.
        </p>
        <p>
         If examination or laboratory testing is consistent with infection, we treat with antibiotics. Endometrial infection occurs in 0.5 percent of cases (mostly with submucosal fibroids) [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. The antibiotic treatment regimen is the same as in pelvic inflammatory disease (see

        </p>
        <p>
         Persistent vaginal discharge combined with abdominal tenderness or pain, but without fever, may be due to a submucosal intracavity necrotic fibroid being expelled through the cervix into the vagina. Vaginal expulsion of a fibroid (or fibroid tissue) is a relatively common phenomenon, and in general it can be managed expectantly, but sometimes it is necessary to perform a hysteroscopy to remove the fibroid [

         Ovarian insufficiency following UAE occurs more frequently in patients older than 45 years, and patients may develop menopausal symptoms and/or amenorrhea. Arterial flow to the ovary is likely to be transiently occluded during UAE but may be re-established in the longer term.

         We see patients for a follow-up visit several weeks after UAE. Patients are counseled about the signs and symptoms of minor and major complications. In case of pain that does not respond to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, fever, or foul-smelling vaginal discharge, the patient is advised to contact the clinician for evaluation for complications [

         Follow-up imaging studies are not done routinely but performed as needed based on persistent or recurrent symptoms or concern about complications. Decisions regarding reintervention are made based upon symptoms (eg, good response in terms of volume reduction but unchanged heavy menstrual bleeding might result in reintervention, whereas the opposite situation might not).

At five years, 83 percent of patients in the UAE group reported no menorrhagia or great or moderate improvement. The subsequent cumulative hysterectomy rate was 24 percent at two years, 28 percent at five years, and 35 percent at 10 years.

         UAE is the best studied minimally invasive treatment option for fibroids. Other minimally invasive treatments have emerged over the last few years with positive outcomes in case series and cohorts. There are few comparative studies, but some are starting to emerge in the literature [
         <a href="#rid59">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A meta-analysis of uterus-sparing options for fibroids included 85 studies (8 were randomized trials; 14 studies compared between different procedures) with over 17,000 participants [
         <a href="#rid60">
          60
         </a>
         ]. The risk of reintervention after 60 months of follow-up for each method was: UAE (14.4 percent), high intensity focused ultrasound (using localization with magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or ultrasound; 53.9 percent), myomectomy (12.2 percent), and hysteroscopy (7 percent). All methods were associated in improved quality of life, but high intensity focused ultrasound showed the lowest degree of improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
         A systematic review evaluating UAE, MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS), and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) included 81 observational studies; only one study directly compared two modalities [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59,61
         </a>
         ]. Pooled data for each modality showed the following mean fibroid volume reduction at 12 months: UAE (66 percent), MRgFUS (28 percent), and RFA (75 percent).
        </p>
        <p>
         UAE was compared with MRgFUS in the Fibroid Interventions: Reducing Symptoms Today and Tomorrow study (FIRSTT); the study combined analysis of randomized trial data in 57 patients and observational data in 34 (participants who refused randomization) [
         <a href="#rid62">
          62
         </a>
         ]. MRgFUS compared with UAE resulted in a higher rate of reintervention for symptomatic fibroids (30 versus 12.5 percent) within three years. Reintervention was more likely when treatments occurred at younger ages and in patients with higher pretreatment anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) levels. AMH levels at 24 months were lower in the UAE group. Both treatment arms improved in quality of life scores and pain, although the effect was larger in the UAE group. The decrease in AMH levels reconfirms our caution regarding use of UAE in patients who desire future fertility.
        </p>
        <p>
         Observational studies that directly compared UAE with MRgFUS have also found a lower reintervention rate with UAE, consistent with the FIRSTT study [

         <a href="#rid67">
          67,68
         </a>
         ]. In one randomized trial (n = 69), satisfaction with menstrual blood loss was comparable between the two treatments but tended to remain improved more than 12 months after UAE [
         <a href="#rid67">
          67
         </a>
         ]. Another trial (n = 66) compared UAE with uterine artery occlusion and found that UAE was superior in terms of recurrence rate (48 versus 17 percent) and volume reduction (51 versus 33 percent) after 48 months of follow-up [

UAE and control pregnancies showed similar rates of preterm birth (14 versus 16 percent, respectively) and intrauterine growth restriction; however, the study lacked sufficient statistical power to detect a difference in these outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Higher rates of preterm birth have been described. In a retrospective study including 109 patients with a live birth after UAE, preterm birth occurred in 23 patients (32 percent); the average age at birth for those delivering preterm was 35 (±2.8) weeks gestation [

          Definition
         </strong>
         – Uterine artery embolization (UAE) is a minimally invasive treatment for uterine fibroids (leiomyomas). The procedure is a percutaneous angiographic procedure performed with video fluoroscopic imaging with injection of embolic agents into the uterine artery  (

          Candidates
         </strong>
         – Ideal candidates for UAE include patients with heavy menstrual bleeding or dysmenorrhea caused by intramural fibroids, who are premenopausal, and who have no desire for future pregnancy. If pelvic pain/pressure or bulk-related symptoms are the only symptom, efficacy of UAE is questionable. (See

         – We suggest
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         performing UAE in patients who desire future pregnancy (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_3" rel="external">
          Grade 1C
         </a>
         ). However, UAE may be reasonable in patients with severe anemia or symptoms associated with fibroids, those who have failed conservative measure and have contraindications to surgery, or those who consent to UAE within an approved research protocol. Patients should be counseled about the potential risks of UAE to a future pregnancy. (See

          Pedunculated fibroids
         </strong>
         – Subserosal or submucosal fibroids that are pedunculated and have a narrow stalk (stalk &lt;50 percent in diameter in comparison with the largest diameter fibroid) are considered a relative contraindication to UAE. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Large fibroids
         </strong>
         – The volume of necrosis after UAE in a large fibroid uterus can be substantial with a proportionate level of postprocedural pain. However, no clear threshold for the size of the uterus or size or number of fibroids has been established as a contraindication. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Imaging
         </strong>
         – The first-line imaging study to evaluate for uterine fibroids is pelvic ultrasound. Many protocols include magnetic resonance imaging before UAE in order to properly determine size and location and ensure that the uterine masses are consistent with uterine fibroids. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Efficacy
         </strong>
         – Most patients (73 to 90 percent) report improvement or disappearance of heavy menstrual bleeding symptoms up to ten years after treatment. Lower abdominal pain or dysmenorrhea shows an improvement in up to 80 percent of patients. Approximately 28 percent of patients undergo hysterectomy within five years after UAE. (See

         <strong>
          Complications
         </strong>
         – Common complications of UAE include pelvic pain, fever, and vaginal discharge, but these are self-limiting in most patients. Some patients may develop ovarian insufficiency. The most serious potential complications are introduction of embolic agents into inadvertent vessels, necrosis of the gluteus maximus or limb, or pulmonary embolism. (See
