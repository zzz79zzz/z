         The vasculitides are defined by the presence of inflammatory leukocytes in vessel walls with reactive damage to mural structures. Both loss of vessel integrity leading to bleeding, and compromise of the lumen may result in downstream tissue ischemia and necrosis. In general, affected vessels vary in size, type, and location in association with the specific type of vasculitis. Vasculitis may occur as a primary process or may be secondary to another underlying disease. The exact pathogenetic mechanisms underlying these diseases are unknown.
        </p>
        <p>
         The vasculitides are often serious and sometimes fatal diseases that require prompt recognition and therapy. Symptomatic involvement generally reflects and follows the pattern of affected organs. The distribution of affected organs may suggest a particular type of vasculitis.

         This topic will review the nomenclature of the different vasculitides and provide an overview of the approach to the patient with suspected vasculitis. An overview of the treatment of these disorders and detailed discussions of the individual disorders are presented separately. (See

         The disease names and definitions of the vasculitides continue to evolve as our understanding of the pathogenesis advances. The international Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) has developed one of the most widely used nomenclature systems which specifies the names and definitions for most forms of vasculitis [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. The CHCC nomenclature system has changed over the past few decades, and definitions that were put forth by the CHCC in 1994 have since been revised in the 2012 CHCC  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90188" href="/z/d/graphic/90188.html" rel="external">
          table 1

          table 2

         ) with a specific addendum issued to cover the many forms of vasculitis of the skin [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Among the notable changes in the 2012 CHCC was the preferential use and adoption of new names for several diseases, consistent with the trend of replacing eponyms with disease names that reflect an increased pathophysiologic understanding of these conditions. Among the name changes are: eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, abbreviated EGPA, in place of Churg-Strauss syndrome; granulomatosis with polyangiitis, abbreviated GPA, in place of Wegener's granulomatosis; immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein), abbreviated as IgAV, in place of Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP); anti-C1q vasculitis as an alternative name for hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis, abbreviated HUV; and use of the term "cryoglobulinemic vasculitis" in place of "essential cryoglobulinemic vasculitis." Furthermore, the 2012 CHCC formally adopted the term antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) for the group of three disorders that include microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), GPA, and EGPA, with additional categories also named to describe variable-vessel vasculitis and secondary forms of vasculitis. This nomenclature system is not meant to substitute for classification criteria, which include clinical observations that classify a specific patient into a category for research purposes. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Classification criteria'

         Classification of the noninfectious vasculitides is primarily based upon the predominant size of the vessels involved  (

          figure 1
         </a>
         ), although there may be some overlap in the size of arteries involved with all these diseases. Thus, large-vessel vasculitis, as its name suggests, mostly affects large arteries. The same principle is true for the medium- and small-vessel vasculitides in which medium-vessel vasculitis predominantly affects medium arteries and small-vessel vasculitis predominantly affects small arteries and capillaries. The Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) also recognizes that some forms of vasculitis do not involve a single predominant size of vessel (variable-vessel vasculitis).

         Giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis, predominantly affects the aorta and/or its major branches, with a predilection for the branches of the carotid including the superficial temporal artery. The onset of disease usually occurs in patients older than 50, with markedly increased incidence in the eighth and ninth decades of life. (See

         Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a necrotizing vasculitis that does not substantially involve the deposition of immune complexes. AAV predominantly affects small vessels and is associated with ANCA specific for myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA) or proteinase 3 (PR3-ANCA). Cases of ANCA-negative AAV do occur, especially in eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) but also to some extent in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). ANCA-negative AAV describes cases in which the patient otherwise fulfills the definition for AAV but has negative results on serologic testing for ANCA. (See

         The major clinicopathologic variants of AAV include microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), GPA, and EGPA; additionally, AAV can occur in only a single organ, especially a subset referred to as renal-limited AAV.

         MPA is a necrotizing vasculitis that primarily affects capillaries, venules, or arterioles, most commonly manifesting as necrotizing glomerulonephritis and/or pulmonary capillaritis. Involvement of medium- and small- sized arteries may also be present. Granulomatous inflammation is usually absent. ANCA is present in &gt;90 percent of patients with MPA. (See

         GPA is a necrotizing vasculitis predominantly involving small- to medium-sized vessels (eg, capillaries, venules, arterioles, arteries, and veins). It typically produces granulomatous inflammation of the upper and lower respiratory tracts as well as necrotizing, pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. ANCA is present in &gt;80 percent of patients with GPA. (See

        <p>
         While MPA and GPA continue be regarded as distinct entities within AAV, they have markedly overlapping manifestations and it can be sometimes extremely difficult to differentiate between these two diseases within a patient. Furthermore, there is a growing recognition that ANCA type (anti-MPO or anti-PR3) has more prognostic and clinical meaning rather than the disease type (MPA or GPA), leading some experts to refer to MPO-AAV or PR3-AAV, and many clinical trials in AAV now stratify enrollment by ANCA type (MPO or PR3) and report results for each subgroup.

         Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, previously termed essential cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, is characterized by the presence of cryoglobulins, which are serum proteins that precipitate in the cold and dissolve upon rewarming. In this disorder, which is most often due to hepatitis C virus infection, cryoglobulin immune complexes are deposited in the walls of capillaries, venules, or arterioles, thereby resulting in inflammation in small vessels. Skin, glomeruli, and peripheral nerves are often involved. (See

         The classification of the vasculitides has been a challenging problem for decades [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. In 1990, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) proposed criteria for several types of vasculitis [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-12
         </a>
         ]. These criteria have been widely applied to and are quite useful for clinical research. However, while the criteria can be used to help inform the diagnosis, they lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used as diagnostic criteria [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2022, the ACR and European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR; formerly known as European League Against Rheumatism) published a set of new validated classification criteria for the three types of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (granulomatosis with polyangiitis [GPA], microscopic polyangiitis [MPA], and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [EGPA]) as well as two types of large-vessel vasculitis (giant cell arteritis [GCA] and Takayasu arteritis [TAK]) [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14-23
         </a>
         ]. There were no prior criteria for MPA. Compared with the 1990 criteria, the 2022 ACR/EULAR classification criteria were developed using more sophisticated analytic methods, data from thousands of patients from many regions of the world, and incorporation of testing not available or routinely used in 1990 (eg, ANCA or magnetic resonance (MR)/computed tomography (CT) angiography). The 2022 criteria sets each use weighted parameters for clinical, laboratory, imaging, and biopsy features that are combined to derive a score.
        </p>
        <p>
         The new classification criteria for the vasculitides are not intended for use as diagnostic criteria but are intended to delineate the type of vasculitis in a patient with an established diagnosis of vasculitis. The use of the criteria for making a diagnosis of vasculitis runs the risk of misdiagnosis.

         The European Medicines Agency (EMA) developed an algorithm that was designed to help classify the ANCA-associated vasculitides as well as polyarteritis nodosa for epidemiologic studies, but this also has its limitations [
         <a href="#rid24">

         Although the ACR/EULAR criteria, the EMA algorithm, and the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) nomenclature system have each been used by clinical researchers and clinicians to help diagnose patients, each approach has limitations, and accurate diagnostic criteria for each of the vasculitides have yet to be developed.

         It is not possible to outline a single algorithm for evaluating patients suspected of having any one of the vasculitides because of the clinical heterogeneity of these diseases. Nevertheless, there are some elements of the medical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation that may be helpful when trying to identify a patient suspected of having a vasculitis. While each form of vasculitis is rare, the potential for severe organ damage or death from these diseases means it is appropriate to consider the possibility early in the evaluation of patients with any possible manifestations of vasculitis.
        </p>
        <p>
         In general, the presence of vasculitis should be considered in patients who present with systemic or constitutional symptoms in combination with evidence of single and/or multiorgan dysfunction, and especially with some key manifestations as outlined below. The diagnosis of vasculitis is often delayed because the clinical manifestations can be mimicked by a number of other diseases.
        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis of the individual vasculitides is generally based on patterns of organ injury, the size of the vessels affected, histopathologic features, and characteristic findings on diagnostic imaging. Refer to separate topic reviews for each of the individual vasculitides for a more detailed diagnostic approach once a specific type of vasculitis is suspected.

         Although neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of vasculitis, systemic symptoms such as fever, fatigue, weight loss, and arthralgias are often present in patients with vasculitis. A history of eye inflammation, particularly scleritis, are features sometimes observed in vasculitis. Persistent nasal crusting, epistaxis, or other upper airway disease is suggestive of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). The presence of acute foot drop or wrist drop may be due to a motor neuropathy from an ischemic process. Limb claudication, especially in the upper extremities or in a person at low risk for atherosclerosis, is suggestive of a large arterial occlusion from Takayasu arteritis (TAK) or giant cell arteritis (GCA).
        </p>
        <p>
         Unexplained hemoptysis should always raise concern for alveolar hemorrhage and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV). Similarly, any patients with suspected glomerulonephritis must be evaluated for possible vasculitis, especially AAV or anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease. The combination of lung hemorrhage and renal insufficiency (often referred to as "pulmonary-renal syndrome") should immediately raise concern for vasculitis [
         <a href="#rid25">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A detailed history is also important to assess whether the patient has recently (up to at least some time in the prior 6 to 12 months) been exposed to specific medications or cocaine which may be associated with drug-induced vasculitis, has a history of hepatitis, or has been diagnosed with any disorder known to be associated with a vasculitis (such as systemic lupus erythematosus).

Certain findings, such as diminished sensation to touch and motor weakness of the extremities due to neuropathic changes consistent with mononeuritis multiplex and palpable purpura  (

         Some laboratory tests may help identify the type of vasculitis, the degree of organ involvement, or identify another disease.

There is increasing adoption of using ultrasound to detect possible giant cell arteritis, especially in countries and centers with the experience and expertise to conduct ultrasound of the temporal arteries. PET is sometimes useful in identifying potential inflammatory disease in the aorta and its branches. However, while more invasive imaging studies generally can be avoided, conventional catheter-based angiography remains an important diagnostic test in some situations. It is important to realize that no angiographic abnormalities are themselves pathognomonic for vasculitis, but they can be used to support a diagnosis when combined with other clinical data. Angiograms of mesenteric or renal arteries in polyarteritis nodosa may show aneurysms, occlusions, and vascular wall irregularities  (

         ). By contrast, angiography is unlikely to be helpful in assessing a small-vessel vasculitis because the affected vessels are below the resolution of usual angiograms.

         Patients with nonvasculitic disease processes may present with symptoms and findings that closely mimic various vasculitides. Perhaps most common are systemic rheumatic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, atherosclerotic disease, drug reactions, and vaso-occlusive processes. Among the most important diseases to exclude are infections and malignancies, since the immunosuppressive therapy could worsen these conditions and a delay in diagnosis can be extremely dangerous. While it is beyond the scope of this review to provide a comprehensive list of all possible alternative diagnoses, we present several categories of mimics of vasculitis in a table  (

          General principles
         </strong>
         – The vasculitides are defined by the presence of inflammatory leukocytes in vessel walls with reactive damage to mural structures. Both loss of vessel integrity leading to bleeding, and compromise of the lumen may result in downstream tissue ischemia and necrosis. In general, affected vessels vary in size, type, and location in association with the specific type of vasculitis. Vasculitis may occur as a primary process or may be secondary to another underlying disease. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Nomenclature
         </strong>
         – The international Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) has developed one of the most widely used nomenclature systems, which specifies the names and definitions for most forms of vasculitis  (

          Major categories of vasculitis
         </strong>
         – Classification of the noninfectious vasculitides is primarily based upon the predominant size of the vessels involved  (

          figure 1
         </a>
         ), although some overlap in the size of arteries involved occurs among the major size-based categories. There are also some forms of vasculitis that do not involve a single predominant size of vessel (variable-vessel vasculitis) (see

          'Major categories of vasculitis'

          Classification criteria
         </strong>
         – The 2022 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) classification criteria for vasculitides offers fully revised criteria and will become the new standard for clinical research. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) classification system is also used. The CHCC nomenclature system is also a widely referenced naming system for vasculitides.

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Although each of these systems may inform clinicians about the diagnosis of vasculitis, they all lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used as diagnostic criteria. (See

         <strong>
          Clinical features suggestive of vasculitis
         </strong>
         – In general, the presence of vasculitis should be considered in patients who present with systemic or constitutional symptoms in combination with evidence of single and/or multiorgan dysfunction. The diagnosis of the individual vasculitides is generally based on patterns of organ injury, the size of the vessels affected, histopathologic features, and characteristic findings on diagnostic imaging.

         <strong>
          Diagnostic evaluation
         </strong>
         – Diagnostic evaluation for a case of possible vasculitis should include a detailed history, including drug use, infectious disease exposure, and symptoms of manifestations that may characterize or exclude a suspected diagnoses; a careful physical examination to identify potential sites of involvement of vasculitis and determine the extent of vascular lesions; general laboratory testing to help identify the degree of organ involvement and exclude another disease; additional laboratory testing, depending on the suspected diagnosis and findings, such as tests for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), complement levels, ANCA; a chest radiograph or high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest; electromyography; a lumbar puncture; a biopsy of the involved tissue if possible; and vascular imaging.
