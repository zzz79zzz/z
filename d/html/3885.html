         The evaluation of illness in returned travelers should focus on the possible infections given the patient's clinical findings, travel geography, administration (if any) of vaccinations and malaria chemoprophylaxis, the nature and timeframe of potential exposure(s), and the incubation period(s) of the relevant possible infections  (

         Good resources that provide current information about the infections that occur in various geographic areas are essential [

          2-4

          Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome
         </strong>
         - Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging viral infection transmitted by ticks in central and eastern China, western Japan, and rural areas of South Korea. The illness begins with a nonspecific prodrome, including fever, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, vomiting, and diarrhea, that persists for about a week. Thereafter, patients may develop mucosal hemorrhage, hemorrhagic rash, altered mental status, and multiorgan failure. Laboratory findings include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Diagnosis is based on serum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or serology.

         (rare) - Schistosomiasis due to
         <em>
          Schistosoma japonicum
         </em>
         is endemic in parts of rural China. Transmission occurs via contact with fresh water where snails are intermediate hosts. Human skin is penetrated by cercariae released from the snail; these become schistosomulae and migrate to the liver where they mature into adult worms, which then migrate (against portal blood flow) to the mesenteric venules of the intestine. Clinical manifestations include intestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, anorexia, diarrhea) and hepatosplenic disease due to inflammation around trapped eggs in the presinusoidal periportal spaces of the liver; chronic infection leads to portal vein occlusion and portal hypertension with splenomegaly. Among returned travelers, serology is the most sensitive and useful test for screening. Among individuals living in endemic areas, stool should be obtained for egg microscopy and antigen detection.

          Liver flukes

         (rare) – Fascioliasis is endemic in sheep-rearing areas of temperate climates, including Central and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Fascioliasis is transmitted by ingestion of watercress; the incubation period is 6 to 12 weeks. Clinical manifestations include fever, right upper quadrant pain, and eosinophilia. The diagnosis of liver fluke infection is established by identifying eggs in stool, duodenal aspirates, or bile specimens. (See

The illness is characterized by fever, anorexia, abdominal pain, myalgia, arthralgia, malaise, and urticaria. Late in the course of infection, symptoms can occur due to chronic mechanical injury and bile duct obstruction by adult flukes; these include fatigue, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, weight loss, dyspepsia, and diarrhea. Severe disease can result in obstructive jaundice, pancreatitis, recurrent cholangitis, and pyogenic liver abscesses.

          Fasciolopsiasis
         </strong>
         (rare) - Fasciolopsiasis (giant intestinal fluke) infection is common in Southeast Asia and the Far East. Transmission to humans is typically associated with ingestion of contaminated water or plants, particularly bamboo shoots, watercress, or water chestnuts. Fasciolopsiasis is usually asymptomatic. When symptoms do occur, it is usually in the setting of heavy infection and the onset is typically 30 to 60 days after exposure. Symptoms are due to inflammation, ulceration, and microabscesses that can develop where the flukes attach to the intestine. Anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and signs of malabsorption can occur. The diagnosis is established by demonstrating either adult worms or eggs in the stool or other fluids.

         Paragonimiasis (lung fluke) can be acquired in most countries of the region. Transmission is via consumption of raw or undercooked crab or crayfish. Between initial infection and first egg production (about two months), fever, malaise, diarrhea, epigastric pain, and/or urticaria may occur. As larvae penetrate the diaphragm and migrate within the pleural cavity, pleuritic chest pain may develop; additional symptoms may include dyspnea, cough, and malaise. During the second phase of infection when mature flukes inhabit the lungs, worms induce inflammation and fibrosis; recurrent hemoptysis is the most common symptom. During late infection the diagnosis can usually be confirmed by identifying Paragonimus eggs in the sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage. (See

          Rabies
         </strong>
         (rare) – Rabies is transmitted by animal bite (dogs, bats, and other animals) and is distributed worldwide. The average incubation period is one to three months. Forms of rabies include encephalitic rabies (referred to as "furious rabies" in animals) or paralytic rabies (referred to as "dumb rabies" in animals). Encephalitic rabies is more common (80 percent of cases) and is characterized by fever, hydrophobia, pharyngeal spasms, and hyperactivity, whereas paralytic rabies is characterized by flaccid paralysis. The diagnosis can be made by virus-specific immunofluorescent staining of skin biopsy specimens, isolation of virus from the saliva, or detection of antirabies antibodies in serum or CSF. (See

         The differential diagnosis of fever with neurologic symptoms also includes etiologies unrelated to travel such as meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess, and subdural empyema. Travelers with onset of neurologic and/or gastrointestinal symptoms following ingestion of seafood should also be considered for ciguatera fish poisoning and shellfish poisoning. (See

          High-altitude disease
         </strong>
         – There are large high-altitude areas within the East Asian region, especially in western China (including the Tibetan plateau) and Mongolia. Altitude illness is a high risk for travelers to these regions, especially those who ascend rapidly via motorized transport. High-altitude areas also exist in Japan and Taiwan. Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is diagnosed clinically in a person who lives at low altitude but has recently ascended to high altitude (generally over 2000 m). Symptoms include headache, fatigue, lightheadedness, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, disturbed sleep, and mild shortness of breath with exertion. Onset of AMS is usually delayed for 6 to 12 hours following arrival at high altitude but can occur as rapidly as 1 to 2 hours or as late as 24 hours. (See
