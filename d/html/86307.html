         Palliative care is an interdisciplinary medical specialty that focuses on preventing and relieving suffering and on supporting the best possible quality of life for patients facing serious illness and their families. The primary tenets of palliative care are symptom management; establishing goals of care that are in keeping with the patient’s values and preferences; consistent and sustained communication between the patient and all those involved in his or her care; psychosocial, spiritual, and practical support both to patients and their family caregivers; and coordination across sites of care. Thus, palliative care aims to relieve suffering in all stages of disease and is not limited to end of life care. Palliative services, including setting patient-centered achievable goals for medical care and aggressive symptom management, should be routinely offered alongside curative and disease-modifying treatments for patients with serious illnesses.
        </p>
        <p>
         Palliative care has been best studied and implemented among patients with cancer, but is also beneficial for patients suffering from chronic lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, and others. The ultimate goal of palliative care is to improve patients’ quality of life and provide support for patients and their families [

         The disease trajectory of chronic lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary fibrosis, is variable and characterized by considerable uncertainty. While patients typically have a phase of gradual decline, the trajectory can change abruptly due to exacerbations of the underlying lung disease or events caused by a comorbid disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         The disease trajectories for less common lung diseases such as pulmonary hypertension (PH) or lung transplant recipients differ depending on the cause of the disease, co-morbid conditions, response to treatment or surgery.

         <strong>
          COPD
         </strong>
         – Patients with advanced COPD usually experience a gradual but progressive decline in exercise tolerance and development of oxygen dependence that is typically punctuated by acute exacerbations [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Patients with COPD are frequently hospitalized at the end of life, often in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, there is some evidence that over time, fewer patients are dying in acute care hospitals. As an example, one retrospective cohort study examined fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries who died in 2000, 2005, or 2008 with a diagnosis of cancer, COPD, or dementia [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Among the cohort with COPD, between 2000 and 2009, more patients died at home in 2009 than in 2000 (28 versus 24 percent), fewer died in acute care hospitals (32 versus 44 percent) and more patients were under hospice care at the time of their death (39 versus 20 percent).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Every exacerbation of COPD can be life-threatening and is associated with an increased risk of dying. In fact, about 10 percent of patients hospitalized with an acute exacerbation of COPD die during the hospital admission [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. This proportion increases to about one-fourth for patients who need invasive mechanical ventilation because of respiratory failure [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. About one-half of the patients admitted for an exacerbation don’t survive four years after discharge [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/122145.html" rel="external">
          "COPD exacerbations: Prognosis, discharge planning, and prevention", section on 'Prognosis after an exacerbation'

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Importantly, not all patients follow this hypothetical disease trajectory, of a gradual decline with interspersed acute exacerbations. In fact, the progression of COPD is very heterogeneous [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ], and the end of the patient’s life is often unanticipated by their loved ones [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Despite the heterogeneity in clinical course among patients with COPD, certain parameters predict a greater likelihood of death within 12 months: decrease in six-minute walk distance of 50 meters, change toward a very sedentary lifestyle, change toward feeling upset or downhearted, increase in arterial tension of carbon dioxide of &gt;3 mmHg, or decrease in arterial tension of oxygen by &gt;5 mmHg [

         <strong>
          Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
         </strong>
         – Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is usually characterized by a gradual and inexorable decline in respiratory capacity. However, patients may remain stable for a longer period of time or may be confronted with frequent hospital admissions because of acute worsening of respiratory symptoms [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. The median survival for IPF is two to three years, although some patients live much longer [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Most patients experience a subacute worsening over one or more months, while a minority have an acute deterioration less than one month. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113935.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The majority of patients with IPF die in a hospital setting, and in contrast to the data in COPD, there is no evidence that this number has declined over time or that hospice enrollment has increased [
         <a href="#rid12">

          Pulmonary hypertension
         </strong>
         – The clinical course of pulmonary hypertension (PH) is highly variable depending on the type, functional class, and comorbidities. For patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), the median survival without treatment is three years. Data from the Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-term PAH Disease Management (REVEAL registry) reveal one-, three-, five-, and seven-year survival rates of 85, 68, 57, and 49 percent, respectively, from the time of diagnostic right heart catheterization [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. The prognosis of patients with PH related to chronic lung disease, left heart disease, connective tissue disorders, or portal hypertension varies with the prognosis of the underlying disease, severity of the PH, and response to therapy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/121912.html" rel="external">

          Lung transplantation

         Among patients with chronic lung disease, death may be caused by progressive respiratory failure, an acute exacerbation of the lung disease, intercurrent infection, or a comorbid disease.

         A longitudinal study of patients with COPD showed that approximately 58 percent have a respiratory cause of death [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. For patients with severe or very severe COPD, respiratory failure from an acute exacerbation of COPD is the primary cause of death [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. On the other hand, patients with COPD often suffer from multiple comorbidities and a substantial minority (approximately 42 percent) die of non-respiratory diseases [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,17
         </a>
         ]. The most common causes of death for patients with mild or moderate COPD are cancer and cardiovascular disease [

          18

         Among patients with IPF, most deaths are due to progression of IPF rather than comorbid conditions [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. However, coronary artery disease, heart failure, bronchogenic carcinoma, infection, and pulmonary embolism are additional contributors to mortality. (See

         The main cause of death in patients with PAH is right heart failure with circulatory collapse and superimposed respiratory failure. Circulatory collapse can also occur when these patients are placed on mechanical ventilation for ventilatory failure. Patients with PAH who experience cardiac arrest rarely survive. In a retrospective study of more than 3000 patients with PAH who required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), only 6 percent survived for 90 days [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. The cause of death for patients with PH varies depending on the course of the underlying disease. (See

         In the first month after lung transplantation, the leading cause of death is graft failure, a form of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)/diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), which occurs in the early hours to days after transplant. Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), which manifests as bronchiolitis obliterans or restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS), is the leading cause of mortality after the first year. Infectious complications remain a major cause of death at all time points after lung transplantation. (See

         A growing body of evidence supports the effectiveness and positive impact on quality of life and possibly survival of early palliative care consultation for patients diagnosed with advanced malignant diseases, including lung cancer [

         Fewer studies have specifically examined the benefits of early palliative care consultation in patients with nonmalignant chronic lung diseases, although several have included patients with multi-morbidities including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF):

         In one randomized trial that included patients with refractory breathlessness due to a variety of illnesses (COPD, IPF, cancer, heart failure, and motor neuron disease), usual care was compared with initiation of an interdisciplinary breathlessness support service, which included palliative care specialists [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. The interdisciplinary support service delivered an intervention focused on assessing patients’ symptoms and teaching mastery skills to manage dyspnea. Patients assigned to the support service reported a 16 percent improvement in breathlessness mastery as compared to usual care. These findings support early integration of palliative care to improve dyspnea control for patients with advanced lung diseases.

         A review of the impact of outpatient palliative care on outcomes that included studies conducted in patients diagnosed with late-stage COPD, heart failure, and cancer concluded that palliative care services improve patient satisfaction, symptom control, quality of life, and reduced health care utilization [

         A systematic review of 23 studies that were conducted in the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, Italy, Spain, Canada, and Australia and included patients with cancer, heart failure (HF), COPD, HIV/AIDS and multiple sclerosis found that use of expert home palliative care teams more than doubled the odds of dying at home [

          26

         Similarly, several studies suggest benefit of palliative care consultation services for patients with chronic disease. A study of 524 dying patients at five VA medical centers and affiliated nursing homes in 2006 to 2007 showed that those who received inpatient palliative care consultations had significantly better outcomes in five of six domains studied: information and communication, access to home care services, emotional and spiritual support, well-being and dignity, and care around the time of death [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. Several studies also suggest that inpatient palliative care consultations are associated with a reduction in costs of care in the hospital [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28-30
         </a>
         ]. Moreover, a study performed in Australia showed that community-based palliative care can reduce hospital costs for patients with multiple conditions, including COPD [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31

         While hospice and palliative care share the same principles of providing comfort and support for patients, palliative care differs from hospice care. In the United States, the term hospice is used to describe a model of palliative care that is offered to patients with a terminal disease who are at the end of life (generally with an estimated life expectancy of six months or less) when curative or life-prolonging therapy is no longer the focus of treatment. In contrast, palliative care should be appropriately offered to patients at any time along the trajectory of any type of serious life-threatening illness, even concurrent with restorative, life-prolonging therapies. While all care that is delivered by hospice programs can be considered palliative care, not all palliative care is delivered in hospices.
        </p>
        <p>
         Eligibility for hospice care generally requires that a physician estimate that life expectancy is six months or less. Disease-specific criteria for hospice referral for patients with chronic lung disease as well as non-disease specific criteria are outlined in the tables  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61282" href="/z/d/graphic/61282.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         ), and discussed in more detail below.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with a serious, life-threatening illness such as chronic lung disease, palliative care should be offered early in the disease process and should be available throughout the patient’s course if needed to address difficult-to-control symptoms, goals of care, or coordination across sites of care. Palliative care may be delivered in a number of settings across the continuum of health care, including in the home, nursing homes, long-term acute care facilities, acute care hospitals, and outpatient clinics [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         Hospice and Palliative Medicine is now recognized as a medical subspecialty by the American Board of Medical Specialties, as well as in Canada, England, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. Many other European countries are also in the process of developing certification for palliative care. In most jurisdictions, palliative care is provided by an interprofessional team [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ] of specially trained physicians, nurses, social workers, chaplains, and other specialists with advanced training in palliative care who work with a patient’s other clinicians to provide an "extra layer" of support. Clinicians who are specifically trained in palliative care can provide in-depth pain and symptom management, communication regarding goals of care, and care coordination across settings and over time. Subspecialty palliative care services are most available in high-income countries, as exemplified by the United States. The availability of subspecialty palliative care services in low-income countries is generally quite limited, as only 14 percent of the global population has access to the highest level of provision of palliative care [

         In order for the large number of patients with advanced life-threatening illness to benefit from palliative care it is important that supportive services be provided not only by palliative care specialists but also incorporated into the practices of all clinicians who are caring for persons with serious and complex illness such as chronic lung disease. Some term this "primary" palliative care, to distinguish it from "secondary" or "subspecialty" palliative care [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49
         </a>
         ]. This encompasses any type of supportive care that is delivered by all health care professionals caring for patients with serious life-threatening illness. Optimal palliative care for patients with chronic lung disease should ideally integrate both primary and subspecialty palliative care  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef140026" href="/z/d/graphic/140026.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Several examples of skill sets that are appropriate for primary versus subspecialty palliative care are provided in the table  (

        </p>

         Clinicians caring for these patients need to attain competence in providing comprehensive supportive care. Several palliative care training options are available for clinicians  (

         While physicians caring for patients with chronic lung disease are able to manage most of their patients' palliative care issues, consultation with a palliative care specialist may be beneficial in certain situations. Indications for a formal palliative care consultation have not been established for patients with chronic lung disease. However, criteria for a palliative care assessment at the time of admission to the hospital are available  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76969" href="/z/d/graphic/76969.html" rel="external">
          table 5
         </a>
         ). Other criteria that may apply to outpatients with chronic lung disease are summarized in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef103284" href="/z/d/graphic/103284.html" rel="external">
          table 6
         </a>
         ). Often a combination of indications or patient characteristics may reduce the threshold for consultation with a palliative care specialist.
        </p>
        <p>
         Consideration of disease specific criteria (eg, COPD GOLD stage 4 or a decline in forced vital capacity [FVC] for patients with IPF), in addition to the degree of functional impairment, helps guide clinicians on when to consult specialty palliative care  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef140026" href="/z/d/graphic/140026.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). For clinicians who do not integrate primary palliative care into their practice, an early consult to specialty palliative care may help guide subsequent goals of care discussions.

         It can be helpful to introduce palliative care as "supportive care" and explain that it focuses on symptom management and team communication about the patients’ goals and care wishes. This description helps to address the general lack of understanding about the meaning of palliative care. A study found that patients and caregivers better understood the meaning of supportive care than palliative care, which is often misperceived as end-of-life care [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50
         </a>
         ]. It is important to emphasize that palliative care is often provided in addition to a patient’s current treatment plan. For example, a patient with COPD can receive palliative care and still choose to receive endotracheal intubation, if needed, in the event of an acute exacerbation with respiratory failure.
        </p>
        <p>
         When thinking about the language to use to initiate a conversation about palliative care, it may be helpful to focus on aspects of that particular patient’s symptoms or clinical course, such as progressive dyspnea, an increase in oxygen requirement, decrement in pulmonary function tests, increasing dependence on others, or a recent emergency department visit or hospitalization that may have suggested the need for a goals of care discussion or advance care planning  (

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         It may be beneficial to include family caregivers of patients with advanced lung disease in these discussions as they often need to make specific and urgent treatment decisions about life-sustaining treatment [

          52

         Advance care planning (ACP), defined as "planning for and about preference-sensitive decisions often arising at the end-of-life," is an ongoing process in which patients, their families, and their healthcare providers reflect on the patient’s goals, values, and beliefs, and discuss how they should inform current and future medical care [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53
         </a>
         ]. ACP enables individuals to define goals and preferences for future medical treatment and care, to discuss these goals and preferences with family and health-care providers, and to record and review these preferences if appropriate [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ]. In an ideal ACP discussion, the clinicians, patient, and his or her loved ones think through particular approaches to follow if (or when) the patient’s health declines. This process is iterative and typically occurs longitudinally within the context of an existing and continuing medical relationship [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55
         </a>
         ]. General issues about advance care planning are discussed separately. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Issues related to advance care planning for patients with chronic lung disease include the patient’s diagnosis, the expected disease course, and whether the patient would want life-sustaining treatments (eg, intubation and mechanical ventilation). If the patient would like a trial of mechanical ventilation, parameters for discontinuing mechanical ventilation should be included, which is sometimes called a "time-limited trial" of intensive care [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56
         </a>
         ]. The potential outcomes of intubation/mechanical ventilation should be described to help the patient’s decision-making. While prognostic uncertainty and variable trajectory of illness make communication about these issues difficult [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ], it is important to acknowledge and incorporate this uncertainty into advance care planning. (See

         Advance care planning discussions should begin early in the disease process when the patient is well enough to participate  (

Patients tend to underestimate disease severity and rarely initiate a discussion about palliative care or end-of-life planning [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59
         </a>

         <a href="#rid60">
          60

         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. Preferably, these discussions should occur when the patient is relatively stable, rather than at a time of acute illness. Studies suggest most patients and their families prefer to have these conversations in a stable medical state when they are able to make clear decisions [

         The discussion should be patient-centered, balancing hope with reality with sensitivity. Eliciting information about the patient’s perception of the impact of the disease in their life, disease severity and prognosis will guide the clinician in achieving this balance. Sensitivity to the individual patient’s response to a discussion of these issues is essential due to the broad variation in patient responses. Discussions about prognosis can be especially difficult. Issues related to communication of prognosis in patients with advanced life-threatening illness and practical guidance for discussing prognosis are addressed elsewhere. (See

         Many patients with advanced lung disease fear dyspnea crisis and suffocation. So, it is important for patients to discuss palliative care options for dyspnea and how to manage dyspnea crisis. Reassurance about a clear plan to deal with dyspnea may alleviate unspoken fears. Other relevant palliative care topics are the role of advance directives and surrogate decision-makers, preferences for location of end-of-life care and spiritual beliefs [

         Patients with chronic lung disease are particularly likely to develop respiratory failure in the setting of acute exacerbations or relatively mild intercurrent illnesses. Thus, understanding a patient’s preferences for life-sustaining treatments early in the disease course is particularly relevant. When given the opportunity, patients with chronic lung disease are able to indicate their preferences regarding life-sustaining treatments based on their expected burden of treatment and expected outcome of treatment [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. Thus, it is important to include a discussion of prognosis after resuscitation or mechanical ventilation and potential withdrawal of life support.

          Prognosis after resuscitation or mechanical ventilation
         </strong>
         – Patients with COPD tend to have a poor prognosis for returning home and living independently after in-hospital resuscitation or, to a lesser extent, mechanical ventilation for an exacerbation. A study found that among patients with COPD who received in-hospital resuscitation, only 15 percent of patients survived to hospital discharge and, among survivors, they had a median survival of only five months [
         <a href="#rid67">
          67
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, less than 2 percent were discharged home after the hospitalization and were alive at six months [
         <a href="#rid67">
          67
         </a>
         ]. A retrospective cohort study of 4791 patients with COPD receiving long term oxygen treatment examined the outcomes of patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation for an exacerbation [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. In total, 23 percent of these patients died during the hospital admission, and an additional 45 percent died in the subsequent 12 months. Two-thirds of the patients surviving hospitalization were readmitted at least once in the year following the hospital admission and more than a quarter were discharged to a nursing home or skilled nursing facility.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For patients with IPF, prognosis after mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure is also poor. In one review that included 135 patients, the mortality was 87 percent in the intensive care unit and 94 percent at three months [
         <a href="#rid68">
          68

         <strong>
          Withdrawal of ventilatory support
         </strong>
         – Making an "all-or-nothing" decision about ventilatory support may be difficult in the early stage of an illness. The possibility of a time-limited trial of ventilatory support may allow treatment of a process like pneumonia, which is expected to be curable, but enable clinicians to withdraw ventilatory support if the patient does not improve based on a defined duration of therapy as guided by the patient and/or surrogates. Thus, it is prudent to establish the goals of care and the situations in which mechanical ventilation would be discontinued. Alternatively, patients may agree to noninvasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula, but not intubation with invasive ventilation. (See
         <a class="local">

         Discussing goals of care is an important component of advance care planning, and this starts with exploring what is important to the patient. Exploring what "living well" means to patients can help start this discussion [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71
         </a>
         ]. Some patients feel that living as long as possible is most important even if it means that they have to undergo highly burdensome interventions, such as prolonged mechanical ventilation, that impair their quality of life. Other patients may want to spend their remaining time at home with their loved ones without having to go to the hospital, even if this compromises their survival. The best possible care should support patients to live the rest of their lives according to their informed wishes, which may change over time. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95552.html" rel="external">
          "Discussing goals of care"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Asking about the experience of living with advanced lung disease as well as previous experiences with hospital admissions is important during goals of care and advance care planning discussions [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71
         </a>
         ]. The narrative of these experiences can help the clinician understand the patient’s day-to-day disease burden, and also their expectations, hopes, and fears about their future disease experience. Once the goals have been defined, the clinician may then describe the potential burden of future treatments, possible outcomes, and the likelihood of these outcomes in the context of the patient’s goals. Doing so will greatly facilitate decision-making for specific treatments. Hopefully, such discussion will also lead to a realistic understanding of the limits of therapy and avoidance of requests for treatments that are considered medically inappropriate (previously called "futile" care). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16296.html" rel="external">
          "Ethics in the intensive care unit: Responding to requests for potentially inappropriate therapies in adults"

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Gaining insight to patients’ perspectives on what is important to their quality of life not only serves as the foundation for making decisions about treatments, but can improve patients’ overall satisfaction with clinicians’ communication skills [
         <a href="#rid72">
          72
         </a>
         ]. Thus, it is important to avoid the common mistake of asking patients to make specific treatment choices, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation or mechanical ventilation, prior to ascertaining the patient’s overall values and goals for care. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95552.html" rel="external">
          "Discussing goals of care", section on 'REMAP: A stepwise approach'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Some patients have advanced directives stating their preferences for care that were established long before the terminal stage of the illness. Importantly, preferences for life-sustaining treatments may change during the course of the disease. In one study, more than one-third of the outpatients with COPD changed their preferences regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation and/or invasive mechanical ventilation at least once during one year [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. Preferences are more likely to change when patients with COPD experience a change in health status, mood status, mobility, or marital status [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. (See

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, it is of major importance to stress that a decision to forego life-sustaining treatments doesn’t mean that a patient won’t receive the best possible care to meet their needs and individual goals of care, including optimal management of dyspnea, pain, and other symptoms to alleviate suffering.

         End-of-life care refers to the processes of addressing the medical, social, emotional, and spiritual needs of people who are nearing the end of life.

         An important component of end-of-life care planning is to determine whether the patient and their caregivers would be most comfortable spending their last days to weeks at home or in a hospital setting. For patients with lung disease, the management of dyspnea and hypoxemia at home should be discussed, if the patient’s preferences and goals of care are in keeping with dying at home. Palliative care can be delivered at home; one of the best known models is home hospice care, although hospice care can also be delivered in acute care hospitals, separate hospice centers, and in nursing homes.

         Dyspnea is a central symptom in most advanced lung diseases. As an example, dyspnea is the most frequently reported symptom of patients with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with 94 percent reporting moderate to severe dyspnea and most patients reporting insufficient treatment [
         <a href="#rid75">
          75

        <p>
         Alleviation of dyspnea has many components, including addressing any specific treatable causes of dyspnea (eg, bronchoconstriction, pleural effusion, excess secretions), nonpharmacologic management (eg, relaxation exercises, fan, energy conservation, optimal positioning, supplemental oxygen), and medications (predominantly opioids) [

         For patients with advanced lung disease, pharmacologic management of dyspnea includes optimizing disease-specific treatments, such as bronchodilator therapy for COPD, systemic glucocorticoids for acute exacerbations of COPD, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and other interstitial lung diseases, and also antibiotics for comorbid lung infection or bronchiectasis, unless these interventions are not consistent with the patient’s goals of care  (

         For patients with advanced interstitial lung disease or pulmonary hypertension, hypoxemia may be refractory. As a patient’s oxygen requirement increases, the type of interface (eg, nasal cannula, reservoir, mask), need for humidification, type of portable oxygen, and the capacity of oxygen concentrator may need adjustment.

         Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is the mode of ventilator support of choice for some groups of patients with acute respiratory failure, such as patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD. Use of NIV in patients who have chosen to forego endotracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation has been controversial, but may be appropriate in selected patients [
         <a href="#rid101">
          101-103
         </a>
         ]. (See

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Two international professional society statements have promoted the conceptualization of the use of NIV for patients with chronic lung disease and acute respiratory failure into one of three categories:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">

          ●

         NIV as a palliative measure when patients and families have chosen to forego all life support and receive comfort measures only [
         <a href="#rid101">
          101,102
         </a>
         ]
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Therefore, NIV should only be applied after careful discussion of the goals of care. To help clarify the goals of care, clinicians should consider which of these three categories apply to specific patients. These three categories underscore the need to elicit patient preferences and goals, communicate the rationale for NIV, and outline parameters for success and failure of NIV. Importantly, goals of care may change during the treatment of an episode of acute respiratory failure.
        </p>
        <p>
         Studies suggest that NIV is the treatment of choice for some patients with acute respiratory failure in category 1 (such as acute exacerbations of COPD). For category 2, studies suggest that in some subgroups of patients (such as patients with COPD or heart failure) hospital survival after use of NIV for a patient who has opted to forego endotracheal intubation can be acceptable, in the 50 to 75 percent range [
         <a href="#rid101">
          101,102
         </a>
         ]. For patients with COPD and hypercapnia who have benefitted from NIV during hospitalization for an acute exacerbation of COPD, nocturnal NIV may be used after discharge. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1453.html" rel="external">
          "Nocturnal ventilatory support in COPD"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Data to support the use of NIV in category 3, exclusively as a comfort measure, are limited [
         <a href="#rid101">
          101,102,104,105
         </a>
         ]. However, one randomized trial that included patients with a malignant disease suggests that some patients may benefit with reduced time to control of dyspnea and reduced opioid use [
         <a href="#rid104">
          104
         </a>
         ]. Another smaller trial suggests a similar improvement in dyspnea scores between NIV and high-flow oxygen in patients with dyspnea related to advanced cancer [
         <a href="#rid105">
          105
         </a>
         ]. Despite the limited data, 2017 recommendations from the European Respiratory Society and American Thoracic Society (ERS/ATS) support offering NIV to dyspneic patients for palliation in the setting of terminal cancer or other terminal conditions [
         <a href="#rid103">
          103
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         It is also important to ensure that NIV is applied with monitoring and staff who are experienced with initiating and trouble-shooting NIV. A qualitative study of patients with COPD, caregivers, and health care professionals identified important issues to be considered prior to initiating palliative NIV, such as the effectiveness of NIV in providing symptom relief and improved energy, patients’ and caregivers’ perceptions of the usefulness of NIV to manage dyspnea, burden of therapy and effects on quality of life (eg, discomfort of mask and pressure sores, dryness in mouth, loss of intimacy if bed partner bothered by noise of machine), and socioeconomic issues (eg, greater burden and dependence on caregivers; expense of machine, tubing, replacement masks) [

         Investigators have characterized various aspects of "episodic breathlessness" in patients with advanced cancer and nonmalignant diseases including COPD and heart failure [
         <a href="#rid109">
          109
         </a>
         ]. One hundred and twenty-nine patients described episodes of acute breathlessness as mainly short in duration (lasting &lt;10 minutes); severe, with mean rating of 6.5 on a 0 to 10 modified BORG scale  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63981" href="/z/d/graphic/63981.html" rel="external">

         ); and occurring daily. Another study conducted by the same investigators compared characteristics of episodic breathlessness among 82 patients diagnosed with either COPD or lung cancer [
         <a href="#rid110">
          110
         </a>
         ]. Patients with COPD perceived significantly higher peak severity of dyspnea, compared with patients with lung cancer and the duration of the episodes were longer in the COPD group, by approximately two minutes. The frequency of the dyspnea episodes was similar and often daily in both groups. Collectively, these findings describe acute breathlessness episodes and help guide effective management and coping strategies to improve acute symptom relief.

         Cough, sputum production, and hemoptysis can be bothersome symptoms for patients with advanced lung disease and their caregivers [

          111,112

         ]. If it is consistent with the goals of care, the first step in the management of chronic cough is to determine the etiology, as it is not necessarily due to the primary lung disease. As examples, among patients with interstitial lung disease, cough may be caused by etiologies such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, upper airway cough syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux, or bronchiectasis [
         <a href="#rid113">
          113,114

         Systemic opioids are the most effective treatment for refractory cough. No one agent appears superior. Initial doses in opiate-naïve patients are usually small, such as

         For patients with bronchiectasis, control of purulent sputum production can often be achieved with antimicrobial agents. Depending on the prior antibiotic usage and current sputum cultures, antipseudomonal antibiotics may need to be administered intravenously.

        <p>
         Hemoptysis, even of small amounts, may be extremely frightening for the patient and those who watch. The distress from expectoration of a small amount of blood-flecked sputum may be relieved by reassurance. At the other extreme, if hemoptysis is massive, it may herald a life-ending event, and witnessing what may be exsanguination requires urgent attention to all who are witnesses. Patients with massive hemoptysis should be immediately placed into a position in which the presumed bleeding lung is dependent. The roles of invasive and palliative management of hemoptysis are discussed separately. (See

         <a href="#rid119">
          119

          32,120
         </a>
         ]. Almost half of the outpatients with advanced COPD require help with personal care; family caregivers provide care to over 80 percent of the patients with advanced COPD; professional caregivers also provide in-home support [

         <a href="#rid124">
          124

          122

          125
         </a>

         <a href="#rid121">
          121,126

          121
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, healthcare providers of patients with chronic lung disease should pay attention to caregiver burden and also the positive aspects of family care giving. Many respiratory societies and foundations have recognized this large caregiver burden and have dedicated informational resources and support for family members on their webpages  (

Development of bereavement care as part of palliative care for patients with chronic lung disease and their loved ones may be important to reduce the important consequences of complicated grief for the loved ones as well as for the society.

          Nonmalignant lung diseases frequently requiring palliative care

          Goals of palliative care
         </strong>
         – The primary goal of palliative care is to improve the quality of life for the patient with a serious illness and their family through relief of emotional and physical symptoms. Thus, eligibility is based on the diagnosis of advanced, life-threatening illness requiring management of serious symptoms, social or emotional needs, or a goals-of-care discussion. (See

          'Use and benefits of palliative care'

          Distinguishing palliative care and hospice
         </strong>
         – Palliative care differs from hospice in the United States, where the term "hospice" describes a model of care focused primarily on comfort that is offered only toward the end of life, generally the last one to six months of life. Criteria for hospice eligibility are described in the tables  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61282" href="/z/d/graphic/61282.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         <strong>
          Primary and secondary palliative care
         </strong>
         – Optimal palliative care for patients with chronic lung disease integrates both primary and secondary (subspecialty) palliative care. Basic aspects of primary palliative care can be provided by the patient’s usual clinicians, while secondary palliative care is provided by clinicians with specialty training in palliative care. Individual patients in different stages of their illness require different services depending on their needs and preferences, as well as the palliative care skills of their clinicians. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Advance care planning
         </strong>
         – While patients with serious lung disease typically have a phase of gradual decline, the trajectory can change abruptly. Thus, advance care planning, including patient-clinician communication about end-of-life care, is of major importance for patients and their loved ones. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical course and causes of death'
         </a>
         above and

         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         Topics that are important to address during advance care planning discussions include diagnosis, prognosis, patient’s goals of care, and values and beliefs. Only after discussing these issues, should clinicians discuss treatment preferences. In particular, it is important to avoid the common mistake of asking patients to make specific treatment choices, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation or mechanical ventilation, prior to discussing their values and goals.

          Management of dyspnea
         </strong>
         – Dyspnea is a central symptom in most advanced lung diseases. For patients receiving palliative care who have dyspnea that is refractory to specific therapies for their underlying disease, systemic opioids are the first-line agents. The usual initial dose is sustained-release
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9788" href="/z/d/drug information/9788.html" rel="external">
          morphine
         </a>
         10 mg daily with gradual individual dose titration while monitoring for adverse effects. The use of opioids for dyspnea is not associated with excess mortality. Early integration of palliative care can improve dyspnea mastery for patients with COPD and probably for patients with other chronic lung diseases. (See

         "Dyspnea crisis" is defined as sustained and severe resting breathing discomfort that occurs in patients with advanced, life-limiting illness and often overwhelms the patient and caregivers’ ability to achieve symptom relief. The mnemonic "COMFORT" can be used by caregivers to remember the steps to managing a dyspnea crisis: Call for help; Observe the degree of respiratory difficulty; Medications such as inhaled bronchodilators or

         Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is sometimes used in patients with chronic lung disease to avoid intubation and mechanical ventilation and occasionally used to reduce dyspnea or treat chronic hypercapnia. Defining the goals of care before implementing NIV, either as a life-sustaining treatment or as a palliative measure, is particularly important in the care of patients with chronic lung disease. (See

          Other symptoms
         </strong>
         – The palliative treatment of other respiratory symptoms, such as cough, sputum production, and hemoptysis, and also extrapulmonary symptoms (eg, anxiety and insomnia) can improve the patient’s experience of their illness. (See
