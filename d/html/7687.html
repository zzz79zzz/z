While successful treatment of OSA with positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy or other modalities typically improves sleep quality, a small proportion of patients continue to experience EDS <strong>despite</strong> adequate therapy.</p><p>The evaluation and management of residual excessive sleepiness (RES) in adults with OSA is discussed here. Primary therapy for OSA (eg, PAP, oral appliances, or, occasionally, surgery) is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7695.html" rel="external">"Obstructive sleep apnea: Overview of management in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2839784"><span class="h1">DEFINITION AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>RES in patients with OSA refers to the subjective complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) that is present even when breathing and oxygenation parameters during sleep are normalized by successful OSA therapy. EDS is defined as the inability to maintain wakefulness and alertness during the major waking episodes of the day, with sleep occurring unintentionally or at inappropriate times [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. It can also be defined by inability to perform or master tasks that require vigilance or to stay awake against intention.</p><p>Although the definition of RES is agreed upon, the entity itself is not universally accepted, as some experts feel that the prevalence of EDS in patients with successfully treated OSA simply reflects a prevalent complaint in the general population (ie, a population of patients with a genetic predisposition to excessive sleepiness) [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of RES in patients with adequately treated OSA is likely multifactorial. Sleep fragmentation caused by repeated episodes of pharyngeal collapse and arousal is thought to be the most important mechanism. Additional factors may include abnormal sleep architecture, activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, and chronic inflammation and cytokine production. The degree of nocturnal hypoxia has been inconsistently associated with measures of daytime sleepiness in observational studies [<a href="#rid6">6-10</a>]. Disruption of sleep due to positive airway pressure therapy and associated mouth or mask leaks is also thought to be a cause.</p><p>Experimental studies in animals have suggested that intermittent nocturnal hypoxia may cause irreversible cellular injury in regions of the brain that control sleep wake regulation [<a href="#rid11">11-13</a>], but it is not known whether this is contributory in humans.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H172524467"><span class="h1">PREVALENCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most patients with OSA who are treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or other primary therapies (eg, mandibular advancement device) experience improvement in sleepiness when <strong>adherent</strong> to therapy. However, a minority experience residual sleepiness. The reported prevalence of residual sleepiness in patients adequately treated with CPAP ranges from 6 to 14 percent [<a href="#rid6">6,14</a>], although rates as high as 55 percent have been reported [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The prevalence of residual sleepiness decreases with increasing nightly CPAP use [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. There is no gender predominance.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23994911"><span class="h1">RISK FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Risk factors for residual sleepiness in OSA are poorly studied and not well defined but may include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Severe excessive daytime sleepiness at diagnosis – Several studies have demonstrated residual sleepiness was associated with a higher score on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/13440.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>) and slightly lower apnea hypopnea index (AHI) on presentation [<a href="#rid6">6,10,14</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other possible risk factors include [<a href="#rid6">6,9,14</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Younger age (eg, &lt;55 years, although the threshold is poorly defined)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Lower mean night duration of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) usage</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Side effects from CPAP usage (eg, aerophagia, leaks, facial discomfort)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Select sleep-related parameters (eg, reduced nocturnal sleep latency, periodic limb movement)</p><p></p><p>Baseline severity of OSA does not appear to be a risk factor for residual sleepiness in OSA patients on adequate CPAP therapy. In one large study, patients with moderate OSA at baseline (defined as an AHI between 15 and 30 events per hour) were twice as likely to complain of residual sleepiness than those with severe OSA (AHI &gt;30 events per hour) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. In the same study, body mass index (BMI) and medical comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes were not associated with residual sleepiness.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H172524480"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Before making the diagnosis of RES and considering wake-promoting agents in patients with OSA, the clinician should take steps to do the following  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131568" href="/d/graphic/131568.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Confirm the diagnosis of OSA</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Confirm adherence to the prescribed therapy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Exclude other competing etiologies of excessive sleepiness</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ensure that patients are receiving adequate OSA therapy (eg, positive airway pressure, oral appliances)</p><p></p><p>Treatment with wakefulness-promoting agents should <strong>not</strong> be considered until this evaluation is complete.</p><p>When following up with patients with an OSA diagnosis, we assess for RES at six weeks, three months, and annually [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The optimal timing for investigation of RES is at three to six months while receiving optimal OSA therapy since resolution of sleepiness may continue to improve over a prolonged period while on optimal therapy [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. In some patients, more frequent assessments may be needed to assess their level of sleepiness (eg, patient-initiated contact, weight gain, change to high-risk occupation).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3097586256"><span class="h2">Revisit the diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinical evaluation of residual daytime sleepiness in patients with OSA who are receiving therapy usually starts with ensuring that the diagnosis of OSA is correct. The clinician should reassess for the symptoms of OSA and review diagnostic data from home or in-laboratory tests (ie, polysomnography). A detailed approach to the clinical presentation and diagnosis of OSA is provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7706.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults"</a>.)</p><p>When the diagnosis of OSA is clear, it is imperative that adherence to therapy be assessed. (See <a class="local">'Ensure adherence to treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>We use the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/13440.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>) to assess excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in adults with OSA. In practice, ESS scores ≥10 are generally considered abnormal (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/13440.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>). However, the ESS does not capture all facets of sleepiness and some patients who are sleepy may have a normal ESS score. Alternative questionnaires require further evaluation before they can be routinely used (eg, Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement System Sleep-Related Impairment [PROMIS SRI]) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3951022724"><span class="h2">Ensure adherence to treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All patients with OSA who have EDS despite therapy should be assessed for adherence to their therapy. Most patients with OSA show improvement in daytime sleepiness after successful treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or other primary OSA therapies (eg, mandibular advancement device [MAD]). However, up to 30 percent of patients with OSA do not use their CPAP every night, and among those patients, mean nightly use is less than four hours per night.</p><p>Patients (and their bed partner) should be asked directly regarding frequency and duration of nightly use. In addition, objective measurements of adherence are available through CPAP telemonitoring [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Most newer CPAP devices have data interrogation capability that allows the clinician to determine hours of nightly use and assess other issues that may be contributing to sleepiness such as efficacy of CPAP therapy, airway leak, and insufficient sleep. However, such data is generally unavailable for those wearing oral devices (eg, MAD) such that the clinician may be reliant upon self-reported adherence from the patient; insertable monitoring capability is not typically available [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/97878.html" rel="external">"Downloading data from positive airway pressure devices in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Once the evaluation for adherence is completed, we suggest the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients who are not adherent, there are a variety of interventions that can help promote CPAP use, including troubleshooting device side effects, behavioral therapy, and engagement tools [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. A detailed approach to treating nonadherence is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7702.html" rel="external">"Assessing and managing nonadherence with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for adults with obstructive sleep apnea"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients who are adherent, alternate etiologies for EDS despite therapy should be sought. (See <a class="local">'Exclude alternative etiologies'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H569540544"><span class="h2">Exclude alternative etiologies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with OSA who have residual sleepiness on therapy to which they are adherent should be re-evaluated for additional causes of EDS. This is the most challenging step in the evaluation of residual EDS in patients with OSA receiving therapy. Specifically, clinicians should inquire about common causes of EDS. As an example, clinicians should request that the patients keep a sleep journal to elicit poor sleep habits or insufficient sleep EDS and inquire about EDS that may be due to depression, medication side, effects and other comorbid medical and psychiatric disorders all of which are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef86811" href="/d/graphic/86811.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>In most cases, ruling out other significant causes of EDS is determined by history and examination. Further testing including multiple sleep latency testing and laboratory tests (eg, blood count, thyroid function tests, vitamin D level, testosterone level, iron studies, Epstein-Barr virus antibodies) may be performed depending upon the suspicion for specific etiologies. Some patients may have central hypersomnia, such as idiopathic hypersomnia (IH), as well as OSA, but they should only be diagnosed with IH if their sleepiness clearly preceded the development of OSA. The etiologies and approach to a patient with EDS are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14892.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with excessive daytime sleepiness", section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with a suspected etiology for their residual sleepiness should be investigated for that etiology while patients in whom there is no clear alternate etiology should have the adequacy of their OSA therapy evaluated. (See <a class="local">'Evaluate adequacy of therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1139772716"><span class="h2">Evaluate adequacy of therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinicians should elicit a history of weight gain or medication changes, which can contribute to inadequate therapy. If inadequate therapy is suspected or if the patient is adhering to primary therapy and no alternative causes of EDS have been identified, we typically prefer to repeat in-laboratory polysomnography (with the patient wearing their device) to assess whether the primary OSA therapy (ie, CPAP, oral appliance) is indeed adequate, although using a home sleep apnea test may also be feasible [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Adequate primary therapy is defined as the minimal pressure setting required to resolve all apneas, hypopneas, snoring, and arousals related to these events in all stages of sleep and in all sleep positions [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7694.html" rel="external">"Home sleep apnea testing for obstructive sleep apnea in adults", section on 'Type 3 devices (portable devices)'</a>.)</p><p>For patients deemed to be on inadequate therapy, reasons for persistently abnormal parameters should be sought. These include weight gain, a poorly fitting mandibular device, inadequate CPAP titration leading to residual respiratory events, CPAP mask or mouth leaks, treatment-emergent central sleep apnea, and inadequate sleep duration (eg, &lt;4 hours/night for &gt;5 nights/week [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]). Similarly, while 4hours/night of CPAP usage may be sufficient for insurance coverage, using CPAP for the entire sleep period may be needed to further reduce sleepiness. In addition, while OSA may be adequately treated with CPAP in the sleep laboratory, it may be worse in the home environment due to environmental allergies or use of sedatives or alcohol. Such issues may be suspected when disparate results occur between data derived from the device used at home and data derived from in-laboratory assessment. Titration and optimization of CPAP therapy is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7677.html" rel="external">"Titration of positive airway pressure therapy for adults with obstructive sleep apnea"</a>.)</p><p>Patients with OSA deemed to have adequate therapy, who still complain of burdensome EDS, and in whom alternative etiologies have been excluded are candidates for a trial of adjunctive stimulant pharmacotherapy. (See <a class="local">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H691889729"><span class="h2">Diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>RES in patients with OSA is defined as the subjective complaint of EDS that is present even when breathing and oxygenation parameters during sleep are normalized by successful OSA therapy (see <a class="local">'Definition and pathogenesis'</a> above). The diagnosis of RES is dependent upon the confirmation of the diagnosis of OSA, the exclusion of alternate etiologies for excessive sleepiness, and the assurance of adherence to therapy that is adequate. (See <a class="local">'Revisit the diagnosis'</a> above and <a class="local">'Ensure adherence to treatment'</a> above and <a class="local">'Exclude alternative etiologies'</a> above and <a class="local">'Evaluate adequacy of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H172524487"><span class="h1">TREATMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3826906325"><span class="h2">Wakefulness promoting agents</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>RES in patients with adequately treated OSA in whom other etiologies of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) have been excluded should be assessed for the severity of their sleepiness so that a decision can be made regarding the prescription of wakefulness promoting agents.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H967287654"><span class="h3">Patient selection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with adequately treated OSA who have persistent burdensome daytime sleepiness and in whom alternative causes of daytime sleepiness have been excluded, we suggest a trial of a wakefulness-promoting agent [<a href="#rid21">21,23</a>]. However, the level of daytime sleepiness at which a trial of stimulant therapy is warranted has not been well-defined.</p><p>Although not ideal and unsupported by evidence, we sometimes use wakefulness promoting agents in patients who are partially or incompletely treated for OSA (eg, patients in whom an apnea hypopnea index &lt;5/hour cannot be achieved with therapy) [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Such an approach should only be performed under the supervision of a sleep expert and is supported by our belief that the adverse consequences of EDS (eg, motor vehicle and occupational accidents, poor quality of life and cognitive impairment) coupled with the safety profiles of nonamphetamine wakefulness-promoting agents (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10157" href="/d/drug information/10157.html" rel="external">modafinil</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9260" href="/d/drug information/9260.html" rel="external">armodafinil</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="120816" href="/d/drug information/120816.html" rel="external">solriamfetol</a>) justify their prescription on a trial basis.</p><p>The decision to prescribe a wakefulness-promoting medication is generally based upon the subjective impact of patient symptoms on their activities of daily living in conjunction with the ESS score (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/13440.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>). Symptoms that might prompt a trial of a wakefulness-promoting agent include, but are not limited to, falling asleep at work or while driving and significant fatigue or sleepiness affecting quality of life and work productivity. Although no single best cut-off value on the ESS has been determined, we believe that an ESS score of ≥10 is a reasonable threshold for initiating a treatment trial.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1967010372"><span class="h3">Choosing an agent</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Available agents include <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10157" href="/d/drug information/10157.html" rel="external">modafinil</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9260" href="/d/drug information/9260.html" rel="external">armodafinil</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="122332" href="/d/drug information/122332.html" rel="external">pitolisant</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="120816" href="/d/drug information/120816.html" rel="external">solriamfetol</a>. Choosing among the available agents is individualized and depends upon physician and patient preference as well as cost and the presence of cardiovascular comorbidities. While all agents have been shown to improve EDS in randomized trials, modafinil and armodafinil are <strong>not</strong> approved in Europe for this indication and are therefore, not reimbursable. Solriamfetol is, however, approved and reimbursable. In the United States, modafinil and armodafinil are more frequently prescribed, and depending upon insurance, modafinil may be less expensive. Solriamfetol may be less suitable for those with cardiovascular disorders as it can dose-dependently increase blood pressure [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>]. In addition, modafinil and armodafinil decrease the effectiveness of oral contraception and are contraindicated by some supervisory agencies during pregnancy. (See <a class="local">'Modafinil and armodafinil'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14202.html" rel="external">"Obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy"</a>.)</p><p>Stimulants such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9638" href="/d/drug information/9638.html" rel="external">methylphenidate</a> and amphetamines are not typically prescribed and their use is discouraged in patients with OSA because of the increased cardiovascular risk associated with their use. (See <a class="local">'Other agents'</a> below.)</p><p>Wakefulness-promoting agents have not been directly compared with each other.

(See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Definition and pathogenesis</strong> – Residual excessive sleepiness (RES) in patients with OSA refers to the subjective complaint of EDS that is present even when breathing and oxygenation parameters during sleep are normalized by successful OSA therapy. EDS is defined as the inability to maintain wakefulness and alertness during the major waking episodes of the day, with sleep occurring unintentionally or at inappropriate times. The pathogenesis of RES is poorly understood and likely multifactorial (eg, sleep fragmentation, abnormal sleep architecture, activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, chronic inflammation). (See <a class="local">'Definition and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prevalence</strong> – Residual sleepiness is reported by approximately 6 to 14 percent of patients with <strong>adequately</strong> treated OSA. Risk factors for residual sleepiness are not well defined but may include severe EDS at presentation, younger age, lower mean duration of continuous PAP (CPAP) usage, side effects from CPAP usage, select sleep-related parameters (eg, reduced nocturnal sleep latency, periodic limb movements), and depression. (See <a class="local">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic evaluation</strong> – Clinical evaluation of residual daytime sleepiness in patients with OSA who are receiving therapy usually starts with ensuring that the diagnosis of OSA is correct. We typically reassess patients for the symptoms of OSA and review diagnostic data from any sleep tests that have been performed (eg, home or in-laboratory studies). (See <a class="local">'Revisit the diagnosis'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7706.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">When the diagnosis of OSA is assured, we suggest the following  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131568" href="/d/graphic/131568.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Assess adherence – Patients should be assessed for adherence to their therapy by questioning them (and their bed partner) directly regarding frequency and duration of device use and, for those on PAP, by interrogating device data which records hours of nightly use, effectiveness, and airway leak. Obtaining information via telemonitoring may also be useful.

In most cases, ruling out other significant causes of EDS is determined by history and examination and obtaining a self-reported sleep diary from the patient. Further testing including multiple sleep latency testing and laboratory tests (eg, blood count, thyroid function tests, testosterone level, iron studies, Epstein-Barr virus antibodies) may be performed depending upon the suspicion for specific etiologies. (See <a class="local">'Exclude alternative etiologies'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14892.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with excessive daytime sleepiness", section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Assess adequacy of therapy – If inadequate therapy is suspected or no alternative explanations can be found, we typically prefer to perform in-laboratory sleep testing (with the patient wearing their device) to formally assess the adequacy of primary therapy. Alternatively, home sleep apnea testing while using their device is also an option. For patients deemed to have inadequate therapy, reasons for persistently abnormal parameters should be sought. This includes weight gain, a poorly fitting mandibular device, inadequate CPAP titration leading to residual respiratory events, CPAP mask or mouth leaks, and treatment-emergent central sleep apnea.
