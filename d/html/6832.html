         Patients who present to the office with chest pain are a diagnostic challenge given the wide array of possible etiologies, including a potentially life-threatening condition. Approximately 1 percent of all ambulatory visits in primary care are for chest pain [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Cardiac disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, yet only 2 to 4 percent of patients presenting to a primary care office with chest pain will have unstable angina or an acute myocardial infarction [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-4
         </a>
         ]. The most common causes of chest pain in the primary care population are chest wall pain (20 to 50 percent), reflux esophagitis (10 to 20 percent), and costochondritis (13 percent).

         Angina pectoris, or angina, describes chest pain attributable to myocardial ischemia. It is considered stable when provoked by conditions associated with increased oxygen demand or decreased oxygen supply  (

        </p>
        <p>
         The classic clinical presentation of myocardial ischemia includes chest discomfort that is worse with exertion and improves with nitroglycerine. Symptoms of myocardial ischemia vary by population. Women, individuals with diabetes, and younger adult patients are more likely to present without chest pain but have symptoms of dyspnea, weakness, nausea and vomiting, palpitations, or syncope.

         – Acute pericarditis refers to inflammation of the pericardial sac. Etiologies include infection, medications, autoimmune disorders, uremia, and malignancy. The term myopericarditis indicates a primarily pericarditic syndrome with minor myocardial involvement. Key symptoms include sharp, pleuritic chest pain which is decreased by leaning forward from a seated position, and radiates to the trapezius ridge. Pericarditis has characteristic ECG changes of diffuse ST elevations and PR depressions. (See

In panic disorder, patients experience recurrent panic attacks, with worry about future attacks or avoidance of behaviors related to attacks. One in four people with a panic attack will have chest pain and shortness of breath [

The pain is perceived in the corresponding dermatomes and myotomes. For example, referred pain can come from abdominal organs, cervical disc disease, or from the ligaments, muscles, and periosteum of the cervical and thoracic spines.

         – Clinical decision rules, such as the INTERCHEST score, can estimate the likelihood of coronary artery disease in primary care patients with chest pain and help to determine the need for additional cardiac work-up. We use the INTERCHEST score in outpatients whose initial evaluation does not suggest a clear cardiac etiology. It is most useful for differentiating individuals who are at low risk for unstable CAD from those who are at higher risk and require urgent evaluation [

         Evaluation for gastrointestinal disease involves elicitation of symptoms of heartburn, indigestion, regurgitation, and pain associated with food intake, all of which make a gastrointestinal etiology more likely. Common etiologies are discussed above. (See

         There is considerable overlap between symptoms of gastrointestinal disease and myocardial ischemia. Discomfort that reliably occurs with eating, or that is reliably and repeatedly palliated by antacids or food is likely of gastroesophageal origin. However, relief of pain following the administration of a "gastrointestinal cocktail" (eg, viscous

         Musculoskeletal etiologies are the most common causes of chest pain. Well-localized pain associated with point tenderness is more likely to be musculoskeletal in origin [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36
         </a>
         ]. Body position or movement may exacerbate chest pain of musculoskeletal origin. Musculoskeletal complaints outside the chest are suggestive of a musculoskeletal etiology for chest pain. For example, pain in the neck, thoracic spine, or shoulder may cause referred pain to the chest. Chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain is associated with fibromyalgia. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5631.html" rel="external">

         If the evaluation is consistent with musculoskeletal pain (eg, point tenderness that is reproducible with palpation) with no evidence of underlying systemic etiology, it is reasonable to defer diagnostic studies and prescribe a therapeutic trial of physical therapy or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication which may help confirm the diagnosis if there is improvement [

         The most common psychiatric diseases associated with chest pain are panic disorder and depression. Patients with depressed mood, decreased appetite, or sleep disturbances may have depression. Classic associated symptoms in patients with panic attack include fear and tachycardia. The following validated screening question is good for ruling out a diagnosis of panic attack/disorder when patients answer no: “In the past four weeks, have you had an anxiety attack (suddenly feeling fear or panic)?” [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. A "no" answer to this question makes the diagnosis of panic attack/disorder very unlikely (negative likelihood ratio [LR] 0.09).
        </p>
        <p>
         A "yes" answer moderately increases the likelihood of panic attack (positive likelihood ratio [LR] 4.2). These patients should undergo additional evaluation for other psychiatric disorders (eg, panic disorder, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder) and receive education about the likely etiology of their symptoms and initial management, which might include cognitive behavioral therapy and/or antidepressant medication.

         If other etiologies have been evaluated and ruled out or the history and physical examination are not consistent with those etiologies, we use a knowledge of dermatomes and spinal and visceral pain referral patterns to guide to the evaluation of other less common causes of chest pain (eg, zoster) and pain referred to the chest (eg, from the gallbladder, diaphragm, or from a disc herniation). Hyperesthesia, particularly when associated with a rash, is often due to herpes zoster. Patients with referred pain will often have associated symptoms or physical examination findings that support a particular diagnosis.

          Common causes
         </strong>
         – The most common etiologies of chest pain in primary care practice include musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal conditions. (See

         <strong>
          Initial triage and evaluation
         </strong>
         – The initial assessment should serve to identify patients with life-threatening conditions who need to be transferred to the emergency department (see
         <a class="local">
          'Initial triage'
         </a>
         above). Further evaluation (after excluding life-threatening causes) starts with a history and physical examination to assess the probability of specific causes of chest pain and determine the need for further testing. An ECG is warranted in many patients. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Indications for electrocardiogram'

          Life-threatening conditions
         </strong>
         – Patients with unstable vital signs or concern for life-threatening etiology (eg, acute coronary syndrome [ACS], pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, esophageal rupture, tension pneumothorax, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade) should be referred to the emergency department. (See

          Suspected acute coronary syndrome
         </strong>
         – Concern for ACS may be based on symptoms (angina pectoris at rest, or prolonged or progressing episodes) or ECG changes. Patients with suspected ACS should have an ECG performed and be transferred immediately to an emergency department. If available, patients should also be given

         <strong>
          Evaluation of stable angina
         </strong>
         – Patients who have symptoms consistent with stable angina should be evaluated for myocardial ischemia. Evaluation for coronary heart disease (CHD) may also be warranted in patients with chest pain whose symptoms are not strongly suggestive of angina but do not have another obvious etiology for their chest pain. The INTERCHEST clinical prediction rule can be used to estimate the risk of CAD in specific patients and help guide next steps in management. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Evaluation for stable myocardial ischemia'

         <strong>
          Evaluation of other causes
         </strong>
         – In patients with a negative workup for myocardial ischemia, or in whom suspicion is low, further evaluation is based upon the most likely etiologies that emerge from the initial evaluation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Characteristics of other etiologies'
