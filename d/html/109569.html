Practice guidelines indicate that treating these depressive disorders, as well as subsyndromal symptoms, can improve well-being and quality of life [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Depression is one of the most frequent forms of psychiatric distress in cancer patients. The misconception that all patients with cancer are or should be depressed can trivialize their suffering and disability and lead to the underdiagnosis and undertreatment of depression [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews the clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis of unipolar depressive disorders in patients with cancer. The clinical features and diagnosis of other psychiatric disorders in cancer patients are discussed separately, as are the clinical features and diagnosis of unipolar depression in palliative care and the management of depressive disorders in cancer patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4858.html" rel="external">"Patients with cancer: Overview of the clinical features and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2205.html" rel="external">"Assessment and management of depression in palliative care"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4853.html" rel="external">"Management of psychiatric disorders in patients with cancer", section on 'Depression'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3410716106"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The term “depression” is potentially confusing because it may refer to a transient mood state, a syndrome, or mental disorder. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/91774.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Clinical features", section on 'Definitions of depression'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, there is a continuum of pathological depressive conditions, from subsyndromal symptoms to the syndromes of minor depression and major depression. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/91774.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Clinical features", section on 'Continuum of severity'</a>.)</p><p>A diagnosis of cancer may engender anticipatory grief, which is distinguished from depression. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14684.html" rel="external">"Bereavement and grief in adults: Clinical features", section on 'Anticipatory grief'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1398469581"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2744284988"><span class="h2">Prevalence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The reported prevalence of depression in patients with cancer varies widely, which is likely due to differences in time since diagnosis of cancer, assessment methods, diagnostic criteria, patient populations (eg, sociodemographic factors and stage of cancer), settings (eg, inpatient versus outpatient), and interviewer expertise [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. As an example, identifying cases of depression with clinical interviews, rather than depression rating scales or screening instruments (which are less valid), may yield fewer cases. In addition, diagnosing depression in the context of cancer can be difficult because somatic symptoms such as anergia and disturbances in appetite and sleep may be due to depression, cancer, and/or oncologic treatment.</p><p>The point prevalence of unipolar major depression in patients with active cancer is not clear. Across multiple studies, the point prevalence ranges from approximately 5 to 20 percent [<a href="#rid5">5-9</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A meta-analysis of 70 studies included patients with cancer (n &gt;10,000) across 14 countries who underwent psychiatric interviews. The primary findings were as follows [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The estimated point prevalence of unipolar major depression was 16 percent; however, heterogeneity across studies was high. In the United States (23 studies), the point prevalence of unipolar major depression in patients with cancer was approximately 22 percent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In the nine high-quality studies, the estimated point prevalence of unipolar major depression was 8 percent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The point prevalence of any type of depressive syndrome (major depression, minor depression, or persistent depressive disorder (ie, dysthymia and chronic unipolar major depression) was approximately 21 percent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 2014 study of over 4000 cancer patients who were interviewed found that the point prevalence of unipolar major depression ranged from 6 to 13 percent (depending upon the type [site] of cancer) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. This is consistent with a 2013 review, which focused upon higher-quality studies and found that in six studies of outpatients with cancer (number of patients not reported), major depression was present in 5 to 16 percent [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A meta-analysis of 11 studies that conducted diagnostic interviews for depression in over 1300 patients with cancer estimated that the point prevalence of unipolar major depression was 14 percent; however, heterogeneity across studies was high [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p>Multiple studies indicate that the risk of major depression is two to four times greater in patients with cancer than the general population [<a href="#rid10">10-16</a>]. As an example, a national registry study identified almost 2,000,000 women with no history of cancer or psychiatric disorders and observed that over 13 years of follow-up, nearly 45,000 women developed breast cancer [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The incidence of treatment for depression in the first year after diagnosis of cancer was greater in cancer patients than the general population (relative risk 1.7, 95% CI 1.4-2.1). In addition, depression may occur more often in patients with cancer than other nonpsychiatric illnesses, such as diabetes, heart disease, and thyroid disease [<a href="#rid15">15,17</a>].</p><p>One registry study suggests that the increased rate of depression in cancer patients is greatest in the first week after the cancer diagnosis and decreases thereafter [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Although the increased risk of depression persists for several years, it progressively dissipates, such that the prevalence of depression in patients who become long-term cancer survivors eventually appears to be comparable to that in the general population. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96044.html" rel="external">"Overview of psychosocial issues in the adult cancer survivor", section on 'Depression'</a>.)</p><p>The prevalence of depression in palliative care settings (including late stage or far advanced cancer) is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2205.html" rel="external">"Assessment and management of depression in palliative care", section on 'Prevalence of depression in palliative care'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1841511484"><span class="h2">Risk factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among patients with cancer, the risk of developing unipolar major depression may be increased by the following factors:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prior history of major depression [<a href="#rid10">10,19-21</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Social deprivation, including relatively low income and less education (eg, less than high school) [<a href="#rid7">7,10,22</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Living alone, unmarried marital status, and/or poor social support [<a href="#rid1">1,10,21-23</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>General medical comorbidity and debility [<a href="#rid1">1,24</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Frequent, poorly controlled pain [<a href="#rid21">21,23</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Metastases/advanced cancer [<a href="#rid21">21,23,25</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Impairment of functioning (eg, unable to perform self-care or work) [<a href="#rid10">10,23,26</a>]</p><p></p><p>Some of these factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of depressive syndromes in cancer patients. (See <a class="local">'Pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p>Other populations at greater risk of developing major depression include patients with far advanced cancers and the terminally ill. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2205.html" rel="external">"Assessment and management of depression in palliative care"</a>.)</p><p>Although major depression in the general population is more common among females than males by a ratio of 2:1, the prevalence of cancer-related depression in women and men appears to be comparable [<a href="#rid5">5,21,27</a>]. In addition, patient age is not associated with the prevalence of depression in cancer patients [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. However, the rate of depression appears to be greater for cancers with poor prognosis [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3231093587"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pathogenesis of depressive syndromes in patients with cancer is not known. Factors that may be involved include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient factors – Patient factors that may cause depression include psychological stress and the emotional impact of the cancer diagnosis, personal or family history of depression, lack of social support, heightened attachment anxiety (insecurity and fear of abandonment), poor communication with medical clinicians, and maladaptive coping behaviors (eg, substance-induced intoxication or withdrawal) [<a href="#rid4">4,10,28-30</a>]. Other stressors can also contribute to onset of a depressive episode (eg, bereavement, job loss, and interpersonal conflicts).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Disease factors – Advanced stages of cancer (eg, cerebral metastases), a greater number and severity of physical symptoms (eg, pain syndromes), and functional disability are associated with depression. In addition, cancer may lead to depression by inducing the release of proinflammatory immune cytokines and by disrupting neuroendocrine processes (eg, elevating nocturnal secretion of cortisol) [<a href="#rid10">10,28,29</a>]. As an example, a meta-analysis of 54 studies (n &gt;5000 patients with cancer) found that increased levels of peripheral blood interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor, and C-reactive protein were associated with depression, and the clinical effect was moderate to strong [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Treatment factors – Depressive syndromes may arise from the neurotoxic effects of drugs that are used to treat cancer, such as androgen deprivation therapy, buparlisib, glucocorticoids, interferon-alpha, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9815" href="/d/drug information/9815.html" rel="external">procarbazine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10044" href="/d/drug information/10044.html" rel="external">vinblastine</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10045" href="/d/drug information/10045.html" rel="external">vincristine</a> [<a href="#rid10">10,28,32-35</a>]. Treatment-induced tissue destruction may also release depressogenic cytokines [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In addition, neurosurgery and thyroidectomy may be associated with depression [<a href="#rid10">10</a>], and disfiguring surgery (eg, mastectomy, limb amputation, and radical neck surgery) may contribute to onset of depression [<a href="#rid29">29,33</a>]. Radiation therapy may also be involved in the pathogenesis of depressive syndromes through a variety of mechanisms, depending upon the treatment target [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p>Information about the pathogenesis of depressive syndromes in the general population (including inflammation) is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/118668.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression: Pathogenesis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1521590800"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H987285843"><span class="h2">Symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The symptoms of unipolar depressive disorders include [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Depressed mood (dysphoria)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Loss of interest or pleasure (anhedonia)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Appetite decreased or increased</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sleep decreased or increased </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Loss of energy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cognitive dysfunction</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Psychomotor agitation or slowing</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Suicidal ideation and behavior</p><p></p><p>Information about each symptom is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/91774.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Clinical features", section on 'Symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>The symptom of dysphoria (including hopelessness) is common in patients with cancer. Depressed mood can be an appropriate response to a new cancer diagnosis, worsening prognosis, or cancer recurrence. However, dysphoria in the context of other core signs and symptoms of unipolar depression can also indicate onset of a depressive syndrome that requires pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4853.html" rel="external">"Management of psychiatric disorders in patients with cancer", section on 'Depression'</a>.)</p><p>Several symptoms of depressive disorders overlap with symptoms of cancer and its treatment, including anergia, anorexia, cognitive impairment, and insomnia [<a href="#rid4">4,37</a>]. The approach toward diagnosing a depressive syndrome in patients with these overlapping symptoms is discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See <a class="local">'Initial evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2776347933"><span class="h2">Comorbid psychopathology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Depressive disorders in patients with cancer may be accompanied by comorbid psychopathology, such as anxiety disorders [<a href="#rid10">10,38</a>]. In a study of more than 8000 patients who were currently treated for cancer, self-report surveys suggested that clinically significant symptoms of depression plus anxiety were present in 12 percent [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. Other potential comorbidities include substance-related and addictive disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder.</p><p>Additional information about comorbidity is discussed separately in the context of the general population of patients with depression. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/91774.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Clinical features", section on 'Psychiatric'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3944937091"><span class="h2">Course of illness</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Episodes of depression in patients with cancer often last at least three months. A prospective observational study included women with breast cancer (n = 122) who were enrolled within eight weeks of diagnosis, followed for up to five years, and suffered an episode of syndromal or subsyndromal depressive and/or anxiety disorders [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. The episodes lasted at least three months in 66 percent of patients. In a three-year prospective study of approximately 4800 cancer patients, clinically significant depressive symptoms persisted throughout follow-up in 3 percent [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1383831166"><span class="h1">SCREENING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We suggest that clinicians screen patients with cancer for unipolar depressive disorders. The rationale is that depression is associated with adverse outcomes (eg, increased mortality); is prevalent, underrecognized, and treatable; and that standardized, valid screening tools are available [<a href="#rid41">41,42</a>]. Clinicians may not identify depression because they think they lack the proper training or sufficient time to address emotional distress. In addition, patients may hesitate to discuss their feelings of distress.</p><p>To screen patients with cancer for unipolar depressive disorders, we suggest the self-report, two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89663" href="/d/graphic/89663.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), which is derived from the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307" href="/d/graphic/59307.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Screening should be implemented with services in place to ensure follow-up for diagnosis and treatment. Evidence supporting the use of the PHQ-2 to screen for depression includes a pooled analysis of five studies (900 patients with cancer), which found that sensitivity was 91 percent, specificity 86 percent, positive predictive value 57 percent, and negative predictive value 98 percent [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. A subsequent study found that the PHQ-2 functioned as well as the PHQ-9 [<a href="#rid44">44</a>].</p><p>However, in multiple reviews that have evaluated self-report depression screening tools, there is no consensus regarding which specific instrument should be adopted [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. Reasonable alternatives to the PHQ-2 and PHQ-9 include the Beck Depression Inventory (21 items), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (20 items), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (14 total items, including a 7-item depression subscale). Like the PHQ-2 and PHQ-9, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale is in the public domain and thus available free of charge for unlimited clinical use.</p><p>Although several instruments with fewer than five questions (eg, the single-item Distress Thermometer) are available to screen for depression and are appealing because of their brevity, we generally avoid them due to their inadequate psychometric properties [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. A pooled analysis of seven studies (n &gt;1200 patients with cancer) found that these short instruments performed poorly in detecting possible cases of major depression; the pooled sensitivity was 75 percent and positive predictive value 36 percent [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. The instruments were better at excluding cases of possible major depression, with a specificity of 81 percent and negative predictive value of 96 percent.</p><p>Screening for depression in patients with cancer should occur when the initial diagnosis of cancer is made and periodically thereafter as clinically indicated, especially with changes in the patient’s cancer (eg, disease progression) or treatment status (eg, posttreatment or recurrence), and when patients transition to palliative care. Uptake of screening in community oncology practices may be increased by audits, assigning someone to facilitate screening, and adapting the screening process to the specific workflows of the clinic [<a href="#rid42">42</a>].</p><p>Patients who screen positive with the PHQ-2 should be interviewed to make the diagnosis of depression, because screening instruments are often insufficient for case finding [<a href="#rid41">41,46,47</a>].

Additional information about the initial assessment in the general population is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1721.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis", section on 'Assessment'</a>.)</p><p>In particular, the assessment should address current and past suicidal ideation and behavior; identification of current suicidality should prompt a referral to a mental health specialist for further evaluation and management. Patients with severe symptoms, such as suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation with a specific plan and intent, as well as patients who feel they cannot control their behavior, should be immediately and directly referred to an emergency department for urgent evaluation. (Referral is also warranted for psychotic symptoms and grossly impaired functioning.) Additional information about assessing suicidality is discussed separately.

Focusing more upon mood and cognitive symptoms is consistent with the approach taken when diagnosing major depression in the context of other general medical disorders. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1721.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis", section on 'Unipolar major depression'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, major depression may also be characterized by feelings of hopelessness and helplessness that is disproportionate to the medical reality and prognosis of the patient’s cancer.</p><p>Patients may state that they are burdening and inconveniencing their families and causing them pain and distress. Such beliefs are less likely to represent a symptom of depression than if patients suffer with guilty recrimination (eg, “God is punishing me”), feel that their lives have never had any worth, or that they are being punished for evil things that they have done.</p><p>We also suggest deemphasizing the somatic (neurovegetative) symptoms of depressive disorders, which include anergia, anorexia, and insomnia, and may be due to cancer and its treatment [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Cancer commonly causes fatigue, unrelieved pain may cause insomnia and depression, and chemotherapy may lead to loss of appetite and weight. In addition, the somatic symptoms may be attributable to a nonpsychiatric medical cause, such as progression of the cancer (eg, a cerebral metastasis).</p><p>Placing less emphasis upon somatic symptoms when diagnosing major depression in patients with cancer is consistent with the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) [<a href="#rid36">36</a>], and the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases-11<sup>th</sup> Revision (ICD-11) [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]. Both nosologies specify that symptoms that are counted toward a diagnosis of depression should not be attributable to a nonpsychiatric medical condition. However, if the etiology of the somatic symptoms is indeterminate, clinicians may reasonably take a more inclusive approach by counting somatic symptoms toward the diagnosis of major depression, to avoid missing the diagnosis [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].</p><p>Furthermore, deemphasizing the somatic/physical symptoms of depression does not mean that they should be ignored; multiple studies suggest that assessing somatic symptoms have some utility when evaluating cancer patients for depressive disorders [<a href="#rid56">56</a>]. As an example, a prospective study assessed patients (n = 279) for unipolar major depression or minor depression up to three times within the first nine months of being diagnosed with cancer [<a href="#rid57">57</a>]. All depressive symptoms, including somatic symptoms, were more common in depressed patients than nondepressed patients, and the diagnostic accuracy of somatic symptoms was at least as good as that for mood and cognitive symptoms. In addition, asking about specific somatic symptoms may help begin a dialogue about depression with patients who may otherwise resist discussing emotional issues.</p><p>Passive wishes for death to come sooner and thoughts of hastening death are common in cancer patients throughout the disease course. Careful assessment is needed to evaluate whether these thoughts are associated with a suicide plan and/or behavior. Frequently, suicidal thoughts represent a wish to talk about fears of dying or other concerns about the future, and can be remediated by increased clinical attention and support.</p><p>The presence of risk factors for depression may also help clinicians rule in a depressive disorder in patients with cancer.
