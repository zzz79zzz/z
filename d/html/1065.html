         Atrial flutter is a relatively common supraventricular arrhythmia that can impact quality of life and cause stroke or systemic embolization. Restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm improves symptoms and decreases the risk of embolization if atrial flutter recurrence does not occur. (See

         We attempt to keep most patients with recurrent atrial flutter in sinus rhythm to decrease symptoms, unlike atrial fibrillation (AF) in which rhythm control and rate control are reasonable strategies. In addition, the long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm may decrease the risk of stroke. Rhythm control with either radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation or antiarrhythmic drug therapy is necessary; in most cases, RF catheter ablation is preferred because of the high rate of success and low rate of complications. Exceptions include individuals identified as having reversible triggers such as pneumonia, hyperthyroidism, and other acute medical problems. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1045.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Atrial flutter is characterized by rapid, regular atrial depolarizations at a characteristic rate of approximately 300 beats/min. In the absence of rate slowing drugs or atrioventricular (AV) nodal disease, every other depolarization passes through the AV node, and the ventricular rate is usually around 150 beats per minute. Unlike AF, attempts to slow this rate are often unsuccessful or require high doses of rate slowing drugs; thus, the maintenance of sinus rhythm is desirable in most patients to control symptoms. In addition, episodes will often be recurrent unless a reversible cause is present. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2118.html" rel="external">

         The discussion in this topic pertains primarily to patients with typical atrial flutter. The pathogenesis of typical atrial flutter makes it highly amendable to curative therapy with radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation, though atypical flutters may also be cured with RF ablation. Typical (also called isthmus-dependent) atrial flutter utilizes a large macroreentrant pathway in the right atrium, with the left atrium following passively. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1061.html" rel="external">
          "Electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic features of atrial flutter"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The negative deflection of the flutter (F) wave in lead II coincides in time with the impulse activating the low right atrial tissue between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid valve. Activation then travels anteriorly through the region of the low septum, and superiorly and anteriorly up the medial surface of the right atrium, returning along the lateral wall of the right atrium back to the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) [
         <a href="#rid1">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The cavotricuspid isthmus between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid annulus (IVC-TA isthmus) is an obligatory route for typical flutter, and, as such, is the best anatomic target for ablation  (

         </span>
         The femoral approach is generally used and, under fluoroscopic guidance or using a three-dimensional mapping system, an ablation catheter is placed at the CTI where a large ventricular and small atrial electrogram are recorded. RF energy is applied, and the catheter is slowly withdrawn to create a line of ablation from the annulus to the inferior vena cava.
        </p>
        <p>
         The goal is to create a complete ablation line with the absence of electrical conduction across the CTI both medially to laterally and laterally to medially. This is the best marker for long-term success  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef69946 graphicRef60090" href="/z/d/graphic/69946.html" rel="external">
          waveform 1A-B
         </a>
         ). If the patient presents in typical atrial flutter, CTI block should still be assessed with differential pacing on both sides of the ablation line after termination of atrial flutter, since frequently there can still be conduction across the CTI [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17

         during pacing may help to assess the completeness of isthmus block [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Alternatively,

          adenosine
         </a>
         may also be given to assess for block across the line [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Another method for ablation is the maximum voltage technique [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Coronary sinus (CS) ostial pacing is completed and the largest amplitude atrial signal in the CTI is ablated as a point lesion. The next largest signal is then targeted, and the process is repeated until block is seen across the isthmus.
        </p>
        <p>
         Electroanatomic mapping is used in many cases for identifying the appropriate target area for ablation; it is a nonfluoroscopic three-dimensional mapping system. This system permits reconstruction of cardiac anatomy without the use of fluoroscopy. A study of 50 patients with atrial flutter compared isthmus ablation using conventional fluoroscopy for catheter positioning to positioning with electromagnetic mapping [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. The success rate for complete isthmus blockade after 20 RF pulses or 25 minutes of fluoroscopy time was greater with electromagnetic mapping (96 versus 67 percent). Electromagnetic mapping significantly reduced the overall fluoroscopic time (4 versus 22 minutes) and the fluoroscopic time needed for isthmus mapping (0.2 versus 17.7 minutes).
        </p>
        <p>
         Ablation guided by intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) can also be used, and may be helpful to assess for pouches and ridges in the CTI during difficult cases or repeat procedures [

         The initial success rate for RF catheter ablation of typical atrial flutter has ranged from 65 to 100 percent [

          22,23

         Between 7 and 44 percent of patients who undergo flutter ablation have recurrent atrial arrhythmia, though the recurrent arrhythmia is usually AF [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22,23
         </a>
         ]. Thus, some patients should undergo surveillance for recurrent atrial flutter or AF. Our approach to surveillance for recurrent arrhythmia is as follows. For patients who were initially symptomatic and who did not develop a tachycardia mediated cardiomyopathy, we perform testing to document recurrent arrhythmia only for symptoms. If the patient was initially asymptomatic, we perform periodic examinations (every 12 months) at which time we obtain an electrocardiogram, Holter, or event monitor. For those patients who developed tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy, standard heart failure therapy is still indicated unless otherwise contraindicated. Follow-up assessment of left ventricular function by imaging techniques such as echocardiography is warranted. We obtain a repeat echocardiogram three to six months after initiation of therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         The rate of recurrent AF appears to depend upon the presence or absence of AF before the procedure. In a study of 100 patients, 29 of whom had documented AF before the procedure, AF occurred in 36.4 percent of those with complete follow-up after a mean of almost 15 months [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. However, in another study of approximately 100 patients without pre-existent AF, new onset AF developed in only 12.9 percent during a mean follow-up of 19 months [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. Most patients (92 percent) who develop AF after flutter ablation do so within six months. The risk may be as low as 10 percent (mean follow-up of 20 months) in those with no prior AF and a left ventricular ejection fraction &gt;50 percent [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. The likely reasons for the difference in the rates of recurrence likely has to do with differing populations being studied (eg, symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients) and the intensity of follow-up.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a study of 363 patients who underwent RF ablation for typical atrial flutter, 82 percent developed drug refractory AF during a follow-up period of 39 (+/- 11) months [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. Elimination of atrial flutter may delay, but does not prevent AF and the two may share common triggers. Therefore, patients may derive a better long-term benefit from additional anatomical ablative treatment, lifestyle modifications, and/or pharmacological therapy of AF. (See

         Persistent atrial flutter can result in a tachycardia-mediated left ventricular cardiomyopathy, similar to what has been seen with AF and other arrhythmias. On the other hand, reversal of the arrhythmia can result in improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction and, in 6 of 11 patients in one report, restoration of normal function [

         RF catheter ablation of atrial flutter is significantly safer than that for atrial fibrillation, in part because the left atrium is not entered and because the procedure is generally shorter due to the fact that ablation in a very limited area that is not adjacent to vulnerable structures such as the esophagus and pulmonary veins [

         For most patients with atrial flutter, pharmacologic therapy is not chosen for the long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm. The success rate at one year has been estimated at only 20 to 30 percent, with the risk of recurrence highest in the patient with an enlarged right atrium who is in heart failure. Good prognostic signs for maintaining sinus rhythm are normal atrial size, recent onset, little or no heart failure, and an underlying reversible disorder such as hyperthyroidism, myocardial infarction, or pulmonary embolism. For patients in whom an attempt will be made to maintain sinus rhythm with antiarrhythmic drug therapy, we use the following drugs (with suggested starting doses):

         The drugs that are most likely to maintain sinus rhythm are the same as those used for rhythm control in atrial fibrillation (AF)  (

         ). They act by suppressing triggering beats and arrhythmias and affecting atrial electrophysiologic properties. In a meta-analysis that included 36 patients,

          flecainide

          35
         </a>
         ]. Flecainide can also slow down the atrial flutter rate; thus, atrioventricular (AV) nodal agents should always be used in conjunction to prevent one-to-one atrial flutter. (See

         Many patients with atrial flutter also have episodes of atrial fibrillation (AF). For many of these patients who have chosen ablation, we recommend atrial fibrillation (with or without atrial flutter ablation) ablation rather than atrial flutter ablation alone. The electrophysiologic substrates of AF and atrial flutter are different, and the addition of atrial flutter ablation to AF ablation adds very little risk. However, in some cases, we believe it is reasonable to perform atrial flutter ablation alone, particularly if atrial flutter is the predominant rhythm and if the rate in flutter is difficult and causing most symptoms. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/949.html" rel="external">
          "Atrial fibrillation: Catheter ablation"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The optimal approach to ablation in patients with both atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation was evaluated in the single-blind APPROVAL trial, which randomly assigned 360 patients to ablation of AF (with or without atrial flutter ablation) or ablation of flutter alone [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. Among patients in the first group, 124 received AF ablation only and 58 had both ablation procedures. At nearly 22 months of follow-up, patients assigned to the group that received AF ablation (with or without atrial flutter ablation) had a higher rate of primary end point of freedom from arrhythmia off antiarrhythmic drug therapy during follow-up (64 versus 19 percent). This outcome was similar for the two subpopulations in the first group (AF ablation with or without atrial flutter ablation). Patients in group one had significant improvement in scores on most quality-of-life measures, whereas those in group two did not.
        </p>
        <p>
         The finding in APPROVAL of similar outcomes between patients who received both AF and atrial flutter ablation and those who received AF ablation alone was noted in an earlier study of 108 patients with both AF and typical atrial flutter who were randomly assigned to either a dual ablative procedure (pulmonary vein isolation [PVI] and CTI ablation, 49 patients) or PVI alone (59 patients) [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         These findings suggest that pulmonary vein triggers appear to initiate atrial flutter as well as AF. This conclusion is consistent with evidence that atrial flutter commonly starts after a transitional rhythm of variable duration, usually AF [

         The discussion of anticoagulation below focuses on patients who undergo radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation. However, similar issues apply to patients with atrial flutter (and atrial fibrillation) in whom antiarrhythmic drug therapy is to be started. Any therapy that causes conversion of atrial flutter (or fibrillation) to sinus rhythm leads to a measurable increase in the short-term risk of embolization unless proper anticoagulation is in place.

         For patients in atrial flutter scheduled to under RF ablation, anticoagulation is handled, broadly speaking, in a manner similar to that for patients with atrial fibrillation who undergo cardioversion. Most of these patients require at least three to four weeks of adequate anticoagulation before the procedure. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1069.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         For those patients with atrial flutter of less than 48 hours duration, there is disagreement whether a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is necessary to exclude the presence of a left atrial thrombus, as there is not good quality evidence available. If a TEE is performed and no thrombus is found, RF catheter ablation may be performed without prior anticoagulation. For low-risk patients with atrial flutter of less than 48 hours, it may be reasonable to proceed with ablation without a TEE. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/906.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         If the patient is not in atrial flutter at the time of the ablation, therapeutic anticoagulation is not necessary and a TEE is not usually performed.

         Anticoagulation for the prevention of embolic events may be necessary, at least on a temporary basis, after flutter ablation due to the potential for the development of recurrent atrial flutter or AF within six months. However, there are limited data to support this approach [

         For patients with evidence of recurrent atrial flutter after atrial flutter ablation, with atrial fibrillation before or after the flutter ablation, or for those patients in sinus rhythm at the time of the ablation, we use the CHA2DS2-VASc score to determine the long-term need for anticoagulation. This may include using no anticoagulation in those at low risk.
