         Basic calcium phosphate (BCP)-associated musculoskeletal syndromes can be organized into two categories, arthritis associated with BCP crystals and calcific periarthritis. Osteoarthritis (OA) associated with BCP crystals is the most common form of arthritis associated with these crystals, and Milwaukee shoulder syndrome (MSS) is a characteristic syndrome in which BCP crystals play a prominent role. The predominant mineral type in BCP-associated musculoskeletal pathology is carbonated hydroxyapatite [
         <a href="#rid1">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         An overview of the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of BCP-associated arthritis will be presented here. An overview of BCP-associated calcific periarthritis, calcific tendinopathy of the shoulder, and the pathogenesis of OA are discussed in detail separately. (See

         The predominant mineral type in basic calcium phosphate (BCP)-associated musculoskeletal pathology is carbonated hydroxyapatite, although the term "basic calcium phosphate" refers to a trio of submicron-sized calcium phosphate crystals [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. These include partially carbonate-substituted hydroxyapatite, octacalcium phosphate, and tricalcium phosphate (whitlockite). The terms "calcium phosphate" and "hydroxyapatite" are often used synonymously with the more accurate term "basic calcium phosphate." BCP crystals are similar in composition to both the normal mineral found in bones and teeth and the pathologic mineral found in atherosclerotic plaques and calcinosis cutis.

         Intraarticular BCP crystals have been recognized since the 1970s, initially in the synovial fluid of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and subsequently in other conditions [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. A subset of patients with a unique clinical presentation of noninflammatory, shoulder-predominant, OA-like arthritis associated with BCP crystals has been termed Milwaukee shoulder syndrome (MSS), although OA is the clinical syndrome that remains most closely linked with intraarticular BCP crystals [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         OA with BCP crystals and MSS likely represent points on the same spectrum of disease pathogenesis rather than different syndromes. In addition to these conditions, there are case reports of BCP-associated arthritis in patients with autoimmune inflammatory processes and in the setting of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).
        </p>
        <p>
         Other common BCP-associated musculoskeletal syndromes are BCP-associated calcific periarthritis and calcific tendinopathy of the shoulder, which are described in detail elsewhere. (See

         </span>
         The causes of pathologic basic calcium phosphate (BCP) crystal formation are not fully understood [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. BCP mineral formation often occurs at sites of local tissue damage associated with injury or inflammation. Once formed, BCP crystals can produce symptoms and mediate tissue damage by several mechanisms, including the induction of a vigorous inflammatory response, biomechanical disruption, and by direct interactions with connective tissue cells, producing destructive cytokines and prostaglandins in the absence of inflammation [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6-10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Severe radiographic damage and the presence of articular calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystals are risk factors for BCP crystals in patients with osteoarthritis (OA). A history of shoulder trauma or heavy use, along with increased age, are associated with Milwaukee shoulder syndrome (MSS). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Osteoarthritis with BCP crystals'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="local">
          'Milwaukee shoulder syndrome'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The average age of the largest collection of reported cases of MSS was 72 years, and most were female [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Approximately one-third of these patients described some trauma to the affected shoulder, while others had occupations involving heavy use of the shoulders or a history of crutch walking and/or wheelchair use. Calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease has some clinical overlap with MSS, but whether these patients are clinically different from those with BCP crystals alone is not known.
        </p>
        <p>
         The absence of widely available clinical tests to accurately detect articular BCP crystals has slowed progress in understanding their roles in OA and other settings in which they occur, and relatively little is known about the factors that specifically initiate symptomatic arthritis associated with the crystals. The pathogenesis of BCP crystal disease is reviewed in more detail separately. (See

         Basic calcium phosphate (BCP) crystals are associated with arthritis in several syndromes and clinical settings, including osteoarthritis (OA) with BCP crystals and Milwaukee shoulder syndrome (MSS). BCP crystal arthritis can also occur in a subset of patients with systemic rheumatic ("connective tissue") diseases, in patients with calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease, and in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).

         BCP crystals are common components of advanced large-joint OA. Patients with OA and intraarticular BCP crystals are generally clinically indistinguishable from those with typical OA, although the presence of BCP crystals is postulated to predict rapid progression to end-stage disease [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. The clinical manifestations of OA are described in detail separately. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         There are no population-based studies of this association, due to the absence of a widely available clinical test for articular BCP crystals. Two studies of synovial fluids sampled at the time of knee joint replacement for OA demonstrated that approximately 50 percent contained BCP crystals [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ]. Histologic studies confirm the high prevalence of BCP crystal deposits in OA tissues, with 100 percent of end-stage hip and knee joints showing BCP crystal deposition at the time of joint replacement [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16
         </a>
         ]. Routine laboratory studies are generally normal in patients with OA with and without BCP crystals. It is not known whether the modest elevations in C-reactive protein (CRP) observed in OA correlate with the presence of BCP crystals [

         MSS is a chronic syndrome of shoulder arthritis, which presents with chronic shoulder pain and loss of function. It occurs in older adult patients, especially women, and is often associated with large but noninflammatory shoulder effusions [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,11
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The largest reported case series involved 30 patients. A compilation of published reports included 72 patients with MSS [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18

         ].

        <p>
         In the largest reported case series, which involved 30 patients, 80 percent were women; the mean age was 72 years, ranging from 50 to 90 years of age [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Observations from one compilation of published reports of MSS that included a total of 72 patients found that MSS tended to be worse on the patient's dominant side but was bilateral in 64 percent of the patients [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Severe degenerative arthritis of the knee, with an atypical pattern of lateral-compartment-predominant involvement, was present in 53 percent of the MSS patients, and 7 percent had hip involvement. The elbow may also be affected [
         <a href="#rid19">

         Physical examination may show a large cool glenohumeral joint effusion, crepitation, and joint instability. Sinus tracts and capsular ruptures with large chest wall ecchymoses have been described.
        </p>
        <p>
         Routine laboratory studies are generally normal, while elevated inflammatory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), are described in some case reports of MSS [

         Involved shoulder joints eventually demonstrate a classic radiographic appearance characterized by severe joint destruction, cartilage loss, and extensive rotator cuff damage. However, not all of these features may be present in early disease (

         – Alizarin red S staining can identify calcium-containing crystals in synovial fluid with ordinary light microscopy. BCP aggregates appear as orange-red clumps in stained synovial fluid. Unfortunately, alizarin red S staining is neither sensitive nor specific for BCP crystals. In one study of synovial fluid samples from patients with OA who were strongly positive on alizarin red S staining, only 50 percent contained crystals by transmission electron microscopy [

         In osteoarthritis (OA), calcific deposits can be identified in hyaline cartilage, fibrocartilage, and synovium. Tissue histopathology from patients with Milwaukee shoulder syndrome (MSS) demonstrates synovial hypertrophy and embedded basic calcium phosphate (BCP) crystals in the synovium, accompanied by fibrin deposition and occasional giant cells.

         The diagnosis of basic calcium phosphate (BCP) crystal-associated arthritis is based upon the presence of characteristic clinical features of joint swelling and pain, with routine synovial fluid analysis that excludes inflammation and other crystals as the cause of the findings, and plain radiographic imaging showing substantial joint injury.

          Osteoarthritis with BCP crystals
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis of OA with BCP crystals is made by obtaining a clinical history consistent with noninflammatory arthritis in large joints. These patients have subacute or chronic pain in one or more large joints, which is worse with activity, increases as the day progresses, and is not associated with prolonged (&gt;30 minutes) morning stiffness. The presence of intraarticular BCP crystals may be suspected when there is an unusually rapid pace of progression or very aggressive joint and soft tissue destruction. The diagnosis is further supported by the presence of noninflammatory synovial fluids without visible MSU or CPP crystals.

         <sup>
          3

         A number of testing techniques, none of which are routinely available for clinical use, can be used to more specifically identify BCP crystals. As examples, BCP crystals can be definitively identified in clinical samples with techniques such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy; however, these technologies are not widely available for clinical use. Other measures may also be effective to identify BCP crystals. Some clinical laboratories are willing to analyze particulates from synovial fluid with equipment used to identify kidney stone composition. In addition, methods to detect BCP crystals based upon radioactive bisphosphate-binding or calcium-binding fluorescent dyes, with or without flow cytometry, have been described but have not been validated for clinical use [

          CPPD disease and gout
         </strong>
         – Like other crystal-related forms of arthritis, BCP-associated arthritis can cause significant joint swelling and pain. CPPD disease and gout can be distinguished from BCP arthritis by the presence of characteristic calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) and monosodium urate (MSU) crystals, respectively, which are seen in these other disorders on examination of the synovial fluid with compensated polarizing light microscopy. Differences in the acuity of presentation and the degree of inflammation may help differentiate between these syndromes.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         MSS usually presents with symptoms and signs that evolve over months or years, while acute CPP crystal arthritis and gout more often present with rapid onset of symptoms. Synovial fluid analysis in acute gout and acute CPP crystal arthritis demonstrates inflammatory cell counts, while cell counts in joints from patients with MSS are in the noninflammatory range. More chronic presentations of CPPD involving the shoulder may be more difficult to differentiate from MSS, and a careful search for synovial fluid CPP crystals would be needed to distinguish between these two syndromes.

         Our primary management goal is symptom relief, which involves the use of local intraarticular interventions and, if needed, orally administered analgesics (eg,

          Moderate to severe pain

Most patients respond to aspiration and intraarticular glucocorticoid injections with improvement lasting for a period of weeks to months. However, some patients exhibit an inadequate response, with rapid recurrence of pain and reaccumulation of the effusion within days of the injection. For patients who don't respond to glucocorticoid injections, we generally do not perform injections more than twice, as responses to additional injections are unlikely; however, some patients still respond to repeated aspiration without injection.

         – In patients with an inadequate response to pain medication and intraarticular glucocorticoids, we perform tidal lavage if oral analgesics are inadequate.

         Basic calcium phosphate (BCP) mineral formation often occurs at sites of local tissue damage associated with injury or inflammation. Once formed, BCP crystals can produce symptoms and mediate tissue damage by induction of an inflammatory response, biomechanical disruption, and by inducing the local production of destructive cytokines and prostaglandins in the absence of inflammation.

         BCP crystals are associated with arthritis in several syndromes and clinical settings, including osteoarthritis (OA) with BCP crystals and Milwaukee shoulder syndrome (MSS). BCP crystal arthritis can also occur in a subset of patients with systemic rheumatic diseases, in patients with calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease, and in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).

         BCP crystals are common components of advanced large-joint OA. Patients with OA and intraarticular BCP crystals are generally clinically indistinguishable from those with typical OA, although the presence of BCP crystals may predict rapid progression to end-stage disease. (See

         MSS is a chronic syndrome of shoulder arthritis, which typically presents in older adult patients, especially women, with chronic shoulder pain, loss of function, and often with large but noninflammatory shoulder effusions. Radiographs of involved joints eventually demonstrate a characteristic severe joint destruction, cartilage loss, and extensive rotator cuff damage. (See

         The diagnosis of OA with BCP crystals is made in a patient with a clinical history consistent with noninflammatory arthritis in large joints, especially when there is an unusually rapid pace of progression or very aggressive joint and soft tissue destruction. The diagnosis is further supported by the presence of noninflammatory synovial fluids without visible MSU or CPP crystals. (See

         In patients with pain that impairs sleep and physical function, we suggest joint aspiration and intraarticular glucocorticoid injection. We use

         In patients with an inadequate response to pain medication and intraarticular glucocorticoids, we perform tidal lavage. This is performed under ultrasound guidance, with 1500 to 2000 mL of sterile
