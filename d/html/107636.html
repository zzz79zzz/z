          —
         </span>
         Regular exercise has been shown to have wide-ranging health benefits. There is evidence to suggest a sedentary lifestyle may be an even stronger predictor of mortality than such established risk factors as smoking, hypertension, and diabetes [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Numerous epidemiologic studies show that unfit individuals are two to three times more likely to experience acute cardiovascular events or die during follow-up compared with their more fit counterparts regardless of their risk profile, including coronary calcium score, body habitus, or the presence of cardiovascular disease. In addition, studies have consistently demonstrated an inverse relationship between physical activity and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) morbidity and mortality [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Because physical inactivity is a modifiable risk factor, clinicians should routinely assess and prescribe structured exercise and increased lifestyle activity to all patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         In this topic, we discuss the fundamental concepts and terminology of exercise, how to assess a patient's level of exercise and physical activity, how to determine whether a non-exerciser is willing to begin exercising, and medical clearance of a patient to begin an exercise program (often, formal medical screening is not necessary). The general benefits and risks of exercise, how to prescribe exercise to patients, and the role of exercise for patients with cardiovascular and other conditions are reviewed separately:

         Intensity is an important factor in developing cardiovascular performance and fitness. Athletes know that to improve performance, some training must be performed at high intensity. While significant health benefits are clearly achieved with moderate-intensity exercise, the results of large observational studies suggest that performing some vigorous exercise is associated with lower all-cause mortality [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. As an example, a report using data from 11 cohorts in the Health Survey for England and the Scottish Health Survey found that vigorous physical activity was associated with a 16 percent greater reduction in all-cause mortality risk than more moderate-intensity activities [

          Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE)
         </strong>
         are scales based on an individual's perception of how hard they are exercising. The most commonly used is the Borg Scale, which rates the intensity of activity between 6 and 20  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70470" href="/z/d/graphic/70470.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). Moderate exercise correlates with an RPE of 12 to 13 (somewhat hard), while vigorous exercise correlates with an RPE of 14 to 16 (hard). By adding a zero to the rating on the Borg RPE scale, one can estimate the corresponding HR in healthy young adults when performing activity at that perceived intensity. Thus, moderate exercise would correlate with a HR between 120 and 130 beats per minute. Although this appears simplistic, numerous studies have demonstrated the accuracy of this method [

         For strength training, intensities are typically determined using a percentage of the maximum weight a person can lift for a single repetition of a given exercise. That weight is called the one-repetition maximum (1-RM). As an example, if a person can press 110 pounds (50 kg) overhead just once (1-RM), then 55 pounds (25 kg) would be 50 percent of their 1-RM.
        </p>
        <p>
         Using this approach, intensities for strength training can be categorized as follows [

         Before prescribing strength exercise, the clinician or coach should explain how to determine a 1-RM for each exercise. Several online tables and calculators are available to assist the patient in estimating a 1-RM, including the following chart from the United States National Strength and Conditioning Association (
         <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nsca.com%2Fcontentassets%2F61d813865e264c6e852cadfe247eae52%2Fnsca_training_load_chart.pdf&amp;token=yaYB5J0E18WO%2BmCDORf75SVchdokaYQLgdR1hvNkHnBg9hBdt7thWmf958SI%2Ba7O3dG1qHNN57IZXoGqGtJ%2B5lzloL4aJrPs81f8qfCdr9jALtKRLIYq03jemTnEOQbf&amp;TOPIC_ID=107636" target="_blank">

         ). Actually lifting the maximal weight is typically unnecessary and potentially harmful. Our suggested approach for determining the starting weight for an exercise is reviewed separately. (See

         Key determinants of health for adults include the number of minutes and the corresponding intensity of physical activity performed each week.

         ]. The United States Physical Activity Guidelines recommend that adults (18 years and older) perform at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise (like a brisk walk). Guidelines for Canada and the European Union parallel those of the United States. Australian guidelines are similar and offer specific suggestions for activity for different ages. All published guidelines encourage the accumulation of 150 minutes or more of moderate-intensity activity each week [

         PAVS is designed to assess whether a patient is meeting published recommendations for performing at least 150 minutes per week of moderate- or greater-intensity exercise. PAVS can be assessed by a medical assistant as they settle the patient in the examination room and obtain standard vital signs. At several large United States health care organizations, the PAVS assessment is performed by asking the following questions [

        <p>
         Based on the patient's responses, total exercise time is calculated in minutes per week of moderate or greater (ie, vigorous) physical activity. This number can be displayed in the patient's chart adjacent to the traditional vital signs. The patient's body mass index (BMI), smoking history, and other important information relevant to the patient's capacity for and risks associated with exercise are also recorded.

         PAVS allows the clinician to assess a patient's exercise habits quickly and offer either brief advice or a more detailed exercise prescription. At a minimum, providers are asked to offer each patient feedback, saying either:

         A patient's current stage should be determined before a clinician counsels them about a specific behavior change (eg, becoming more physically active) to help ensure their counsel is appropriate. While a pre-contemplator may need help changing their understanding, the contemplator may need help assessing the pros and cons of changing a behavior. Exploring alternative action plans, providing specific instructions (step-by-step guides), offering positive personal feedback, and halting recidivism may be needed for patients in the determination, action, maintenance, and relapse stages, respectively.

         <strong>
          Facilitating behavior change
         </strong>
         – The likelihood that a patient will change a longstanding unhealthy behavior is governed by a myriad of socioeconomic, attitudinal, and cultural factors, including their expectation of the benefits, costs, and consequences of that behavior [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. Common barriers to making lasting behavioral changes (eg, following an exercise program) include suboptimal social support, social isolation, financial difficulties, psychological factors (eg, depression, chronic stress), and a lack of free time. Strategizing with the patient to identify realistic options to overcome these barriers, real or perceived, is integral to changing unhealthy behaviors.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The "five As" approach (ask, advise, assess, assist, and arrange) has been reported to produce significant improvements in a variety of health behaviors, including physical activity [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Use of the five As for smoking cessation is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16634.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of smoking cessation management in adults", section on 'The 5A's approach'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         More clinicians now perform the first two As (that is, ask about the risky behavior and advise behavior change). However, it is the less frequently performed As (assess, assist, arrange) that require more time and specific counseling skills to implement and that have the greatest impact on healthful behavior change [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. The core of effective counseling is a patient-centered approach, helping the patient to create and implement an "action plan" to reach their self-stated goals [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. This approach grows out of the patient's answers to carefully worded questions posed by the clinician.

         <strong>
          Motivational interviewing
         </strong>
         – Motivational interviewing is a form of talk therapy used by the clinician during patient encounters to encourage behavioral change [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. To achieve healthier lifestyle habits, the clinician must convey understanding, acceptance, and sincere interest in the patient.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The first step is to identify the patient's readiness to change their behavior. Unhealthy lifestyle practices should be discussed in a sympathetic manner, as the clinician helps the patient to understand the factors that contribute to these behaviors.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The next step in getting the patient to understand and accept the need for change is to assist them in identifying and overcoming obstacles. Questions to help them accomplish this task may include:
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         <span class="glyph">

         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         Are there any barriers to starting this exercise, and how could they most easily be overcome?

         <span class="glyph">

         Could you commit to exercising for a total of 30 minutes per day, three times per week, prior to our next visit?
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Next, the clinician should help the patient overcome inertia and become independent and self-motivating, emphasizing that time is an ally to successful lifestyle modification. Patients should be counseled on handling resistance and dealing with recidivism.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Lifestyle modification is analogous to Newton's first law of motion: a body at rest tends to remain at rest; a body in motion tends to remain in motion. We need to get patients to act. The easier we make it for patients to move, using goals suited to their circumstances, the easier it is for them to overcome inertia. Any action they take (eg, repeated 10-minute exercise bouts) may serve as a springboard to permanent lifestyle change.

          The Patient-centered Assessment and Counseling for Exercise (PACE) program: A model to emulate?
         </strong>
         – The PACE program is a comprehensive approach to physical activity counseling [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. This approach draws heavily on the "stages of change" model, which suggests that individuals change their behavior in stages and uses tailored recommendations for each stage [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The PACE program was developed to overcome common barriers to physician counseling for physical activity, using brief counseling sessions (two to five minutes) during a conventional physical examination. The results of controlled trials suggest that the PACE approach can be incorporated effectively into clinical encounters intended to motivate previously sedentary adults to become more physically active [
         <a href="#rid30">

         Our suggested approach to determining which patients need a medical assessment prior to beginning an exercise program is summarized in the following algorithm  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116688" href="/z/d/graphic/116688.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         In the past, medical organizations, including the American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology, emphasized preparticipation screening examinations to identify "at risk" individuals who should seek more detailed medical evaluation prior to beginning exercise. Such medical evaluations might include a history and physical examination, exercise stress testing, or more extensive diagnostic testing. To increase participation in exercise programs, screening has been deemphasized.
        </p>
        <p>
         Little evidence supports the role of routine screening examinations or diagnostic testing in reducing the risk of exercise-related cardiovascular events [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32-35
         </a>
         ]. The United States Preventive Services Task Force 2018 recommendations advise against routine screening with exercise testing to prevent cardiovascular events [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36
         </a>
         ], including higher-risk populations with diabetes mellitus [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, there is a lack of consensus among organizations about the extent of the medical evaluation needed for screening [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. In part, this stems from the many variables to be considered, such as patient age, intensity of the exercise to be performed, prior training history, and whether the patient has known cardiovascular, metabolic, or renal disease [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. Regardless of organization guidelines, many patients will seek advice from their medical providers before engaging in an exercise program. The clinician needs to be aware of current guidelines for identifying high-risk individuals who may require a more thorough evaluation before beginning an exercise program, as well as what advice to give low-risk individuals.

         Asymptomatic patients who might benefit from peak or symptom-limited exercise testing before beginning a physical conditioning program, especially if vigorous exercise is contemplated, include those who meet any of the following criteria:

         – For inactive, asymptomatic patients with known CMKD, medical clearance is recommended for light- to moderate-intensity exercise. For inactive patients with any symptoms or signs that suggest CMKD, medical clearance is recommended before participating in light- to moderate-intensity exercise with progression.

         The ACSM guidelines have eliminated age cutoffs, risk factor profiles, and the use of low-, moderate-, and high-risk classifications. The term "medical clearance" is used, rather than specific recommendations for performing a formal medical examination or exercise testing, as the authors felt that such evaluations should be left to the clinician's discretion. In addition, patients with pulmonary disease are no longer automatically referred for medical clearance because pulmonary disease does not necessarily confer greater risk of nonfatal and fatal cardiovascular complications during exercise [

         Musculoskeletal dysfunction from injury or chronic disease can present significant obstacles to exercise. Patients with new musculoskeletal complaints or known chronic conditions should be evaluated and managed as necessary. Appropriate modifications to a standard exercise program may be needed for such patients. Multiple UpToDate topics address the workup of patients with musculoskeletal complaints and issues around exercise in patients with chronic conditions.

         In many cases, a patient's functional capacity can be estimated based on their clinical history. A patient who uses a walker or seldom leaves their single-level home because of symptoms has poor functional capacity, while a patient who walks approximately 3.5 miles (5.5 km) in one hour several times per week or regularly plays singles tennis has an above average to high functional capacity.
        </p>
        <p>
         In select patients, simple surveys (such as the Duke Activity Status Index) can be used to obtain a valid and reliable estimate of the patient's functional capacity (expressed in metabolic equivalents [METs]) [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. (See

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Others have shown that cardiorespiratory fitness can be estimated accurately from readily available demographic and clinical data, including sex, age, body mass index (BMI), resting heart rate (RHR), and self-reported physical activity [

         Can you walk approximately 10 minutes at a pace of 2.5 to 3 miles per hour (4 to 5 km per hour; approximately 3 to 3.5 METs) without experiencing limiting symptoms (eg, shortness of breath)?

         An affirmative answer to either question suggests the patient's functional capacity is adequate (ie, ≥5 METs) and above the least fit 20 percent of patients, which typically places them in a lower-risk cohort. Conversely, clear negative responses to both questions generally confirm that a patient has reduced exercise tolerance or poor functional capacity.

          36

         While not needed for most adults beginning an exercise program, exercise testing can be helpful for assessing a range of potential cardiovascular disorders in patients at risk. Suitable candidates for exercise testing prior to beginning a vigorous exercise program (ie, activities involving ≥60 percent oxygen consumption [VO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>

         <a href="#rid4">
          4,45
         </a>
         ]. However, as most acute coronary syndromes that occur in previously asymptomatic subjects are due to vulnerable plaque disruption, it is impractical to use exercise testing to prevent acute cardiovascular events at rest or during exercise in asymptomatic subjects [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32

Other patients who may benefit from such testing prior to beginning an exercise program include those whom the clinician suspects may be ignoring symptoms or not giving an accurate history, patients with atypical chest pain at rest or during exertion, and those who complain of palpitations [

         The primary care clinician plays an important role in monitoring the new exerciser moving from a sedentary to a more active lifestyle, as well as the more advanced exerciser. Evidence to guide such surveillance is scant; what follows are the authors' suggestions. Our approach to primary care surveillance of exercisers is summarized in the following table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117940" href="/z/d/graphic/117940.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Attrition rates among sedentary individuals embarking on a new exercise program are high, with one source citing adherence rates of 50 percent or lower [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. According to a small observational study, poor exercise adherence was associated with overly optimistic expectations among inexperienced exercisers, which led to disappointment [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. Interventions to help ensure realistic expectations among participants may increase success with exercise programs. One strategy is to remind patients of the considerable health benefits gained from even small increases in physical activity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most beginning exercisers are thought to face their greatest challenges in maintaining their exercise regimen during the initial conditioning stage (first 5 to 10 weeks), and so it makes sense for primary care clinicians to intervene during this time. Interventions can include phone calls from office staff or the clinician to encourage adherence. In addition, as dropout rates are highest during this early period, we suggest making a scheduled office visit to reinforce the new behavior and to help overcome any obstacles to exercising.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although evidence is limited, a range of technologies may help patients maintain their exercise regimen and achieve activity goals. Digital tools on smartphones and tablets, apps that promote physical activity, and activity trackers may all reduce barriers to regular physical activity and provide daily goal reminders [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49
         </a>
         ]. Self-monitoring techniques or devices (eg, pedometers, accelerometers, heart rate [HR] monitors) can be helpful. Active-play video gaming with aerobic requirements (approximately 2 to 6 metabolic equivalents [METs]) can help patients meet goals and serve as a gateway to structured exercise programs [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50,51
         </a>
         ]. Collectively, data suggest that using technology, a contributor to the physical inactivity epidemic, may also be part of the solution.

          —
         </span>
         Extreme exercisers pose a different set of challenges for the clinician. While improvements in cardiac function are seen in individuals who perform three or more hours of vigorous exercise weekly, extreme exercise is more commonly used to describe endurance athletes who perform 15 to 40 hours of training per week [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Individuals involved in high-volume, high-intensity training regimens or competitions are not immune to structural cardiovascular abnormalities or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and extreme exercise is more likely to trigger acute cardiac events in such participants. Therefore, preparticipation and serial screening aimed at identifying athletes at risk of exertion-related sudden cardiac arrest or progression of cardiovascular disease appears warranted. Clinicians should be aware of the potential risks associated with extreme endurance exercise or high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and provide appropriate counsel to patients contemplating such activity [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. The issues surrounding the screening of such athletes are reviewed in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/960.html" rel="external">
          "Screening to prevent sudden cardiac death in competitive athletes"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         We believe that the management of extreme endurance exercisers should be individualized. At minimum, an annual cardiovascular assessment, including an electrocardiogram, seems to us a reasonable approach. Most individuals who experience an exercise-related cardiac arrest have risk factors or a history of cardiovascular disease, have structural heart disease (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), or experience symptoms at some time prior to the arrest. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to counsel their patients about warning signs and symptoms of cardiac disease [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38,53
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         While moderate-to-vigorous exercise is clearly beneficial to health outcomes, the dose-response relationship between extreme exercise and health remains incompletely understood [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ]. Little evidence is available to inform how to approach surveillance of the extreme endurance exerciser. In a review of this subject, one team of researchers suggested that extreme exercise not be discouraged but recommended annual surveillance [
         <a href="#rid54">

          Terminology
         </strong>
         – Exercise is physical activity that is planned, purposeful, and performed regularly to improve or maintain health and fitness. Exercise has wide-ranging health benefits. Exercise types include endurance exercise to improve cardiovascular and respiratory fitness, resistance exercise to improve strength and power, exercises to improve balance and proprioception, mobility exercises, and combinations of these. The different types and facets of exercise and physical activity are reviewed in the text. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Terminology and common types of exercise'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Patient assessment and time spent exercising
         </strong>
         – One key determinant of cardiovascular health is the time spent being physically active. The 2020 World Health Organization guidelines encourage the accumulation of 150 minutes or more of moderate-intensity activity or 75 minutes or more of vigorous-intensity activity, or equivalent combinations, each week. Assessment of a patient's physical activity and of a sedentary patient's willingness to embark upon an exercise program are reviewed above. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Assessment of individual patient activity'

          Who needs a medical assessment before starting to exercise?
         </strong>
         – Patients
         <strong>
          without
         </strong>
         diagnosed chronic disease (eg, heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease) or concerning symptoms (eg, chest discomfort, dyspnea at rest, dizziness) generally do
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         require a health screen prior to beginning a moderate-intensity exercise program. Patients with significant cardiovascular, metabolic, or kidney disease (CMKD), those who develop concerning symptoms at rest or during activity, and some others should be evaluated by their primary care clinician prior to embarking on an exercise program. Our suggested approach to determining which patients need a medical assessment before starting an exercise program is summarized in the following flow chart  (

          algorithm 1

         ). (see

         <strong>
          Surveillance of exercising patients
         </strong>
         – Evidence to guide primary care surveillance of the adult exerciser is scant. A table summarizing our approach is provided  (

         <strong>
          Supporting patients starting to exercise
         </strong>
         – Attrition rates among sedentary individuals embarking on a new exercise program are high, particularly during the initial conditioning stage (first 5 to 10 weeks). Interventions during this period, such as phone calls from office staff or clinicians to encourage patients, can reduce attrition. We suggest making a scheduled office visit during this period to reinforce the new behavior and to help overcome any obstacles to exercising. (See
