         </span>
         Emergency ETI may be performed in the prehospital setting, as well as in emergency departments or other critical care settings. The need for intubation may be immediately apparent, such as in cardiopulmonary arrest. In other circumstances, the decision to intubate may result from dynamic assessment based on progressive or anticipated deterioration despite maximal medical therapies and non-invasive respiratory support.
        </p>
        <p>
         Emergency intubation is inherently more difficult to perform than planned intubation in the operating room. Patients are not prescreened and often had recent oral intake as opposed to being in the fasted state (ie, nil per os [NPO]). In addition, rapid clinical deterioration may compromise preparation time, and underlying illness or injury may make patients more susceptible to the adverse physiologic effects of this procedure.

         ]. Patients with depressed mental status can be assessed clinically for loss of protective airway reflexes. In particular, determining a patient's ability to swallow and handle secretions provides the most reliable indication of adequate airway protection. Studies suggest that swallowing and airway protective reflexes may in fact be centrally integrated [

         Though commonly assessed, the gag reflex is a less useful indicator of airway status for several reasons: (1) The gag reflex correlates poorly with GCS [

         </a>
         ]; (2) A gag may not be elicited in more than one third of healthy subjects [

          12
         </a>
         ]; (3) The absence of a gag reflex in patients with prior neurological insults does not correlate with risk of aspiration [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]; (4) Attempting to gag a patient to determine the need for intubation increases the risk of vomiting in those whose reflex remains intact.

         <strong>
          Potential for clinical deterioration
         </strong>
         – Children whose condition will likely deteriorate, such as those with thermal inhalation injuries or epiglottitis, require early intubation in a controlled fashion. (See

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Other illnesses, such as severe anaphylaxis or asthma exacerbations, may initially be treated with aggressive medical therapies. However, clinical response must be continuously assessed, with a clear endpoint and plan for airway intervention if the patient does not improve and respiratory failure is anticipated. (See

         Similarly, patients with sepsis may be intubated based on their anticipated course, as well as to maximize oxygen delivery and relieve energy expenditure related to increased work of breathing. (See

         <strong>
          Prolonged diagnostic studies or patient transport
         </strong>
         – Control of the airway through intubation may be the safest alternative for some patients with combative or unstable conditions who require diagnostic studies that are prolonged or prevent continuous access to the patient. This is particularly true during computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, where assessment and support of the child's airway will be limited in the event of an acute change. Intubation is also suggested prior to transfer to another facility for any patient at risk for deterioration. Securing the airway prior to departure avoids the need for emergency advanced airway management in a less controlled setting such as an ambulance or a helicopter transport.

         Assessment and management of the airway is the first priority in caring for acutely ill or injured children. Thus, there are no absolute contraindications for ETI by appropriately trained providers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Relative contraindications are uncommon but do exist and primarily relate to the need to move to a more controlled environment or to perform a surgical approach to the airway:

         In order to preserve airway reflexes and spontaneous respiratory efforts in case of a failed intubation, rapid sequence intubation with neuromuscular blockade should be avoided in patients who are known or expected to be difficult to intubate and difficult to ventilate with bag and mask, without an appropriate back up plan in place.

         Patients with a known or suspected laryngeal fracture should be intubated with caution because of the risk of further disrupting a partial laryngeal transection, resulting in complete loss of the airway.

          Mouth and oropharynx
         </strong>
         – The lips define the entrance to the mouth. Immediately behind the lips are the teeth extruding from the gingiva. The mouth is bound superiorly by the hard and soft palate, laterally by buccal mucosa, and inferiorly by the tongue. The uvula hangs down from the roof of the mouth in the midline, and the tonsils lie laterally just behind the palatoglossal folds which define the entrance to the oropharynx  (

          Hypopharynx
         </strong>
         – Below the oropharynx is the hypopharynx which extends from the epiglottis to the cricoid cartilage. The epiglottis attaches to the anterior aspect of the hypopharynx and drapes over the glottis. The anatomic space at the junction of the base of the tongue and the epiglottis is the vallecula. At the base of the vallecula lies the hyoepiglottic ligament, which connects the epiglottis to the hyoid bone anteriorly, covered by the median glossoepiglottic fold  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59721" href="/z/d/graphic/59721.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). The larynx lies in the anterior portion of the hypopharynx, bounded laterally by the piriform recesses. Posteriorly lies the origination of the esophagus. Distinguishing the esophagus from the glottis is crucial during ETI. The esophageal opening has a puckered or ill-defined shape, and has smooth, homogeneous soft tissue structures surrounding it  (

         <strong>
          Larynx
         </strong>
         – The larynx is defined anteriorly by the hyoid bone, the thyroid cartilage, the cricothyroid membrane, and the cricoid cartilage. The arytenoid cartilages (cuneiform and corniculate) make up the posterior aspect of the laryngeal inlet. These posterior cartilages are important landmarks as they are the first structures visualized as the epiglottis is lifted during laryngoscopy and may be the only portion of the glottis visualized in some patients. The aryepiglottic folds, which connect the arytenoids to the epiglottis, make up the lateral borders of the laryngeal inlet. The true vocal cords originate below the epiglottic tubercle anteriorly and connect with the arytenoids posteriorly. The vocal cords cover the entrance to the trachea. An optimal laryngoscopic view will allow visualization of the entire length of both vocal cords  (

Yankauer or wide-bore tonsil tip catheters are most appropriate for suctioning particulate matter (eg, thick secretions and vomitus). Flexible suction catheters can be used for thin secretions in the nose, mouth, and hypopharynx, as well as for deep suctioning through the endotracheal tube (ETT).

          Bag and mask

         – Selecting an appropriately sized bag and mask for bag-mask ventilation (BMV) is discussed separately. (See

         BMV can provide a temporizing means for oxygenation and ventilation while preparing for intubation in the child in respiratory failure. In addition, children desaturate more quickly than adults during RSI and may require assisted ventilation after administration of sedatives or neuromuscular blockade agents and prior to laryngoscopy and ETI. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6310.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         BMV is as effective as ventilation following ETI for providing immediate respiratory support. For example, a randomized controlled trial of prehospital BMV versus ETI in 820 pediatric patients found no difference in survival to hospital discharge or good neurologic outcomes between the two groups. Median scene and transport times were 15 minutes in the BMV group and 17 minutes in the ETI group, suggesting that BMV was equivalent to ETI for short-term airway and ventilatory support among paramedics [

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         However, BMV does not provide a secure airway and may result in gastric insufflation, which increases the risk for vomiting and aspiration. In addition, resultant abdominal distension may limit diaphragmatic excursion and compromise ventilation. Thus, any child requiring prolonged respiratory support is best managed with ETI, especially when performed by appropriately trained providers in the emergency department or other critical care settings.

         Cuffed ETTs also improve accuracy of capnography and decrease need for ETT changes. The clinician should test the balloon integrity prior to intubation by briefly inflating the cuff and then deflating completely. After intubation with cuffed tubes, care must be taken to avoid cuff pressures greater than 20 to 25 cm H

         Historically, uncuffed ETTs have been recommended for infants and young children to prevent pressure-induced ischemic damage to tracheal mucosa from a cuffed tube. Functional narrowing of the airway at the subglottis in children can create an effective anatomic seal without the need for a cuffed ETT in some patients. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6310.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         However, ETTs with low-pressure, high-volume cuffs in sizes suitable for infants and children have been shown to be safe and effective. Observational studies and two randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that cuffed tubes are more likely to result in placement of a correctly sized tube on the first attempt and provide better tidal volumes and less leakage during ventilation without causing an increase in acute postextubation respiratory complications (ie, postextubation stridor and/or need for racemic

          18,19,24,27-30
         </a>
         ]. The ability to adjust cuff inflation for excessive air leak also results in less frequent need for tube change secondary to inappropriate sizing. Thus, cuffed ETTs may avoid the need for repeat intubation in critically ill children in whom air leak compromises the ability to oxygenate or ventilate effectively.

         The ETT size for children outside of the neonatal period can be estimated based upon age  (

          table 7

          calculator 1
         </a>
         ). For neonates, initial ETT size is based on gestational age or weight  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71813" href="/z/d/graphic/71813.html" rel="external">
          table 8
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The size of the ETT is determined by the internal diameter, measured in millimeters (mm). Available sizes range from 2.5 mm (suitable for a preterm infant) to adult sizes of 7.0 mm or more. The appropriate size ETT for any given patient should be small enough to pass easily through the vocal cords but large enough to minimize resistance to air flow through the tube. Uncuffed tubes should fit snugly in the subglottic trachea to minimize air leak, while cuffed tubes allow for some adjustment through cuff inflation to provide appropriate endotracheal fit.
        </p>
        <p>
         For uncuffed ETT sizing, the age-based formula 4 + (age in years/4) has been shown to be effective and accurate in children [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31

         ]. When using a
         <strong>
          cuffed

         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ], though with the development of newer, lower profile, thinner walled cuffed ETTs, using a tube one half size smaller than the age-based calculation is recommended  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef72932" href="/z/d/graphic/72932.html" rel="external">
          table 7

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Other methods that have been proposed for estimating the best size uncuffed ETT in children include comparison of the outer ETT diameter width with the child's fifth finger or the width of the child's fifth fingernail with inner ETT diameter, and a derivation based on the child's length [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. Of these methods, derivation based on the child's length is best.
        </p>
        <p>
         Utilizing a length-based resuscitation tape (eg, Broselow-Luten tape), is as effective as age-based formulae for determining the appropriate ETT size in children with normal growth [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>

         <a href="#rid35">
          35

         ]. Early versions, however, may not include sizing for cuffed ETTs below 5.5 mm.
        </p>
        <p>
         Regardless of the method chosen in selecting ETT size, it is important to have available additional tubes, one size larger and one size smaller than expected, to permit rapid replacement of any poorly fitting tube.

         The clinician should generally use a stylet during emergency ETI to reinforce the rigidity of the ETT and allow the operator to direct the tube into the glottic opening.
        </p>
        <p>
         The largest diameter stylet that fits through the ETT should be used. Tubes greater than 5.5 mm usually accommodate a larger diameter (ie, adult) stylet. Two small (pediatric) stylets may improve rigidity in smaller tubes if a single small stylet is inadequate. If the stylet does not have a friction reducing surface coating, the provider should lubricate it with water soluble lubricant to facilitate removal. Bending the styletted ETT into a hockey stick configuration enhances the ability to direct the ETT anteriorly through the glottis  (

         To avoid injury to the tracheal mucosa, care must be taken to ensure that the tip of the stylet does not pass beyond the distal end or through the Murphy's eye of the ETT. Bending the proximal end of the stylet over the adapter at the proximal end of the tube prevents inadvertent movement during intubation.

         There are two components to the laryngoscope, the handle, and the blade. Pediatric and adult sized handles are available that differ in diameter and length, though either size can be used depending on the clinician's preference. Standard geometry laryngoscope blades are either curved or straight. The choice of curved or straight blade is best made based on the experience and preference of the laryngoscopist. Curved blades have a large flange which facilitates displacement of the tongue, and a curve that promotes easy placement in the vallecula  (

          figure 5

         ). A straight blade permits direct lifting of the epiglottis to expose the glottic opening, which may be preferred in infants and children younger than two years of age in whom the epiglottis is often larger, floppier, and more acutely angled  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77129" href="/z/d/graphic/77129.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         A straight blade may also be preferred in patients in whom cervical spine injury is suspected because laryngoscopy with a straight blade may result in less motion of the cervical spine [

         Laryngoscope blades range in size from 00 for the extremely premature infant to 4 for large adults. The appropriate size blade for a given patient is one that is large enough to control the tongue and to reach the glottic structures  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73906" href="/z/d/graphic/73906.html" rel="external">
          table 9

         ). Generally, size 0 or 1 blades are used in average-sized newborns, and size 1 blades for most infants beyond the immediate newborn period. The Wis-Hipple is available in a 1.5 size, which is convenient for children one to three years of age. The phrase "switch to size 2 at age two (years)" helps to remember this important changeover point for laryngoscope blade sizing.

         Anatomic landmarks also help identify the appropriate laryngoscope blade size. In a prospective observational study, intubation was more consistently successful on the first attempt when the length of the blade used for laryngoscopy was within one centimeter of the distance between the upper incisors and the angle of the mandible [

          23,40

The bulb is deflated and then placed on the end of the ETT following intubation. When the grip on the bulb is released, it will remain deflated when the ETT is in the esophagus but will reinflate with gas from the trachea and lungs when the ETT is correctly positioned in the non-collapsible trachea.

Depending upon the method used, the sensitivity for correct tube placement relative to chest radiograph or capnography varied from 91 to 100 percent and overall accuracy was 89 to 98 percent. In some studies, confirmation of correct endotracheal position was obtained as quickly as 17 seconds using a curvilinear probe. However, confirmation was more difficult in patients who had short necks or were wearing cervical collars. The use of ultrasound as an adjunct for confirmation of ETT placement warrants further validation.

         Continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring and pulse oximetry prior to intubation are essential. Capnography should be utilized to confirm and monitor endotracheal tube (ETT) position after intubation. Patients requiring emergency ETI may have significant cardiovascular or respiratory compromise. In addition, profound physiologic changes may occur as a result of medication delivery, the mechanical stimulation from laryngoscopy and/or ETI, and the physiologic change from spontaneous (negative pressure) to assisted (positive pressure) ventilation.

         Preoxygenation with the maximal possible fraction of inspired oxygen creates an oxygen reservoir, primarily by washing nitrogen out of the functional residual capacity of the lungs and replacing it with oxygen. This increased lung store of oxygen, in combination with the improved oxygen delivery within the circulation and body tissues, serves to delay or avoid hypoxemia resulting from prolonged apneic periods during ETI. Thus, preoxygenation should be performed even in patients with normal oxygen saturation.

         Patients without spontaneous respirations require immediate institution of bag-mask ventilation (BMV) with maximal possible fraction of inspired oxygen.
        </p>
        <p>
         Preoxygenation has traditionally included administration of oxygen using a nonrebreather mask for three to five minutes in the spontaneously breathing patient. Although two minutes may be sufficient in healthy children [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48,49
         </a>
         ], emergency intubations are often performed in patients with compromised pulmonary function or respiratory effort who may benefit from more prolonged oxygen delivery prior to the procedure. In general, children have less functional residual capacity and higher oxygen utilization and, thus, will become hypoxic more quickly than adults, regardless of the method of preoxygenation. (See

         Rarely, children with gastric distension after bag-mask ventilation have restricted lung excursion on inhalation and are difficult to preoxygenate. Placement of a gastric tube in these patients is warranted prior to ETI despite the risk of vomiting. Venting of a gastric or gastrostomy tube, when present, also relieves gastric distension without adding any additional risk of emesis.

Thus, the balance between minimizing neck movement must be weighed against the possibility of insufficient glottic visualization and an unsuccessful intubation attempt. The safest practice is to provide the minimum amount of force and movement necessary to allow for successful completion of endotracheal intubation. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Once RSI medications are provided, the clinician should limit BMV because of the increased risk of vomiting and aspiration that can occur with gastric distention. However, in patients who cannot be adequately preoxygenated or who are likely to desaturate quickly, BMV with small tidal volumes and cricoid pressure to reduce gastric insufflation is preferable to intubating a hypoxic patient. BMV may also be continued in patients with severe metabolic acidosis where prolonged apnea may result in increasing pCO2, compounding the acidosis. Nasal cannula oxygen delivery to the apneic patient following administration of RSI medications can also decrease the likelihood of hypoxemia. The optimal flow of oxygen for this practice in pediatrics has not been determined. Our approach is to provide apneic oxygenation using 1 to 2 L/min per year of age (maximum flow rate, 15 L/min) via nasal cannula. Higher flow rates may be utilized when using heated, humidified nasal cannula delivery. (See

         Laryngeal exposure with visualization of the glottis is a key determinant of success or failure for endotracheal intubation (ETI). During emergency endotracheal intubation (ETI) in children, we suggest use of a videolaryngoscope (VL), if available, rather than traditional direct laryngoscope (DL), although some experienced clinicians continue to prefer DL based upon their expertise and which device is most immediately available [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54-59
         </a>
         ]. The technique for use of video laryngoscopes equipped with standard geometry (ie, Miller- or MacIntosh-type) blades is similar to direct laryngoscopy as discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Technique'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Some experts refer to the use of a VL with a standard geometry laryngoscope blade as "video-assisted laryngoscopy" because it permits direct and/or indirect laryngoscopy for the primary proceduralist, with the additional benefit of a shared view that allows coaching from an experienced physician observer and a safe means of guiding less experienced proceduralists during emergency ETI for [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The use of VL with standard geometry blades may encompass viewing the laryngeal structures indirectly, directly, or in combination. For intubations in children with normal mouth opening and without concern for cervical spine injury, VL with standard geometry blades rather than acute angle blades permits direct and indirect laryngoscopy during ETI and easier passage of the endotracheal tube. The shape of the acute angle video laryngoscope blade permits intubation without neck movement, making it a good choice for intubation of trauma patients and those with limited cervical spine mobility. However, acute angle laryngoscopy only provides indirect visualization of the airway and delivery of the tracheal tube requires that the tube tip is bent to form a 60- to 80-degree angle with its body. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13872.html" rel="external">
          "Video laryngoscopy and other devices for difficult endotracheal intubation in children", section on 'Acute angle blade'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Observational studies that compare use of a VL with a traditional DL for emergency pediatric endotracheal intubation (ETI) have found that VL is associated with either similar or reduced frequency of adverse effects; and similar or higher first attempt success rate [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54-60
         </a>
         ]. For example, in a cohort study of over 1400 ETIs performed in pediatric emergency departments, use of video-assisted laryngoscopy, when compared with traditional DL, was associated with higher odds of first-attempt success (odds ratio [OR] 2.01, 95% CI 1.48-2.73) and decreased odds of severe adverse airway outcomes such as aspiration, severe hypoxia, unrecognized esophageal intubation, hypotension, or cardiac arrest (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.58-0.85) [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ]. Emergency departments with high use of video-assisted laryngoscopy (&gt;80 percent of intubations) had higher odds of first-attempt success than sites with low use (&lt;20 percent of intubations) even after adjusting for the type of laryngoscopy used on individual patients (adjusted OR [aOR] 2.30, 95% CI 1.79-2.95). During implementation of routine VL with standardized coaching by an attending in 10 pediatric intensive care units, over 3,500 ETIs using VL were performed, and VL during ETI increased from 30 percent (baseline) to 89 percent of ETIs. VL was associated with lower adverse events compared with DL (9 versus 15 percent, aOR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.81) [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59
         </a>
         ]. In another multicenter retrospective study of nearly 500 children undergoing ETI in pediatric emergency departments, first pass success was also similar for VL versus DL although VL was used for the entire procedure in only 35 percent of patients [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Additional indirect evidence from clinical trials involving children undergoing elective intubation in the operating room also supports VL rather than DL for rapid sequence induction and intubation in neonates, infants, and in older children with difficult airways (eg, limited mouth opening, cervical spine immobility, or severe micrognathia due to genetic syndromes such as Pierre Robin or Treacher Collins).

          Inserting the laryngoscope

         – The laryngoscope is held in the left hand, regardless of the practitioner's hand dominance. The most common approach is to insert the blade into the right side of the patient's mouth, taking care not to catch the lower lip against the teeth, which may lacerate the lip. Asking an assistant to retract the lip off the teeth can be helpful. Within the oral cavity, the blade is passed under direct visualization along the base of the tongue following the natural contour of the pharynx. The tongue is swept to the left as the laryngoscope is advanced into midline of the hypopharynx  (

         ). The laryngoscope should not be "rocked" backward, using the upper palate or incisors as the fulcrum for leverage. This improper technique will decrease the space within the oral cavity, making it difficult to pass the ETT under direct visualization. In addition, injury to the mouth, gingiva, or teeth can occur when the blade is levered against these structures. Keeping the wrist straight will help prevent inadvertent levering.

          Identifying glottic structures
         </strong>
         – After the tongue and soft tissues have been retracted, the aim is to identify recognizable anatomic structures within the extrathoracic airway. As the laryngoscope blade is advanced into the pharynx, the epiglottis will often come immediately into view  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69513" href="/z/d/graphic/69513.html" rel="external">
          figure 11
         </a>
         ). This is the landmark that is most useful when identifying the remainder of the glottic structures. At this point, suction is often needed to remove saliva, blood, or debris and optimize the glottic view.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Several laryngoscopic adjustments can be made if the epiglottis is not seen immediately:

         The epiglottis may be lying flat against the posterior pharyngeal wall or folded on itself, making it difficult to distinguish from surrounding mucosal surfaces. Additional elevation of the mandibular block may help separate the epiglottic rim from surrounding tissue.

         The laryngoscope blade may not be midline, often as a result of challenges in sweeping the tongue from right to left. Repositioning the blade using the uvula as a midline reference point may be helpful.

         If neither the epiglottis nor the glottic structures are visible, the laryngoscope blade can be advanced fully, placing the blade tip in the esophagus. The blade is then pulled back slowly. The first structure to fall into view will be the glottis, followed by the epiglottis. Some experts recommend routine use of this approach with blind insertion beyond the larynx and locating identifiable structures as the blade is withdrawn, particularly when intubating infants [

         <strong>
          Elevating the epiglottis
         </strong>
         – After the epiglottis has been identified, it needs to be elevated to expose the underlying vocal cords and glottic opening. The technique employed varies based on the type of blade being used.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         When using a straight blade, the tip of the blade is commonly positioned under the epiglottis to lift it directly  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77129" href="/z/d/graphic/77129.html" rel="external">
          figure 6
         </a>
         ). The epiglottis is frequently large, floppy, and covered with airway secretions and therefore may easily slide off the blade. If this occurs, the blade should be repositioned beneath the epiglottis, and it should be carefully lifted again. Alternatively, the straight blade can be placed in the vallecula, and the epiglottis indirectly lifted with elevation of the mandibular block.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         When using a curved blade, the tip of the blade is pressed against the deepest portion of the vallecula (median glossoepiglottic fold) to place tension on the hyoepiglottic ligament, which will help suspend the epiglottis.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Once the blade (straight or curved) is positioned correctly, force is applied upward and forward along the long axis of laryngoscope handle at approximately 45 degrees. This will lift the mandibular block and the epiglottis to expose the glottic opening  (

         Laryngoscope blade positioning has an important impact on airway visualization. For example, in a prospective cohort study of 171 video-laryngoscopy attempts performed with either a curved or straight standard geometry laryngoscope blade in a children's hospital emergency department (first-pass success rate 83 percent), directly lifting the epiglottis compared with indirectly lifting it with the blade in the vallecula was associated with a better glottic view but not a higher overall success rate [
         <a href="#rid63">
          63

         Ideally, with appropriate positioning and laryngoscopy, the vocal cords and glottic aperture will be quickly identified. In selected pediatric patients with poor visualization of the larynx, external laryngeal manipulation or cricoid pressure may improve the glottic view:

          External laryngeal manipulation (bimanual laryngoscopy or BURP maneuver)
         </strong>
         – If little or none of the glottic opening is visualized despite appropriate positioning of the patient and the laryngoscope blade, external laryngeal manipulation (ELM) may improve the view in some patients (eg, children with anteriorly located airways due to congenital anomalies or trauma patients undergoing intubation with cervical spinal motion restriction in place).

         Once the optimal glottic view is obtained, the laryngoscopist has an assistant place their fingers in exactly the same spot on the thyroid cartilage, using the same direction and degree of force necessary to maintain the view. This can be facilitated using the shared view available with VL.

         Alternatively, backward-upward-rightward pressure (BURP) is applied to the larynx by an assistant. The BURP maneuver has been demonstrated to improve glottic exposure in some patients by moving the larynx more into the line of vision [

          (Cricoid pressure)
         </strong>
         – Cricoid pressure was originally described in adults as pressure on the cricoid cartilage to occlude the posteriorly seated esophagus to prevent aspiration. This posterior pressure has also been described as a means to posteriorly displace the laryngeal structures to improve visualization. Distinguishing the cricoid cartilage from the thyroid cartilage may be challenging in young children, and both efforts can be included under the description of external laryngeal manipulation (ELM). Adjusting the location of pressure on the anterior neck may be an important part of optimizing ELM. When used, it should be applied after the sedative is administered and the patient becomes unconscious. If ELM does not improve or worsens the view, it should be removed immediately, and external laryngeal manipulation attempted [

         Cricoid pressure may also help prevent gastric insufflation during bag-mask ventilation although regurgitation can still occur and is considered optional for this purpose. However, during RSI, bag-mask ventilation should be limited whenever possible (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6390.html" rel="external">
          "Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in children for emergency medicine: Approach", section on 'Protection'

         Cricoid pressure has historically been proposed as a means to prevent passive regurgitation of gastric contents during laryngoscopy and intubation. However, conflicting evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of cricoid pressure for preventing regurgitation and ELM may better improve visualization of the glottis. Therefore, we prefer to use the ELM technique during RSI. (See

         Once the glottic opening has been identified, the final step is passage of the ETT. While maintaining a view of the glottic opening, the intubator receives the tube in his/her right hand from a previously assigned assistant. The tube is held like a pencil, between the thumb and first two fingers  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66376" href="/z/d/graphic/66376.html" rel="external">
          figure 12

         ). Having an assistant place traction on the right corner of the mouth can provide improved visualization and additional room to accommodate the ETT entering the mouth  (

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The tube enters the right side of the mouth and is advanced toward the larynx in a horizontal plane. Passage of the tube directly along the barrel of the laryngoscope blade will obscure visualization of the glottic opening and should be avoided. The ETT should be passed through the vocal cords under direct visualization. Once the tip has passed through the vocal cords, the tube is rotated to the upright position  (

         After correct position is confirmed, the ETT must be firmly secured. The most common approach is to tear longitudinally down the midline of a length of cloth or silk tape, creating a Y-shape. One segment is wrapped around the tube and the base segment is placed across the cheek  (

         , which is allowed to air dry, can provide additional adherence. Alternatively, commercial tracheal tube holders may be utilized to secure the ETT. These devices have been shown to be rapidly applied in adults and to have reasonable resistance to extubation forces, although in most instances, tape is stronger [

          80
         </a>
         ]. Optimal position is located at a minimum of one to three centimeters above the carina and below the thoracic inlet. Tube depth may be adjusted based on radiographic position. Preliminary evidence suggests that bedside ultrasound, performed by clinicians experienced with this technique, may also be useful for directly determining the position of the ETT within the trachea, or confirming appropriate position by documenting bilateral lung sliding. However, this is not common practice at this time and should not replace radiography [

          Gastric decompression

         – An orogastric or nasogastric tube should be placed following intubation to decompress the stomach. Gastric distension can occur secondary to crying or insufflation following BMV. In addition, because emergency intubation may be performed on non-fasted patients, residual gastric contents may be present and should be evacuated.

         Prolonged laryngoscopy (even with adequate preoxygenation) will lead to hypoxemia. Monitoring via continuous pulse oximetry is essential to recognize inadequate oxygenation. If desaturation occurs, the intubation attempt should be discontinued. Before another attempt is initiated, the patient should receive BMV until oxyhemoglobin saturations improve. If cricoid pressure is in place, then it should be continued during BMV provided it is not compromising ventilation.

         An alternative approach is to time laryngoscopy duration during the intubation attempt and discontinue it if the attempt is unsuccessful within a specific time period (eg, 30 to 45 seconds). This may prevent oxyhemoglobin desaturation during pediatric RSI but may also result in more laryngoscopy attempts. In one observational study that used video review of 114 children (median age 2.4 years) undergoing RSI in a pediatric emergency department, at least one episode of oxyhemoglobin desaturation (pulse oximetry &lt;90 percent) occurred in 33 percent of patients [

Oxyhemoglobin desaturation was more common in children two years of age or younger compared with older children (59 versus 10 percent) and was strongly associated with the duration of laryngoscopy; 82 percent of patients experiencing desaturations had laryngoscopy durations of 30 seconds or longer. There was no association between the number of intubation attempts and desaturation.

          Infection control precautions
         </strong>
         – For children with suspected highly contagious and virulent airborne pathogens such as early COVID-19 variants prior to the availability of effective vaccines, there is a significant risk for transmission during laryngoscopy, endotracheal intubation, and other airway management procedures. Techniques designed to improve patient care, minimize infectious risks to care providers, and decrease spread of pathogens are essential and provided separately. (See

          Contraindications and precautions
         </strong>
         – Assessment and management of the airway is always the first priority in caring for acutely ill or injured children. Thus, there are no absolute contraindications for endotracheal intubation (ETI) by appropriately trained providers. Relative contraindications are uncommon but do exist and primarily relate to the need to move to a more controlled environment or to perform a surgical approach to the airway. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Contraindications and precautions'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Preparation
         </strong>
         – Success in airway management depends on careful patient assessment, implementation of an appropriate ETI plan, and gathering and testing of all necessary equipment. Use of a pre-intubation checklist  (

          figure 3

          Procedure
         </strong>
         – The table provides a summary of emergency endotracheal intubation in children  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64481" href="/z/d/graphic/64481.html" rel="external">
          table 12
         </a>
         ). During emergency endotracheal intubation in children, we suggest video laryngoscopy (VL), if available, rather than traditional direct laryngoscopy (DL) (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). However, some experienced clinicians continue to prefer DL based upon their expertise and which device is most immediately available. A range of VL devices are available that include standard geometry and acute angle blades. Standard geometry blades permit both direct and indirect laryngoscopy and can be used in children with normal mouth opening and without concern for cervical spine injury. By contrast, acute angle blades permit only indirect laryngoscopy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Procedure'
         </a>
         above and

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Immediately following intubation, placement of the endotracheal tube (ETT) in the trachea must be confirmed using an end-tidal CO
