         The preoperative management of the patient with cancer can be complex. While patients with cancer are similar in many ways to those without cancer, the direct and indirect (systemic) effects of the cancer and the side effects of cancer therapy can influence perioperative evaluation and management. Here we will provide an overview of issues that are relevant to patients with current or past cancer. General preoperative evaluation and estimation of cardiac risk from surgery are discussed elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4816.html" rel="external">
          "Preoperative medical evaluation of the healthy adult patient"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The preoperative medical evaluation of cancer patients should include an assessment of nutritional status, functional status, and symptom control (particularly regarding cancer-related pain) in addition to an assessment of general medical issues. The natural history of the cancer and effects of any prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy should also be considered. The short- and long-term outcomes of cancer surgery in older patients can be equivalent to those in younger patients. Treatment considerations should be based on functional status, not on chronological age [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2808.html" rel="external">
          "Comprehensive geriatric assessment for patients with cancer"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The timing and purpose of the cancer surgery can affect perioperative evaluation. While rarely an emergency, cancer surgery is usually not elective, and therefore the amount of time available to medically optimize a patient may be limited.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is growing recognition that a patient's physiologic fitness for surgery plays a role in reducing perioperative complications. Patients with cancer tend to be deconditioned due to numerous factors. In this situation, where patients are taking numerous insults to their overall functional status, it may be beneficial to enroll patients into a prehabilitation program as soon as a cancer diagnosis is made  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113780" href="/z/d/graphic/113780.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to managing coexisting medical conditions, the internist may also play an important role in coordinating the many complex levels of care provided by surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and others.

         If possible, we recommend consultation with a nutritionist for all cancer patients for whom surgery is being contemplated, regardless of time to operation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with cancer may become significantly malnourished for a variety of reasons. Eating and drinking can be impaired by pain, nausea, stomatitis, or tumors involving the oropharynx or gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, metabolic aberrations may induce anorexia and weight loss. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2817.html" rel="external">
          "Pathogenesis, clinical features, and assessment of cancer cachexia"

        </p>
        <p>
         The indiscriminate use of enteral or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10307" href="/z/d/drug information/10307.html" rel="external">
          parenteral nutrition
         </a>
         is not indicated in well-nourished patients or those with mild malnutrition. Although many studies have failed to demonstrate a survival benefit from preoperative nutritional support in patients undergoing cancer surgery, some have found fewer operative complications and a shorter length of hospital stay in severely malnourished patients receiving nutritional support prior to major surgery for cancers of the digestive tract and the head and neck. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2830.html" rel="external">
          "The role of parenteral and enteral/oral nutritional support in patients with cancer", section on 'The perioperative setting'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         On the other hand, nutrition optimization is an important component of enhanced recovery programs for surgical patients. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/120301.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of prehabilitation for surgical patients", section on 'Nutritional supplementation'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, preoperative nutritional support for cancer patients may be reasonable in the following circumstances:

         Patients with cancer often require medication for pain control. Those who have been receiving opioid analgesics can be expected to have some degree of tolerance and may require dose escalation in the postoperative period to attain adequate pain control. Many patients will be receiving long-acting forms of opioids and may require conversion to short-acting forms of analgesia in the perioperative period. Conversion tables are available  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111216" href="/z/d/graphic/111216.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2795.html" rel="external">
          "Assessment of cancer pain"
         </a>
         and

          "Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         As in other surgical patients, medications used for pain control in patients with cancer can have important side effects. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause bleeding, gastritis, and impaired renal function, and opioids can cause nausea, constipation, sedation, and delirium. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2800.html" rel="external">
          "Prevention and management of side effects in patients receiving opioids for chronic pain"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         NSAIDs may be contraindicated in patients with thrombocytopenia from cancer or its treatment, and in patients with impaired renal function. Selective COX-2 inhibitors (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8847" href="/z/d/drug information/8847.html" rel="external">
          celecoxib
         </a>
         ) do not increase nongastrointestinal bleeding risk, but as with other NSAIDs, they do increase the risk of renal failure. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7992.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of COX-2 selective NSAIDs"

         Patients may have concerns about postoperative pain control. These should be addressed as part of the preoperative evaluation. The subject of managing acute pain in the patient on chronic opioid therapy is addressed elsewhere. (See

         The clinician must integrate information from the history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram (ECG) in order to develop an initial estimate of perioperative cardiac risk.

         An algorithmic approach to assessment of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery is provided  (

         The following sections address specific issues that arise in patients with cancer.

          —
         </span>
         Patients with cancer are at risk for malignant and non-malignant pericardial disease. Metastases to the pericardium can cause effusions, tamponade, and constrictive pericarditis. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4954.html" rel="external">
          "Pericardial disease associated with cancer: Clinical presentation and diagnosis"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Radiation therapy to the mediastinum can also cause constrictive pericarditis or effusions with or without tamponade. Pericarditis can present months to years after radiation treatment [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. (See

          "Cardiac tamponade"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Echocardiography should be performed if physical examination reveals findings consistent with tamponade or constriction (eg, hypotension, jugular venous distension, narrowed pulse pressure, distant heart sounds, or excessive respiratory variation in blood pressure) or if electrocardiography or imaging suggests a significant pericardial effusion.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tamponade and constrictive pericarditis must be treated prior to surgery whenever possible. Patients with asymptomatic malignant pericardial effusions should be carefully monitored for the development of tamponade in the perioperative period.

         Radiation therapy to fields that include the heart can lead to premature coronary heart disease (CHD). Radiation to the heart may also be associated with conduction abnormalities [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, younger patients who might not otherwise be expected to be at risk for CHD, but who have a history of thoracic radiation therapy for cancer, should be assessed for symptomatic CHD as part of the preoperative history and review of systems, and should have a preoperative screening ECG. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7062.html" rel="external">
          "Cardiotoxicity of radiation therapy for breast cancer and other malignancies"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Radiation therapy has also been associated with valvular heart disease, particularly of the mitral and aortic valves [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6
         </a>
         ]; therefore, careful cardiac auscultation is an important part of the preoperative examination. (See

        <p>
         However, antibiotic endocarditis prophylaxis is not necessarily indicated. The 2007 American Heart Association guideline for the prevention of infective endocarditis (which was updated in 2008) narrowed the indications for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis, compared with prior versions, in recognition of the absence of strong supportive evidence [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. Antimicrobial prophylaxis is not indicated unless the patient has a history of endocarditis. Guidelines from the combined American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology and the European Society of Cardiology are largely in agreement with this approach [

         Electrocardiographic abnormalities such as sinus tachycardia, premature atrial or ventricular contractions, nonspecific ST and T wave changes, and low-voltage QRS complexes may be early signs of cardiotoxicity, but are insensitive indicators of myocardial dysfunction. Assessment of left ventricular function before surgery should be considered in patients who are at risk for cardiomyopathy since they are at increased risk for heart failure [

         Patients with tumors in or adjacent to the central airway are at risk for airway obstruction. Stridor, or other signs or symptoms of upper airway obstruction, should be assessed preoperatively by laryngoscopy. (See

         Anterior and middle mediastinal masses can compress the lower airways, heart, and major vessels. This can lead to life-threatening airway obstruction or to cardiopulmonary arrest during any phase of general anesthesia [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, the preoperative evaluation of a patient with an anterior or middle mediastinal mass should include a detailed review for respiratory symptoms including stridor, dyspnea, wheezing, and orthopnea, and examination for evidence of neck or chest vein engorgement or swelling restricted to the face and neck. Imaging of the chest with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiography should be performed to look for central airway, cardiac, or vascular compression. Flow volume loops should also be obtained to look for central airway compromise. (See

         If surgery is being performed for the purpose of pathologic diagnosis of a mediastinal tumor that is causing compression, serious consideration should be given to alternate diagnostic strategies that would not require general anesthesia, such as lymph node biopsy or pleural or sputum cytology. However, in patients with superior vena cava syndrome, invasive procedures such as bronchoscopy and thoracoscopy can be safely carried out under general anesthesia with minimal risk of complications.

         Preoperative hyponatremia can occur in cancer patients, and may be attributed to paraneoplastic effects of the tumor or be caused by treatments. (See

        <p>
         Preoperative hyponatremia may be associated with increased risk for postoperative complications. In a cohort study of 964,263 adults undergoing major surgery at one of 200 hospitals over a five-year period, a preoperative serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/L was associated with significantly higher postoperative 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.44), and significantly higher rates of major adverse cardiac events (aOR 1.21), surgical site infection (aOR 1.24), and pneumonia (aOR 1.17), as well as a longer postoperative hospitalization (by a median of one day) [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Because the association was actually stronger for lower-risk surgeries and for younger patients, and was independent of the time prior to surgery that the serum sodium was measured, hyponatremia is likely not the direct cause of postoperative complications, but instead a marker for impaired fluid and electrolyte homeostasis associated with chronic conditions, such as chronic heart failure.
        </p>
        <p>
         Therefore, the best approach to the patient with preoperative hyponatremia may be to identify the underlying impairment(s), avoid exacerbating the hyponatremia with hypotonic intravenous solutions, and to closely monitor and carefully manage the patient in the postoperative period [
         <a href="#rid18">

         Adrenal insufficiency can occur in cancer patients as a result of adrenal suppression from chronic glucocorticoid treatment, or less commonly, from metastatic disease to both adrenal glands. Adrenal insufficiency is also described as a rare complication of immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. (See

         The presence or absence of adrenal suppression, and therefore the need for perioperative "stress-dose" glucocorticoid coverage, can usually be predicted from the dose and duration of the patient's glucocorticoid therapy (see

         Carcinoid crisis is a life-threatening form of carcinoid syndrome that develops in patients with serotonin-producing well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors, primarily those arising in the gastrointestinal tract (carcinoid tumors), and may be triggered by tumor manipulation (palpation at the bedside, biopsy, or during surgery) or by induction of anesthesia. Carcinoid crisis presumably arises because of the release of an overwhelming amount of biologically active compounds, such as catecholamines, that are produced by the tumor. Symptoms include flushing, diarrhea, tachycardia, arrhythmias, hypertension or hypotension, bronchospasm, and delirium. (See

Some form of preoperative pharmacologic preparation is indicated for all patients with catecholamine-secreting neoplasms, including pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. Preoperative medical therapy (typically starting with pharmacologic alpha-adrenergic followed by beta-adrenergic blockade) is aimed at controlling hypertension (including preventing a hypertensive crisis during surgery) and ensuring adequate intravascular volume prior to surgery.

         Anemia is common in cancer patients, and it is frequently undertreated. Anemia is associated with impaired performance status and poorer postoperative outcomes. In addition, anemia is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in cancer patients [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23-30

        <p>
         Iron deficiency commonly contributes to anemia in cancer patients, particularly in patients with gastrointestinal malignancies [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>

         <a href="#rid32">
          32-38
         </a>
         ]. In addition to encouraging iron-rich foods  (

          table 5
         </a>
         ), oral iron supplementation and intravenous iron replacement should be considered on an individual basis. Intravenous iron replacement has become safer and is likely to more rapidly replete iron stores than oral iron [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33,39-41
         </a>

         The optimal approach for preoperative management of anemic patients who are not iron deficient is debated. The use of erythropoietin-stimulating agents in the preoperative period may increase thrombotic complications. Such agents may also stimulate neoplastic growth, thereby increasing the risk of recurrence and of secondary cancers, such as transitional cell cancers of the urinary tract. (See

         Blood transfusion might be appropriate for a severely anemic patient at risk for demand ischemia of the heart, brain, or kidneys due to the expected physiologic stress of surgery [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42,43

Whether this reflects an independent effect of the transfusion or anemia severe enough to necessitate transfusion is simply a marker of the severity of the underlying disease remains uncertain. Concerns about blood transfusion have also included potential immunosuppression and the risk of transmitting or inducing cancer. At least some data suggest that restricted transfusion practices may be associated with better outcomes [

         Although autologous blood transfusion has the benefit of reducing the risk of an immune reaction, it is more expensive, administratively more complicated and therefore more likely to create an error in the process, and unlikely to be a consideration in cancer patients because there is seldom time before surgery to allow the patient to recover from autologous donation.

         Whenever possible, nonemergency surgery should be postponed in neutropenic patients. Postoperative fever is common, and if it develops in the setting of neutropenia, aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are necessary. As discussed in more detail separately, neutropenic fever in any setting requires the prompt administration of broad spectrum antimicrobials. Even when neutropenia has resolved, patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy remain relatively immunocompromised for a period of time. (See

         Paraneoplastic syndromes that affect neuromuscular function are relatively rare, but are of particular concern in the perioperative period because treatment with anesthetic agents can exacerbate neuromuscular dysfunction, leading to respiratory failure or delayed extubation. Although a wide variety of tumor types may be responsible, many of these neuromuscular paraneoplastic syndromes arise in the setting of small cell lung cancer. Treatment of the cancer may occasionally mitigate these symptoms. (See

         Routine imaging of the central nervous system is not mandatory in patients with cancer prior to surgery. However, radiographic imaging of the brain may be warranted in the setting of unexplained symptoms referable to the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, if prophylactic anticoagulation is planned, radiographic screening for brain metastases (preferably with magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) should be pursued in those patients whose tumors have a propensity to spread to the CNS and spontaneously bleed, including melanoma, small cell carcinoma of the lung, choriocarcinoma, renal cell, breast, adenocarcinoma of the lung, or thyroid cancer. Patients with other systemic cancers should also be imaged if there are any symptoms suggesting brain metastasis (eg, headache, mental status changes, seizures, other neurologic symptoms). The presence of untreated CNS metastases represents a relative contraindication to systemic anticoagulation in this setting, while active intracranial bleeding is an absolute contraindication. (See

         Patients with mass lesions that could compromise the upper central airway are at increased risk for perioperative respiratory failure, and should have airway patency assessed preoperatively. (See

         Patients with a mediastinal mass are also at increased risk for perioperative cardiopulmonary failure. Before surgery, obtain chest cross-sectional imaging echocardiography, and flow-volume loop measurements. Those with evidence of cardiac, vascular, or airway compression require special perioperative management. (See
