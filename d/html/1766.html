         Diet is one of the most important behavioral aspects of diabetes treatment. Basic principles of nutritional management, however, are often poorly understood by both clinicians and their patients. The role of nutrition and the development of a medical nutrition therapy (MNT) plan for a patient with type 2 diabetes are discussed here. Nutrition for patients with type 1 diabetes, as well as diets for the prevention of diabetes and for weight loss in general, are discussed separately.

         Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is the process by which a registered dietitian-nutritionist (RDN) tailors a meal planning approach specific to a patient's underlying condition and including medical, lifestyle, and personal factors. It is an integral component of diabetes management and diabetes self-management education [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Randomized controlled trials of MNT compared with usual care (initial lifestyle consult with infrequent follow-up) have demonstrated decreases in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) of approximately 2 percent in newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes and 1 percent in patients with an average four years' duration of type 2 diabetes [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The five components of MNT include:

        <p>
         The process of MNT involves selecting an appropriate meal planning approach and educational materials based on assessment of a person's ability or willingness to learn, motivation to make changes in eating habits, clinical and nutrition goals, diabetes medications, activity level, and lifestyle [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. MNT clinical practice guidelines recommend a series of three to six encounters with a registered dietitian lasting for 45 to 90 minutes. The series of encounters should ideally begin at diagnosis of diabetes, or at first referral to a dietitian for MNT, and should be completed within six months. The dietitian can then reassess diabetes-related outcomes and discuss with the patient whether additional MNT encounters are needed. At least one follow-up MNT encounter is recommended annually to reinforce lifestyle changes and evaluate and monitor diabetes-related outcomes [
         <a href="#rid1">

         Several formulas are available to estimate baseline caloric intake for weight maintenance. A commonly used formula considers the patient's age, sex, height, weight, and usual level of physical activity  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66100" href="/z/d/graphic/66100.html" rel="external">

         A rough estimate of daily caloric needs to maintain body weight can be determined as follows [

         Major emphasis should be placed on portion control and healthy food choices to lower caloric intake and induce weight loss for patients with type 2 diabetes who are overweight (BMI ≥25 to 29.9 kg/m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         ) and obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         ), as weight loss can improve diabetes management as well as comorbidities (blood pressure and lipids). Improved glycemia induced by weight loss is associated with partial correction of the two major metabolic abnormalities in type 2 diabetes: insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Caloric restriction, even before significant weight loss, will result in short-term improvement in glycemic management. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) falls within several days of calorie restriction, possibly due to a fall in hepatic glucose output [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,10,11
         </a>
         ]. However, long-term reduction in FBG concentration depends upon weight loss; blood glucose values increase slightly when the patient resumes a weight maintenance diet [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>

         ) or obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         ), initial recommendations for weight loss and physical activity are to lose 5 to 10 percent of initial body weight [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ] and to accumulate at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity over the course of most days of the week [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ]. Once initial weight goals are met, further goals should be determined based on assessment of the impact of the weight loss on FBG and the patient's willingness to lose more weight.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients need not reach ideal body weight to achieve improvement in health status, particularly if the patient engages in regular exercise [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. A sustained weight loss of even 5 to 10 percent of initial body weight in overweight individuals can have a lasting beneficial impact on serum glucose, dyslipidemia, and hypertension [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13,16-18
         </a>
         ]. In Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes), a randomized trial of an intensive lifestyle intervention to increase physical activity and decrease caloric intake versus standard diabetes education in people with type 2 diabetes, a modest weight loss of 8.6 percent of initial weight at one year was associated with significant improvements in blood pressure, glycemic management, FBG, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride levels and significant reductions in the use of diabetes, hypertension, and lipid-lowering medications [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. After a median follow-up of 9.6 years, the difference in weight loss was attenuated but remained significant, and there were greater reductions in A1C and improvements in fitness and some cardiovascular risk factors [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. The cardiovascular effects of the intensive lifestyle intervention are reviewed in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1779.html" rel="external">
          "Initial management of hyperglycemia in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus", section on 'Intensive lifestyle modification'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The Look AHEAD trial and the Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT) both highlight the potential role of weight loss in achieving diabetes remission. In Look AHEAD, patients in the lifestyle intervention were more likely to experience complete or partial remission of diabetes compared with the diabetes support and education group (11.5 percent during the first year and 7.3 percent at year 4, compared with 2 percent for the diabetes support and education group at both time points) [

          Counting calories and fat grams
         </strong>
         – Counting calories and fat is a well-recognized means of weight loss and was the strategy selected for achieving weight reduction for both the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and Look AHEAD trials [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23,24
         </a>
         ]. Participants were coached on calorie and fat gram counting and given reference booklets. Calorie and fat gram targets were based on initial body weight and targets were selected to promote weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds per week, providing 25 to 30 percent of calories from fat and &lt;10 percent saturated fat. In Look AHEAD, the calorie and fat gram goals were as follows:

          Meal replacements
         </strong>
         – Meal replacements can facilitate weight loss, improve glycemia, reduce cardiovascular risk factors, and promote effective weight maintenance for periods as long as four to five years [

          22,25-33
         </a>
         ]. Formula shakes, bars, or soups can be used to replace some (or all) meals and snacks to achieve weight loss and weight maintenance. In a meta-analysis of 17 trials in 2112 participants with type 2 diabetes, meal replacement of 4 to 52 weeks duration led to greater reductions in A1C (mean difference -0.46 percentage points) and body weight (mean reduction -2.4 kg) compared with control diets (typically the carbohydrate exchange system) [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. Total meal replacement conferred greater reductions in A1C and body weight compared with partial meal replacement, and the metabolic benefits of meal replacement did not differ between individuals on insulin and non-insulin therapy. However, all but one of the included studies were less than five months in duration, calling into question the relevance of these findings to management of a chronic disease.

         Meal replacements in the form of liquid shakes and bars and portion-controlled servings of conventional foods have been used in both the DPP and Look AHEAD. In the Look AHEAD lifestyle intervention, use of meal replacements, which was not a randomized intervention, was associated with significantly more weight loss. Although this association should not be used to suggest causality, it is notable that the lifestyle intervention participants with the highest meal replacement use (approximately 12 meal replacements per week) had a mean weight loss of 11.2 percent, and those with the lowest use (approximately two meal replacements per week) lost 5.9 percent of initial weight after the first year of the intervention [

          Exchange system approach
         </strong>
         – The exchange system was developed in 1950 by the American Dietetic Association (now called the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics), the American Diabetes Association (ADA), and the United States Public Health Service as an educational tool to provide consistency in meal planning and allow a wider variety of food choices for people with diabetes [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36
         </a>
         ]. Originally, the exchange lists categorized foods into six groups: starch/bread, meat and meat substitutes, vegetables, fruit, milk, and fat. Each portion of food listed within a group was "exchangeable" because it contained approximately the same nutritional value in terms of calories, carbohydrate, protein, and fat.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The food groups have been more recently categorized into three groups, to simplify the teaching of carbohydrate consistency concepts. These three groups are carbohydrate, meat and meat substitutes, and fat  (

          Time-restricted eating
         </strong>

         , mean A1C 8.1 percent), participants were randomly assigned to time-restricted eating (eating window of 12:00 PM to 8:00 PM), caloric restriction (goal of 25 percent calorie reduction), or control (participants continued their typical activity and dietary patterns) [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. Compared with the control group, time-restricted eating led to body weight loss (mean difference -3.56 percent), whereas body weight loss was not significant with caloric restriction (mean difference -1.78 percent). Time-restricted eating and caloric restriction reduced A1C comparably (mean difference -0.91 and -0.94 percentage points, respectively, compared with controls). Time-restricted eating led to a decrease in daily caloric intake of 313 kcal, whereas intake decreased by 197 kcal per day with caloric restriction and 16 kcal per day in the control group. Additional real-world and trial data are needed to establish whether such eating patterns are sustainable and demonstrate long-term efficacy.

         Exercise is an important component of diabetes management. Benefits of exercise include improved glycemia, reduction in body weight and comorbidities (hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease [CVD], and depression), and improved quality of life. (See

         Patients with diabetes, in particular those treated with medications that can cause hypoglycemia (such as insulin or sulfonylureas), should check blood glucose levels before and after exercising, especially in the beginning of an exercise program as patterns are established. Monitoring of blood glucose can both identify hypoglycemia and provide feedback to patients on the beneficial impact of exercise on glycemic management. (See

         Although patients with type 2 diabetes are more resistant to hypoglycemia than patients with type 1 diabetes, patients who are treated with hypoglycemic medications or insulin may benefit from meal planning to achieve carbohydrate consistency. Management of carbohydrate consumption and appropriate insulin adjustments for identified quantities of carbohydrate can improve glycemic management since carbohydrate intake directly determines postprandial blood glucose [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. Older "conventional" insulin regimens, with fixed doses of short- and intermediate-acting insulins, require more consistency in timing and amounts of carbohydrate intake to avoid fluctuations in glucose values. However, flexible insulin dosing regimens, incorporating a long-acting insulin to provide basal levels and a rapid-acting insulin for premeal bolus doses, allow for adjustments of insulin dose for variations in carbohydrate intake. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1752.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Carbohydrate consistency may also be helpful for patients with erratic blood glucose patterns, including problems with hypoglycemia. In addition, reducing overall carbohydrate content at meals and snacks has been shown to improve glycemic management and can be applied in a variety of eating patterns [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. Pre- and post-meal blood glucose monitoring data can then help to determine if adjustments to carbohydrate intake at meals and snacks will be sufficient, or if medication(s) need to be combined with MNT [

        </p>

          Basic carbohydrate counting
         </strong>
         – The goal of carbohydrate counting for patients with type 2 diabetes is to promote glycemic management by implementing a consistent pattern of carbohydrate consumption with meals and snacks. Patients who have been instructed in basic carbohydrate counting consume a predetermined total amount of carbohydrate proportioned throughout the day, calculated in grams of carbohydrate per food portion. The target amount of carbohydrate is usually based on nutrition goals and usual eating patterns. There is controversy about the optimal amount of carbohydrate consumption. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Nutritional content'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Patients need to be comfortable with simple arithmetic computations. Most patients will require specific training in carbohydrate counting, usually by a registered dietitian, to set an appropriate target and learn to measure or estimate portion size  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51729" href="/z/d/graphic/51729.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For those who are not able to do basic carbohydrate counting, another option is to teach the diabetes plate method. This commonly used approach provides basic meal planning guidance and has been shown to help achieve improved glycemic management [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. This method uses a simple graphic of a 9-inch plate to show how to portion foods (one-half plate as non-starchy vegetables, one-quarter plate as lean protein, and one-quarter plate for carbohydrates such as starches or grains). This balanced plate method is a viable option for those who have challenges with numeracy and food literacy or for those who need a simplified approach for achieving moderation of carbohydrate intake and better carbohydrate consistency [

         <strong>
          Advanced carbohydrate counting
         </strong>
         – At a more advanced level, carbohydrate counting focuses on adjustment of food, insulin, and activity based on patterns from detailed logs. Patients treated with flexible insulin dosing can determine how much rapid-acting insulin is needed to cover a certain amount of carbohydrate. Pre- and post-meal blood glucose monitoring data can help to determine if the insulin dose is correct. As an example, a patient may have been told to eat 60 grams of carbohydrate with their evening meal and precede this with 4 units of rapid-acting insulin. This means that they are using 1 unit to cover every 15 grams, and they can decrease their insulin dose proportionately if they plan to eat less carbohydrate at a meal. Facility with carbohydrate counting strategies becomes essential in making these adjustments.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Patients vary considerably in the amount of insulin required to cover a set amount of carbohydrate; some patients need a different insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio at different meals. Once the ratio is established, patients have freedom to vary the amount of carbohydrate ingested at particular meals. (See

         Consistent timing of food intake is an important aspect of nutrition in type 2 diabetes patients treated with insulin secretagogues or traditional insulin regimens [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38,41
         </a>
         ]. Insulin regimens that are based on the injection of roughly the same amount of insulin at the same time each day (twice-daily premix or basal plus oral medications) require some attention to consistency in meal timing. If meal time varies widely, then blood glucose profiles will fluctuate as well, with little chance of achieving low A1C values without a substantial risk of hypoglycemia. In contrast, basal-bolus insulin regimens offer patients with type 2 diabetes who require insulin more flexibility in meal timing. Meal timing consistency is also important for patients with type 2 diabetes who are taking oral medications that promote insulin secretion, such as sulfonylureas or meglitinides.

         The impact of specific dietary composition on weight change remains uncertain. When energy from dietary carbohydrates decreases, energy from fat or protein sources must increase. The reverse is also true; when energy from dietary fats decreases, energy from carbohydrate or protein sources increases. The debate has mainly centered on whether low-fat or low-carbohydrate diets can better induce weight loss and sustain it over the long-term. The relative importance of other dietary factors is also unknown; these include protein, types of fat, fiber (especially soluble), acid content of foods, particle size, food processing regimens, and rate and efficiency of digestion and absorption of different nutrients [

         The optimal macronutrient composition of the diet for patients with diabetes should be individualized based upon weight loss goals, other metabolic needs (eg, hypertension, dyslipidemia, nephropathy), and food preferences. A dietary pattern of healthful foods should be chosen, rather than focusing on a specific nutrient. Choosing a macronutrient mix based upon patient preferences may improve long-term adherence to the dietary prescription.

          Mediterranean diet

         As an example, in a four-year trial of a low-carbohydrate Mediterranean-style diet (≤50 percent complex carbohydrates, ≥30 percent mono- and polyunsaturated fat) versus a low-fat (&lt;30 percent) diet in 215 overweight patients with newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes, patients randomly assigned to the Mediterranean diet were less likely to require antihyperglycemic drugs (44 versus 70 percent) [

However, there was no difference in weight loss between the two groups at years 3 and 4. Throughout the four years of the trial, the increase in HDL and decrease in triglycerides were significantly greater in the Mediterranean diet group. Following completion of the trial, all participants were invited to enter a previously unplanned monitoring program, which consisted of twice-yearly visits as participants continued to follow the assigned diet. At the end of eight years, the Mediterranean diet delayed the time to initiation of glucose-lowering medication (median 4.8 versus 2.8 years with the low-fat diet) [

          Dietary fat
         </strong>
         – People with type 2 diabetes typically consume diets that are higher in total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol than is recommended. Median intake of saturated fat is reported to be approximately 13 percent of calories, with 85 percent of persons exceeding the saturated fat recommendation of less than 10 percent [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55
         </a>
         ]. Patients with diabetes who are consuming diets higher in fat must reduce saturated fat intake and also assure that their diet is adequate in sources of lean protein, fiber content, and essential vitamins and minerals. The type of fat consumed is critical for the prevention and treatment of CVD. Trans fat (hydrogenated fats) are atherogenic, while mono- and polyunsaturated fats (particularly omega-3 fatty acids) are protective. Different saturated fatty acids and different food sources of saturated fat have divergent effects on cardiovascular and metabolic health. There is some evidence that replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat reduces fasting glucose, A1C, and insulin resistance and that replacing carbohydrates, saturated fat, or monounsaturated fat with polyunsaturated fat improves insulin secretion capacity [

         Foods containing the same amount of carbohydrate can have significantly different glycemic effects. In general, foods with higher fiber content have a lower glycemic index. These differences led to the development of the concepts of glycemic index and glycemic load. A more detailed discussion of the glycemic index is presented separately. (See

        <p>
         For patients with type 2 diabetes, low glycemic index diets may provide a modest benefit in terms of controlling postprandial hyperglycemia, especially in individuals previously consuming a high glycemic index diet [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58

          1,5,59

         Moderate amounts of alcohol, when ingested with food, do not significantly increase plasma glucose or serum insulin; however, the carbohydrate content of the non-alcohol component of a mixed drink may raise blood glucose. For patients who choose to ingest alcohol, intake should be limited to no more than one drink per day for women or two drinks per day for men. Alcohol should be consumed with food. For patients who need to lose weight, the excess calories from alcohol need to be considered.

         , mean dose 2 g daily for 4 to 16 weeks) in patients with diabetes (predominantly type 2) did not show a significant beneficial effect of cinnamon on A1C, postprandial glucose, or serum insulin levels [
         <a href="#rid70">
          70
         </a>
         ]. The effect of cinnamon on FBG levels was inconclusive due to significant heterogeneity among the point estimates. In contrast, another meta-analysis of eight trials found a significant lowering in FBG (-8.8 mg/dL [-0.49 mmol/L]) in patients with type 2 diabetes randomly assigned to cinnamon [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71

         The dietary history, along with several days of food records, is helpful in an assessment of caloric intake and carbohydrate consistency. Recognizing that this is not always possible in the context of the clinician visit, a brief 24-hour recall will usually provide an assessment that will serve as a basis for initial changes and can be improved upon at follow-up visits.

         Once sufficient data are obtained, changes can be advised to move the patient toward a more healthful diet. The patient's own food, activity, medication dosing and adherence, blood glucose records, and readiness to change can be helpful in guiding choices between a detailed exchange system, calorie and fat gram counting, use of meal replacements, a focus on carbohydrate counting, the diabetes plate method, or individualized behavioral goals; decisions between these options are made on an individual basis [

         During follow-up visits, ask specifically about diet and exercise to reinforce their importance. Ideally, a patient should be able to quote his or her dietary and exercise prescription in detail. Patients requiring insulin and using carbohydrate counting will also need to be able to specify how many grams of carbohydrate they aim to eat at each meal and snack during the day.

         Periodic adjustments are necessary in the patient's comprehensive plan for diet, exercise, stress, and pharmacologic interventions to achieve and maintain optimal glycemic management and prevent complications. The four critical times for providers to make medical nutrition therapy (MNT) referrals are at diagnosis; annually and/or when not meeting treatment targets; when medical, physical, or psychological complicating factors develop; and when transitions in life and care occur [
         <a href="#rid79">
          79

         Patients taking insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications that increase insulin secretion should be well trained in methods to treat hypoglycemia, for example during or after exercise, to prevent overcompensation. A pattern of overtreating hypoglycemia can result in a greater than desired rise in blood glucose and increased calorie intake, resulting in weight gain. In the long-term, it is better to adjust medications or insulin to compensate for increased activity (or a reduced calorie intake) rather than add extra snacks in patients with type 2 diabetes, as most are trying to lose weight or manage weight.

          Medical nutrition therapy plan
         </strong>
         – The medical nutrition therapy (MNT) plan is the process by which a registered dietitian-nutritionist (RDN) tailors a meal planning approach for people with diabetes based on medical, lifestyle, and personal factors. It is an integral component of diabetes management and diabetes self-management education. The five components of MNT are weight management and physical activity, caloric intake, day-to-day carbohydrate consistency, nutritional content, and meal timing. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Definition'

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The MNT for patients with type 2 diabetes should optimally manage the "ABCs" of diabetes control: glycated hemoglobin (

          Weight management
         </strong>
         – Major emphasis should be placed on the benefits of lowering caloric intake and inducing weight loss for patients with type 2 diabetes and overweight (body mass index [BMI] ≥25 to 29.9 kg/m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         ) and obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         ). A sustained weight loss of even 5 to 10 percent of initial body weight in can have a lasting beneficial impact on serum glucose, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Weight management'

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Physical activity, diet, and behavioral modification are important components of all programs to accomplish weight loss. There are additional options for weight loss, including addition of medication to promote weight loss and bariatric surgery. (See

          Carbohydrate consistency
         </strong>
         – Although patients with type 2 diabetes are more resistant to hypoglycemia than patients with type 1 diabetes, patients who are treated with hypoglycemic medications or insulin may benefit from meal planning to achieve carbohydrate consistency. Carbohydrate consistency may also be helpful for patients with erratic blood glucose patterns, including problems with hypoglycemia. In addition, reducing overall carbohydrate content at meals and snacks has been shown to improve glycemic management and can be applied in a variety of eating patterns. (See

         <strong>
          Meal timing
         </strong>
         – Consistent timing of food intake is an important aspect of nutrition in type 2 diabetes patients treated with insulin secretagogues or traditional insulin regimens. If meal time varies widely, then blood glucose profiles will fluctuate as well, with little chance of achieving low A1C values without a substantial risk of hypoglycemia. (See

          'Timing of food intake'

         <strong>
          Macronutrient composition
         </strong>
         – The impact of specific dietary composition on glycemic management and cardiovascular risk remains uncertain. The optimal macronutrient composition of the diet for patients with diabetes should be individualized, based upon weight loss goals, other metabolic needs (eg, hypertension, dyslipidemia, nephropathy), and food preferences. A diet that includes carbohydrates from fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and low-fat milk is encouraged. It is important to distinguish between types of fat in the diet, lowering saturated and avoiding hydrogenated fats, while consistently including monounsaturated and omega-3 fatty acids in the diet. Protein intake should be appropriate to medical condition. (See

         <strong>
          Promoting adherence
         </strong>
         – Adherence can be fostered by engaging in person-centered collaborative care that is guided by shared decision-making in treatment selection and monitoring of an individualized nutrition care plan that incorporates and is respectful of the individual preferences, needs, goals, values, and life experiences of the person with diabetes.
