They are associated with high rates of psychiatric comorbidity and high risks of morbidity and mortality.</p><p>First-line treatment of these disorders is psychotherapy; however, patients with personality disorders may be highly symptomatic and are often prescribed multiple medications in a manner unsupported by evidence. In the absence of trials comparing medications or consensus-based clinical practice guidelines, there is limited information to guide adjunctive pharmacotherapy. Preliminary evidence from meta-analyses of clinical trials provides an early basis to guide treatment and limit the practice of polypharmacy. However, the evidence remains limited by lack of published studies and limitations in study design and sample size. Therefore, clinical practice is largely guided by expert opinion and experience, which support the efficacy of low-dose antipsychotics and mood stabilizers when applied to specified symptom domains.</p><p>Pharmacotherapy for personality disorders is reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, diagnosis and treatment of individual personality disorders are reviewed separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6617.html" rel="external">"Overview of personality disorders"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14760.html" rel="external">"Antisocial personality disorder: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, course, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14643.html" rel="external">"Antisocial personality disorder: Treatment overview"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6619.html" rel="external">"Borderline personality disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, course, assessment, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6618.html" rel="external">"Borderline personality disorder: Psychotherapy"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14766.html" rel="external">"Narcissistic personality disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/108421.html" rel="external">"Narcissistic personality disorder: Treatment overview"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14771.html" rel="external">"Schizotypal personality disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/112012.html" rel="external">"Schizotypal personality disorder: Psychotherapy"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/116590.html" rel="external">"Schizotypal personality disorder: Treatment overview"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26308340"><span class="h1">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>As with other psychiatric disorders and chronic conditions generally, a comprehensive treatment plan that addresses the biological, psychological, and social needs of the patient is useful in promoting mental health, wellness, and overall recovery.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prior to treatment, the accuracy of all psychiatric diagnoses should be evaluated, as patients with personality disorders are sometimes misdiagnosed. As an example, a patient with borderline personality disorder may be incorrectly diagnosed with bipolar disorder.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In general, first-line treatment for personality disorders is psychotherapy. Symptom-focused, medication treatment of personality disorders is generally considered to be an adjunct to psychotherapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/108262.html" rel="external">"Borderline personality disorder: Treatment overview"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6618.html" rel="external">"Borderline personality disorder: Psychotherapy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/108421.html" rel="external">"Narcissistic personality disorder: Treatment overview"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/116590.html" rel="external">"Schizotypal personality disorder: Treatment overview"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy may be delivered comprehensively by a single clinician [<a href="#rid1">1</a>] or can be delivered collaboratively by separate clinicians. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14762.html" rel="external">"Collaboration between prescribing physicians and psychotherapists in mental health care"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoid prescribing medications that can be fatal in overdose, such as tricyclic antidepressants. The risk of death by intentional or accidental suicide should be directly discussed rather than minimized or avoided. (See <a class="local">'Suicidality'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1708.html" rel="external">"Suicidal ideation and behavior in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoid prescribing medications that can induce physiological dependence and tolerance, including benzodiazepines, which are especially toxic when combined with alcohol or opioids. An additional risk of benzodiazepines is behavioral disinhibition associated with this class of medications in patients with personality disorders [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoid changing medication each time there is a crisis or change in mood symptoms, which may occur frequently and suddenly, and also remit suddenly in some people with personality disorders. Prescribing medication at the time of a crisis often lacks a specific target symptom as well as an endpoint upon which the effects of a medication can be judged.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Symptom expression in patients with personality disorders often waxes and wanes in relationship to life circumstances. Thus, it may take a number of months to determine whether a particular medication is helpful. Premature additions or changes to medications can lead to unnecessary, ineffective, and/or potentially harmful treatment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Education and communication with the patient and key members of their support system (with the patient's consent) may reduce the likelihood of repeated, premature requests to increase or "augment" the medication.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients seeking relief from intense or temporary symptoms such as panic or depersonalization, consider applying stimulation to the parasympathetic nervous system through the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Applying ice or ice-cold water to the face (mammalian dive reflex) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>“Paced” breathing techniques – The exhalation phase is at least two to four counts longer than the inhalation phase (eg, inhale while counting to four and exhale while counting to eight) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Stimulation of the vagal nerve in this manner, in our clinical experience, results in an immediate, direct relief of intense emotions, in contrast to orally administered medications, which do not result in immediate relief due to the necessity for absorption into the body.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Disclose to patients in the United States that using a medication to treat their symptoms of a personality disorder lies outside of a specific US Food and Drug Administration-approved indications for use of medications.

In general, individuals with personality disorders respond less robustly to medication as compared with individuals with mood, anxiety, or psychotic disorders. However, we have found the addition of medication to be useful for patients with symptoms that are more severe, cause greater impairment, and/or do not respond to nonpharmacologic treatment.</p><p>The decision to use medications should be reached through shared decision-making with the patient.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H278379783"><span class="h2">Factors that inform medication selection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Based on clinical experience, we typically select which medication to use based on:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Which symptom domain includes the most impairing of the patient’s symptoms? Which medications are efficacious in treating that domain? (See <a class="local">'Targeted symptom domains'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If multiple medication classes are similarly efficacious, which has the fewest adverse effects?

For each symptom domain, meta-analyses compared the efficacy of the three medication classes using effect sizes from placebo-controlled trials of individual medications [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1944031276"><span class="h2">Targeted symptom domains</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Symptom domains that cause impairment and distress across personality disorders are discussed below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4071202394"><span class="h3">Cognitive and perceptual disturbances</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We typically use a low dose of antipsychotic medications to treat disruptive stress-related, cognitive-perceptual disturbances in individuals with severe personality disorders. Meta-analyses comparing placebo-controlled clinical trials have found that low-dose antipsychotic drugs are more effective than antidepressants or mood stabilizers for treatment of these symptoms [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Administration of low-dose antipsychotic medications is discussed elsewhere. (See <a class="local">'Administration'</a> below.)</p><p>A meta-analysis of five clinical trials of antipsychotics compared with placebo in patients with personality disorders found a moderate effect for cognitive-perceptual symptoms (standardized mean difference = 0.56) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. No effects of antidepressants or mood stabilizers on cognitive-perceptual symptoms were seen.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2526658528"><span class="h3">Impulsivity or behavioral dyscontrol</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We typically use mood stabilizers for the treatment of impulsivity and behavioral dyscontrol in patients with severe personality disorders. For those who also demonstrate recurrent self-harm, we typically add omega-3 fatty acids as an adjunct to a mood stabilizer, given their benign side effect profile and preliminary evidence suggesting efficacy. Administration of these medications is discussed elsewhere. (See <a class="local">'Administration'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mood stabilizers </strong>– Meta-analyses have found that mood stabilizers are more effective than antidepressants or antipsychotics in the treatment of impulsivity and behavior dyscontrol in individuals with severe personality disorders [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Specific trials of mood stabilizers in the treatment of behavior dyscontrol in individuals with personality disorders have been mixed. For example, in a meta-analysis of six clinical trials including 172 individuals, mood stabilizers resulted in a very large effect size for symptoms of impulsivity or behavioral dyscontrol (standardized mean difference 1.51, 95% CI 0.42-2.59) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. However, in another trial that included 276 individuals with borderline personality disorder and was not included in the meta-analysis, no clinically relevant differences were seen in outcomes comparing <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9545" href="/z/d/drug information/9545.html" rel="external">lamotrigine</a> versus placebo [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. However, a limitation of that trial was a failure to target the intervention to participants experiencing primarily affective instability and/or impulsivity as the targeted symptom domain, which may have diluted any effect.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Omega-3 fatty acids</strong> – In a meta-analysis with pooled data from four randomized clinical trials studying the use of marine omega-3 fatty acids in participants with borderline personality disorder, moderate quality evidence of clinical benefit to domains of impulsivity and affective symptoms was found [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1165057918"><span class="h3">Affective dysregulation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We typically use mood stabilizers or low-dose antipsychotic medications for the treatment of affective dysregulation in this population.

Regular medication management visits will support the development of a therapeutic clinician-patient relationship and provide a framework for ongoing psychoeducation regarding treatment goals and expectations. We use the following methods to foster treatment adherence: (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16980.html" rel="external">"Approaches to the therapeutic relationship in patients with personality disorders"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Seeing patients more frequently</strong> – In order to engage patients and foster treatment adherence, seeing patients weekly or twice per month may be helpful. For patients regularly engaged in psychotherapy with another provider, it may be possible to space appointments at monthly intervals or longer. As patients learn to more capably manage their personality disorder symptoms, they may not need to be seen as frequently. In some cases, their care may be transferred to a primary care provider.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Increasing the length of visits</strong> – For complex patients, a visit length of 30 to 60 minutes is usually necessary in order to establish the therapeutic frame, convey empathy and compassion, provide psychoeducation, manage expectations, and work together to advance the treatment plan. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16980.html" rel="external">"Approaches to the therapeutic relationship in patients with personality disorders"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14764.html" rel="external">"Overview of the therapeutic relationship in psychiatric practice"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Validating symptoms</strong> – Patients with personality disorders benefit from acknowledgement and validation of their symptoms. This is particularly true with respect to the obvious pain and suffering associated with their experience. As with all patients, those with personality disorders, respond to having their symptoms taken seriously and not minimized. The therapeutic goal is to join with patients to reduce emotional pain and improve functioning.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Minimizing polypharmacy</strong> – Limiting the number of medications prescribed and the frequency of dosing can be helpful in maximizing adherence. Medications which require regular dosing to reduce the risk of adverse events, such as with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9545" href="/z/d/drug information/9545.html" rel="external">lamotrigine</a> and the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, should only be prescribed to patients for whom adherence to regular medication dosing has been successfully managed. It is useful to inquire about adherence in a nonjudgmental manner. (See <a class="local">'Individuals treated with polypharmacy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Direct and nonjudgmental communication</strong> – This is particularly important in discussing acceptable boundaries regarding medication usage. As an example, one way of addressing the issue of medication usage may be: “Because I’m concerned about your health and safety, I will not continue to prescribe this medication if you are taking more than prescribed or saving medication to take all at once.” Consider this information a much-needed, and usually welcomed, orientation to the “ground rules” of your therapeutic relationship.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">This approach does not imply that the patient is a “drug-abuser” or “medication hoarder.” It might be helpful to say, “Given the extreme distress you have been experiencing, anyone in your position might experience an urge to take more than the prescribed dose. I want you to know that this possibility concerns me, and I’d like to work with you to do everything possible to reduce the risk of a medication overdose. I’d like to describe some methods I use to work together to ensure you are able to use this medication safely.” Depending on the patient, the nature of your therapeutic relationship, their history of impulsive behavior, and engagement with other healthcare professionals, the clinician may consider dispensing a 30-day supply of medications, or less depending on the toxicity of the agent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Nonjudgmental communication is helpful for patients with a personality disorder who may be contacting the clinic or the provider directly or repeatedly in a manner that is potentially taxing to available resources. Typically, these communications are the patient’s best attempts at keeping the clinician informed and seeking guidance. The interpersonal limitations related to their personality disorder prevent them from discerning the impact of their behaviors on the clinician and other members of the interdisciplinary team.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Underline the types of communication that reinforce the strength of your relationship: <em>“</em>I really appreciate how you called me once to leave a message regarding the side effect improvement. That was the correct use of phone contact and allowed me to feel helpful.”</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">As with any patient, egregious or abusive behaviors should be identified as such and managed with the assistance of administrative and/or security personnel. This may include termination of the therapeutic relationship within legal and ethical limits, which vary across care settings. In many cases, effective communication and conveyance of empathy informed by the understanding of the nature of the interpersonal deficits inherent in the personality disorder can foster productive treatment relationships.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2324225584"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
