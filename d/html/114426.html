         Perioperative stroke is defined as stroke occurring within 30 days following surgery. Although the incidence of clinically recognized perioperative stroke is very low after noncardiac and nonneurologic surgery, it is a potentially devastating postoperative complication and an important cause of perioperative mortality and morbidity [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. This topic will discuss perioperative stroke after noncardiac, noncarotid, nonneurologic surgery, including risk factors, strategies for risk reduction, and what is known about mechanisms of stroke in these settings. In 2021 the American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association developed a joint scientific statement on the cerebrovascular complications of noncardiac surgery, highlighting the importance of perioperative stroke [

         The overall incidence of
         <strong>
          clinically recognized
         </strong>
         stroke after noncardiac, nonneurologic surgery is reported to be between 0.1 and 0.8 percent in registry and database studies [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3,6-8
         </a>
         ]. Whereas the incidence of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and death after noncardiac surgery has decreased over time, the incidence of perioperative stroke may be increasing [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Perioperative stroke is significantly more common in certain patient populations, and after particular surgical procedures, even within the category of noncardiac, nonneurologic procedures. Patient and surgical risk factors for perioperative stroke are shown in a table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120874" href="/z/d/graphic/120874.html" rel="external">

         The incidence of clinically
         <strong>
          unrecognized
         </strong>
         stroke ("covert stroke") after major noncardiac nonneurologic surgery may be as high as 7 percent in patients 65 years and older [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ] and may have implications for long-term outcomes (see
         <a class="local">
          'Outcomes after perioperative stroke'
         </a>
         below). In the large studies described below, the incidence of stroke may be underestimated as signs and symptoms of stroke may be difficult to recognize in the postoperative patient because of comorbid factors, sedative medications, and examination by non-neurologists.
        </p>
        <p>
         Examples of contemporary studies on the incidence of perioperative stroke and risk factors are as follows:

         In a study of data on 523,059 patients who had noncardiac, nonneurologic surgery from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database, the overall incidence of perioperative stroke was 0.1 percent [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Independent predictors of stroke in decreasing order of risk included age ≥62 years, history of MI within six months prior to surgery, acute renal failure, history of stroke, dialysis dependence, hypertension, history of transient ischemic attack (TIA), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and current tobacco use. Body mass index 35 to 40 kg/m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         was slightly protective, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.7. The incidence of perioperative stroke ranged from 0 in patients who underwent arthroscopy, to 0.9 percent in patients ≥65 years of age who underwent abdominal exploration. In this study patients with five or more risk factors had a 21-fold increased risk of perioperative stroke with an incidence of 1.9 percent [
         <a href="#rid1">

         In another study, records were analyzed from the National Inpatient Sample for approximately 372,000 patients who underwent one of three major intraabdominal, orthopedic, and noncardiac thoracic surgical procedures [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. The overall incidence of perioperative stroke was 0.7 percent after hemicolectomy, 0.2 percent after total hip replacement, and 0.6 percent after lobectomy/segmental lung resection. For patients &gt;65 years of age, the incidences were 1 percent, 0.3 percent, and 0.8 percent, respectively. Identified patient risk factors for perioperative stroke included renal disease, atrial fibrillation, history of stroke, and cardiac valvular disease.

         An analysis of records for 10,581,621 major inpatient noncardiac surgical procedures (including neurosurgery) from the National Inpatient Sample in the United States from 2004 to 2013 found that the rate of acute MI and death declined over the time period studied, whereas the rate of perioperative stroke increased from 0.52 percent to 0.77 percent [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8

         Advanced age has been identified as a risk factor for perioperative stroke in multiple studies [

          1-3,6,7,10,11
         </a>
         ], consistent with the age-associated decreases in cerebrovascular reserve and increases in risk factors for cardiovascular comorbidities. The age at which risk increases varies in the literature, but it is likely to be progressive from age 62 years onwards. In one prospective observational study of patients who underwent noncardiac surgery, compared with patients who were &lt;50 years old, risk of perioperative stroke increased in patients 50 to 69 years (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.8-12.4), and increased markedly for patients older than 70 years (OR 23.6, 95% CI 9.6-58.1) [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10

         Existing cardiovascular diseases (eg, hypertension, recent MI, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease) are identified risk factors for perioperative stroke [

         The presence of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) is associated with cryptogenic stroke, and may be associated with perioperative stroke [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13
         </a>
         ]. PFO may represent a mechanism for stroke after intraoperative venous air embolism, or perioperative thrombosis. In a large retrospective database study, the risk of perioperative stroke in patients with PFO was lower in those who received perioperative anti-thrombotic therapy [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13

         The risk of perioperative stroke associated with extracranial carotid artery stenosis is unclear, and there are only limited data pertaining to noncardiac surgery. One of the larger studies was a retrospective report of over 2000 patients who had carotid duplex ultrasound performed within six months before and one month after noncardiac, noncarotid surgery [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. The study found no association between carotid artery stenosis and perioperative stroke, which occurred in 2.6 percent, or 30-day mortality, which affected 5.3 percent. It is likely that the subjects included in this study had carotid duplex studies because of cardiovascular risk factors or neurologic symptoms, suggesting a higher risk of stroke than the general population.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some patients without a history of carotid stenosis are found to have a carotid bruit on a preoperative physical examination. However, further evaluation of the carotid arteries in a patient with an asymptomatic carotid bruit is not usually warranted prior to surgery; the presence of a carotid bruit by itself does not correlate with the severity of underlying carotid stenosis [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15-17
         </a>
         ], and has not been shown to increase the risk of perioperative stroke [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,19
         </a>
         ]. As an example, a prospective single center study of 735 patients who underwent general and cardiac surgery found that the incidence of postoperative stroke was similar in patients with and without carotid bruits [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Most of the available literature involves cardiac surgery patients and suggests that the risk of perioperative stroke with cardiac surgery is increased in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis, and in some patients with high grade asymptomatic carotid stenosis as well. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1097.html" rel="external">
          "Coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with cerebrovascular disease", section on 'Carotid stenosis'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         There is a strong association between carotid artery disease and coronary heart disease; the presence of known carotid artery disease or a carotid bruit [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20

         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Indeed, history of stroke or TIA is one of the risk factors in the widely used Revised Cardiac Risk Index. (See

          6

         There is concern that preoperative and intraoperative administration of beta blockers may increase the risk of perioperative stroke, though the existing literature is conflicting. Because of the risks associated with acute discontinuation of beta-blocker therapy, those patients on chronic beta-blocker therapy (including

         In contrast, a retrospective database analysis of over 200,000 patients who underwent major abdominal surgery found that perioperative beta blocker use was not associated with increase or decrease in perioperative stroke or major cardiovascular events [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. However, this study had important limitations including the inability to distinguish between different types of beta blockers used, lack of adjustment for potentially important confounders such as hypotension, anemia, and atrial fibrillation, and a relatively young patient population (over 60 percent were &lt;65 years old).

         The etiologic role of beta blockers in perioperative stroke is often conflated with the role of hypotension, since beta blockers are commonly used to lower blood pressure and may result in hypotension. In the POISE trial, hypotension occurred more commonly in patients who were randomized to receive high dose
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9645" href="/z/d/drug information/9645.html" rel="external">
          metoprolol

         ; however hypotension was defined as the lowest blood pressure recorded during hospitalization and was not evaluated in a systematic fashion [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Subsequent observational studies have found an association between perioperative stroke and administration of metoprolol specifically, independent of hypotension [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. This observation should be applied cautiously in clinical practice because there has not been a randomized trial comparing stroke risk with metoprolol versus other beta blockers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Potential mechanisms for the apparent increase in perioperative stroke risk with non-cardioselective beta blockers supported by both human and animal studies include an attenuated beta-2 mediated cerebrovascular dilation with reduced oxygen delivery [

          26,28

         Several perioperative stroke risk prediction tools have been suggested, though all have limitations (eg, complexity of use, lack of external validation).

         An observational study of data on over 540,000 patients who had noncardiac surgery between 2009 and 2010 from the US National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database evaluated the ability of existing cardiovascular risk models to assess the risk for perioperative stroke [

         In 2021, the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association suggested using the ACS-SRC for perioperative stroke risk prediction [

         </a>
         ]. However, it is not clear how the ACS-SRC would be used, since it does not provide a specific quantitative estimate of stroke risk, it is not clear how the clinician would calculate that risk, and the NSQIP database does not include all relevant variables, such as atrial fibrillation and timing of previous stroke.
        </p>
        <p>
         A further perioperative stroke risk prediction tool derived from the NSQIP database has been proposed, with limitations similar to other tools [

The more comprehensive Stroke After Surgery (STRAS) risk prediction tool derived from and validated with a United States administrative dataset of nearly 250,000 patients in Massachusetts identified 13 variables associated with ischemic stroke within one year after surgery.

         Perioperative strokes are predominantly ischemic, rather than hemorrhagic [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3,25,38-41
         </a>
         ]. These ischemic strokes can be embolic, thrombotic, or hemodynamic (ie, hypoperfusion of vulnerable areas) and may be a combination of these mechanisms (eg, hypoperfusion in the setting of embolic stroke). Ischemic stroke has rarely been reported following anterior cervical spine surgery involving retraction of the carotid artery, possibly due to combination of cerebral hypoperfusion and thrombosis in the setting of pre-existing carotid vascular disease [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ]. Aside from patients who have embolic stroke related to atrial fibrillation or fat or air embolism, the mechanisms for postoperative cerebral embolism or thrombosis are largely speculative. Additional mechanisms for perioperative stroke may include hypercoagulability after surgery and surgery-induced inflammatory responses, but at present there is no supporting evidence for these theories. (See

         Stroke after noncardiac surgery often presents after a brief postoperative recovery period, and is only infrequently evident on emergence from anesthesia [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39,43
         </a>
         ], which suggests that, in some cases, intraoperative events may be contributory rather than causal for stroke. In a small study of noncardiac and nonneurologic surgical patients only 10 percent of cases of perioperative stroke were recognized in the post-anesthesia care unit [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44

          3

         The role of hypotension in the etiology of perioperative stroke is unclear. For noncardiac and nonvascular surgery, intraoperative hypotension may be associated with stroke, but causality has not been established [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25,45-47
         </a>
         ]. Whereas it is commonly assumed that hypotension is the major cause of perioperative stroke, there are little data to support this assumption, partly because perioperative hypotension is endemic and difficult to study. A retrospective analysis of 358,391 noncardiac surgical patients found no significant association between intraoperative hypotension (both relative [mean arterial pressure &lt;30 percent of baseline] and absolute [mean arterial pressure &lt;55 mmHg], stratified by duration) and perioperative stroke within seven days after surgery, after adjusting for preoperative risk factors [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. Similarly, in a 2018 systematic review of retrospective observational studies of the relationship between hypotension and perioperative organ dysfunction, only insignificant associations were found between hypotension and perioperative stroke, based on four studies [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49
         </a>
         ]. In contrast, a retrospective case-control study of 126 patients with perioperative strokes matched to 500 control subjects found a positive association between cumulative duration of MAP of less than 55 mmHg and perioperative stroke (aOR 1.17, 95% CI 0.10-1.23) [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         There is little doubt that a low enough blood pressure or a critically reduced blood pressure for long enough will result in a stroke. However, in individual patients these thresholds can only be determined in retrospect, after ischemia occurs.

         There is no standardized definition of hypotension in the anesthesia literature, and the reported incidence of hypotension ranges from 5 to 99 percent, depending on definition [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. In the published literature, hypotension is commonly defined as a 20 percent decrease in systolic pressure from a baseline value; a decrease below a systolic of 80 mmHg; or a combination of absolute value and percentage, eg, below 100 mmHg or a 30 percent decrease from baseline, whichever is greater.

         The temporal relationship between low blood pressure and the occurrence of a stroke is rarely known. As an example, perioperative hypotension (defined as the lowest documented blood pressure during hospitalization) was associated with perioperative stroke in the Perioperative Ischemic Evaluation (POISE) trial, but the timing of stroke related to this episode of hypotension was undocumented in this study [

         Cerebral hypoperfusion due to systemic hypotension may coexist with cerebral embolism, leading to impaired clearance of emboli from the microcirculation [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ]. Thus, hypotension is likely an important modulator of stroke, ensuring or worsening injury after an embolic or thrombotic event. After acute non-perioperative strokes, reductions in systolic blood pressure below 140 mmHg significantly increase morbidity and mortality, and best outcomes are associated with systolic blood pressure 140 to 180 mmHg [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53,54

          31

         The effect of intraoperative arterial and end tidal carbon dioxide on the risk of perioperative stroke is unclear. In theory, hypocarbia could lead to cerebral vasoconstriction and reduced cerebral blood flow, while hypercarbia could lead to cerebral vasodilation and vascular steal from areas with borderline perfusion. A retrospective case-control study (133 stroke cases, 500 controls) found associations between both intraoperative hypocarbia and hypercarbia and increased risk of stroke within 30 days of surgery [

         We suggest delaying truly elective surgery for at least three months after stroke, and if possible up to nine months, to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,21
         </a>
         ]. The timing of surgery in patients who have a history of ischemic stroke should incorporate the risk of recurrent stroke and other cardiovascular events, patient factors, and the risks associated with delaying surgery. For patients with a history of ischemic stroke, the significant risks of recurrent perioperative stroke and death should be discussed with the patient and the surgeon, along with the risks associated with delaying surgery. (See
         <a class="local">
          'History of prior stroke'

        <p>
         Support for the suggestion to delay elective surgery after stroke comes from two separate analyses of large administrative health care databases in the United States and Denmark [

         In the Danish study, there was a 67-fold increase in the risk of perioperative ischemic stroke in patients who had surgery within three months of an ischemic stroke, compared with patients without prior stroke [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. The incidence of perioperative stroke was 12 percent in patients who had surgery within three months of a stroke. The risk of perioperative stroke decreased over time after stroke and leveled off at nine months, but remained elevated thereafter compared with patients without history of stroke. In response to concerns that these results merely reflected the normal temporal course for risk of recurrent stroke in nonoperative patients, a subsequent analysis of these data was performed [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55
         </a>
         ]. Patients with prior stroke but no surgery had a similar decline in the rate of recurrent stroke over time, but a markedly lower absolute risk of recurrent stroke than patients with prior stroke who underwent surgery. For example, patients who did not undergo surgery had a stroke recurrence rate of 3 to 4 percent at three months compared with 12 percent in surgical patients.

         An analysis of 5,841,539 Medicare patients aged 65 years and older in the United States also demonstrated that ischemic stroke prior to surgery increased the risk of perioperative stroke, with the highest risk within 30 days of surgery [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. Compared with patients who had never had a stroke, risk of ischemic stroke was increased 8-fold for those with a stroke within 30 days prior to surgery, 6-fold for patients with a stroke 31 to 60 days prior to surgery, and 5-fold in patients who had a stroke from 61 to 90 days prior to surgery. The incidence of stroke was 0.33 percent in patients with no prior stroke, 2.52 percent after surgery within 30 days of stroke, 1.99 percent within 30 to 60 days of stroke, and 1.61 percent within 61 to 90 days of stroke. The odds of stroke were similar in patients who had surgery at 61 to 90 days after surgery compared with the risk at six months and a year after surgery. Thus, in contrast with the analysis of the Danish database described above, elevated risk leveled off between 60 and 90 days after stroke. These results may have differed due to variation in the study cohort characteristics, including that the Medicare database contained only older patients.

         One study addressed timing of emergency surgery after stroke. This study analyzed a cohort of patients from the Danish National Patient register for patients with prior ischemic stroke who underwent emergency noncardiac non-neurologic surgery, risk of major cardiovascular adverse events (ie, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death; MACE) and all-cause mortality were highest if surgery was in the first three months after stroke, leveled off until nine months after stroke, but remained elevated thereafter [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56
         </a>
         ]. In contrast with the composite outcome of MACE, the risk of ischemic stroke was similar for emergency surgery performed at any time in the first two weeks after stroke. The risk of MACE was lower for emergency surgery performed within three days after stroke compared with days 4 to 14.

         The decision to continue or stop ongoing antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication in the perioperative period represents a balance between reducing the risk of thromboembolism (and ischemic stroke) and increasing the risk of surgical bleeding during and after the planned procedure. Bleeding may be catastrophic during and after intracranial and neuraxial surgery, and discontinuation of antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications is usually warranted for these procedures. For other surgical procedures, medication management must be individualized. There may be a subset of patients at particular risk for perioperative stroke (recent ischemic stroke and/or transient ischemic attack [TIA], or existing intracranial stents) who warrant consideration for ongoing antiplatelet therapy perioperatively when the surgical procedure permits.

         Patients who take statin medications should continue them throughout the perioperative period whenever possible. In addition, patients who do not take a statin but are at high risk of cardiovascular disease should start a statin as early as possible before elective surgery, and when possible, before urgent or emergency surgery. The supporting evidence for starting statins preoperatively to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, including perioperative stroke, is weak, but the risk associated with such therapy is very low. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See

         For most surgical procedures, the choice of general versus regional anesthesia should be based on the surgical procedure, patient comorbidities, and patient choice. There is very little evidence supporting one anesthetic technique over another for noncardiac, noncarotid surgery as a strategy to reduce the risk of stroke. For patients who undergo total hip arthroplasty, several observational studies have reported an association between neuraxial anesthesia and a lower risk of perioperative stroke, though a causal relationship has not been established [

         Despite the lack of high-quality evidence regarding the role of hypotension in the etiology of perioperative stroke, intraoperative hypotension should be avoided in patients at risk of stroke (see

         The decision to transfuse blood during surgery is complex, and must consider patient factors and ongoing blood loss. There are retrospective data suggesting that patients who take beta blockers may be more sensitive to anemia and possibly at higher risk of perioperative stroke due to the attenuation of cerebral compensatory vasodilation by beta blockers [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26

         ]. This appears to be particularly true for

          metoprolol

        <p>
         The limited literature on the risks of perioperative stroke associated with anemia and transfusion is retrospective, includes small numbers of events, and is conflicting with respect to suggested management. Database studies cannot separate the relative contributions of anemia and hypotension, both of which often accompany the need to transfuse. The decision to transfuse must balance the effects of anemia against the known risks of blood transfusion.

         Time is of the essence in recognizing stroke in order to preserve brain tissue and initiate stroke revascularization in appropriate patients. If there is any suspicion of a new neurologic deficit, an urgent neurology consultation should be obtained, and the institution's acute stroke protocol should be activated. Eligibility for acute endovascular intervention for patients who emerge from general anesthesia with new neurologic deficits may extend to 16 to 24 hours after stroke onset, as shown by the DEFUSE 3 [
         <a href="#rid64">
          64

         Recognition of stroke-related neurologic deficits in the postoperative patient is often difficult, complicated initially by residual anesthetic medication, and later by the effects of opioids and other analgesics. Assessment of motor function may be hampered by surgical pain. The evaluation can also be confounded by postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction, particularly in older patients. These issues are of particular concern because mental status changes may be the only manifestation of stroke, without any focal deficits [

         In the perioperative period we recommend the use of a rapid screening tool for stroke, such as the Face Arm Anesthesia Speech Time (FAAST) scale, during vital sign checks in patients with risk factors for stroke [

          67
         </a>
         ]. The FAAST tool evaluates patients with suspected stroke by assessing for the presence of a speech impairment, facial and/or arm weakness, and includes a question about the possibility of residual anesthesia effect and a reminder that time is of the essence particularly for those eligible for mechanical thrombectomy, as follows:

         All patients with ischemic stroke should be evaluated for possible reperfusion therapy as soon as possible after diagnosis. Thrombolysis will be contraindicated or relatively contraindicated for many postsurgical patients  (

          table 3

          alteplase
         </a>
         ). Other major surgery in the previous 14 days represents a relative contraindication; the increased risk of surgical site bleeding with alteplase should be weighed against the anticipated benefits of reduced stroke-related neurologic deficits.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mechanical thrombectomy, which does not require systemic thrombolysis (eg, intravenous tPA), may be an option for patients with ischemic stroke caused by a proximal large artery occlusion in the anterior circulation who can be treated within 24 hours of the time they were last known to be at their neurologic baseline  (

          algorithm 1

         We suggest delaying truly elective surgery for at least three months, and if possible, up to nine months, after ischemic stroke, to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke (

Retrospective data suggest that the risk of perioperative stroke is substantially increased for at least three months after a prior stroke and decreases over time before leveling off between three to nine months later. The timing of surgery after ischemic stroke should be individualized and based on the risk of recurrent stroke and other cardiovascular events, patient factors, and the risks associated with delaying surgery.

         Recognition of postoperative neurologic deficits is often difficult; perioperative stroke can present with only impaired consciousness. In the perioperative period we recommend the use of a rapid screening tool for stroke, such as the Face Arm Anesthesia Speech Time (FAAST) scale in patients with risk factors for stroke (See
         <a class="local">
          'Recognition of perioperative stroke'
         </a>

         Unilateral or focal deficits are never normal during emergence unless explained by the surgical procedure. If there is any suspicion of neurologic deficit, urgent neurology consultation and neuroimaging should be obtained.

         Acute stroke is in the differential diagnosis of delayed emergence after general anesthesia and should always be considered while other possible etiologies are ruled out.

          Management
         </strong>
         – All patients with ischemic stroke should be evaluated for reperfusion therapy. Some postoperative patients with acute ischemic stroke may be candidates for reperfusion therapy including mechanical thrombectomy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Recognition of perioperative stroke'

          Prognosis
         </strong>
         – Perioperative stroke is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. (See
