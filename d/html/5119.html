         The majority of causes of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) in 2012 included vehicular accidents (31.0 percent), falls (40.4 percent), and firearm injuries (5.4 percent) based on a review of hospitalized patients with acute traumatic SCI in the United States [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>

         <a href="#rid2">
          2

         Pulmonary physiologic changes due to spinal cord injury (SCI) are related to the extent of neurological impairment. The American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) and the International Spinal Cord Society (ISCoS) have developed standards for documenting the neurological level and severity of a patient with SCI [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10

         The patient’s strength in key muscle groups is assessed and graded. A muscle grade of 5/5 is normal, and a grade of 3/5 means the muscle can be moved against gravity. The motor level is defined as the most caudal key muscle that is graded 3/5 or 4/5 with the segment cephalad to that level graded 5/5. The sensory level is defined as the most caudal dermatome to have normal sensation for both pinprick and light touch. For areas that lack key muscles to test, such as between T2 and L1, sensory findings are used to estimate motor levels.
        </p>
        <p>
         Complete motor SCI includes AIS A (no sensory or motor function preserved below the neurologic level) and AIS B (sensory but no motor function preserved below the neurologic level)  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ). Incomplete motor SCI includes AIS C where motor function in less than half of the key muscles below the neurologic level have a muscle grade less than 3, and for AIS D more than half the key muscles below the neurologic level have a muscle grade of 3 or more. (See

         With tetraplegia, there is injury to at least one of the eight cervical segments of the spinal cord; with paraplegia, there is injury in the thoracic, lumbar, or sacral regions. Based on the National Spinal Cord Injury Database 2010 to 2014. 28.8 percent of SCI had cervical A, B, or C level of injury.

         Pulmonary physiologic changes following spinal cord injury (SCI) include: (1) impairment of ventilatory muscle performance; (2) changes in lung and chest wall compliance; (3) changes in ventilatory control; and (4) airflow limitation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. In describing the occurrence of these changes, it is useful to consider SCI in three phases: (1) immediately following the injury; (2) during the year thereafter; and (3) more than one year after injury.

         Immediately after SCI, flaccid paralysis occurs and affects all muscles caudal to the level of injury, a physiologic state is known as spinal shock. Subsequent improvements in pulmonary function are due primarily to functional descent of the neurologic injury level as spinal cord inflammation resolves, enhanced recruitment of accessory ventilatory muscles, retraining of deconditioned muscles, and the evolution from flaccid to spastic paralysis [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12-16
         </a>
         ]. Starting from several days to up to four to six weeks, spinal reflexes return and eventually become exaggerated as the syndrome of spasticity develops. In a study of 54 patients (mean age 65 years old) who experienced mainly incomplete cervical spinal cord damage as a result of a hyperextension injury and no accompanying bone fracture, mean vital capacity improved substantially from 57.7 percent predicted at admission to 78.9 percent predicted at 12 weeks [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. In more severely injured patients with complete motor and sensory loss at presentation, the vital capacity increased from a mean of 31.1 percent predicted (11 patients) to 44.9 percent predicted (9 patients) at three months [

         ]. Among those who required mechanical ventilation, 90 percent of the episodes of respiratory failure occurred within the first three days after SCI. Improvement in respiratory muscle performance after SCI largely occurs in the first year following injury [

         The extent of ventilatory muscle impairment depends upon the degree and location of the injury, as well as the duration of time since the injury. The higher the level and more complete the injury, the more likely that there will be respiratory muscle dysfunction. Ventilatory muscles innervated below the level of a complete SCI are completely nonfunctional (AIS A or B), while the degree of ventilatory muscle compromise is variable in patients with incomplete injuries (AIS C or D)  (

         The most important muscle that mediates inspiration is the diaphragm, which is innervated by the phrenic nerves (third to fifth cervical roots). The other principal muscles of inspiration are the external intercostals innervated by thoracic nerve roots [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. Accessory muscles of inspiration include the pectoralis major and minor, scalenes, serratus anterior, serratus posterior superior, levator scapulae, trapezius, and sternocleidomastoids. The scalenes are innervated by cervical nerve roots C4 to C8 and the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles are innervated via C1 to C4 and also cranial nerve XI. Patients with high SCI can sometimes utilize oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal muscles for short-term ventilation by projecting boluses of air past the glottis (glossopharyngeal breathing), although these muscles are not traditionally thought of as muscles of respiration. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5116.html" rel="external">
          "Noninvasive ventilatory support and mechanical insufflation-exsufflation for patients with respiratory muscle dysfunction", section on 'Glossopharyngeal breathing'

        <p>
         The muscles of expiration are the abdominal wall muscles (rectus abdominus, obliques, and transversus abdominus), innervated by the lower thoracic and lumbar nerve roots, and the internal intercostals, innervated by the thoracic nerve roots. Normally, expiration is passive and does not require use of these muscles. However, these muscles are crucial when forced exhalation is needed, such as during exercise or coughing. When the ability to generate forced exhalation for coughing is impaired, removal of airway secretions is ineffective. In addition, these muscles contribute to normal function of the diaphragm in three important ways [
         <a href="#rid23">

         </span>
         The intercostal muscles help to stabilize the rib cage, preventing inward collapse of the rib cage during diaphragmatic contraction for inspiration. In patients with cervical or thoracic SCI, paralysis of the intercostal muscles leads to inward motion of the rib cage during inspiration, thus decreasing the volume of air inspired for a given amount of diaphragmatic work.

         </span>
         The integrated abdominal wall and thoracic cage musculature act as a fulcrum against which the diaphragm can contract. Loss of this fulcrum effect reduces the efficiency of the diaphragm.

         Flaccid paralysis of the abdominal wall muscles leads to relocation of the abdominal contents caudad, away from the diaphragm. The diaphragm is less steeply domed and, therefore, less efficient.

         Complete injury above C3 produces near total ventilatory muscle paralysis because the phrenic nerve, which innervates the diaphragm, arises from the third to fifth cervical roots. In addition, the intercostal, abdominal muscles, sternocleidomastoid, and trapezius muscles are denervated. Due to complete paralysis of the respiratory muscles, patients with SCI above the C3 root have acute ventilatory failure and do not survive unless manual ventilation is rapidly instituted at the accident scene.

         Injuries involving C3 to C5 cause variable impairment of diaphragmatic strength and variable impairment of the accessory muscles of inspiration (eg, scalenes, sternocleidomastoid, trapezius and others). Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation is common during the first few days to weeks after the injury, either due to respiratory muscle weakness and fatigue or precipitated by atelectasis or pneumonia. As the initial muscle flaccidity transitions to spasticity and accessory muscles are recruited and strengthened, spontaneous ventilation is often adequate for weaning from mechanical ventilation.

         Patients with complete cervical SCI but with intact diaphragm function are able to inhale via the diaphragm and accessory muscles above the level of injury (such as muscles in the neck). Exhalation occurs primarily through the passive recoil of the chest wall and lungs, because the primary muscles of exhalation (internal intercostals and muscles of the abdominal wall) are paralyzed. When the arms are fixed, the clavicular portions of the pectoralis major muscles may contribute to exhalation; training of this muscle has been described but typically provides only a small contribution [

          28,29

         <a href="#rid31">
          31

Although the abdomen is highly compliant in quadriplegia, the rib cage compartment of the chest wall is stiff because of intercostal muscle spasticity and ankylosis of the rib articulations with the spine and sternum.

         Subjects with tetraplegia demonstrate reversible expiratory airflow limitation, which is usually only apparent when a bronchodilator is administered, as the predominant abnormality is a restrictive ventilatory defect. Loss of postganglionic sympathetic innervation to the airways is a potential mechanism contributing to airflow limitation, although the functional significance of direct sympathetic airway innervation is thought to be minor or absent. The reversibility of this airflow limitation was demonstrated by the administration of inhaled

          35,36

         Individuals with tetraplegia have an abnormally small increase in ventilatory drive in response to hypercapnia [

          42
         </a>

         One hypothesis is that the blunted response is related to a decrease in blood pressure in the sitting position.

         American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria also require a prompt onset of exhalation, but subjects with complete quadriplegia are more likely than others with SCI to have a delay at the start of a forced expiratory maneuver, resulting in an excessive back-extrapolated volume (BEV). The BEV is the volume of gas that has already been expired from maximal lung volume before the start of exhalation using the slope of the steepest portion of the volume-time curve to determine time 0 [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45,47
         </a>
         ]. ATS standards prior to 2019 were that the BEV had to be less than 5 percent of FVC or 150 mL, whichever is greater, in order to identify spirometry that did not represent maximal effort [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45

         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in a study of 278 adults with SCI, those with excessive back-extrapolated volume had a back-extrapolated volume of 7.4 percent of the FVC, which is higher than the ATS criterion [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46

        <p>
         When ATS standards are modified to allow expiratory efforts less than six seconds, as long as a 0.5 second plateau is achieved (presumably at residual volume), and a greater degree of excessive back-extrapolated volume, as long as the volume-time curves and flow volume loops are otherwise acceptable, then the FVC and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV

         Posture has a significant impact upon lung mechanics in the majority of patients with SCI.

         <sub>
          1

         values were 2.41 L and 2.36 L, respectively. The expiratory reserve volume (ERV) decreased in the supine position and the inspiratory capacity (IC) increased proportionally more than the VC (2.21 L when seated and 2.56 L when supine).

         In eight patients with C4 to C7 motor complete tetraplegia, the mean IC increased significantly from the seated (1.34 L) to the tilted (1.61 L) and the supine (2.14 L) position, with no significant change in total lung capacity (TLC) [

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         A change from the seated to the supine position results in a decrease in FRC because the abdominal contents push upon the diaphragm. However, the muscle fibers of the diaphragm are longer at end expiration when supine and, thus, at a more favorable portion of their length-tension curve, resulting in a greater downward (caudad) excursion of the diaphragm during inspiration. Together, these effects result in an improved IC and VC when supine. On the other hand, gas exchange abnormalities are more likely in the supine position due to airway closure and any atelectasis that could arise from tidal breathing at lower respiratory system volumes (at a reduced FRC). When choosing a position to optimize respiratory system function, the advantage of a greater VC and IC must be weighed against the possibility of gas exchange problems due to airway closure and atelectasis (eg, arising from tidal breathing at lower respiratory system volumes).

         Most patients with complete cervical motor SCI will have a restrictive ventilatory defect (decreased TLC and FVC). The FRC and ERV are also reduced, but the residual volume (RV) is increased. The decreases in TLC, FRC, and ERV are attributable to inspiratory muscle weakness, while the increase in RV is due to expiratory muscle weakness. (See

         Immediately after SCI, flaccid paralysis affects all muscles caudal to the level of injury (also known as spinal shock). Subsequent improvements in pulmonary function are due primarily to functional descent of the neurologic injury level as spinal cord inflammation resolves, enhanced recruitment of accessory ventilatory muscles, retraining of deconditioned muscles, and the evolution from flaccid to spastic paralysis. (See
         <a class="local">

         The extent of ventilatory muscle impairment depends upon the degree and location of the injury, as well as the duration of time since the injury. The higher the level and more complete the injury, the more likely that there will be respiratory muscle dysfunction. Complete injury above C3 produces near total ventilatory muscle paralysis because the phrenic nerve, which innervates the diaphragm, arises from the third to fifth cervical roots. (See

         Posture has a significant impact upon lung mechanics in the majority of patients with SCI. Typically, individuals with SCI have an increase in vital capacity (VC) when changing from a seated to supine position, whereas the normal response to recumbency is a slight decrease in VC. (See

         When obtaining spirometry, American Thoracic Society (ATS) standards may need to be modified to accept expiratory efforts less than six seconds in duration, as long as a 0.5 second plateau is achieved (presumably at residual volume), and a greater degree of back-extrapolated volume (eg, ~7.5 percent of forced vital capacity), when volume-time curves and flow volume loops are otherwise acceptable. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Use of modified ATS standards'

         Among individuals with chronic cervical cord injury, spirometry typically shows a restrictive ventilatory defect with forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV
         <sub>

         Lung volumes following complete cervical cord injury show a marked reduction in expiratory volume (ERV), a mild to moderate reduction in total lung capacity (TLC) and functional reserve volume (FRC), and preservation of residual volume (RV). The main lung volume abnormality after incomplete cervical or thoracic SCI is a moderate reduction in ERV. (See

         In general, when the level of SCI is below C5 and thus spares the phrenic nerve, maximal expiratory force is impaired more than maximal inspiratory pressure, which remains near or within the normal range. (See

         Pulmonary function testing in persons with weaker respiratory muscles (ie, cervical A, B, or C tetraplegia) may not reliably detect airflow limitation. Airflow limitation may only become apparent during reversibility testing with inhaled bronchodilators such as beta2-agonists and the anticholinergic agent

         However, the clinical benefit regarding the routine use of bronchodilators in quadriplegia for purposes of maximizing pulmonary function has not been established. (See
