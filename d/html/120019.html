Individuals take performance-enhancing drugs and substances for a variety of reasons, which include improving athletic performance, increasing alertness, and improving appearance. Although the focus of the news media is on competitive athletes caught using banned hormonal agents (eg, androgens, growth hormones) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], many non-hormonal drugs and other substances for performance enhancement are used, some of which are banned but others of which are permitted and freely available.</p><p>There has been a massive increase in the use of supplements in the sports community over the past few decades. Companies worldwide make a range of claims about the ergogenic benefit of many of these supplements. However, research suggests that only a small number have demonstrable benefits for athletes. The additive, interactive, and potentially harmful effects from the common practice among athletes of combining multiple supplements remains largely unknown. Importantly, throughout the world, quality control for these substances is generally poor, and regulations pertaining to their manufacture and marketing are weak, making it difficult for athletes to determine which supplements are safe, effective, and legal.</p><p>This topic will review some of the most common nutritional and non-medication supplements that are <strong>not</strong> banned and are used by athletes for performance enhancement. Banned performance-enhancing drugs, including hormonal agents, permitted performance-enhancing medications, and supplements commonly marketed to the general public are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15454.html" rel="external">"Prohibited non-hormonal performance-enhancing drugs in sport"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7475.html" rel="external">"Use of androgens and other hormones by athletes"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/109127.html" rel="external">"Prescription and non-prescription medications permitted for performance enhancement"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126971.html" rel="external">"High-risk dietary supplements: Patient evaluation and counseling"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3733177477"><span class="h1">NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3356596222"><span class="h2">Use of supplements and contamination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many substances are designated or marketed as nutritional supplements, including vitamins, minerals, herbs, extracts, amino acids, metabolites, or any combination of these and other substances [<a href="#rid2">2-5</a>]. As testing for performance-enhancing drugs has expanded to nearly all levels of competition, athletes have begun to use more over-the-counter nutritional supplements, assuming they are legal, safe, and beneficial. A survey of athletes participating in the 2004 Athens Olympic Games found that over 47 percent reported use of nutritional supplements [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. However, in many countries, the sports supplement industry is poorly regulated, and supplements are sometimes a source of doping violations. This is due to either inadvertent contamination or the intentional addition of additives not included on the label that provide the beneficial effects touted by the manufacturer. Supplements are generally not tested for contamination or accurate labeling, and they frequently contain unlisted substances. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126971.html" rel="external">"High-risk dietary supplements: Patient evaluation and counseling"</a>.)</p><p>There is an international movement encouraging larger supplement manufacturers to submit products for testing. Some countries, including Australia, and international organizations (eg, <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsport.wetestyoutrust.com%2F&amp;token=WINsTTFykGehYXyzGwZ8%2FhkWxN2i87RROXysLs20bztBK%2B%2FmqoLB5k6wumYPEOIA&amp;TOPIC_ID=120019" target="_blank">Informed-Sport</a>) are working with supplement companies to have them submit their supplements for testing, with the incentive of being given a "safe in sport" label acknowledging that their product has been found to be free of contaminants.</p><p>Large manufacturers of conventional supplements, such as protein powders, usually follow reasonable quality-control practices. Supplements obtained via the internet from small, unregulated companies can be contaminated or mislabeled. In one case series, a number of healthy individuals were found to be taking dietary supplements laced with steroids, and they presented for medical care with complaints including nausea, anorexia, jaundice, severe pruritus, and kidney failure [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Supplements promoting increased muscle mass are more likely to contain anabolic contaminants, such as nandrolone, stanozolol, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10181" href="/z/d/drug information/10181.html" rel="external">oxandrolone</a>. Prohormones, peptide hormones, and releasing factors have also been found in supplements. These include growth hormone-releasing peptides (eg, GHRP6, GHRP2), hexarelin (a synthetic growth hormone agonist), and growth hormone secretogogues, such as ghrelin. All such substances are banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). In a 2004 study, 634 supplements from 215 suppliers in 13 countries were analyzed, and 14.8 percent were found to be contaminated with hormones or prohormones, most commonly anabolic androgenic steroid hormones and prohormones [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>Some supplements have been contaminated with selective androgen receptor modulators (eg, ostarine, LGD-4033), which act on androgen receptors and exert anabolic effects on muscle and bone. These substances are banned by WADA. Stimulants such as methylhexanamine, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9114" href="/z/d/drug information/9114.html" rel="external">ephedrine</a>, and sibutramine have been found in supplements, particularly pre-workout powders, energy boosters, and fat burners [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Clenbuterol has been detected in a small number of cases of alleged doping violations involving a supplement promoted for weight loss. Clenbuterol was not included on the label. Higenamine, a beta-2 agonist, is a stimulant that has been detected in many supplements. Labeling of these supplements often includes the name of the plant from which higenamine is derived (eg, <em>Nandina domestica</em>, <em>Tinospora crispa</em>, <em>Aconitum japonicum</em>) or the chemical name (eg, norcoclaurine), rather than the common name, making it difficult to determine whether the supplement is safe.</p><p>A number of common supplements are discussed below. Some have proven ergogenic benefits, whilst there is limited (if any) evidence for the performance-enhancing effects of others.

It is not prohibited by WADA and has been shown to be effective at improving training and performance of short-duration, high-intensity exercise. Creatine is available in a wide range of commercial products, primarily as a powder [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>Creatine is a naturally occurring substance derived from three amino acids (methionine, glycine, and arginine). Approximately 95 percent is stored in skeletal muscle, with the remainder being located in the brain, testes, and kidneys. Of the creatine in muscle, approximately 65 percent is in the form of phosphocreatine. Phosphocreatine is a source of phosphate for the rapid resynthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which muscles rely on for energy during short–duration, high-intensity exercise. Creatine supplementation increases the rate of phosphocreatine resynthesis during recovery between such bouts, thereby enhancing recovery and performance [<a href="#rid10">10,13</a>]. In addition, creatine may have direct cellular effects via upregulation of genes and increased activity of enzymes involved in protein synthesis and other activities with anabolic effects [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2483484568"><span class="h3">Effectiveness</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Multiple studies have reported improvement in the performance of repeated bouts of 6- to 30-second maximal exercise (eg, sprint, heavy weightlifting) with short recovery periods (20 seconds to 5 minutes) following creatine supplementation. In a meta-analysis of seven trials of young men (&lt;36 years old), creatine supplementation combined with resistance training increased the maximal lifting weight for the bench press and squat [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. There was no effect in women or older men, and performance of other types of muscular effort did not improve. The lack of improvement reported in women may be due to the use of lower doses, stemming from concerns about weight gain.</p><p>According to a review of creatine and its effects, short- and long-term supplementation in female athletes improves strength and power, as well as anaerobic and aerobic exercise measures, with minimal effect on body composition parameters [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Subsequent randomized trials have confirmed that creatine increases maximum power output [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>]. A meta-analysis of 12 trials in patients with muscular dystrophies found a similar increase in muscle strength among those taking creatine compared with placebo [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. </p><p>Results suggesting that creatine enhances performance in endurance sports are inconsistent, and further investigation is required, particularly in sports that require high-intensity bursts (eg, road cycling) where supplementation may be useful [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. A systematic review of 13 controlled trials involving trained endurance athletes found no evidence of benefit [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Theoretically, creatine supplementation may be useful for sports that involve short intervals of high-intensity effort followed by brief recovery periods, such as American football, rugby, racquet sports, and other team sports.</p><p>A review of studies of creatine use among adolescent athletes noted relatively heavy use in the United States and the absence of reports of adverse effects [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. The authors concluded that creatine appears well tolerated and effective in adolescents, while noting the paucity of rigorous, well-designed studies assessing either safety or effectiveness in this age group.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1894081216"><span class="h3">Dosing and formulations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute loading over a five-day period is probably less beneficial than chronic loading over a 28-day period. Rapid loading is achieved by taking 20 to 25 g (0.3 g/kg per day) in four divided doses for five days (eg, 5 g four times per day for five days) [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Chronic loading involves consuming 3 g per day over 28 days. Elevated muscle creatine stores are maintained by continued supplementation using doses of 2 to 3 g per day [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Doses do not differ for power athletes, sprinters, and other athletes.</p><p>Of note, creatine is sold in several formulations other than the recommended creatine monohydrate supplement. These formulations include ethyl ester, nitrate, and phosphate, are usually more expensive, may contain impurities, and may have no added ergogenic benefit. When supplementation ceases, it takes four to five weeks for muscle creatine concentrations to return to pre-supplementation levels.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1497073779"><span class="h3">Side effects</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Reported side effects of acute creatine ingestion include weight gain (from increased water retention), reduced joint mobility, and muscle cramping, although the evidence for this last purported side-effect is not strong [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>]. Nausea, gastrointestinal (GI) upset, and headaches have been reported anecdotally but are not consistent findings in well-designed studies. Up to 30 percent of individuals do not respond to creatine supplementation and will not significantly increase muscle creatine stores. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H308219843"><span class="h3">Effects on kidney function</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although some have claimed that creatine can adversely affect kidney function, limited published evidence and wide experience with this supplement suggest that this is not true in patients with normal baseline renal function [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>]. In fact, creatine may be beneficial when exercising in hot, humid conditions, as the increased body water appears to aid thermoregulation, reduce heart rate, and reduce sweating [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The potential long-term consequences of creatine supplementation are unknown, and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends it be used only by physically mature, well-developed athletes. For this reason, it is not recommended for adolescent athletes.</p><p>Serum creatinine concentrations may become slightly elevated in athletes with normal renal function who take creatine supplements [<a href="#rid28">28-31</a>]. Primarily, such increases occur because creatinine is a normal byproduct of creatine metabolism, and they do not reflect kidney dysfunction or injury. In some cases, increases may stem from direct absorption of creatinine present in the supplement [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Particular formulations of creatine may lead to relatively larger increases in serum creatinine. Creatine ethyl ester (CEE) appears to cause larger increases than creatine monohydrate, for example [<a href="#rid28">28,30,33</a>]. Creatinine concentrations return to normal when supplementation is ceased.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H906725452"><span class="h2">Protein and amino acids</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Proteins and their amino acid constituents have been promoted widely as muscle-building agents. Common types and their use for sports performance are discussed below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H955369558"><span class="h3">Branched-chain amino acids</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), leucine, valine, and isoleucine, are the most abundant amino acids in muscle [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. They cannot be synthesized in the body, but large amounts are found in red meat and dairy products. Vegetarians can obtain sufficient amounts if they eat an adequate amount and appropriate mix of legumes, nuts, grains, and seeds daily. BCAAs are oxidized in the muscle during exercise.</p><p>Manufacturers of BCAA supplements claim they reduce fatigue, improve endurance, provide fuel for working muscle, and reduce muscle protein breakdown and soreness from exercise. Nevertheless, although BCAAs are widely used by athletes, there is no high-quality evidence of their efficacy, particularly when compared with eating a diet rich in meat, which is less expensive. A chicken breast is said to contain the equivalent of seven average BCAA tablets.</p><p>Laboratory studies have found that the rate of oxidation of BCAAs is too low for the process to make a significant contribution to energy production [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. There is limited scientific evidence (much of it in vitro) that BCAAs may accelerate the repair of muscle damage after exercise.</p><p>Adequate amino acids are needed for muscle protein synthesis following resistance exercise, but no studies have examined the effects of BCAA supplementation on protein synthesis in this setting [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. In addition, no studies have found any change in muscle function as a result of BCAA supplementation. Several studies have reported reductions in muscle soreness after both acute and chronic supplementation, but this is probably most prominent in untrained individuals [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p>5-hydroxytryptophan has been implicated in the development of fatigue in athletes. Increased plasma levels of BCAA during exercise may reduce transport of tryptophan into the brain, and this might reduce the synthesis of 5-hydroxytryptophan [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. A small observational study reported that BCAA supplementation during prolonged exercise improved cognitive function and reduced perceived exertion levels [<a href="#rid38">38</a>].</p><p>Suggested doses for BCAA supplementation are approximately 2 to 4 g per hour during exercise and the immediate recovery period. They are best consumed as a drink.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1052496279"><span class="h3">Glutathione, glutamate, and glutamine</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Glutathione is an important intracellular antioxidant that helps to modulate reactive oxygen species. Glutathione also plays an important role in cellular signaling and transcription processes, including some involved in the adaptations of skeletal muscle to athletic training. Based on these functions, some researchers have proposed that increasing glutathione concentrations via supplementation or increased synthesis may enhance athletic performance. Glutathione is synthesized from glutamate, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8890" href="/z/d/drug information/8890.html" rel="external">cysteine</a>, and glycine. However, there is no convincing, high-quality evidence that supplementation with glutathione or with its amino acid precursors improves athletic performance [<a href="#rid39">39,40</a>]. Therefore, we do not advocate such supplementation outside of well-conducted research trials. </p><p>Individuals with low baseline, pre-exercise glutathione concentrations are more likely to sustain increased oxidative stress and impaired physical performance compared with those with higher baseline concentrations; preliminary research suggests that high baseline concentrations may buffer the effects of reactive oxygen species following such exercise [<a href="#rid41">41,42</a>]. Nevertheless, little research has explored directly the effect of glutathione supplementation on exercise performance. In a randomized trial, 75 males with experience performing resistance exercise were given placebo, 2g/day of L-citrulline, or 200mg/day of glutathione and 2g/day of L-citrulline [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. After eight weeks of supervised resistance training, no significant differences in strength, lean muscle mass, or blood chemistries were noted among groups.</p><p>Glutathione concentrations decrease with age, and reduced serum concentrations are associated with poor health. Thus, supplementation is popular among some patients with chronic medical conditions, such as HIV, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cancer; but there is no high-quality evidence of benefit. </p><p>Gastric enzymes likely limit the action of glutathione. To circumvent these enzyme effects, glutathione is taken orally in liposomes, parenterally, transdermally, or in nebulized form. Substances such as curcumin, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9884" href="/z/d/drug information/9884.html" rel="external">selenium</a>, vitamins C and E, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9317" href="/z/d/drug information/9317.html" rel="external">N-acetylcysteine</a> may boost endogenous production of glutathione. Foods high in glutathione include garlic, broccoli, asparagus, avocado, and spinach.</p><p>The side effects of glutathione supplementation are largely unknown. Gastric cramping, nausea, abdominal bloating, and allergic reactions have been reported. Chronic supplementation has been linked to low serum zinc concentrations.

Glutamine, which is converted to glutamate during normal metabolism, is purported to have anabolic and immune effects of benefit to athletes. Normal dietary intake is approximately 3 to 6 g per day. During intense athletic training, glutamine stores are depleted, and this has been associated with the depressed immune function seen in some endurance athletes [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. Nevertheless, there is little evidence that glutamine supplementation stimulates protein synthesis, reduces protein breakdown or muscle soreness, or improves immune function. Observational evidence suggests that glutamine supplementation may reduce the incidence of upper respiratory tract infections among endurance athletes training intensively [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. The authors of one literature review suggest that chronic oral administration of free L-glutamate or the dipeptide can attenuate the inflammation induced by intense exercise, but find that the effects on muscle recovery remain unclear [<a href="#rid44">44</a>].

Colostrum supplements are made from bovine colostrum and are available as liquids, capsules, tablets, or powder. </p><p>Some believe that the growth factors in colostrum provide ergogenic effects. The insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) found in colostrum is thought by some to increase strength. However, while some studies of long-term colostrum supplementation (eight weeks of 10 to 60 g per day) have reported increased vertical jump, peak sprint cycle power, and endurance performance, other studies of similar design have failed to show benefit [<a href="#rid55">55</a>].</p><p>Improved immunity is another purported benefit of colostrum [<a href="#rid56">56-58</a>].

Antioxidants are purported by some to counteract the negative consequences of reactive oxygen species (free radicals) produced during high-intensity physical activity. However, antioxidant supplementation has not consistently been found to reduce muscle damage or muscle soreness in acute exercise and does not appear to have an ergogenic effect on athletic performance, although some studies show reduced oxidative stress [<a href="#rid61">61,62</a>]. In addition, there is some evidence suggesting that chronic intake of antioxidants may impair training adaptations.</p><p>Antioxidant processes and the metabolism surrounding oxidative stress associated with exercise are complex. Oxidative stress has both beneficial (eg, cellular signaling, transcription) and deleterious (eg, muscle damage, inflammation) metabolic effects, and individuals exhibit wide variations in oxidative stress following eccentric exercise. Supplementation with any antioxidant must balance the potential benefits of reducing the harmful physiologic and performance effects of oxidative stress with the potential harms of blunting adaptive pathways. This balance is as yet unknown. As an example, in a small randomized trial, subjects pre-treated with N-acetyl <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8890" href="/z/d/drug information/8890.html" rel="external">cysteine</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9776" href="/z/d/drug information/9776.html" rel="external">vitamin C</a> sustained greater increases in serum markers of cellular damage following injury induced by eccentric exercise compared with those given placebo [<a href="#rid63">63</a>].

Preliminary evidence suggests that nitrate supplementation designed to increase the bioavailability of NO may reduce fatigue during exercise and may improve performance in short-duration exercise (&lt;15 minutes). NO plays important roles in vasodilatation, platelet aggregation, immune function, mitochondrial function, and hormone regulation, particularly around glucose and calcium homeostasis. </p><p>During physical activity, NO production increases in skeletal muscle. It is thought that NO contributes to the therapeutic effects of exercise and increases glucose uptake by skeletal muscles during exercise independent of any increase in muscle blood flow [<a href="#rid66">66</a>]. NO is produced via oxidation of the amino acid L-arginine and involves the enzyme NO synthase. In addition, NO can be produced by a process not reliant on oxygen, and possibly in acidic conditions, involving the modification of nitrate into nitrite. Given the relative hypoxia and acidic milieu of some tissues during exercise, this mechanism may be important for athletes.</p><p>Nitrate is present in vegetables. Approximately 25 percent of nitrate is converted into nitrite via oral bacteria, and a portion of nitrate intake is converted to NO by the acidic stomach environment. Dietary nitrate produces peak serum concentrations in one to two hours, while nitrite and NO concentrations peak at 2.5 hours. Levels return to baseline at 24 hours. Given the importance of oral bacteria in the metabolic processes, those taking supplements should avoid antibacterial mouthwashes and chewing gums.</p><p>A meta-analysis of 80 randomized, placebo-controlled trials involving 1179 men and 156 women found that nitrate supplementation improves performance among younger, healthy, non-elite endurance athletes; but the effect size was small overall and varied widely among study populations, suggesting that additional factors may be at play [<a href="#rid67">67</a>]. The outcome in the large majority of trials was the time required to cover a set distance, but measures of exercise efficiency were also used. As an example, a randomized trial involving nine male athletes reported that supplementation with 0.1 mmol/kg per day of dietary nitrate improved exercise efficiency, as demonstrated by lower oxygen demand during submaximal work on a cycle ergometer, compared with placebo (ie, sodium chloride supplementation) [<a href="#rid68">68</a>]. A similar trial involving beetroot juice, a naturally occurring rich source of nitrates, reported comparable findings about oxygen demand from submaximal exercise and extended time to exhaustion during high-intensity exercise [<a href="#rid69">69</a>]. These findings have been confirmed in studies of running, walking, cycling, and resistance training [<a href="#rid70">70-72</a>].</p><p>Benefit from nitrate supplementation has <strong>not</strong> been found consistently in high-level athletes. The authors of the aforementioned meta-analysis found that ergogenic benefits demonstrated in other populations were "not observed in well-trained endurance athletes" [<a href="#rid67">67</a>]. As an example, in a study of female speed skaters, no difference in performance was noted among athletes given low-dose (1 mmol nitrate) versus high-dose (6.5 mmol nitrate) supplementation [<a href="#rid73">73</a>]. Possibly, higher doses are needed in such athletes. </p><p>Nitrate supplementation may be of benefit to athletes competing in higher-intensity events lasting four to eight minutes (eg, sprint cycling, rowing, swimming), particularly less fit athletes [<a href="#rid60">60</a>]. Benefit has also been reported in some team sport participants [<a href="#rid74">74</a>]. Overall, available evidence suggests a small improvement in time to exhaustion and a small improvement in performance, and that these effects are greater in recreational athletes [<a href="#rid75">75</a>]. The improvement has been estimated at approximately 3 percent in non-elite male athletes [<a href="#rid67">67</a>].</p><p>The dosing needed acutely to improve performance in highly trained athletes is thought to be between 5.1 and 25 mmol (approximately 1.5 to 6 beetroot juice shots) per day, consumed two and a half hours prior to competition, but chronic supplementation for the few days prior to a completion appears to give better results. There is no consistency in supplementation doses or protocols, subject selection, or sports and exercise protocols in studies to date [<a href="#rid60">60,66,68-71,74</a>]. According to a comprehensive review, the reduced oxygen cost of submaximal exercise can be maintained for at least 15 days if supplementation is continued at a dose of 6 mmol per day [<a href="#rid76">76</a>]. Further research is needed to determine appropriate dosing protocols for training and competition, the true benefits of NO-containing products, particularly in women, and for which sports these purported benefits are most useful.</p><p>Note that <strong>nitrite</strong> salts can be toxic, causing methemoglobinemia. There is one report on an internet forum of an athlete confusing nitrate supplementation with nitrite salts and subsequently developing methemoglobinemia. Nitrite reacts rapidly with hemoglobin, converting it to the ferric form (Fe3+ methemoglobin) rather than the usual ferrous (Fe2+) form. The ferric form of hemoglobin binds oxygen but does not release it readily to tissues, causing ischemia. The lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) for oral nitrite (100 to 200 mg/kg) is comparable to that of cyanide. Organic nitrates and nitrites (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9706" href="/z/d/drug information/9706.html" rel="external">nitroglycerin</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8767" href="/z/d/drug information/8767.html" rel="external">amyl nitrite</a>) can be fatal at too high a dose. High doses of inorganic nitrates are probably safe, as the body can only convert these slowly to nitrite. However, some experts urge caution [<a href="#rid77">77</a>], suggesting that athletes refrain from using nitrate and nitrite salts as dietary supplements, as confusion among the available types could lead to a large unintentional intake that could be life threatening. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7094.html" rel="external">"Methemoglobinemia"</a>.)</p><p>Although these warnings are important to keep in mind, natural sources of nitrate, such as whole vegetables or vegetable juices, appear to hold little risk. At recommended doses, the use of natural products such as beetroot juice seldom causes side effects, and such effects are typically mild. Side effects may include mild GI upset and altered color of urine and stool. Long-term studies on the effects of NO supplement use have not been performed. If nitrate-containing supplements are used, athletes should ensure that they are using only the inorganic form of nitrate.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H706380763"><span class="h3">Tart cherry juice</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Montmorency (or tart) cherries contain anthocyanins, flavonoids (including quercetin), flavonols, procyanidins, and phenolic acids.

Many suggest that the equivalent of 45 to 60 tart cherries be taken twice daily between five and seven days prior to an endurance race, during extended periods of endurance training, and within 30 minutes of completing an intense training session. Montmorency cherries contain melatonin and hence may have positive effects on sleep when used as a supplement [<a href="#rid78">78</a>].</p><p>Studies of tart cherry juice supplementation by athletes are preliminary but report encouraging results.

In addition, carnosine may protect against oxidative damage and participate in glycation. It may also increase the efficiency of excitation-contraction coupling during muscle fiber contraction.</p><p>Carnosine is found in large amounts in type II muscle. Synthesis is limited by the availability of beta-alanine, which can be increased by eating white meat (eg, poultry breast) or taking a supplement. Increasing muscle carnosine via supplementation with beta-alanine most likely improves athletic performance by directly increasing muscular exercise capacity [<a href="#rid94">94,95</a>]. According to a 2015 position paper from The International Society of Sports Nutrition, four weeks of supplementation with beta-alanine significantly increases muscle carnosine concentrations, providing an effective intracellular pH buffer [<a href="#rid95">95</a>]. As with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9928" href="/z/d/drug information/9928.html" rel="external">sodium bicarbonate</a>, the buffering effect from carnosine is likely to benefit athletes involved in high-intensity activity lasting from 30 seconds to 10 minutes; there is no proof of benefit for activities of shorter duration [<a href="#rid94">94</a>].</p><p>A meta-analysis of 40 studies of long-term beta-alanine supplementation in 1461 participants involving a wide range of exercise outcome measures reported a small but statistically significant effect size of 0.18 (95% CI 0.08-0.28) [<a href="#rid94">94</a>]. Of note, the beneficial effect on exercise-to-exhaustion was greater than that on performance-based tests, such as time trials, and the effect on trained individuals was less than for non-trained persons. Nevertheless, the authors believe that trained athletes in appropriate sports (eg, 4 km cycling, 2 km rowing, middle-distance running, and 100, 200, 400, and 800 m swimming) can benefit from supplementation. Sports involving both whole-body exercise and isolated limb exercise benefited equally. The meta-analysis found that both continuous exercise protocols and those involving repeated bouts of high-intensity work improved with supplementation. However, testing was not sport-specific, so questions remain about the effectiveness of beta-alanine for individual sports involving intermittent bursts of high-intensity work over a prolonged period. Another review of the literature concluded that the benefit of beta-alanine is likely sport specific and that there appears to be a slight added benefit when it is given in combination with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9928" href="/z/d/drug information/9928.html" rel="external">sodium bicarbonate</a> [<a href="#rid96">96</a>].</p><p>The typical loading dose among the included studies was 4 to 6 g of beta-alanine per day, ingested in divided doses every three to four hours for at least two to four weeks, or two doses of 2.4 g for 10 weeks, followed by a maintenance dose of 2 g per day.</p><p>Long-term supplementation with both beta-alanine and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9928" href="/z/d/drug information/9928.html" rel="external">sodium bicarbonate</a>, aimed at increasing both intra- and extracellular buffering capacity, appears to provide greater benefits than beta-alanine supplementation alone, according to limited data [<a href="#rid94">94</a>].

HMB was initially used to increase muscle and reduce fat in animals. During the 1990s, use increased among athletes due to claims that it increased lean muscle mass, reduced muscle soreness, and improved aerobic capacity. HMB is also said to have an anticatabolic effects and reduce muscle breakdown. However, available evidence suggests that any ergogenic effect from HMG supplementation in athletes is probably trivial. We suggest that athletes focus on appropriate nutrition to improve protein synthesis, rather than strategies intended to reduce protein breakdown.
