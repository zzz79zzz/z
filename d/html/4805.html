Approximately one-half of these cases are diagnosed prenatally, and the other half are diagnosed in the 12 months after delivery [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Cervical cancer is one of the most common malignancies in pregnancy, with an estimated incidence of 0.8 to 1.5 cases per 10,000 births [<a href="#rid3">3-6</a>].</p><p>Most patients are diagnosed at an early stage of disease [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. This is probably a result of routine prenatal screening, but it is also possible that advanced stage disease interferes with conception. Stage for stage, the course of disease and prognosis of cervical cancer in pregnant patients are similar to those of nonpregnant patients [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>].</p><p>There are no data from large randomized trials upon which to base recommendations for the care of pregnant patients with cervical cancer. Therefore, management is based upon evidence from randomized trials in nonpregnant women, findings from observational studies of pregnant women, and the unique medical and ethical considerations underlying each individual case. Treatment should be individualized and based on the stage of cancer, the woman's desire to continue pregnancy, and the risks of modifying or delaying therapy during pregnancy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cervical cancer is often first suspected when a screening test for the disease is abnormal [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. While they have not been studied directly, the performance characteristics of the Papanicolaou (Pap) test do not appear to differ significantly between pregnant and nonpregnant women [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Overall, the rate of significant cytological abnormalities among obstetrical patients has been reported to be 5 to 8 percent and is similar to that of the nonpregnant population [<a href="#rid1">1,7</a>].</p><p>Symptoms and signs of cervical carcinoma in pregnancy are dependent upon the clinical stage and lesion size  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119447" href="/z/d/graphic/119447.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). In two series, all pregnant patients with stage IA and 50 percent of those with stage IB carcinoma were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis and had their disease detected by routine cancer screening [<a href="#rid6">6,11</a>]. Patients with symptomatic stage IB disease presented with abnormal vaginal bleeding or discharge; patients with more advanced disease also presented with pelvic pain, sciatica-type leg pain, flank pain, chronic anemia, and shortness of breath. Since many of these symptoms are similar to those associated with a normal pregnancy, the diagnosis of cervical cancer may be delayed in pregnant women. </p><p>A gross cervical lesion may be observed or palpated at any gestational age. The ability to detect early neoplasia by physical examination may be limited by normal pregnancy-associated cervical changes such as ectropion, stromal edema, and ripening. In addition, normal decidual reaction of the cervix may resemble carcinoma.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H471209277"><span class="h2">Women with clinical findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cervical cytology to exclude cervical cancer is part of the diagnostic evaluation of abnormal vaginal bleeding in pregnancy. A gross lesion suspicious for malignancy should be biopsied (see <a class="local">'Colposcopy'</a> below). Women with pathologic confirmation of cervical cancer or preinvasive disease should be referred to a gynecologic oncologist for staging. Referral is also indicated if the cervical mass is suspicious for invasive carcinoma but the biopsy results are nondiagnostic. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Women with abnormal cervical cytology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In general, management of pregnant women with abnormal cervical cytology is the same as nonpregnant women, with the following exceptions [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Expedited treatment with a diagnostic excisional procedure is unacceptable without having first performed colposcopy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Endocervical curettage and endometrial biopsy should not be performed as part of the colposcopic evaluation; however, the endocervical canal may be sampled gently with a cytobrush.</p><p></p><p>Details about the management of women with an abnormal cervical cytology in pregnancy are found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128059.html" rel="external">"Cervical cancer screening: Risk assessment, evaluation, and management after screening", section on 'Pregnant patients'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3229.html" rel="external">"Cervical cytology: Evaluation of atypical and malignant glandular cells", section on 'Modifications for pregnant patients'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H471209695"><span class="h2">Colposcopy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If colposcopy is performed, lesions suspicious for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2,3 or cancer should be biopsied [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. If biopsy reveals CIN 1, additional cytologic and colposcopic evaluation should be performed postpartum, but no sooner than four weeks after delivery. If biopsy reveals CIN 2,3, and invasive disease is not suspected, repeat colposcopic evaluation can be performed every 12 to 24 weeks during pregnancy, or deferred until after four weeks postpartum. This is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3215.html" rel="external">"Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Management", section on 'Pregnant patients'</a>.)</p><p>Colposcopic evaluation of the cervix in pregnancy can be challenging; it should be done by a colposcopist experienced in recognizing both pregnancy-related and cancer-related cervical changes [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation of the transformation zone</strong> – If colposcopy in early pregnancy is unsatisfactory, repeating the procedure in 6 to 12 weeks may result in a satisfactory examination because the transformation zone may have "migrated" to the ectocervix, thus allowing a satisfactory examination by 20 weeks of gestation [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cervical biopsies</strong> – Cervical biopsies can be performed during pregnancy without a significantly increased risk of excessive bleeding [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Bleeding, if encountered after biopsy, can be controlled with use of Monsel solution or suturing. Endocervical curettage is not performed in pregnant women because of concern that it may disrupt the pregnancy, although there is no evidence proving an increased risk of pregnancy disruption [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Reliability of colposcopy and biopsies</strong> – The increased vascularity of the gestational cervix exaggerates the way immature metaplastic epithelium reacts to acetic acid, which may mimic a dysplastic lesion [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Conversely, neoplastic cervical lesions early in pregnancy may be mistaken for the normal eversion of the squamocolumnar junction or benign cervical decidualization. The reliability of colposcopy with directed biopsy is not related to the stage of pregnancy when performed by an experienced colposcopist familiar with the changes of the cervix that occur in pregnant women. The reliability of colposcopy and biopsy in pregnancy is illustrated by the following studies:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In one series of 612 gravid patients with abnormal cytology, no invasive carcinoma was missed, and complications of biopsies were minimal, with only two patients experiencing preterm labor and delivery (both had undergone cone biopsies) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Similarly, another study found colposcopy to have concordance, overestimation, and underestimation of the final diagnosis in 72.6, 17.6, and 9.8 percent of cases, respectively [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The authors also noted that the reliability of colposcopy and directed biopsy was not related to the pregnant state.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In one multi-institutional study that included over 1000 women who presented with an abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) smear in pregnancy, colposcopy and subsequent biopsy were performed in 89 patients [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Of those with a colposcopic impression that was normal/CIN 1 (n = 27), the biopsy confirmed this in 22 (81 percent) but found CIN 2,3 in 5 (19 percent). Of those with a colposcopic impression of CIN 2,3 (n = 62), the biopsy confirmed these findings in only 34 patients (54.8 percent), with normal/CIN 1 findings in the 28 remaining cases (45.2 percent).</p><p></p><p>Repeat evaluation postpartum is essential, as persistent high-grade disease is common [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>]. As an example, one study reported persistent HSIL postpartum in all 28 patients with antepartum HSIL, three of whom were diagnosed with microinvasive carcinoma [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Another study observed that HSIL regressed to normal in 53 percent, 31 percent had persistent high-grade disease, and 16 percent regressed to a lower-grade lesion within six months postpartum, but about one-half the patients in this series were lost to follow-up [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128059.html" rel="external">"Cervical cancer screening: Risk assessment, evaluation, and management after screening"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3215.html" rel="external">"Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Indications for and performance of conization</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Traditional indications for cervical conization in the nongravid population are not applicable during pregnancy. Diagnostic conization in <strong>nonpregnant</strong> patients is performed to exclude invasive cancer when a punch biopsy shows only microinvasive disease or adenocarcinoma in situ (stage IA or microscopic IB, no clinically visible lesion) because the maximum depth of invasion can only be determined by examination of the entire lesion. By contrast, diagnostic conization is only indicated during pregnancy if confirmation of invasive disease will alter the timing or mode of delivery; otherwise, conization is postponed until the postpartum period to avoid potentially disrupting the pregnancy [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3179.html" rel="external">"Invasive cervical cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3218.html" rel="external">"Cervical adenocarcinoma in situ"</a>.)</p><p>If prepartum conization is performed, the optimal time appears to be the second trimester, preferably between 14 and 20 weeks of gestation. Cervical conization should not be performed within four weeks of the estimated date of delivery because labor may cause the fresh conization wound to hemorrhage or extend [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6775.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for nonobstetric surgery during pregnancy"</a>.)</p><p>Technically, pregnancy-related eversion of the squamocolumnar junction facilitates the conization procedure in pregnant women. Frequently, a limited wedge biopsy is all that is needed to produce an appropriate diagnostic specimen. Some experts suggest excising a "coin"-shaped specimen instead of a "cone"- shaped specimen to limit disruption of the endocervical canal, minimize morbidities associated with blood loss, and avoid disturbing the fetal membranes [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. If a true conization is required, one option is to perform a cone cerclage whereby a cerclage is placed immediately after the conization [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3255.html" rel="external">"Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Diagnostic excisional procedures"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6737.html" rel="external">"Transvaginal cervical cerclage"</a>.)</p><p>Potential complications of conization during pregnancy include hemorrhage (5 to 15 percent), miscarriage, premature rupture of membranes, preterm labor/delivery, and infection [<a href="#rid19">19,24</a>]. Fetal death is uncommon. It has been reported weeks after the conization procedure and, in some cases, was attributed to chorioamnionitis [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. The frequency of operative hemorrhage greater than 500 mL correlates with the trimester in which the procedure is performed: the risk is minimal in the first trimester, about 5 percent in the second, and about 10 percent in the third [<a href="#rid20">20,26</a>]. In the largest consecutive series of cone biopsies during pregnancy (n = 180), fetal loss possibly or probably related to the procedure occurred in eight (4.5 percent) pregnancies [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Three of the eight fetal losses occurred prior to 14 weeks of gestation and one to four weeks after conization. Thirteen women (7.2 percent) lost greater than 500 mL of blood, 11 of whom were in the third trimester.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H471210031"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of cervical cancer is based upon histological confirmation of the disease in a cervical biopsy specimen. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3179.html" rel="external">"Invasive cervical cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Histopathology'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">STAGING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Accurate staging is critical for patient counseling and treatment planning. In 2018, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) expanded the list of tests and procedures that may be used in assigning stage to include imaging and pathologic findings where available  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119447" href="/z/d/graphic/119447.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3244.html" rel="external">"Invasive cervical cancer: Staging and evaluation of lymph nodes"</a>.)</p><p>The ninth version of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system was published in March 2021 and is shown in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef139268" href="/z/d/graphic/139268.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p>All studies in this topic are described using the staging system used at the time of study, but otherwise, the 2018 FIGO staging is the system used in this topic.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Physical examination is a key element of the clinical staging process and includes assessment of the primary tumor, uterus, vagina, parametria, groin, right upper quadrant, and supraclavicular nodes. If examination in an ambulatory setting is suboptimal, we suggest performing the examination under anesthesia.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Imaging studies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the nongravid population, radiologic studies that can be used for FIGO staging include chest and skeletal radiographs, intravenous pyelogram (IVP), and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9180" href="/z/d/drug information/9180.html" rel="external">barium</a> enema. Findings on computed tomographic (CT) studies, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and lymphangiograms may also be used for staging purposes, and may be helpful for treatment planning, but are not necessary.</p><p>In pregnant women, we suggest the following approach that balances the need to obtain information for maternal management with the competing need to limit fetal exposure to ionizing radiation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4791.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic imaging in pregnant and lactating patients"</a>.) </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A chest x-ray (with abdominal shielding) is warranted for evaluation of pulmonary metastatic disease in all patients with more than microscopic cervical cancer.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For stage IA and microscopic/very small stage IB (&lt;1 cm) cervical cancer in which extracervical disease is unlikely, routine radiographic imaging of the urinary tract may be omitted.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For larger stage IB1, bulky stage IB2, or more advanced disease and/or higher-risk histology (adenocarcinoma, small cell carcinoma), the urinary tract should be imaged with ultrasonography or MRI to rule out stage IIIB disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For larger stage IB1, bulky stage IB2, or more advanced disease and/or higher-risk histology (adenocarcinoma, small cell carcinoma), additional imaging of the abdomen and pelvis is extremely helpful for patient counseling and formulation of a management plan.</p><p></p><p>Ultrasonography and/or MRI can be used to evaluate liver and urinary tract involvement. MRI has the advantage of excellent tissue contrast and depicts pelvic anatomy in three planes; therefore, it can be used to calculate tumor volume and assess spread to adjacent organs and lymph nodes. For the assessment of tumor size in nonpregnant patients, the overall accuracy of MRI is 93 percent and the negative predictive value for parametrial invasion is above 95 percent [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. For small nodal metastases, the accuracy of conventional MRI in nonpregnant patients is poor; however, once nodal diameter is greater than 1 cm in short axis, the sensitivity and specificity of MRI are 62 to 89 percent and 88 to 91 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Lymphadenectomy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In selected patients who desire to continue their pregnancy but are at significant risk for lymph node metastases, staging lymphadenectomy during pregnancy via extraperitoneal or laparoscopic approach may provide the most definitive information on lymph node status [<a href="#rid31">31-34</a>]. This information is important, as patients diagnosed with high-risk (node-positive) disease should be counseled about the importance of initiating immediate definitive therapy [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. Case reports on patients with early-stage cervical cancer who underwent successful laparoscopic lymphadenectomy during pregnancy suggest the feasibility of this approach, although this may be dependent on the surgeon’s preference and experience [<a href="#rid32">32-34</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Endoscopy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Endoscopic staging procedures, such as cystoscopy or proctosigmoidoscopy, are rarely indicated, but if required, experts in this area have concluded that endoscopy during pregnancy is generally safe if performed by an experienced operator [<a href="#rid36">36,37</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1130549414"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT OF PREINVASIVE DISEASE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment of preinvasive disease should be deferred to the postpartum period. Re-evaluation and definitive therapy for preinvasive disease should be completed six to eight weeks following delivery [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. Even when the preinvasive disease is high-grade, the risk of progression to invasive carcinoma during pregnancy is exceedingly small (0 to 0.4 percent) [<a href="#rid39">39-41</a>]. In addition, regression may occur postpartum, thus obviating the need for excision [<a href="#rid17">17,40</a>]. It is unclear whether route of delivery (vaginal versus cesarean) affects the rate of regression [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]; therefore, route of delivery should be based on standard obstetrical indications.

Although only low-quality data are available, this strategy appears to be sufficient and relatively safe [<a href="#rid43">43,44</a>]. In a report of eight pregnant women with IA1 squamous cell carcinoma (negative margins and no lymphovascular space involvement [LVSI]) diagnosed by cervical conization and managed expectantly for 9 to 25 weeks, no disease progression was documented before definitive therapy [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. </p><p>It is important that patients are aware that cervical conization during pregnancy may be associated with significant morbidity and perinatal complications.

Therefore, women with stage IA1 and IA2 cervical cancer can proceed with a vaginal delivery, with cesarean delivery reserved for standard obstetrical indications. Episiotomy should be avoided when possible. At least 15 cases of tumor cell implantation in the episiotomy site have been reported after vaginal birth in women with cervical cancer [<a href="#rid58">58</a>].

It is important that the psychosocial needs of women in this situation be actively addressed, even while a treatment plan is developed. For women with metastatic cervical cancer in pregnancy, the management is medical and aimed at disease control, not cure.
