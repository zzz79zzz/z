Most children with sickle cell anemia (Hb SS) and sickle cell beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia have decreased to absent splenic function by age one to two years; children with other SCD genotypes lose splenic function later in childhood. Thus, most individuals with SCD are at especially high risk of infection with encapsulated organisms across their lifespan. (See <a class="local">'Genotype (Hb SS versus SC versus S-beta thalassemia)'</a> below.)</p><p>Fever is frequently the first indication of serious and life-threatening bacterial infection. Fever may also indicate other serious SCD-associated conditions such as acute chest syndrome. </p><p>The definition of a fever has not been rigorously studied (see <a class="local">'What constitutes a fever?'</a> below), and a strict cutoff value cannot be used to determine the risk of serious bacterial infection without an evaluation of the individual patient's circumstance. Individuals with SCD and fever at any age should be evaluated and treated promptly to avoid significant morbidity and mortality.</p><p>The management of children and adults with SCD and fever is reviewed here. Overviews of other clinical manifestations and their management in individuals with SCD are presented separately.

This hyposplenic or asplenic state, commonly referred to as functional asplenia, places them at risk of life-threatening infections. </p><p>The risk of life-threatening infection occurs throughout the lifespan in individuals with SCD. The risk of infection is higher in infants and young children with sickle cell anemia (Hb SS) and sickle cell beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia. (See <a class="local">'Genotype (Hb SS versus SC versus S-beta thalassemia)'</a> below.)</p><p>Individuals with functional asplenia are particularly at risk for serious infection with encapsulated bacteria such as <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and <em>Haemophilus</em> <em>influenzae</em>; other organisms are commonly reported.

However, approximately one-fourth of deaths in children during the period from 1999 to 2002 were due to infectious causes, and case series published after the introduction of the newest pneumococcal vaccine indicate a prevalence of bacteremia in febrile patients with SCD of 0.8 to 4 percent [<a href="#rid12">12-15</a>]. However, European data from 2014 to 2019 confirm that even with widespread availability of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="15567" href="/d/drug information/15567.html" rel="external">PCV13</a>, <em>S. pneumoniae </em>remains the leading cause of bacterial infection in children with SCD, and infection results in a 7 percent chance of death and a 17 percent chance of sequelae [<a href="#rid16">16</a>] Further, the evolving pneumococcal conjugate vaccine recommendations make it difficult to know which strains a particular patient has received vaccination against. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Some strains of <em>S. pneumoniae</em> are not covered by the available vaccines [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Other organisms are not covered by immunization, including <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> [<a href="#rid10">10,13,16,18,19</a>]. </p><p></p><p>In a population-based study from 2021 that included 9503 individuals in the National Health Service of the United Kingdom who were followed over a 10-year period, sepsis requiring hospitalization occurred in 11 percent [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Pneumonia, clinically indistinguishable from acute chest syndrome (ACS), was associated with 18 of 29 (62 percent) of respiratory deaths [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H530614745"><span class="h2">What constitutes a fever?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The definition of a fever has not been rigorously studied in SCD, and a strict cutoff cannot be used to determine the risk of serious bacterial infection without evaluating the patient. Guidelines from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States suggest using a temperature cutoff of ≥38.5°C (equivalent to approximately ≥101.3°F) to trigger immediate evaluation in the emergency department in all cases [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. However, many SCD experts use a lower cutoff, such as ≥38°C (≥100.4°F) or ≥38.3°C (≥100.9°F) [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]. A reasonable strategy is to use the lower temperature threshold in the subgroup of infants with the highest risk of bacteremia (infants &lt;1 year of age), but no evidence-based recommendations have been established. (See <a class="local">'Initial evaluation'</a> below.) </p><p>Patients and parents/caregivers of an individual with SCD should have clear information about the temperature threshold they should personally use and the importance of in-person evaluation should they develop a temperature at or above that threshold. (See <a class="local">'Initial evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>The degree of fever in individuals with SCD cannot be considered comparable to individuals without SCD for the following reasons:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Functional asplenia or hyposplenia</strong> – SCD is an immunocompromising state due to ongoing loss of splenic function beginning at an early age.

Pain is the most common presenting symptom of COVID-19 in adults with SCD [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Other common symptoms are cough, fever, and dyspnea [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Patients with SCD are not at an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 compared with those without SCD, but they are at higher risk of severe disease. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 2022 systemic review of 71 COVID-19 related studies across 15 countries including over 2000 individuals with SCD showed that while adults with SCD typically have a mild to moderate disease course, they also have a twofold to sevenfold increased risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization and a 1.2-fold increased risk of COVID-19-related death relative to adults without SCD; these risks are similar to individuals with similar comorbidities and end-organ damage [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">When compared specifically with Black individuals without SCD or sickle cell trait, patients with SCD and COVID-19 remained at a higher risk of hospitalization (relative risk [RR] 2.0, 95% CI 1.5-2.7), pneumonia (RR 2.4, 95% CI 1.6-3.4), and pain (RR 3.4, 95% CI 2.5-4.8) [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. However, the case fatality rates for those with SCD compared with Black persons without SCD or sickle cell trait were not significantly different. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 2023 meta-analysis that included over 6000 patients with SCD confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection found an overall case fatality rate of 3 percent [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. In addition, 10 percent of patients with SCD were admitted to an intensive care unit after complications caused by COVID-19, and 4 percent of them required invasive ventilatory support. However, in-hospital mortality and invasive mechanical ventilation outcomes in SCD are comparable to that in non-SCD patients hospitalized with COVID-19 [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. </p><p></p><p>Children with SCD are less likely to experience COVID-19-related severe illness and death compared with adults with or without SCD [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2938013689"><span class="h2">Pediatric versus adult considerations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Infants, children, adolescents, and adults with SCD are at risk for potentially life-threatening infection. The following age-specific differences may affect decision-making regarding care:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Infants and young children with SCD may not have received some vaccinations due to their age and the recommended vaccination schedule; these individuals may be unprotected against certain infectious organisms. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7114.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease", section on 'Immunizations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Many children under age 5 to 7 years with SCD are receiving regular penicillin prophylaxis. Prophylactic penicillin is not sufficient treatment if fever develops; in fact, it may select for penicillin-resistant pneumococci requiring the use of parenteral agents for treating possible bacteremia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7114.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease", section on 'Prophylactic penicillin'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Large population studies are not available to describe the epidemiology of life-threatening bacterial infections in children beyond the penicillin prophylaxis age and/or in adults with SCD. However, risk factors for serious infections persist throughout life, and clinical experience demonstrates that fatal sepsis can occur. In a two-center international study of adults with SCD, 19 percent died from microbiologically-documented infectious organisms [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H450215107"><span class="h2">Genotype (Hb SS versus SC versus S-beta thalassemia)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>SCD is an umbrella term that includes persons who are homozygous for the S hemoglobin variant (Hb SS, also called sickle cell anemia) as well as various compound syndromes (Hb S in combination with Hb C, beta<sup>+</sup>-thalassemia, or beta<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia). The degree of splenic dysfunction and other markers of disease severity differ depending on the syndrome. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7115.html" rel="external">"Overview of compound sickle cell syndromes"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hb SS and Hb S-beta</strong><strong><sup>0</sup></strong><strong>-thalassemia</strong> – Splenic dysfunction begins before one year of age; disease is typically more severe.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hb SC and Hb S-beta</strong><strong><sup>+</sup></strong><strong>-thalassemia</strong> – Splenic dysfunction is variable and may or may not occur with onset during childhood and adolescence. Disease is typically less severe, but severe complications may occur.</p><p></p><p>The risks of serious vaso-occlusive complications, bacteremia, and sepsis are generally greater in individuals with Hb SS and Hb S-beta<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia than for Hb SC disease and Hb S-beta<sup>+</sup>-thalassemia [<a href="#rid18">18,28,29</a>]. This is because individuals with Hb SC disease and sickle beta<sup>+</sup>-thalassemia have relatively preserved splenic function during early childhood and perhaps into later life [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. </p><p>However, individuals with all forms of SCD must be seen to be at risk for life-threatening infection, and fever may be the first sign that such an infection is present. Individuals with the less severe compound SCD syndromes may also die from bacterial infections [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. Thus, many centers evaluate children and adults with Hb SC disease and Hb S-beta<sup>+</sup> thalassemia in a similar fashion as other sickle cell syndromes when fever develops. Criteria for admission to the hospital are also similar for all genotypes.

The primary hematologist can provide information regarding the individual's baseline hematologic and other laboratory values, prior SCD-related events, vaccinations, and prior episodes of fever and bacteremia. In addition, the hematologist may offer information about medication adherence and care resources in the home.</p><p>The primary hematologist can assist with decisions about hospital admission and follow-up of the emergency department visit or admission and should be informed about the clinical course and blood culture results.

In a cohort of 9503 individuals of all ages with SCD followed for 10 years, sepsis occurred in 11.1 percent [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. </p><p>If possible, the assessment should be performed by medical personnel who are knowledgeable about SCD, have information about the particular patient's baseline hematologic values and status, and can provide empiric parenteral antibiotics after at least one blood culture has been drawn (including culture of a central line if present).</p><p>The purpose of the evaluation is to:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Confirm that a fever has occurred and the maximum temperature. If the pre-agreed temperature elevation has occurred, based on patient history or direct measurement (see <a class="local">'What constitutes a fever?'</a> above), then a history, physical, laboratory evaluation, and administration of a parenteral dose of antibiotic should rapidly occur.

They may have enhanced inflammation, a blunted temperature response, a greater risk for dehydration, and/or other SCD complications. SCD experts use a cutoff of ≥38 to 38.5°C (≥100.4 to 101.3°F) for empiric parenteral antibiotics and possible admission. Input from the primary hematologist is important for appropriate evaluation and treatment. (See <a class="local">'Key aspects of management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation </strong>– The history focuses on symptoms, vaccination status, prior infection history, medications, and psychosocial support. The examination assesses hemodynamic and cardiopulmonary status, oxygenation, presence of a venous catheter, abdomen, spleen, bones, skin, and neurologic status. Vaso-occlusive pain and/or other SCD complications may be present and should be rapidly assessed. (See <a class="local">'History'</a> above and <a class="local">'Examination'</a> above and <a class="local">'Evaluation for associated conditions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Laboratory tests</strong> – Diagnostic tests include complete blood count (CBC), reticulocyte count, blood culture, urinalysis, SARS-CoV-2 testing during times of high transmission, and influenza swab during flu season. Chest radiograph or lung ultrasound should be obtained for lower respiratory symptoms, abnormal lung examination, or history of acute chest syndrome (ACS). Individuals with diarrhea should have stool culture, those with meningeal signs should have cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and those with signs of severe anemia should have a type and crossmatch. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Antibiotics </strong>– Empiric parenteral antibiotics are required in <strong>all</strong> children and adults with SCD and fever; they should be administered within 60 minutes of presentation. For most patients, we suggest <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13136" href="/d/drug information/13136.html" rel="external">ceftriaxone</a> over other antibiotics (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). The dose is 50 to 100 mg/kg intravenously (maximum 2 g). <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12874" href="/d/drug information/12874.html" rel="external">Vancomycin</a> may be added for hemodynamic instability, suspected meningitis, or an indwelling central line or port. Alternatives for cephalosporin-allergic individuals include <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12549" href="/d/drug information/12549.html" rel="external">levofloxacin</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13157" href="/d/drug information/13157.html" rel="external">ciprofloxacin</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12962" href="/d/drug information/12962.html" rel="external">ofloxacin</a>, or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12583" href="/d/drug information/12583.html" rel="external">meropenem</a>.

Individuals who do not meet any criteria can be managed as an outpatient after receiving a dose of empiric parenteral antibiotic (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13136" href="/d/drug information/13136.html" rel="external">ceftriaxone</a>) with a specific plan for follow-up the next day and immediate recall for documented bacteremia. (See <a class="local">'Criteria for hospital admission'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inpatient</strong> – Inpatient management includes initiation of continuous hemodynamic and oxygen saturation monitoring, appropriate supportive care, continuation of empiric antibiotics, venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis (age dependent), and readjustment of antibiotics when culture results are available. For acute chest syndrome (ACS), an oral macrolide is also recommended. Patients may be discharged when they are afebrile, have no growth from blood cultures for at least 24 hours, and have no other active SCD complication that requires inpatient management. (See <a class="local">'Inpatient management'</a> above and <a class="local">'Discharge from the hospital'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prevention</strong> – Preventive measures to reduce infection following discharge include comprehensive immunizations, prophylactic penicillin (if age-appropriate), and instructions to return for medical evaluation if fever recurs.
