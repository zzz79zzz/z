        <p>
         Older age and the duration and severity of hyperglycemia are the major risk factors for the development of diabetic neuropathy in patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Obesity and metabolic syndrome are significant and independent risk factors for diabetic neuropathy, particularly in type 2 diabetes. Clinical studies from varied patient populations [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,9-12
         </a>
         ] all strongly suggest that one or more components of the metabolic syndrome are critical drivers of diabetic neuropathy [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,9-12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The association between neuropathy and metabolic syndrome is not limited to type 2 diabetes [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Among 1172 participants in the EURODIAB study with type 1 diabetes and no neuropathy at baseline, a distal symmetric polyneuropathy developed over a mean follow-up of 7.3 years in 276 patients (24 percent) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. In addition to duration of diabetes and glycolated hemoglobin values, the incidence of neuropathy in these type 1 patients was significantly associated with increased triglyceride levels, body mass index, and the presence of hypertension at baseline, all markers of the metabolic syndrome.

         </span>
         Diabetic polyneuropathy is primarily a distal symmetric sensory polyneuropathy. The earliest signs of diabetic polyneuropathy probably reflect the gradual loss of integrity of both large myelinated and small myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118369" href="/z/d/graphic/118369.html" rel="external">

         The main symptoms of diabetic polyneuropathy include negative symptoms (those related to nerve fiber loss or dysfunction), such as numbness and loss of balance, and positive symptoms (those related to abnormal function of surviving nerve fibers), such as tingling and pain. Symptoms start distally in the toes and feet [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ], and positive symptoms are usually worse at night. Some patients, however, have few complaints. Up to one-half of patients with diabetic polyneuropathy may be asymptomatic [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ], but the physical examination reveals mild to moderately severe sensory loss [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17
         </a>
         ]. Decreased or absent ankle reflexes occur early in the disease, while more widespread loss of reflexes is a late finding.
        </p>
        <p>
         With disease progression, sensory loss ascends and, when reaching approximately mid-calf, appears in the hands. This gradual evolution causes the typical "stocking-glove" sensory loss. This pattern reflects preferential damage according to axon length; the longest axons are affected first. Motor involvement with frank weakness occurs in the same pattern, but only much later and in more severe cases.

         Diabetic polyneuropathy is frequently insidious in onset and can lead to formation of foot ulcers and muscle and joint disease. Progressive loss of protective sensation predisposes to ulcer formation [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Foot ulcers are usually classified into two groups: acute ulcers secondary to dermal abrasion from poorly fitting shoes and chronic plantar ulcers occurring over weight-bearing areas. Chronic ulceration is probably multifactorial, due to a combination of diabetic polyneuropathy (with decreased pain sensation), autonomic dysfunction, and vascular insufficiency. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1749.html" rel="external">
          "Evaluation of the diabetic foot"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Distal motor axonal loss results in atrophy of intrinsic foot muscles and an imbalance between strength in toe extensors and flexors. This ultimately leads to chronic metatarsal-phalangeal flexion (claw-toe deformity) which shifts weight to the metatarsal heads [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. This weight shift results in formation of calluses that can fissure, become infected and ulcerate. Other arthropathic changes may also develop, including collapse of the arch of the midfoot and bony prominences leading to Charcot arthropathy, fragmentation and sclerosis of bone, new bone formation, subluxation, dislocation, and stress fractures.

         The discussion that follows regarding the diagnosis of diabetic polyneuropathy applies primarily to patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. An overview of the diagnostic approach to suspected polyneuropathy in patients without diabetes or in those who have not yet been evaluated for diabetes is found elsewhere. (See

         The prevalence of diabetic polyneuropathy (and other microvascular and macrovascular complications) increases with disease duration. This was illustrated by a study from Finland that evaluated the natural history of peripheral polyneuropathy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Polyneuropathy was diagnosed on the basis of both clinical (pain and paresthesia) and electrodiagnostic (nerve conduction velocity and response-amplitude values) criteria. The prevalence of definite or probable polyneuropathy progressively increased from 8 percent at baseline to 42 percent at 10 years; comparable values in normal subjects were 2 and 6 percent, respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
         The duration and severity of hyperglycemia and components of the metabolic syndrome are major risk factors for the development of diabetic neuropathy, as discussed separately. (See

         The recommended ADA assessments can be met by using one or more simple screening tests (see
         <a class="local">
          'Simple screening tests'
         </a>
         below). These screening tests used to diagnose diabetic neuropathy do
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         require electrodiagnostic assessments with nerve conduction studies or quantitative sensory testing. The use of electrodiagnostic studies is not indicated for the routine diagnosis of diabetic polyneuropathy, but may be helpful when clinical features are atypical (eg, motor greater than sensory neuropathy, rapid onset, asymmetrical presentation), when the diagnosis is unclear, or when a different etiology is suspected [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Because of the potentially severe complications, including amputation for infected, nonhealing ulcers, early detection of diabetic polyneuropathy is important. Early detection, if followed by therapeutic interventions including patient education, regular foot surveillance, and improved glycemic and metabolic control, may decrease the morbidity of diabetic polyneuropathy.
        </p>
        <p>
         All patients with polyneuropathy, including those who are asymptomatic, should receive foot care education and consideration for podiatric referral. The patient should be instructed to carefully inspect his or her feet every day [

          not
         </strong>
         require further testing. Electrodiagnostic testing is necessary only when the clinical presentation of polyneuropathy is atypical for diabetic polyneuropathy [

         For patients with diabetes who have an unclear cause of neuropathy despite a detailed clinical history and examination, suggested laboratory tests include serum B12 and serum protein immunoelectrophoresis with immunofixation [

         Patients with typical symptoms and signs of diabetic symmetric polyneuropathy (ie, symmetry, distal onset, predominant sensory loss, slow progression) generally do not need referral for specialist consultation. However, to help obtain an accurate diagnosis, patients with atypical presenting symptoms or signs should be referred to a neurologist or neuromuscular specialist, who can direct further investigations including electrodiagnostic testing. Atypical presenting features suggesting a cause other than diabetes include the following:

         In the absence of atypical features, the differential diagnosis of bilateral distal symmetric pain in the toes and feet is neuropathy or peripheral arterial disease. The physical examination is helpful (decreased sensation or loss of deep tendon reflexes), but these signs of neuropathy do not necessarily mean that the pain is due to the neuropathy. Several clues that the patient has neuropathic pain are the location of pain (feet more than calves), the quality of the pain, and the timing of pain (present at rest, improves with walking)  (

          Risk factors
         </strong>
         – The duration and severity of hyperglycemia are major risk factors for the development of diabetic neuropathy in patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Additional risk factors include older age, metabolic syndrome, and obesity. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Risk factors'

         <strong>
          Clinical manifestations
         </strong>
         – Diabetic polyneuropathy is primarily a distal symmetric sensory polyneuropathy. The main symptoms are numbness, tingling, pain, and weakness, starting distally in the toes and feet. The symptoms are usually worse at night. Up to one-half of patients with diabetic polyneuropathy may be asymptomatic, but the physical examination reveals mild to moderately severe sensory loss. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical manifestations'

         <strong>
          Patient selection for screening
         </strong>
         – Diabetic polyneuropathy should be suspected in any patient with type 1 diabetes of more than five years duration and in all patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition, polyneuropathy due to prediabetes should be suspected in any patient presenting with "idiopathic" painful polyneuropathy. (See
         <a class="local">

         – The history and examination should focus on identifying the typical symptoms (eg, numbness, tingling, and pain starting in the toes, with slow progression and proximal spread) and signs (eg, symmetric distal sensory loss) that support the diagnosis of diabetic polyneuropathy  (
