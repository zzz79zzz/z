The classification relies on the use of immunohistochemical characterization in addition to light microscopy for accurate diagnosis, allowing for subtyping that more judiciously guides treatment strategy and predicts clinical course. It provides standardized criteria and terminology for lung cancer diagnosis on small biopsies and cytology, which is critical, given that the majority of patients with lung cancer present with high-stage disease and are not surgical candidates. Finally, it provides guidance for doing molecular testing on many carcinoma types, particularly adenocarcinomas, recognizing the therapeutic importance of targetable genetic alterations. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16538.html" rel="external">"Personalized, genotype-directed therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer"</a>.) </p><p>The 2021 WHO classification re-emphasizes several important concepts, building on the major changes made in the 2015 classification, particularly in the classification of adenocarcinoma, which utilized the expert panel recommendations of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, the American Thoracic Society, and the European Respiratory Society [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. The 2021 WHO classification reflects the following changes:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The proposed grading scheme is based on the patterns and extent of high-grade patterns, which include solid, micropapillary, cribriform, and complex glandular patterns.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The addition of the SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated tumor to the classification.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Renaming of lymphoepithelial-like carcinoma to lymphoepithelial carcinoma, a designation that includes both Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive and EBV-negative tumors.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Renaming enteric adenocarcinoma to enteric-type adenocarcinoma.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">ADENOCARCINOMA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of lung cancer in contemporary series, accounting for approximately one-half of lung cancer cases. The increased incidence of adenocarcinoma is thought to be due to the introduction of low-tar filter cigarettes in the 1960s, although such causality is unproven [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) classification emphasizes that tissue specimens should be managed not only for pathologic diagnosis, but also to preserve tissue for molecular studies, which have important treatment implications such as use of targeted therapies for certain subsets of patients. Patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma and other non-small carcinomas not otherwise specified should have their tumors tested for the presence of a driver mutation (eg, mutated epidermal growth factor receptor [<em>EGFR</em>], anaplastic lymphoma kinase [<em>ALK</em>] translocation, and increasingly, other mutations) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Increasingly, tumors are being tested for a wide variety of molecular alterations by next-generation sequencing. While these tests can be performed on small biopsies, there is a lower limit of sample size and so clinicians performing procedures, such as endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsies, are encouraged to work with cytopathologists in order to assure that samples are sufficiently large to perform the desired testing. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16538.html" rel="external">"Personalized, genotype-directed therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer"</a>.) </p><p>Histologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma requires evidence of either neoplastic gland formation, pneumocyte marker expression (thyroid transcription factor 1 [TTF-1] +/- napsin), or intracytoplasmic mucin (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108078" href="/d/graphic/108078.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108080" href="/d/graphic/108080.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). There is significant variation in the extent and architecture of neoplastic gland formation. The major nonmucinous subtypes are acinar, papillary, micropapillary, lepidic, and solid. These patterns and their proportions in resected specimens have prognostic significance [<a href="#rid3">3,7,8</a>]. The cribriform, solid, and micropapillary patterns have adverse prognostic significance [<a href="#rid9">9</a>], while solid and micropapillary patterns also may predict benefit for those patients having adjuvant chemotherapy after complete resection [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Mucinous lesions can also grow in a lepidic fashion and show papillary, micropapillary, solid, and cribriform architecture, but at this time the WHO does not make any specific recommendations about grading invasive mucinous carcinomas based on the growth patterns in a tumor. Less common forms of adenocarcinoma include colloid, enteric-like, lymphoepithelial, and fetal (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108093" href="/d/graphic/108093.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1177702"><span class="h2">2021 classification of adenocarcinoma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The 2021 WHO classification is similar to the 2015 classification (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef134099" href="/d/graphic/134099.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3-5,11,12</a>].

Mucinous lesions comprise a small subset of such tumors (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108087" href="/d/graphic/108087.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>).

Fetal adenocarcinoma, once referred to as endodermal tumors resembling fetal lung, are considered by some to represent a "monophasic" subset of pulmonary blastoma [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. Classical pulmonary blastoma is a biphasic tumor in which fetal adenocarcinoma is accompanied by a primitive mesenchymal component resembling the blastomatous component of renal Wilms tumors. Regardless of their true histogenesis, fetal adenocarcinomas have a distinctive histologic appearance and are associated with a better prognosis than typical pulmonary adenocarcinomas (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108093" href="/d/graphic/108093.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>On small biopsies, lesions without identifiable adenocarcinoma patterns present, but in which immunohistochemical (IHC) stains support the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma (eg, TTF-1 positive) the terminology "non-small cell carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma" is used (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79343" href="/d/graphic/79343.html" rel="external">picture 11</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>At resection, in similar fashion to biopsies, a morphologically undifferentiated non-small cell carcinoma with TTF-1 positivity would now be classified as an adenocarcinoma with a wholly solid pattern based on IHC, as opposed to a large cell carcinoma.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Tumor spread through air spaces [<a href="#rid3">3</a>] should be reported on resection specimens, as it appears to be associated with a higher recurrence rate in those who undergo limited resections, and is a predictor of worse clinical outcome.</p><p></p><p>Radiographic correlates of this classification have also been developed and include some of the following observations: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>AAH and nonmucinous AIS characteristically have a ground-glass radiographic appearance (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60122" href="/d/graphic/60122.html" rel="external">image 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72990" href="/d/graphic/72990.html" rel="external">image 2</a>).

The mixed histology probably represents the well-recognized heterogeneity of lung carcinomas rather than a prognostically distinct subset [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. The reported incidence of adenosquamous carcinoma ranges from 0.4 to 4 percent of bronchogenic carcinomas. Adenosquamous carcinoma is an aggressive tumor and appears to have a poorer prognosis than either adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. As these tumors are comprised in part of a glandular component, molecular testing of the tumor is recommended. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16538.html" rel="external">"Personalized, genotype-directed therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1177018"><span class="h1">SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Squamous cell carcinoma was the most frequent histologic type of lung tumor in nearly all studies done prior to the mid-1980s. Now, adenocarcinoma is more common than squamous cell carcinoma, particularly in women.</p><p>The diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma is predicated upon the presence of keratin production by tumor cells and/or intercellular desmosomes (referred to as "intercellular bridges") (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72421" href="/d/graphic/72421.html" rel="external">picture 12</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73209" href="/d/graphic/73209.html" rel="external">picture 13</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51629" href="/d/graphic/51629.html" rel="external">picture 14</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78684" href="/d/graphic/78684.html" rel="external">picture 15</a>), or by immunohistochemistry (IHC) consistent with squamous cell carcinoma (ie, expression of p40, p63, CK5, CK5/6, or desmoglein). Variants of squamous cell carcinoma include nonkeratinizing, keratinizing, and basaloid subtypes, with clear cell change now regarded as a cytologic feature rather than a separate tumor type [<a href="#rid3">3,11</a>]. Tumors are nonkeratinizing if there is no keratinization, keratinizing if any keratinization is present, and basaloid if basaloid features comprise more than 50 percent of the tumor. For tumors that are nonkeratinizing, IHC is required to distinguish between squamous carcinoma, solid type adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma with a null phenotype. For such tumors, diffuse positive staining with a squamous marker should be present to confirm a squamous phenotype. The preferable marker is p40, as p63 is not specific for squamous differentiation, and may be seen in adenocarcinomas. </p><p>Most squamous cell carcinomas (60 to 80 percent) arise in the proximal portions of the tracheobronchial tree (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59922" href="/d/graphic/59922.html" rel="external">picture 16</a>) through a squamous metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma in situ sequence (squamous carcinoma in situ), although they are increasingly presenting as peripheral lesions [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Central and peripheral squamous cell carcinomas may show extensive central necrosis with resulting cavitation (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60622" href="/d/graphic/60622.html" rel="external">picture 17</a>). A small subset of central, well differentiated squamous cell carcinomas occur as exophytic, endobronchial, papillary lesions (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56588" href="/d/graphic/56588.html" rel="external">picture 18</a>). Patients with this unusual variant of squamous cell carcinoma typically present with persistent cough, recurrent hemoptysis, or relapsing pulmonary infections due to airway obstruction. Most patients with exophytic endobronchial squamous cell carcinoma have low-stage disease at diagnosis, with a correspondingly good prognosis; five-year survival rates are greater than 60 percent [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h1">LARGE CELL CARCINOMA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Large cell carcinoma (LCC) is a malignant epithelial neoplasm lacking glandular, squamous, or neuroendocrine differentiation by light microscopy and immunohistochemistry (IHC; typically, p40 and thyroid transcription factor 1 [TTF-1]), and lacking cytologic features of small cell carcinoma. LCC usually presents as a large peripheral mass with prominent necrosis. Histologically, LCC is characterized by sheets of round to polygonal cells with prominent nucleoli and abundant pale staining cytoplasm without differentiating features (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108094" href="/d/graphic/108094.html" rel="external">picture 19</a>). IHC has allowed the reclassification of several entities formerly classified as LCCs; this approach has been supported by molecular studies [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Poorly differentiated carcinomas are reclassified as squamous cell carcinoma if they have p40 expression; solid adenocarcinoma if TTF-1 expression is observed, even if mucin is absent; and neuroendocrine carcinoma if staining with chromogranin and synaptophysin are present [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Poorly differentiated carcinomas are considered large cell only if they lack defining IHC markers and have the so-called "null"<em> </em>phenotype.</p><p>Because LCC represents a diagnosis of exclusion, it is inappropriate to apply the term to small biopsies or cytology specimens, both of which have inherent sampling problems [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The term non-small cell lung cancer, not otherwise specified is more appropriate for cases diagnosed in this way, when there is no evidence of squamous or glandular differentiation on IHC.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1176731"><span class="h1">SARCOMATOID CARCINOMA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Sarcomatoid carcinoma is a broad term that represents a heterogeneous group of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). They are characterized by having a malignant epithelial component, but with features that suggest sarcomas. The main categories include pleomorphic carcinoma, carcinosarcoma, and pulmonary blastoma. In a large Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database study, sarcomatoid carcinomas are rare, comprising less than 1 percent of all lung cancers [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. A histologic diagnosis of sarcomatoid carcinoma was associated with overall worse survival (hazard ratio for death 1.60, 95% CI 1.35-2.06).

The nuclei are typically hyperchromatic and either have a dispersed "salt and pepper" chromatin or a homogeneous dispersed chromatin. The cells are fragile and the tumors are generally extensively necrotic, both of which may contribute to the difficulty in establishing a histologic diagnosis on small samples. Tumor cells are usually positive for one or more of chromogranin or synaptophysin, although around 10 percent may be unreactive for classic neuroendocrine markers. Cytokeratin staining is often dot-like in morphology.
