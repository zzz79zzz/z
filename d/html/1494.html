The exercise ECG indirectly detects myocardial ischemia, which is the physiologic consequence of a mismatch between myocardial oxygen delivery (coronary blood flow) and myocardial oxygen demand (myocardial work). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1472.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with suspected angina pectoris"</a>.)</p><p>A well-recognized sequence of events is precipitated by an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79335" href="/z/d/graphic/79335.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). This sequence helps explain why measures of ischemia obtained with echocardiographic or radionuclide imaging are more sensitive indicators than ECG measures; they occur at a lower intensity of ischemia, and thereby precede ECG changes. Similarly, silent ischemia that is identified electrocardiographically often occurs at a lower ischemic threshold than that needed for the symptomatic expression of ischemia.</p><p>This topic provides a brief overview of exercise ECG testing including methodology, indications, and contraindications, and discusses the ECG manifestations of exercise-induced ischemia. A discussion on how to select the optimal cardiac stress test in a given patient is presented elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1502.html" rel="external">"Selecting the optimal cardiac stress test"</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are many patients in whom exercise ECG testing can be used for diagnostic or prognostic purposes, including those with [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Symptoms suggesting myocardial ischemia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute chest pain in whom acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and myocardial infarction have been excluded</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recent ACS treated without coronary angiography </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Known coronary heart disease (CHD) and change in clinical status </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prior coronary revascularization</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Abnormal or equivocal findings on coronary computed tomography angiography</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Valvular heart disease</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Certain cardiac arrhythmias</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An indication for cardiac assessment prior to non-cardiac surgery</p><p></p><p>An extensive discussion of the indications for exercise ECG testing (and stress testing in general) is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1502.html" rel="external">"Selecting the optimal cardiac stress test", section on 'Indications for stress testing'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Exercise testing is not without potential risks or discomfort to the patient, although the procedure is generally quite safe for most patients. Serious complications (ie, acute myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death) occur approximately once for every 10,000 tests performed [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Thus, an assessment of the benefits and risks of testing must be made in each patient prior to the procedure. (See <a class="local">'Life-threatening complications'</a> below.)</p><p>Professional society guidelines have identified a collection of agreed upon absolute and relative cardiovascular contraindications to exercise testing  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80110" href="/z/d/graphic/80110.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. Absolute contraindications include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute myocardial infarction (within two days)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ongoing unstable angina </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Uncontrolled arrhythmias with hemodynamic compromise</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Symptomatic severe valvular stenosis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decompensated heart failure</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Active endocarditis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute myocarditis or pericarditis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute aortic dissection</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infarction, or deep venous thrombosis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Physical disability that precludes safe and adequate testing</p><p></p><p>There are also relative contraindications that can be superseded if the benefits outweigh the risks  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80110" href="/z/d/graphic/80110.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. Relative contraindications should be weighed versus the potential benefits in each individual patient prior to making the decision to proceed with exercise ECG testing. Exercise testing is generally safe in patients with mild to moderate hypokalemia or hyperkalemia [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. </p><p>There have been concerns about the safety of exercise testing in patients with a recent percutaneous coronary intervention. There were no acute coronary events in a report of 261 patients who underwent exercise testing soon after PCI with stent placement [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. However, exercise testing is rarely necessary before 30 days after a stent procedure; when performed it is usually done to evaluate the hemodynamic severity of residual coronary heart disease. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H674436"><span class="h1">LIMITATIONS TO EXERCISE ECG TESTING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are two broad groups of patients in whom exercise ECG testing is not the most appropriate diagnostic test [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients who are unable to exercise sufficiently due to leg claudication, arthritis, deconditioning, pulmonary disease, or other conditions – An exercise ECG test that fails to achieve 85 percent of the patient's predicted maximal heart rate may reduce sensitivity to detect ischemic heart disease even if the test is otherwise negative (ie, absence of symptoms of angina or normal ECG findings) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. There are potential problems with solely using the patient's predicted maximal heart rate, including significant variability in the predicted maximal heart rate and concurrent use of medications that can slow the heart rate, as well as excessive early heart rate response that can lead to the erroneous conclusion of having achieved an adequate exercise test. Patients who are unable to exercise sufficiently should be considered for pharmacologic stress testing  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef87155" href="/z/d/graphic/87155.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Test endpoints'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1502.html" rel="external">"Selecting the optimal cardiac stress test", section on 'Pharmacologic'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with ECG changes at rest that can interfere with interpretation of the exercise test – ECG abnormalities that interfere with the diagnosis of ischemia include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Ventricular preexcitation (Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Ventricular paced rhythm</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Left bundle branch block</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Greater than 1 mm ST depression at rest</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9360" href="/z/d/drug information/9360.html" rel="external">Digoxin</a> use with associated ST-T abnormalities</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T abnormalities</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hypokalemia with ST-T abnormalities</p><p></p><p>Conversely, ischemia can be accurately assessed in patients with right bundle branch block or those with less than 1 mm of ST depression at rest, who undergo diagnostic exercise ECG testing in the appropriate clinical setting. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5312.html" rel="external">"Stress testing in patients with left bundle branch block or a paced ventricular rhythm"</a>.)</p><p>The sensitivity and specificity of exercise ECG testing have been derived from studies correlating the ECG response to exercise with angiographic CHD. Patient gender, age, coronary risk factors, and the characteristics of the chest pain are also important determinants of the pretest probability of CHD, which impact the post-test likelihood of disease, and therefore of the diagnostic accuracy of exercise ECG testing. These issues are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1534.html" rel="external">"Stress testing for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary heart disease", section on 'Estimating pretest probability'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">TYPES OF EXERCISE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The two most common modalities for clinical exercise testing are the motor-driven treadmill and the stationary cycle ergometer. While treadmill exercise is more commonly performed, the choice of exercise modality varies according to local expertise and available equipment. Cycle ergometry can be used in patients for whom weight bearing is problematic, and can be performed using a stationary bicycle or arm ergometry [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Bicycle ergometry is generally preferred to arm ergometry, as the smaller muscle groups involved in arm ergometry generally result in a lower maximum workload.</p><p>Most clinical indications for exercise testing require an incremental protocol, which progresses from low workloads to higher workloads until either a predetermined end point is reached (target heart rate or workload) or signs or symptoms develop that preclude further exercise. The most efficient protocols for treadmill or bicycle testing are patient specific as the protocol is chosen to match the physical working capacity of the individual so that a maximal effort is reached in 6 to 12 minutes. Protocols that are either too short or too long in duration may not truly reflect the patient's functional capacity. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Comparison of types of exercise</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Each type of exercise has advantages and disadvantages, and many exercise testing laboratories in hospitals and clinics have two or three options available:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Treadmill exercise protocols are more flexible than bicycle protocols because both speed and inclination can be varied independently.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bicycle and arm ergometry are generally less expensive, less noisy, more portable, and require less space.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The ECG data are cleaner, especially at high workload, with bicycle ergometry because of less upper body motion. Blood pressures are also more easily obtained during bicycle exercise, since the upper body is more stable.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Older, more-frail individuals, and those with gait, balance, and orthopedic abnormalities may perform better with bicycle or arm ergometry than on the treadmill. On the negative side, individuals who are not experienced cyclists may experience quadriceps muscle fatigue before achieving a maximal cardiovascular effort, and the smaller muscle groups involved in arm ergometry generally result in a considerably lower maximum workload.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h2">Common exercise protocols</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The specific speed and grade parameters for three standard treadmill testing protocols along with estimated oxygen costs for each workload are shown in the following table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70044" href="/z/d/graphic/70044.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h3">Bruce protocol</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Bruce protocol is generally preferred for office-based exercise testing largely because it has been extensively validated [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The protocol is divided into successive three-minute stages, each of which requires the patient to walk faster and at a steeper grade  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70044" href="/z/d/graphic/70044.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). The determinants of the end of the protocol are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Test endpoints'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H674890"><span class="h3">Modified Bruce protocol</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The modified Bruce protocol can be used in sedentary patients in whom the standard Bruce protocol may be too strenuous or for risk stratification of patients after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in whom vigorous exercise in the immediate post-ACS period is not advised. The modified protocol adds two low-workload stages to the beginning of the standard Bruce protocol, both of which require less effort than Stage 1. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h3">Naughton protocol</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Naughton protocol is often used in post-MI exercise testing to classify patients into high-risk and low-risk categories and to determine optimal treatment strategies [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. This protocol is also used for functional exercise testing with gas analysis techniques to measure oxygen uptake and VO<sub>2</sub>max. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3465.html" rel="external">"Cardiopulmonary exercise testing in cardiovascular disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3503.html" rel="external">"Exercise capacity and VO2 in heart failure"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H553257093"><span class="h3">Other treadmill protocols</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Other treadmill exercise protocols have been developed that provide a stress test intermediate in difficulty between the Bruce and Naughton protocols; a popular protocol uses two-minute stages and increases by 2 METs per stage and may be appropriate for a broader range of patients than either the Bruce or Naughton [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].<strong> </strong></p><p>In the Cornell protocol, each stage of the Bruce protocol is divided into two smaller and shorter stages. Although this was done to provide more data points for the computerized ECG analyses, the protocol is also more applicable to patients with limited exercise tolerance because of the smaller workload increments. While once popular, this protocol is now rarely used.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H674690"><span class="h3">Bicycle testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For bicycle testing, exercise should begin with the patient pedaling against minimal resistance for several minutes. The work rate should then be increased in increments of 15 to 25 watts (90 to 150 kpm [kilopond meters/min]) every one to two minutes depending upon the subject's heart rate response; the goal is a duration of 8 to 12 minutes. Extremely sedentary or debilitated subjects may require even smaller increments.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h1">EXERCISE TEST PROCEDURE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H674918"><span class="h2">Pre-test instructions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients should be instructed not to eat, drink, or smoke for at least three hours prior to the examination, as this permits the patient to achieve a higher workload. The patients should bring comfortable exercise clothing and walking shoes to the testing facility. Before testing, the patient should be provided with education regarding the test, including the benefits and risks of exercise testing, as well as provide consent to proceed. </p><p>When the test is ordered, patients should be queried about the use of several categories of medications, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Beta blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (ie, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9365" href="/z/d/drug information/9365.html" rel="external">diltiazem</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10043" href="/z/d/drug information/10043.html" rel="external">verapamil</a>), and certain antiarrhythmic medications (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8595" href="/z/d/drug information/8595.html" rel="external">amiodarone</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9941" href="/z/d/drug information/9941.html" rel="external">sotalol</a>), as these drugs will reduce the maximal heart rate that is achieved.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9360" href="/z/d/drug information/9360.html" rel="external">Digoxin</a>, which may also reduce the maximal heart rate that is achieved and is associated with reduced specificity for angiographic CHD. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5305.html" rel="external">"Stress testing: The effect of medications and methylxanthines", section on 'Digoxin'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nitrates, which can reduce the ischemic response to exercise in patients with coronary disease.</p><p></p><p>Patients should be given specific instructions by the ordering clinician on whether or not to take their usual medications. However, no consensus exists on withholding or continuing beta-blockers (or other medications which may reduce the ischemic response) before exercise testing. As an example, although beta blockers have been shown to markedly reduce maximal exercise heart rate, no differences in exercise test performance were found in a consecutive group of men taking versus not taking beta blockers while being evaluated for possible CHD [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Thus, in our practice, we do not have patients hold their usual medications for exercise testing, although this decision should be individualized. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5305.html" rel="external">"Stress testing: The effect of medications and methylxanthines"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17"><span class="h2">Patient interview and examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A brief interview by a clinician or qualified health professional should be performed prior to testing to evaluate for any contraindications  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80110" href="/z/d/graphic/80110.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and to gather information that will facilitate interpreting the test. (See <a class="local">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p>All patient medications must be identified, and it must be determined in advance if the patient has taken any cardiac medications that would alter the hemodynamic response to exercise and therefore potentially affect the results of the exercise ECG test. (See <a class="local">'Pre-test instructions'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5305.html" rel="external">"Stress testing: The effect of medications and methylxanthines"</a>.)</p><p>A limited cardiac examination should be performed, with attention given to detecting heart murmurs (particularly aortic stenosis), evidence of heart failure, and pulmonary findings such as wheezing. The presence of an arrhythmia, confirmed by the physical examination or the resting ECG, should be documented since it may have an impact on exercise. Important examples are atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter which, if not appropriately treated with an AV nodal blocking agent, may result in excessively high heart rates during exercise. Uncontrolled ventricular or supraventricular tachyarrhythmia is a contraindication to exercise testing  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80110" href="/z/d/graphic/80110.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).

As an example, if a "positive" ECG result were defined as 3 mm ST segment depression rather than the usual criterion of 1 mm, the probability would be very high that all individuals without disease will have negative tests. Although this approach maximizes the specificity of the stress test, it substantially reduces sensitivity since very few patients with coronary heart disease will be detected. Conversely, the application of less stringent criteria for detection of disease would increase sensitivity but decrease specificity.</p><p>Leads V4, V5, and V6 are the most sensitive leads for detecting the ST depression of subendocardial ischemia; V5 alone is often the single best lead for this purpose [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>].

The positive predictive value for significant angiographic coronary artery disease was similar when ST depression occurred during recovery or exercise (84 versus 87 percent).

The exercise ECG indirectly detects myocardial ischemia, which is the physiologic consequence of a mismatch between the supply and demand for blood. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Exercise ECG testing can safely be used for diagnostic or prognostic purposes in a variety of patients. However, there are some absolute and relative contraindications to exercise testing that should be considered before proceeding with the test. (See <a class="local">'Indications'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1502.html" rel="external">"Selecting the optimal cardiac stress test", section on 'Indications for stress testing'</a> and <a class="local">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There are two broad groups of patients in whom exercise ECG testing is not the most appropriate diagnostic test: patients who are unable to exercise sufficiently due to leg claudication, arthritis, deconditioning, pulmonary disease, or other conditions; and patients with ECG findings at rest that can interfere with interpretation of the exercise test. (See <a class="local">'Limitations to exercise ECG testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The procedure for performing exercise ECG testing should include appropriate pre-test preparation and instructions at the time the test is ordered as well as a brief patient interview and targeted physical examination prior to exercise. The test should be supervised by appropriate personnel, with ongoing monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, and ECG, and frequent queries of the patient regarding his or her perceived patient exertion and the development of any symptoms. (See <a class="local">'Exercise test procedure'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>ST segment depression that occurs during exercise testing is one of the most identifiable ECG signs of myocardial ischemia. The ECG portion of the exercise test is generally considered abnormal (ie, "positive" for ischemia) when there is ≥1 mm horizontal or downsloping ST segment depression in one or more leads that persists at 80 milliseconds after the J point. Horizontal or downsloping ST segment depression is generally more specific for ischemia than upsloping ST segment depression.
