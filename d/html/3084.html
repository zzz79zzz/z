(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3041.html" rel="external">"Glomerular disease: Evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nephritic</strong> – Disorders resulting in a nephritic sediment are generally associated with inflammatory lesions of the glomeruli on light microscopy. These lesions can be focal or diffuse. In focal lesions (focal glomerulonephritis), the urinalysis reveals red cells (which often have a dysmorphic appearance), occasionally red cell casts, and mild proteinuria (usually less than 1.5 g/day). These patients often present with asymptomatic hematuria and proteinuria discovered on routine examination or, occasionally, with episodes of gross hematuria. Diffuse lesions (diffuse glomerulonephritis) occur in more advanced disease, which usually presents with heavy proteinuria (which may be in the nephrotic range), edema, hypertension, and kidney function impairment. The urinalysis in diffuse glomerulonephritis is similar to that in focal disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nephrotic</strong> – The nephrotic sediment is associated with heavy proteinuria and lipiduria, but few cells or casts, and is typically considered bland. The term "nephrotic syndrome" refers to a distinct constellation of clinical and laboratory features of kidney disease. It is specifically defined by the presence of heavy proteinuria (protein excretion greater than 3.5 g/24 hours), hypoalbuminemia (less than 3.5 g/dL), and peripheral edema. Hyperlipidemia and thrombotic disease are also frequently observed.</p><p></p><p>Isolated heavy proteinuria without edema or other features of the nephrotic syndrome is suggestive of a glomerulopathy (with the same etiologies as the nephrotic syndrome) but is not necessarily associated with the multiple clinical and management problems characteristic of the nephrotic syndrome. This is an important clinical distinction because heavy proteinuria in patients without edema or hypoalbuminemia is more likely to be due to secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (due, for example, to diabetes) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of heavy proteinuria and the nephrotic syndrome, with emphasis on those disorders with a nephrotic as opposed to a nephritic presentation. More specific issues relating to complications of the nephrotic syndrome are presented elsewhere:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3044.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology and treatment of edema in adults with the nephrotic syndrome"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3043.html" rel="external">"Hypercoagulability in nephrotic syndrome"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3104.html" rel="external">"Endocrine dysfunction in the nephrotic syndrome"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3114.html" rel="external">"Lipid abnormalities in nephrotic syndrome"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3047.html" rel="external">"Acute kidney injury (AKI) in minimal change disease and other forms of nephrotic syndrome"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The individual disorders that cause the nephrotic syndrome are discussed in detail in separate topic reviews. Readers will be referred to these individual topics where appropriate.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3731709669"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Heavy proteinuria with or without the nephrotic syndrome may occur in association with a wide variety of primary and systemic diseases. Minimal change disease is the predominant cause in children. In adults, approximately 30 percent have a systemic disease such as diabetes mellitus, amyloidosis, or systemic lupus erythematosus; the remaining cases are usually due to primary kidney disorders such as minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and membranous nephropathy [<a href="#rid2">2-9</a>]. Amyloidosis is another common cause of the nephrotic syndrome, particularly among older adults. The nephrotic syndrome can also develop in patients with postinfectious and infection-associated glomerulonephritis, glomerulonephritis with a membranoproliferative pattern of injury, and immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy. However, these individuals typically have a "nephritic" type of urinalysis with hematuria and cellular (including red cell) casts as a prominent feature. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3041.html" rel="external">"Glomerular disease: Evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults"</a>.)</p><p>The etiology of nephrotic syndrome varies by race, ethnicity, and geographic region:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a single center study of 3275 native kidney biopsies performed in northern India between 2006 and 2016, there were 1974 cases of the nephrotic syndrome [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Minimal change disease was the most common cause (22.4 percent), followed by membranous nephropathy (22.4 percent) and FSGS (21.5 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In another study of over 34,000 patients who underwent a native kidney biopsy in central China between 2009 and 2018, among the 17,938 biopsies in patients with the nephrotic syndrome, 38 percent had a diagnosis of membranous nephropathy, 20 percent had minimal change disease, 11 percent had IgA nephropathy, 6 percent had lupus nephritis, and only 3.4 percent had FSGS [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Similar findings were reported in another large biopsy series from northeast China [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a study of a diverse population of 2501 patients from California who had primary glomerulopathy identified on native kidney biopsy, the most common lesion was FSGS (40 percent), followed by membranous nephropathy (13 percent), minimal change disease (11 percent), and IgA nephropathy (10 percent) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Over the 12 years between 2000 and 2011, the case rates of FSGS and IgA nephropathy increased, while the rates of membranous nephropathy and minimal change disease remained stable. Other studies have also suggested that the prevalence of FSGS appears to be increasing worldwide [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4211659401"><span class="h2">Minimal change disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Minimal change disease (also called nil disease or lipoid nephrosis) accounts for 90 percent of cases of the nephrotic syndrome in children under the age of 10 years, and more than 50 percent of cases in older children. It also may occur in adults as an idiopathic condition, in association with the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or as a paraneoplastic effect of malignancy, most often Hodgkin lymphoma. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3046.html" rel="external">"Minimal change disease: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis in adults"</a>.)</p><p>The terms "minimal change" and "nil disease" reflect the observation that light microscopy in this disorder is either normal or reveals only mild mesangial cell proliferation  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58414" data-inline-graphics="58414" href="/d/graphic/58414.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). Immunofluorescence and light microscopy typically show no evidence of immune complex deposition. The characteristic histologic finding in minimal change disease is diffuse effacement of the epithelial cell foot processes on electron microscopy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H653493687"><span class="h2">Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is among the most common lesions found to underlie the idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in adults, accounting for 39 percent of all cases in the United States and over 50 percent of cases among Black patients. FSGS is not a single disease but a specific histologic pattern of kidney injury that is characterized on light microscopy by the presence in some but not all glomeruli (hence the name focal) of segmental areas of mesangial collapse and sclerosis [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. FSGS can present as an idiopathic syndrome (primary FSGS) or may be associated with HIV infection, reflux nephropathy, healed previous glomerular injury, or massive obesity. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4159862758"><span class="h3">Diagnostic issues</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are three important diagnostic concerns in FSGS:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sampling error</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Distinguishing primary and secondary FSGS</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Identifying FSGS associated with collapsing glomerulopathy</p><p></p><p>Sampling error can easily lead to misclassification of a patient with FSGS as having minimal change disease. Clinical features that are more common in FSGS are hematuria, hypertension, and decreased kidney function. There is, however, substantial overlap in these features. In addition to careful review of the kidney biopsy, glucocorticoid resistance in a patient considered to have minimal change disease should raise suspicion about FSGS. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3046.html" rel="external">"Minimal change disease: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Primary FSGS is a disorder of the podocyte (a podocytopathy); congenital forms also exist. In addition, as noted above, FSGS can occur as a secondary response to nephron loss (as is reflux nephropathy) or previous glomerular injury. Differentiating primary and secondary FSGS has important therapeutic implications. The former sometimes responds to immunosuppressive agents such as glucocorticoids while secondary disease is best treated with modalities aimed at lowering the intraglomerular pressure, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and addressing the underlying cause of the secondary FSGS, if it can be identified (eg, weight reduction in patients with obesity). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/117559.html" rel="external">"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis: Genetic causes"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/117558.html" rel="external">"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis: Pathogenesis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3100.html" rel="external">"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis: Treatment and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p>The distinction between primary and secondary FSGS can sometimes be made from the history (such as one of the disorders associated with secondary disease) and the rate of onset and degree of proteinuria. Patients with primary FSGS typically present with the acute onset of the nephrotic syndrome and diffuse podocyte foot process effacement, whereas slowly increasing proteinuria, kidney function impairment over time, and segmental podocyte foot process effacement are characteristic of the secondary disorders. The proteinuria in secondary FSGS is often non-nephrotic; even when protein excretion exceeds 3 to 4 g/day, both hypoalbuminemia and edema are unusual. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3049.html" rel="external">"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Classification and clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Collapsing FSGS is a histologic variant that can be associated with HIV infection, bisphosphonate therapy, or systemic lupus erythematosus. Two major features distinguish it from primary FSGS: a tendency toward <strong>collapse</strong> and sclerosis of the entire glomerular tuft, rather than segmental injury; and often severe tubular injury with proliferative microcyst formation and tubular degeneration  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81601" data-inline-graphics="81601" href="/d/graphic/81601.html" rel="external">picture 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59839" href="/d/graphic/59839.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). These patients often have rapidly progressive kidney failure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14026.html" rel="external">"HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3080.html" rel="external">"Collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (collapsing glomerulopathy)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3430764994"><span class="h2">Membranous nephropathy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Membranous nephropathy is the leading cause of primary nephrotic syndrome in White adults. It is characterized by basement membrane thickening with little or no cellular proliferation or infiltration, and the presence of electron dense deposits across the glomerular basement membrane  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57841" data-inline-graphics="57841" href="/d/graphic/57841.html" rel="external">picture 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74698 graphicRef55226 graphicRef69629 graphicRef62937 graphicRef69348" href="/d/graphic/74698.html" rel="external">picture 5A-E</a>).

Most cases of primary membranous nephropathy are due to autoantibodies directed against the phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) found on podocytes. A number of other antigens have been found to be associated with membranous nephropathy, and, in some cases, circulating autoantibodies have been identified [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Secondary causes include hepatitis B antigenemia, autoimmune diseases (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus), thyroiditis, carcinoma, and the use of certain drugs such as NSAIDs, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9747" href="/d/drug information/9747.html" rel="external">penicillamine</a>, gold, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9196" href="/d/drug information/9196.html" rel="external">captopril</a>. The underlying malignancy in presumed tumor-induced membranous nephropathy usually has been diagnosed but may not always be clinically apparent at the time that proteinuria is discovered. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3050.html" rel="external">"Membranous nephropathy: Pathogenesis and etiology", section on 'Phospholipase A2 receptor'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3050.html" rel="external">"Membranous nephropathy: Pathogenesis and etiology"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2354140989"><span class="h2">Amyloidosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Amyloidosis accounts for 4 to 17 percent of cases of seemingly idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, with an increased frequency observed among older individuals [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. There are two major types of renal amyloidosis: AL or primary amyloid, which is a light chain dyscrasia in which fragments of monoclonal light chains form the amyloid fibrils; and AA or secondary amyloidosis, in which the acute phase reactant serum amyloid A forms the amyloid fibrils. AA amyloid is associated with a chronic inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, or chronic osteomyelitis. More recently, through the use of laser capture microdissection of glomeruli from kidney biopsies followed by proteomic analysis of the tissue, several additional forms of renal amyloidosis have been identified [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3120.html" rel="external">"Renal amyloidosis"</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis is suspected by a history of a chronic inflammatory disease or, with primary disease, detection of a monoclonal paraprotein in the serum or urine. Diagnosis should be confirmed, if possible, using specific identification of the amyloid protein with mass spectrometry of the biopsy tissue [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].

Electrical potential differences generated by transglomerular flow may modulate the flux of macromolecules across the glomerular capillary wall [<a href="#rid18">18</a>], although other theories exist for the mechanism of glomerular proteinuria.</p><p>The podocyte appears to be the major target of injury in diseases that cause idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in adults and children (membranous nephropathy, minimal change disease, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis [FSGS]), as illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The common ultrastructural phenotype seen in these diseases is podocyte foot process effacement, slit diaphragm disruption, and a relative or absolute depletion of podocytes [<a href="#rid19">19-21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hereditary podocyte injury (eg, in patients with congenital nephrotic syndrome) is due to mutations of podocyte proteins that are important in the maintenance of the slit diaphragm such as nephrin and podocin, or mutations in proteins that affect the integrity of the podocyte cytoskeleton such as alpha-actinin-4 [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].

Most of albumin loss is due to urinary excretion [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. However, at the same level of albumin loss, patients with the nephrotic syndrome have a plasma albumin concentration that is approximately 1 g/dL (10 g/L) lower than patients treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, in which there is significant albumin loss in the dialysate  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59892" href="/d/graphic/59892.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). One proposed explanation is that, in patients with nephrotic syndrome, a substantial fraction of the filtered albumin is taken up by and catabolized in the proximal tubular cells, resulting in a much greater degree of albumin loss than estimated from the rate of albumin excretion, although this hypothesis is controversial [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>].</p><p>Hepatic albumin synthesis does increase in response to the albumin loss. This effect is mediated by an increase in hepatic albumin gene expression [<a href="#rid24">24</a>] stimulated in part by the low oncotic pressure [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Hypoalbuminemia may also lead to the release of an as yet unidentified circulating factor that contributes to the elevation in hepatic albumin synthesis [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. The low oncotic pressure has a second clinically important effect: it increases hepatic lipoprotein synthesis, which plays an important role in the development of hyperlipidemia. (See <a class="local">'Hyperlipidemia and lipiduria'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3114.html" rel="external">"Lipid abnormalities in nephrotic syndrome"</a>.)</p><p>It remains unclear why, in a patient excreting 4 to 6 g of protein per day, the liver is usually unable to sufficiently increase albumin synthesis to normalize the plasma albumin concentration. There are patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria who have little or no hypoalbuminemia; these patients are more likely to have one of the secondary forms of FSGS (such as reflux nephropathy) rather than one of the primary nephrotic disorders such as membranous nephropathy, primary FSGS, or minimal change disease [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. One contributory factor may be the release of cytokines in the latter conditions; tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1, for example, directly suppress hepatic albumin synthesis [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2777969412"><span class="h2">Edema</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the occurrence of edema in the nephrotic syndrome. In some patients, marked hypoalbuminemia leads to egress of fluid into the interstitial space by producing a decrease in plasma oncotic pressure. In most patients however, there is a parallel fall in the interstitial protein concentration and little change in the transcapillary oncotic pressure gradient  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74352" href="/d/graphic/74352.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). In the latter patients, edema appears to be the consequence of primary renal sodium retention in the collecting tubules  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82649" href="/d/graphic/82649.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>) mediated through the epithelial sodium channel and the basolateral Na-K-ATPase  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60693" href="/d/graphic/60693.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>) [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. The lack of major arterial underfilling has important implications for diuretic therapy since the excess fluid can usually be removed without inducing volume depletion.

Decreased plasma oncotic pressure appears to stimulate hepatic lipoprotein synthesis resulting in hypercholesterolemia.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3114.html" rel="external">"Lipid abnormalities in nephrotic syndrome"</a>.)</p><p>Lipiduria is usually present in the nephrotic syndrome.
