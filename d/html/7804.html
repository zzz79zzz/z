         </span>
         Opioids, used medically for pain relief, have analgesic and central nervous system depressant effects as well as the potential to cause euphoria. Opioid use disorder (OUD) can involve misuse of prescribed opioid medications, use of diverted opioid medications, or use of illicitly obtained heroin. OUD is typically a chronic, relapsing illness, associated with significantly increased rates of morbidity and mortality.
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with OUD who have achieved abstinence through medically supervised withdrawal or by other means, maintenance treatment aims to prevent relapse. Options for long-term maintenance treatment include an opioid agonist (ie,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9623" href="/z/d/drug information/9623.html" rel="external">
          methadone

         or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9170" href="/z/d/drug information/9170.html" rel="external">
          buprenorphine
         </a>
         ), an opioid antagonist (
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9679" href="/z/d/drug information/9679.html" rel="external">
          naltrexone
         </a>
         ), or nonmedication, abstinence-based treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         The psychiatric diagnoses in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) opioid abuse and opioid dependence were replaced by one diagnosis, OUD, in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) [
         <a href="#rid1">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic describes the epidemiology, pharmacology, screening, assessment, and diagnosis of OUD. Treatment of the disorder is discussed separately. Management of intoxication and withdrawal from opioids is discussed separately. Addiction in impaired clinicians and misuse of prescription drugs are also discussed separately.

         Data on the nongenetic risk factors for the development of OUD are often based upon case-control studies. These studies show that risk factors for the misuse of prescription opioids include a prior history of substance use disorder, younger age, more severe pain, and co-occurring mental disorders [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15

         Opioids activate specific transmembrane neurotransmitter receptors (mu, kappa, delta) that couple G proteins. G proteins are molecular intermediaries that initiate the intracellular communication process. Stimulation of G proteins begins the intracellular process of signal transduction. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3804.html" rel="external">
          "Peptide hormone signal transduction and regulation"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Activation of endogenous mu opioid receptors results in the prototypic opioid effects of reward, withdrawal, and analgesia. Mu receptor activation can mediate a variety of G proteins that lead to secondary effects on messenger-generating enzymes (adenyl cyclase and phospholipase-C) [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Secondary messengers such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) are acutely decreased by opioid receptor activation. Chronic opioid receptor activation results in molecular effects opposite to those of acute opioid administration. Long-term opioid use causes up regulation of cAMP along with changes in gene transcription.
        </p>
        <p>
         Opioid receptors are located in the central and peripheral nervous system. The effects of activation of neuronal mu receptors will depend on the location of the receptor, the types of G proteins present in the activated neural tissues, and the frequency and duration of activation. Activation of mu receptors in the central nervous system results in responses such as respiratory depression, analgesia, euphoria, and miosis. Stimulation of peripheral mu opioid receptors, in smooth muscle of the bronchi and intestines, results in cough suppression and opioid-induced constipation.

         Patients presenting with an opioid use disorder (OUD) may appear acutely intoxicated, in opioid withdrawal, or show no acute effects related to their opioid use. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Patients who are acutely intoxicated can have slurred speech, appear sedated (“nodding”), and have pinpoint pupils (miosis). If they have injected opioids, then fresh injection sites may be visible on the physical examination. The duration of acute intoxication will depend upon the half-life of the drug taken as well as the patient’s tolerance to opioids.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients who have developed tolerance to opioids may show no acute effects after use of the drug at a dose typical for that patient. They may not be presenting for treatment of their addiction, but when hospitalized for other reasons may show signs of opioid withdrawal.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with OUD typically have impaired social functioning, which in our clinical experience can vary widely in association with the severity and duration of the disorder. Patients with a mild disorder may maintain jobs and relationships, but detailed interviewing can often reveal problems related to drug use.
        </p>

Use of heroin (or other illicit opioids) can become the organizing feature in the lives of some patients, and their day is centered on either obtaining money to purchase the drug or using the drug. Other aspects of life, such as work and relationships, may be sacrificed for their drug use. While this lifestyle can lead to legal problems, many users are not antisocial (or sociopathic); once they achieve stability, such as through engagement in

         Risk of fracture – In a prospective study including over 539,000 individuals prescribed opioids, the risk of fracture was nearly four times greater during periods of exposure to opioids than during nonexposure periods (incidence rate ratio 3.93, 95% CI 3.82-4.04) [

         A United States nationally representative survey found that, of people who had any lifetime use of heroin, 53 percent went on to develop an American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) disorder of heroin abuse or dependence. Persons who try heroin may be a select population that is inherently at higher risk for developing an opioid use disorder (OUD).

         We suggest screening in patients for whom there is evidence of risk for opioid misuse, for example, patients with hepatitis C virus or HIV infection, or who have not had a good response in terms of functional improvement to long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain. This suggestion is consistent with a multispecialty expert panel’s 2018 recommendation that all patients receiving medical evaluation for endocarditis, bacteremia, skin abscess, vertebral osteomyelitis, HIV infection, or hepatitis C virus infection be screened for opioid use disorder (OUD) [

         It is difficult to know exactly how much active drug a patient has been using because street drugs are diluted (or "cut") by dealers with other substances prior to sale. Heroin purchased on the street may contain 10 to 40 percent active drug; the rest is an adulterant such as sugar, powdered milk, over-the-counter medications such as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">

          pseudoephedrine
         </a>
         (to counteract some of the drowsiness associated with the high), or even a prescription medication. Heroin becomes progressively more diluted and adulterated as it moves down the distribution chain [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. Dealers and consumers generally do not know the proportion of heroin in the product they sell or use [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The amount of drug being consumed influences the likelihood and severity of withdrawal symptoms when the drug is stopped, so it is useful to obtain an estimate of the amount used (frequency and number of times per day). In the eastern United States, heroin users typically describe their quantity of use as number of “bags” of powder heroin. In the western United States, the quantity of tar heroin is typically characterized as fractions of a gram. People with an opioid use disorder (OUD) typically use heroin two to six times a day.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another way to estimate quantity is to ask the patient how much he or she has been spending on heroin on the average day or week. Drug prices and/or the amount of pure heroin in a bag of a fixed amount vary widely based upon geography (even between neighborhoods), by demand, by amount of adulterant added, and over time [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53
         </a>
         ]. A typical "quarter bag" ($25 worth) has enough adulterated heroin powder to snort several lines or inject several times, depending on the tolerance of the buyer. Amounts used can range from $20 to $200 per day.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important to determine if the patient uses other drugs and/or alcohol in addition to opioids. Obtaining an accurate history can be complicated, as patients may accelerate use of one substance (eg, alcohol) during times when heroin is less available. The clinician must accurately identify patients who need concomitant treatment for physiological dependence on alcohol or a benzodiazepine because withdrawal from these drugs can be life-threatening.
        </p>
        <p>
         Inquire specifically about nonmedical use of prescription opioids, which many heroin users also consume. Ask about the drug, dose, and average number of tablets consumed daily. Over 10 percent of nonmedical use of prescription opioids involves "snorting" the tablet contents [
         <a href="#rid54">

         The intravenous route is rapid and produces high bioavailability but is also most dangerous to the user. Injection is the most efficient means of producing euphoria when relatively low-purity heroin is being used. Most overdoses occur when heroin is taken intravenously.

         Intranasal inhalation requires minimal equipment and the onset of action is rapid enough to produce euphoria. Increased purity and potency of heroin in the United States and concerns about overdose have resulted in a rising prevalence of heroin snorting in many areas [

         The clinician should determine whether the patient has been using larger and larger amounts of heroin to get the same effect. This demonstrates tolerance to opioids and indicates that the patient is likely to experience withdrawal symptoms if he or she abruptly stops using. Many persons with OUD start out using heroin to get high then reach a point where they must use simply to avoid withdrawal symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Persons who have recently consumed an opioid and are tolerant to its effects may not show obvious signs of intoxication or withdrawal; injection sites may not be apparent on examination. A careful history, if possible including secondary informants, may help the clinician to identify the disorder.

         The clinician should determine the date of last use and the dose, frequency and pattern of use at that time. This information, along with other history and examination, can be used to determine acute consequences for the OUD patient who has ceased to use opioids (eg, upon hospital admission). Symptoms of withdrawal, for example, indicate that the patient has developed physical dependence on opioids and may require medically supervised withdrawal treatment. (See

Asking the length of the longest period of abstinence helps predict the patient's ability to maintain abstinence in the future.

         Asking about problems that have resulted from drug use helps the patient to begin thinking about reasons to stop using drugs.

         A physical examination should be conducted to elucidate common complications of opioid use and/or assist in diagnosing OUD. Chronic intravenous use can be confirmed by the presence of "track marks,” which are callouses and scars that follow the course of a subcutaneous vein. These are caused by repeated injections into adjacent sites over an accessible vein. Tracks are often found in easily accessible body areas, such as the backs of the hands, antecubital fossae, on the legs, or in the neck. Signs of recent injection may be found in unusual places in patients attempting to hide their sites of injection. A thorough examination for tracks or recent injection sites should include looking between the fingers and toes, under the fingernails and toenails, in the axillae, breast veins, and the dorsal vein of the penis.
        </p>
        <p>
         The nasal septum should be examined for perforation from repeated intranasal insufflation (especially when cocaine is mixed with heroin and snorted). A heart murmur may indicate subacute bacterial endocarditis. Posterior cervical lymphadenopathy may suggest early viral infection, especially with HIV. Hepatic enlargement may indicate acute hepatitis; a small, hard liver is consistent with chronic viral hepatitis due to hepatitis B or C virus, which is common among injection drug users.

         Most clinical trials of OUD treatment were conducted in samples of patients diagnosed using criteria for opioid dependence from Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) and earlier editions. Applying trial results to patients diagnosed with DSM-5 OUD is imprecise, but the most closely comparable group of patients is those with OUD, moderate to severe subtype. Opioid abuse is similar to the mild subtype of OUD.

          Epidemiology
         </strong>
         – Synthetic opioids (eg,

         <strong>
          Clinical manifestations
         </strong>
         – Signs of acute opioid intoxication include slurred speech, sedation, and pinpoint pupils. Patients who have developed tolerance to opioids may show no acute effects after use of the drug at a dose typical for that patient. (See
         <a class="local">

         In hospitalized patients with unacknowledged, undetected opioid use disorder, presenting signs and symptoms may be of opioid withdrawal (eg, dysphoria, restlessness, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, sweating, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, pupillary dilation, and diarrhea). (See

          Health consequences

         – Health consequences of opioid use disorder include increased mortality, overdose, infections, endocarditis, narcotic bowel syndrome. Persons with opioid use have an increased rate of accident-related injuries compared with the general population. (See

          Assessment
         </strong>
         – We include the amount, frequency, and duration of opioid use, last use, and signs of tolerance, and use of other drugs and alcohol as part of our assessment of history. Additionally, we ask about problems resulting from drug use (eg, interpersonal, occupational) and prior substance use disorder treatment. Physical examination can detect signs of opioid use (eg, track marks, deviated nasal septum), as well as physical consequences of use (eg, infections and liver dysfunction). (See
