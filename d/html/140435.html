         Neural tube defects (NTDs) are the second most common major congenital anomaly (cardiac anomalies are the most common). The majority are open (ie, not covered by skin) and involve a defect of the posterior spinal column or cranium. In most cases of open spina bifida, a sac (meningocele) forms over the defect and contains neural tissue (myelomeningocele). In a minority of cases, the defect is not covered by a membrane (myeloschisis).
        </p>
        <p>
         By comparison, in closed NTDs (spinal dysraphism or spina bifida occulta), the defect involves the posterior vertebral arches and possibly the meninges, but does not involve the spinal cord, muscles, tendons, or other tissues of the spinal column; the skin is intact, so neural tissue is not exposed to amniotic fluid. The skin may have nevi, tufts of hair, sinus tract(s), dimple(s), or hyperpigmentation marking the area over the vertebral defect [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         ]. (See

          "Closed spinal dysraphism: Pathogenesis and types"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Open spina bifida is the focus of this topic. The spinal defect results from incomplete closure of the caudal portion of the neural tube between 22 and 28 embryological days (ie, five to six weeks of gestation). The defect usually involves the lumbar or sacral spine and can vary considerably in size. Postnatal clinical manifestations correlate with the spinal level and size of the defect, and usually include lower limb paralysis and bowel and bladder dysfunction. Open spina bifida is usually associated with a Chiari II malformation (Arnold-Chiari malformation), which includes a constellation of CNS anomalies such as hindbrain herniation, brainstem abnormalities, low-lying venous sinuses, a small posterior fossa, and some degree of hydrocephalus. The Chiari II malformation has deleterious effects on motor, cranial nerve, and cognitive functions. (See

         This topic will discuss in utero repair of open spina bifida, including selection of appropriate candidates, options for procedures, counseling, and delivery issues. Prevention and prenatal diagnosis of NTDs and postnatal management and outcome of myelomeningocele are reviewed separately:

         The pathogenesis of intrauterine neuronal injury in open spina bifida is not precisely known. It is hypothesized that the primary defect in neurulation, which exposes the neuronal elements to the intrauterine environment, is associated with neuronal loss, which may reach about 60 percent prior to 16 weeks of gestation ("first hit") [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. A second pathogenic "hit" may occur as a result of ongoing neuronal injury from substances in the amniotic fluid and trauma [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. A third pathogenic "hit" may occur from internal forces within the myelomeningocele sac that stretch the placode and its derivative nerves [

         The technical goal of in utero spina bifida repair is to create complete, water-tight coverage of the defect, with the objective of halting progressive intrauterine neuronal injury [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6

         The safety and efficacy of fetal surgery for repair of open spina bifida were evaluated in the seminal Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) trial, conducted from 2003 to 2010 at three institutions in the United States with extensive experience in fetal surgery [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9

The trial was stopped early because of efficacy. Findings reported in the complete trial and in subsequent follow-up studies include the following [

         Maternal viral disorder – The MOMS trial excluded pregnant individuals with a positive screening test for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) because of the risk of vertical transmission during fetal surgery.

         Abnormal fetal karyotype – The MOMS trial required documentation of a normal fetal karyotype for study inclusion and most centers continue to require normal chromosomal microarray (CMA) in accordance with accepted recommendations for genetic testing in the setting of any major congenital anomaly [

          27

          28
         </a>
         ]. While these data support the use of CMA in all cases for long-term prognostic counseling, they do not necessarily mean that these fetuses should be excluded from prenatal repair. A pathologic variant does not affect the success of the repair (gestational age at delivery, other obstetric and early neonatal outcomes) [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. There is ongoing debate about whether denying fetal interventions to fetuses with pathologic genetic variants is ethical, as such intervention may improve overall survival and prognosis. At our center, this decision is individualized based on input from a team of genetic experts (maternal-fetal medicine and pediatric), a fetal therapy board, and the patient.

         Surgical success depends, in part, on identifying those fetuses with open spina bifida who are appropriate candidates for in utero repair. Fetal evaluation using ultrasound and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an important role in this assessment and is highly dependent on the experience and skill of the imager. A multidisciplinary approach should include pediatric radiologists experienced in fetal MRI and maternal-fetal medicine/fetal intervention specialists experienced in fetal anomaly ultrasound.

         Ultrasound examination is usually adequate to confirm that the spinal defect is open (myelomeningocele, myeloschisis), not closed (eg, myelocystocele and lipomyelomeningocele); closed defects are not amenable to and would not benefit from in utero repair. Ultrasound diagnosis of an open versus closed defect is reliable; amniotic fluid testing for acetylcholinesterase is unnecessary for confirmation. When sonographic visualization of the defect is not adequate because of a difficult fetal lie or maternal factors (eg, obesity), MRI should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

         One way to distinguish open defects from closed defects is to identify the Chiari II malformation (hindbrain herniation, brainstem abnormalities, low-lying venous sinuses, a small posterior fossa, and some degree of hydrocephalus). Closed defects generally are not associated with this malformation  (

         Another way is to carefully evaluate the surface covering the defect, particularly at the margin of the defect where it contacts the skin of the lower back.

         Myeloschisis has no overlying sac containing neuronal elements and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); instead, the neural placode is tethered to the level of the defect itself  (

         Myelomeningoceles are covered with membrane, which tends to be very thin, whereas closed defects are covered with skin, which tends to be thick. On both ultrasound and MRI, membrane-covered lesions are at an acute angle at the point of contact with the lower back [

         Hindbrain herniation is an inclusion criterion for in utero repair. On ultrasound, the fetus should be imaged in the sagittal plane with its back at the maternal abdominal wall, if possible. Focusing on the craniocervical junction will reveal either anechoic CSF posterior to the cerebellum and extending down into the upper cervical canal (indicating no hindbrain herniation) or solid cerebellar tissue will be visualized dorsal to the cord, obliterating the cisterna magna and retrospinal CSF space (indicating hindbrain herniation)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef140468" href="/z/d/graphic/140468.html" rel="external">
          image 4

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with a difficult fetal lie or maternal factors (eg, obesity) that prevent successful visualization on ultrasound, MRI should be performed and is usually diagnostic. Typically, single-shot fast spin-echo (SSFSE) T2-weighted images are utilized, which provide excellent tissue contrast and bright fluid signal, and are relatively resistant to fetal motion. Care should be taken to obtain in-plane sagittal views of the brain, including a midline view; operators may find it helpful to obtain an odd number of images to ensure a single midline image.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some centers categorize the degree of hindbrain herniation, using imaging findings including obliteration of the cisterna magna and effacement of the fourth ventricle, in addition to presence of cerebellar tissue in the cervical canal, which is generally considered the imaging criterion for hindbrain herniation whether grading or a description is used [

         Candidates for fetal repair should have a vertebral defect beginning between T1 and S1, so identifying the upper extent of the defect is important. This can be accomplished via ultrasound or MRI; ultrasound has the advantages of showing each vertebral level in the axial plane so the upper level of the defect can be easily determined and the ability to readily distinguish vertebral levels with intact posterior elements from those that are defective posteriorly  (

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         MRI can be more challenging, particularly in a mobile fetus, but generally the technique depends more heavily on sagittal plane imaging of the spine and relies on echoplanar imaging, which allows for distinct visualization of the bony structures.

         We quantify ventriculomegaly because it is a factor when counseling parents about the risks and benefits of fetal versus postnatal repair. We believe in-utero repair can be beneficial even in fetuses with severe ventriculomegaly because it may preserve lower extremity movement and future independent walking, delay the need for a CSF shunt, and possibly increase the success of future endoscopic third ventriculostomy. However, some centers consider severe ventriculomegaly an exclusion criterion. A detailed analysis of postnatal follow-up data from the MOMS trial revealed that children who had severe ventriculomegaly (defined as &gt;15 mm) on prenatal imaging were highly likely to need treatment for hydrocephalus postnatally, even if they underwent fetal repair [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. In this analysis, 79 percent of fetuses with severe ventriculomegaly prior to fetal repair required postnatal treatment for hydrocephalus, compared with 85 percent of fetuses with severe ventriculomegaly managed expectantly and repaired postnatally. A subsequent study observed that perforation of the cavum septi pellucidi on ultrasound at the time of referral appeared to reliably identify those cases at highest risk for needing treatment of hydrocephalus by one year of age [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Ventriculomegaly can be quantified on ultrasound or MRI, but measurements should be standardized and consistent from scan to scan [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. It is important to be aware that in utero MRI measurements are typically 1 mm greater than ultrasound measurements in the same fetus on the same day, likely due to the higher spatial resolution of ultrasound and more accurate edge definition. It’s also important to be aware that if imaging is performed after fetal repair, ventricles typically increase in size by 2 to 3 mm, which is thought to be due to reaccumulation of CSF in the supratentorial compartment after closure of the defect.

         Lower extremity motion should be assessed at each joint, including hip flexion, knee flexion and extension, and ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion (with plantarflexion referred to as "gas pedal" movement).

Single-shot T2 or balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) sequences can be used for this purpose, with bSSFP having the advantage of being faster overall  (

         Additional fetal anomalies. Syndromes associated with spina bifida (eg, trisomy 18) may have already been detected by genetic testing or by an earlier ultrasound examination prior to referral, but the fetal imager should still pay careful attention to the rest of the fetal anatomic assessment to exclude potential syndromic etiologies. Some syndromes, such as caudal regression and omphalocele-exstrophy-imperforate anus-spine (OEIS) sequences, would typically be associated with a skin-covered NTD and would be an exclusion factor for prenatal repair. Certain stigmata of Chiari II malformation, such as dysgenesis of the corpus callosum and subependymal gray matter heterotopia, should not be mistaken as unrelated anomalies suggestive of an underlying genetic syndrome.

         The fetus may be at risk of adverse effects from general anesthesia administered to the mother. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that lengthy use of general anesthetic and sedation drugs during surgeries or procedures in pregnant people may affect the developing fetal brain [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49
         </a>
         ]. However, these potential effects also apply to newborns, so deferring the repair to the newborn period does not necessarily reduce this possible risk. Although children who need surgery and anesthesia have worse scores for some neurodevelopmental outcomes compared with children who do not need surgery and anesthesia, these differences cannot yet be attributed to anesthesia exposure and there is still uncertainty that exposure to anesthesia has any lasting effects in children or fetuses.

         The open fetal procedure involves maternal laparotomy. The uterus is exteriorized to facilitate surgical access and intraoperative imaging.
        </p>
        <p>
         The ultrasound transducer is placed directly onto the myometrium and the edge of the placenta is identified and marked using cautery. If necessary, the fetus is externally verted to an appropriate presentation and positioned underneath the intended hysterotomy site prior to opening the uterus.
        </p>
        <p>
         A large (8 cm) hysterotomy incision is made as far from the placenta as possible, with the orientation of the uterine incision parallel to the marked edge of the placenta to minimize the risk of extension into the placenta. If the placenta is anterior, uterine entry is either fundal or posterior; if the placenta is posterior, uterine entry is anterior. It is imperative to avoid placental bed bleeding since it cannot be easily controlled. The membranes are stapled to the uterine wall at the edges of the hysterotomy. Bleeding between the membranes and uterine wall leading to a subchorionic hematoma is a potentially serious complication of hysterotomy creation, with the potential for membrane dissection and abruption. Such bleeding can be catastrophic and require delivery and maternal blood transfusion.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once the hysterotomy has been created, the NTD is exposed in the opening. A catheter is placed in the uterus for infusing warm

         solution to maintain intrauterine fluid volume, which will prevent umbilical cord compression and fetal cooling during the procedure.
        </p>
        <p>
         An elliptical skin incision is made around the defect and carried down to the fascia. Extraneous skin and membrane are excised, a water-tight closure is performed, and the skin is closed. Different centers have evolved modifications of the original description of the technique described in the MOMS trial, which involved directly closing the dura when possible, otherwise with a collagen-based dural graft.
        </p>
        <p>
         The uterus is closed in two layers with absorbable sutures. Interrupted stay sutures are placed first, but not tied, and then a continuous suture is placed to close the hysterotomy. Prior to tying the continuous suture, a catheter is used to refill the amniotic cavity with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">

         – The most recent available data for open hysterotomy from over 1000 cases reported to the North American Fetal Therapy Network (NAFTNet) Fetal Myelomeningocele Consortium registry show comparable or better maternal, obstetric, and fetal/neonatal complication rates and outcomes among participating centers than those previously reported in the 2011 MOMS trial [

The modified hysterotomy closure suturing technique (ie, utilizing a third imbricating layer providing serosal-to-serosal apposition) has resulted in a low rates (≤5 percent) of uterine thinning and dehiscence [

         The mini-hysterotomy technique is similar to the open hysterotomy approach (laparotomy, exteriorization of the uterus, and placental border marking), except the length of the uterine incision is much smaller.
        </p>
        <p>
         The fetus is gently moved by external manipulation guided by ultrasound so that the spinal defect is located against the planned hysterotomy site. An electric blade is used to make a 2.5 to 3.5 cm hysterotomy that is superficial to the fetal defect and at least 2 cm away from the border of the placenta. The membranes are sutured to the inner layer of the myometrium, and a neonatal retractor is used to keep the hysterotomy open. Some surgeons have suggested utilizing of a plastic wound retractor (Alexis) at the mini-hysterotomy site [

        <p>
         Since the size of the NTD may be larger than the hysterotomy orifice, the fetus is constantly and carefully moved so that a specific portion of the lesion is accessible to the surgeons. The lesion is dissected and repaired in the same manner as described in the open hysterotomy approach.

         Laparotomy-assisted fetoscopic repair combines laparotomy and percutaneous approaches and is a promising alternative to open hysterotomy repair because it appears to have a lower risk of uterine thinning and dehiscence and thus enables a higher rate of vaginal birth in the index and future pregnancies [

          53-57
         </a>
         ]. Anchoring sutures are placed under ultrasound guidance to ensure that they are placed through the membranes and not partially through the uterine wall. Once the sutures have been placed, the first port is situated in the center of the anchoring sutures under ultrasound guidance using the Seldinger technique. The port should be placed 2 to 5 cm from the placental edge at the highest point on the uterus to obtain the best view of the lesion. The amniotic fluid is removed and replaced with heated and humidified CO

The fetal head is guided into the maternal pelvis and the fetus is maintained in a cephalic presentation with the spine anterior for the entire procedure.

          Outcome data
         </strong>
         – Retrospective studies demonstrated noninferiority to the open hysterotomy approach, with later gestational age at birth (37.6 weeks versus 34.1 weeks in the MOMS trial), less uterine scar associated complications, and high vaginal birth rates in the index pregnancy (50 percent; by comparison, vaginal birth is contraindicated after open hysterotomy) [

In the International Fetoscopic Myelomeningocele Repair Consortium cohort of 300 patients who underwent prenatal percutaneous or fetoscopic repair, the rate of preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) was higher than in studies of open repair (55 versus 32 to 46 percent), although the gestational age at birth was approximately 34 weeks for both groups [

The neural placode is released and dissected; skin is further undermined to allow approximation at the midline.

          Outcome
         </strong>
         – No direct comparison between the percutaneous and open hysterotomy approaches have been published, but advocates of the percutaneous method suggest it mitigates the risks of open maternal-fetal surgery because of less anesthesia risk, improved maternal postsurgical recovery, lower rates of uterine dehiscence, and higher rates of safe vaginal birth [
         <a href="#rid66">
          66
         </a>
         ]. On the other hand, the percutaneous technique does not allow plicating the chorioamniotic membranes, a limitation associated with earlier gestational age at delivery compared with the three approaches described above (32 weeks compared with ≥34 weeks with other approaches). To address this issue, a modification has been introduced that includes mini-laparotomy with placement of sutures to secure the membrane prior to percutaneous insertion of the 5 mm port (discussed below).

          Percutaneous mini-laparotomy technique

         – This technique is similar to the direct percutaneous repair but adds preliminary steps to allow fixation of the membranes prior to trocar placement [
         <a href="#rid67">
          67
         </a>
         ]. The mini-laparotomy incision is made at the expected site of the camera port. A 2 to 3 cm skin incision is made sharply with a scalpel in the abdominal wall. The incision is carried down to the fascia with cautery. Two stay sutures are placed in the fascial layer with the tails left long, and the fascial layer is incised between the 2 stitches. The abdominal wall layers are split bluntly and held open with retractors. The peritoneum is identified, and the abdominal cavity is entered. The uterus is identified and palpated. A wound retractor (Alexis Wound Protector) is placed to provide direct visualization and surgical access to the uterus. Two sutures are placed through the uterine wall at the anticipated location of the 5 mm port site. The trocars are then placed into the uterine cavity under ultrasound guidance by the Seldinger technique, exactly thorough the sutured locations. The remainder of the surgery is similar to the description of the percutaneous approach.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Ultrasound and MRI can both be utilized to assess the success of in utero spina bifida repair. Approximately six weeks after closure of the open spina bifida, the appearance of the Chiari II malformation should improve, with ascent of the hindbrain structures from the cervical spinal canal back into the posterior fossa and return of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to the fourth ventricle and retrocerebellar space. Reaccumulation of fluid in the supratentorial compartment should also occur, with an increase in size of the extra-axial CSF spaces and mild increase in lateral ventricular size on the order of 2 to 3 mm compared with preoperative imaging.

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         If the appearance of the posterior fossa does not improve post-repair, the lower back repair site should be evaluated to look for any evidence of a persistent leak. A CSF leak may accumulate at the repair site and form a fluid collection, known as a pseudomeningocele. Even without a fluid collection, the lack of hindbrain herniation reversal should raise concern for persistent CSF leak at the repair site.

Typically, these cases are associated with severe ventriculomegaly prior to repair. It should be noted that in fetuses with Chiari II malformation and aqueductal stenosis, the expected dilatation of the third ventricle may not be present.

          Candidates for in utero repair
         </strong>
         – Most fetal surgery centers performing open spina bifida repair generally base their inclusion and exclusion criteria on those used in the Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) trial, but modifications of the original parameters are common. Three key inclusion criteria are:

          Preoperative fetal evaluation
         </strong>
         – Preoperative fetal evaluation should include a detailed ultrasound examination and/or MRI to confirm open spinal bifida and evaluate the defect, associated brain findings, and neurologic implications. (See

         <strong>
          Approaches for in utero repair
         </strong>
         – Prenatal repair should only be offered in highly specialized level 3 fetal centers. Prenatal repair approaches include open hysterotomy, mini-hysterotomy, laparotomy-assisted fetoscopic, and percutaneous fetoscopic repair. Detailed discussion of the available approaches and associated adverse outcomes will allow more informed consent and decision-making, enabling parents to choose the management option that best fits their needs and expectations. While limited data comparing the different neurosurgical repair methods suggest they have comparable fetal neurologic outcomes, all centers do not offer the same method and the methods differ significantly in the rate of maternal complications, gestational age at delivery, and chances of vaginal birth. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Centers for fetal surgery'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Delivery
         </strong>
         – We deliver all patients who underwent open hysterotomy repair by cesarean birth at 37+0 weeks, if still undelivered. Patients who underwent any of the fetoscopic methods with no standard contraindications for vaginal birth are induced no later than 39+0 weeks. Induction should be managed carefully, similar to induction of labor after cesarean birth. (See
