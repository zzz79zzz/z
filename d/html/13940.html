         Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) consists of a diverse group of malignant neoplasms of the lymphoid tissues variously derived from B cell progenitors, T cell progenitors, mature B cells, or mature T cells. Unlike in adults where low-grade, clinically indolent NHL subtypes predominate, most pediatric NHL cases are of high grade and have an aggressive clinical behavior [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Whenever possible, children with NHL should be treated in a comprehensive pediatric oncology center by a multidisciplinary team experienced in the diagnosis and care of children with cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will provide an overview of NHL in children and adolescents, focusing on issues that are of interest to primary care providers. The pathobiology of NHL and its diagnosis and management in adults are presented separately, as is an overview of Hodgkin lymphoma in children and adolescents. (See

         NHL is the fifth most common diagnosis of pediatric cancer in children under the age of 15 years, and it accounts for approximately 7 percent of childhood cancers in the developed world [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. In the United States, approximately 800 new cases of pediatric NHL are diagnosed annually with an incidence of 10 to 20 cases per million people per year [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-6
         </a>
         ]. This incidence appears to be increasing overall, largely thought to reflect a rise in NHL among adolescents. The median age at diagnosis is approximately 10 years, and the incidence increases with age [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Lymphomas are rare in infants (≤1 percent) and account for approximately 4, 14, 22, and 25 percent of neoplasms in children age 1 to 4, 5 to 9, 10 to 14, and 15 to 19 years, respectively. There is a male predominance, and White children are more commonly affected than African American children.
        </p>
        <p>
         The incidence and distribution of specific NHL subtypes differs by population (eg, age, race) and geographical region. In general, the most common subtypes of pediatric NHL are derived from B cell progenitors. In the United States and other developed countries, the most common subtypes are Burkitt lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, lymphoblastic T cell or B cell lymphoma, and anaplastic large cell lymphoma [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Other subtypes (eg, follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma) are less common, accounting for approximately 7 percent of pediatric NHL.
        </p>

         Both congenital and acquired immunodeficiency syndromes are associated with an increased risk of NHL. Congenital immunodeficiencies associated with NHL include common variable immunodeficiency, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, ataxia telangiectasia, and X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome. Congenital immunodeficiencies may impact treatment decisions. As an example, the use of diagnostic tests and therapy involving X-rays and ionizing radiation should be limited in children with ataxia telangiectasia to minimize the risk of somatic mutations and subsequent malignancy. Acquired immunodeficiencies include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the use of immunosuppressive medications. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders can follow solid organ and hematopoietic cell transplantation. (See

         Potential emergency complications of NHL may be present at the time of diagnosis and need to be considered during the initial workup and evaluation of a patient with suspected pediatric NHL. Prompt recognition and therapy are critical for these situations, which may be life-threatening or may interfere with and delay treatment of the underlying NHL.

         Tumor lysis syndrome is an oncologic emergency that is caused by massive tumor cell lysis and the release of large amounts of potassium, phosphate, and uric acid into the systemic circulation. Deposition of uric acid and/or calcium phosphate crystals in the renal tubules can result in acute renal failure, which is usually anuric. (See

         The clinical presentation of pediatric NHL varies depending upon the type of lymphoma and the areas of involvement. Symptoms develop quickly, usually over one to three weeks. NHL commonly presents as enlarging, non-tender lymphadenopathy or as symptoms due to the compression of surrounding structures, such as new onset wheezing, facial swelling, respiratory distress, asymmetrical tonsils, or acute abdominal pain. Hepatic and/or splenic enlargement may be present in patients with advanced stage NHL.
        </p>
        <p>
         Central nervous system (CNS) involvement occurs in 6 percent of pediatric NHL with rates ranging from 8.8 percent in Burkitt lymphoma to &lt;3 percent in diffuse large B cell lymphoma [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. A significant minority of patients will have systemic complaints of fever, weight loss, or night sweats (ie, B symptoms). While certain clinical presentations are suggestive of specific NHL histologies, a definitive diagnosis requires a biopsy of involved tissue, as described below. (See

         Hyperuricemia – Patients with rapidly proliferating tumors, particularly Burkitt lymphoma or lymphoblastic lymphoma, may demonstrate manifestations of tumor lysis syndrome with elevated uric acid, potassium, and diminished renal function. Hyperuricemia and tumor lysis syndrome are more commonly seen in patients presenting with underlying renal failure, due to either renal infiltration with lymphoma, pre-existing renal disease, or coincident obstruction of the ureters secondary to NHL.

         Elevated level of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) – LDH elevation associated with NHL may be due to high tumor burden, extensive infiltration of the liver, or association with particular rapidly proliferative NHL such as Burkitt or lymphoblastic lymphoma.

         Initial imaging studies (eg, ultrasound, radiographs, computed tomography) are often performed as part of the evaluation of presenting symptoms (eg, abdominal pain). These may demonstrate masses and/or lymphadenopathy in the neck, chest, or abdomen. Pediatric NHL, unlike Hodgkin lymphoma, may involve non-contiguous areas. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4696.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, routine staging of pediatric NHL should include contrast enhanced computerized tomographic (CT) imaging of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. This CT both serves to help determine disease stage at diagnosis and to provide a baseline study for comparison to determine response to treatment. Integrated positron emissions tomography (PET)/CT scanning is more sensitive and specific than CT in certain histologic subtypes of NHL, including the most common subtypes seen in children [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9

        <p>
         Imaging of the bones with plain films, CT, and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not routinely performed in NHL, but is indicated in the presence of bone pain and/or suspicion of a pathologic fracture. Bone lesions in NHL are mostly osteolytic on plain films, in contrast to those in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, which are predominantly osteoblastic. If there is suspicion of spinal cord compression, urgent MRI of the entire spinal column is indicated, since multiple sites may be involved. MRI (with and without gadolinium) of the head is also indicated for patients with neurologic symptoms or signs. (See

         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Subtypes of NHL are identified using histology, immunophenotype, and genetic studies. Pediatricians should promptly refer children and teenagers with a suspected NHL to a pediatric oncologist for evaluation and diagnosis. (See

         Stage III now includes two extranodal areas irrespective of side of the diaphragm and single bone lesions with extranodal and/or nonregional nodal involvement. The consensus group acknowledged that more sensitive methods play a role in determining if there is bone marrow or cerebral spinal fluid involvement, but stage IV will still depend on standard (Murphy) definitions. They do ask that the data regarding techniques of determining disease status in those sites be recorded. The proposed staging system modifications need to be validated, and currently the Murphy staging is considered standard of care.

         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Optimal therapy involves a multidisciplinary approach from the time of diagnosis, incorporating the skills of pediatric surgical subspecialists, radiation oncologists, pediatric medical oncologists/hematologists, rehabilitation specialists, pediatric nurse specialists, and social workers experienced in the diagnosis and care of children with cancer. Assignment of stage and treatment are best determined after the multidisciplinary team has examined the patient and reviewed the diagnostic images and staging study results. Often there is no better therapy to offer a patient than enrollment onto a well-designed, scientifically valid, peer-reviewed clinical trial. Many of such trials are only offered at comprehensive pediatric oncology centers. (See

        <p>
         Combination chemotherapy is the primary modality used for the treatment of pediatric NHL. Unlike in adults, radiation therapy is not commonly used. As described in more detail below, studies in children have demonstrated that radiation therapy does not appear to improve outcomes in early stage NHL or as prophylaxis of the CNS [

         Most children and adolescents with NHL have a good prognosis with current therapy. Survival rates have improved dramatically over the past 40 years with modern treatment regimens resulting in estimated five-year survival rates of over 85 percent [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,22

         Acute effects of treatment for pediatric NHL depend upon the specific chemotherapeutic agents used.
        </p>
        <p>
         Myelosuppression is the most common dose-limiting acute toxicity of multiagent chemotherapy and can be treated with transfusions (red cells and platelets) or the administration of colony-stimulating factors (eg, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor). Blood products, if given, need to be irradiated to prevent development of fatal transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease in these immunocompromised subjects. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5935.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and immunosuppression increase the risk of life-threatening infections with viruses, bacteria, and fungi, which need to be treated quickly and appropriately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6051.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The cellular immune system, including decreased T cell and NK cell function, may be impaired at baseline and further compromised by myelosuppression, increasing the susceptibility to herpes zoster and varicella infections. Post-exposure prophylaxis can be used to prevent development of varicella infection in children who did not receive the
         <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13006" href="/z/d/drug information/13006.html" rel="external">
          varicella vaccine
         </a>
         before undergoing chemotherapy. Antiviral therapy should be promptly initiated in patients who develop varicella infection or varicella zoster. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8273.html" rel="external">
          "Post-exposure prophylaxis against varicella-zoster virus infection"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Children who receive multiple chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of NHL may develop nausea and vomiting. These effects can be modulated with serotonin receptor antagonist anti-emetics and/or pretreatment with benzodiazepines. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1151.html" rel="external">

         Children with lymphoblastic lymphoma should be enrolled in a clinical trial, whenever possible. Almost all patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma are eligible to enroll on trials for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The preferred treatment modality for pediatric lymphoblastic lymphoma is combination chemotherapy based on regimens used for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). With this approach, children with early stage (I or II) or advanced stage (III or IV) lymphoblastic lymphoma achieve survival rates of &gt;90 and &gt;80 percent, respectively. The role of surgery is limited to surgical biopsy of a peripheral lymph node, a bone marrow aspiration, or aspiration of pleural fluid to establish the diagnosis. There is no role for surgical debulking of disease due to the high sensitivity of the tumor to chemotherapy. Likewise, there is no routine need for radiation therapy [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. Radiation is generally reserved for patients with pathologically proven involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) at the time of diagnosis. Testicular involvement at diagnosis does not require testicular radiation.

         Initial support for the use of ALL protocols in patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma was based upon the significant biological and clinical overlap between these two entities. Indeed, the WHO classification system considers these entities to be the same disease with different clinical presentations [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Initial prospective trials demonstrated the efficacy of ALL protocols in patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma. Subsequent trials demonstrated that good outcomes can be maintained while decreasing the intensity of treatment. As examples:

For children and adolescents with stage III/IV disease without CNS involvement, the A5971 protocol produced a five-year event-free survival rate of 81 percent with intensification and backbone therapy not significantly impacting the outcome. Effective CNS prophylaxis occurred with either intensive intrathecal chemotherapy or with high dose

In contrast, this same trial reported that the 12 children with disseminated CNS disease at the time of diagnosis had estimated event-free survival, overall survival, and relapse rates of 63, 81, and 25 percent at five years, respectively [

         Together, these and other trials demonstrate that treatment based upon protocols for ALL produce excellent survival rates among children with lymphoblastic lymphoma. Prophylactic cranial irradiation adds toxicity and can be eliminated for the vast majority of patients. For patients with disseminated T cell disease without CNS involvement at diagnosis, there appears to be no benefit to extra intensification of therapy during the induction or delayed intensification phases, and no benefit to using high dose

The primary end-point of the trial was EFS (ie, primary refractory disease, relapse, progressive disease, second cancer, or death from any cause). After median follow-up of 40 months, three-year EFS with chemoimmunotherapy (93.9 percent; 95% CI 89.1-96.7) was superior to chemotherapy alone (82.3 percent, 95% CI 75.7-87.5); the hazard ratio (HR) for an event was 0.32 (95% CI 0.15-0.66). Chemoimmunotherapy also achieved superior three-year OS (95.1 versus 87.3 percent; HR for death, 0.36; 95% CI 0.16-0.82). Rituximab infusion-related reactions occurred with the first infusion in 33 percent (4 percent grade 3) but subsequently in &lt;10 percent (2 percent grade 3). More children treated with rituximab had hypogammaglobulinemia (70 versus 47 percent) and required immunoglobulin infusion, and there were more episodes of grade ≥4 febrile neutropenia and infections in patients treated with rituximab, but the differences were not statistically different.

         BL is often encountered during surgery for acute abdominal symptoms or during a tonsillectomy. If the surgeon can remove the tumor entirely, it is appropriate to do so, but otherwise, there is no role for surgical debulking of BL.

        <p>
         Among children with BL, relapses typically occur within the first two years and are clinically aggressive. The outcome of children with relapsed BL is poor, usually due to failure to achieve a second remission.

         NHL is an AIDS-defining malignancy. A key component of the treatment of all HIV-infected patients with an AIDS-related NHL is the administration of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The reduction in HIV viral load and improvement in immune function associated with ART is expected to result in better tolerance of chemotherapy, fewer opportunistic infections, and improvement in overall treatment outcome. As such, children with HIV and NHL should be treated with standard chemotherapy regimens for NHL, but careful attention to prophylaxis against and early detection of infection is warranted. The treatment of AIDS-related lymphomas in adults is presented separately. (See

         Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) represents a spectrum of clinically and morphologically heterogeneous lymphoid proliferations, ranging from disease that looks like a normal reactive process to disease that looks like NHL. Essentially all PTLD following HCT is associated with EBV, but EBV-negative PTLD can be seen following solid organ transplant. In PTLD, first-line therapy is the reduction of immunosuppression.

         Patients are evaluated after the completion of therapy to determine disease response. The choice of imaging modality depends at least partially upon the sites originally involved. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide an assessment of mass size alone, while positron emission tomography (PET) can provide information regarding the metabolic activity of residual masses. MRI is preferred for the evaluation of central nervous system (CNS) disease and bone marrow, while CT is preferred for assessing the lungs. All patients should have pathologic evaluation of their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and bone marrow as part of the disease response assessment.

         The International Pediatric NHL Staging System (IPNHLSS) proposed definitions will need to be validated in clinical trials. Until then, patients who have no evidence of residual disease upon restaging are seen at periodic intervals to monitor for relapse. Residual masses should be biopsied to distinguish between residual disease and other masses (eg, fibrosis, thymus). Relapsed disease can be suggested by changes on imaging studies but can only be confirmed by biopsy. As such, a biopsy should always be obtained to document relapsed disease before proceeding to salvage therapy.

         In a prospective study, 34 children with nonlymphoblastic NHL underwent imaging with PET/CT and conventional contrast material-enhanced CT at baseline, after two cycles of chemotherapy, and after completion of chemotherapy [
         <a href="#rid61">
          61

         ]. Baseline PET/CT and conventional CT were concordant in 112 disease sites, while PET/CT depicted 18 more disease sites and two fewer disease sites resulting in disease upstaging in five patients, but no change in treatment. There was 100 percent concordance regarding bone marrow involvement between PET/CT and bone marrow biopsy. Interim imaging did not predict progression-free or overall survival. Both post-treatment PET/CT and CT could predict progression-free survival, but only post-treatment contrast-enhanced CT could predict overall survival.

         Survivors of childhood cancer are at increased risk for long-term sequelae. Late adverse effects are primarily dependent upon the type and intensity of therapy. Patients who received more intense chemotherapy are more likely to have late complications. The late effects consist primarily of those related to anthracycline and alkylating toxicity. Radiation therapy plays a limited role in treatment, thus most patients do not face the long-term effects of radiation.

         Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) consists of a diverse group of malignant neoplasms of the lymphoid tissues variously derived from B cell progenitors, T cell progenitors, mature B cells, or mature T cells. Unlike in adults where low-grade, clinically indolent NHL subtypes predominate, most pediatric NHL cases are of high-grade and have an aggressive clinical behavior. (See

         The clinical presentation of pediatric NHL varies depending upon the type of lymphoma and the areas of involvement. Signs and symptoms develop quickly, usually over a few weeks to months. NHL commonly presents as enlarging, non-tender lymphadenopathy or as symptoms due to the compression of surrounding structures, such as new onset wheezing, facial swelling, respiratory distress, asymmetrical tonsils, or acute abdominal pain.

         Potential emergency complications of NHL may be present at the time of diagnosis and need to be considered during the initial workup and evaluation of a patient with suspected pediatric NHL.

         Pediatricians should promptly refer children and teenagers with a suspected NHL to a pediatric oncologist for evaluation and diagnosis. The diagnosis of NHL is based upon the pathologic evaluation of involved tissue, usually an abdominal mass, extranodal site, or lymph node, interpreted within the clinical context. Subtypes of NHL are identified using histology, immunophenotype, and genetic studies. (See

         Combination chemotherapy is the primary modality used for the treatment of pediatric NHL. The role of surgery is limited to surgical biopsy of a peripheral lymph node, a bone marrow aspiration, or aspiration of pleural fluid to establish the diagnosis.
