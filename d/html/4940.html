Epidemiologic studies are largely lacking, and the exact incidence and prevalence of acute pericarditis are unknown. However, acute pericarditis is recorded in approximately 0.1 to 0.2 percent of hospitalized patients and 5 percent of patients admitted to the emergency department for nonischemic chest pain [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In an observational study from an urban area in northern Italy, the incidence of acute pericarditis was 27.7 cases per 100,000 persons per year [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In an observational study from Finland that included 670,409 cardiovascular admissions to 29 hospitals across the country over a 9.5-year period, the standardized incidence rate for pericarditis requiring hospitalization was 3.3 cases per 100,000 person-years [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p>Acute pericarditis is a common disorder in several clinical settings, where it may be either the first manifestation of an underlying systemic disease or represent an isolated process. In developed countries, most cases of acute pericarditis are considered of possible or confirmed viral origin, although the exact etiology of most cases remains undetermined following a traditional diagnostic approach [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4957.html" rel="external">"Etiology of pericardial disease"</a>.)</p><p>Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection treated with antiretroviral therapy who develop acute pericarditis have an etiologic spectrum very similar to non-HIV-infected patients. However, HIV infection itself, along with tuberculosis, persist as major causes of acute pericarditis in developing countries or in patients without access to antiretroviral therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3699.html" rel="external">"Cardiac and vascular disease in patients with HIV", section on 'Pericardial disease'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute pericarditis can present with a variety of nonspecific signs and symptoms, depending on the underlying etiology. The major clinical manifestations of acute pericarditis include [<a href="#rid2">2,4</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chest pain</strong> – Typically sharp and pleuritic, improved by sitting up and leaning forward. (See <a class="local">'Chest pain'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pericardial friction rub</strong> – A superficial scratchy or squeaking sound best heard with the diaphragm of the stethoscope over the left sternal border. (See <a class="local">'Pericardial friction rub'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Electrocardiogram (ECG) changes</strong> – New widespread ST elevation and PR depression. (See <a class="local">'Electrocardiogram'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pericardial effusion</strong> – A pericardial effusion is a common feature of pericarditis but is not required for diagnosis. (See <a class="local">'Echocardiogram'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Patients with an infectious etiology may present with signs and symptoms of systemic infection such as fever and leukocytosis. Viral etiologies in particular may be preceded by "flu-like" respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients with a known autoimmune disorder or malignancy may present with signs or symptoms specific to their underlying disorder.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Chest pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The vast majority of patients with acute pericarditis present with chest pain (&gt;95 percent of cases) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The chest pain of pericarditis must always be distinguished from other common and/or life-threatening causes of chest pain  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54629" href="/d/graphic/54629.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) such as myocardial ischemia, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and musculoskeletal pain. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/288.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the adult with chest pain in the emergency department"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6832.html" rel="external">"Outpatient evaluation of the adult with chest pain"</a>.)</p><p>Chest pain that results from acute pericarditis is typically fairly sudden in onset and occurs over the anterior chest. Unlike pain due to myocardial ischemia, chest pain due to pericarditis is most often sharp and pleuritic in nature, with exacerbation by inspiration or coughing [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. One of the most distinctive features is the tendency for a decrease in intensity when the patient sits up and leans forward. This position (seated, leaning forward) tends to reduce pressure on the parietal pericardium, particularly with inspiration, and may also allow for splinting of the diaphragm. Radiation of chest pain to the trapezius ridge has also been considered to be fairly specific for pericarditis. In some patients, dull, oppressive pain may occur; in such cases, it is more difficult to distinguish pericarditis from other causes of chest pain.</p><p>Chest pain is likely to be present in cases of acute pericarditis caused by infection, but may be minimal or absent in patients with uremic pericarditis or pericarditis associated with a rheumatologic disorder (although in some patients, pleuritic chest pain and pericarditis can be the initial presentation of systemic lupus erythematosus). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16578.html" rel="external">"Pericardial involvement in systemic autoimmune diseases"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Pericardial friction rub</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The presence of a pericardial friction rub on physical examination is highly specific for acute pericarditis  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef56608" href="/d/graphic/56608.html" rel="external">movie 1</a>). Classically, pericardial friction rubs are triphasic, with a superficial scratchy or squeaking quality. Pericardial friction rubs are often intermittent, with an intensity that tends to wax and wane, and are best heard using the diaphragm of the stethoscope. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1079.html" rel="external">"Auscultation of heart sounds", section on 'Pericardial friction rub and other adventitious sounds'</a>.)</p><p>Pericardial friction rubs, which occur during maximal movement of the heart within its pericardial sac, are said to be generated by friction between the two inflamed layers of the pericardium. However, this commonly offered explanation for its mechanism may be an oversimplification, as patients with a pericardial effusion may also have an audible friction rub.</p><p>The classic pericardial friction rub consists of three phases, corresponding to movement of the heart during atrial systole, ventricular systole, and the rapid filling phase of early ventricular diastole. Patients in atrial fibrillation lack atrial systole, and therefore will have a two-phase rub. Additionally, for uncertain reasons, some rubs are present only during one (one component) or two phases (two components) of the cardiac cycle [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In a review of auscultation and phonocardiography in 100 patients with a pericardial rub, the rub was triphasic in 52 percent of patients, biphasic in 33 percent, and monophasic in 15 percent [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>Pericardial rubs may be localized or widespread, but are usually loudest over the left sternal border [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The intensity of the rub frequently increases after application of firm pressure with the diaphragm, during suspended respiration, and with the patient leaning forward or resting on elbows and knees  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86234" href="/d/graphic/86234.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). This last maneuver is designed to increase contact between visceral and parietal pericardium, but is seldom used in practice since it is cumbersome for the patient.</p><p>Friction rubs tend to vary in intensity and can come and go over a period of hours; therefore, the sensitivity for detection of a rub is variable and depends in large part on the frequency of auscultation. Pericardial rubs may be easier to hear in patients without a pericardial effusion, but this finding is not universal and is not well documented. In a report of 100 patients with acute pericarditis, a pericardial rub was present in 34 of 40 (85 percent) without an effusion [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. This prevalence is considerably higher than the 35 percent incidence of friction rubs reported in another series [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>Breath-holds during auscultation permit distinction of a pericardial friction rub from a pleuropericardial or pleural rub. A pleuropericardial rub results from friction between the inflamed pleura and the parietal pericardium, while a pleural rub is the result of friction between the inflamed visceral and parietal pleura. As such, pleuropericardial and pleural rubs can be heard only during the inspiratory phase of respiration. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1079.html" rel="external">"Auscultation of heart sounds", section on 'Pericardial friction rub and other adventitious sounds'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2297355"><span class="h2">Electrocardiogram</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ECG in acute pericarditis may evolve through as many as four stages with highly variable temporal evolution of ECG changes. The four typical stages of ECG changes  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115268" href="/d/graphic/115268.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) in patients with acute pericarditis include:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3660788597"><span class="h3">Typical ECG findings</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage 1, seen in the first hours to days, is characterized by widespread ST elevation (typically concave up) with reciprocal ST depression in leads aVR and V1  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef77572" href="/d/graphic/77572.html" rel="external">waveform 1</a>). There is also frequently an atrial current of injury, reflected by elevation of the PR segment in lead aVR and depression of the PR segment in other limb leads and in the left chest leads, primarily V5 and V6. Thus, the PR and ST segments typically change in opposite directions. PR segment deviation, which is highly specific, though less sensitive, is frequently overlooked.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The TP segment is recommended as the baseline for comparison when measuring both PR and ST segment changes in acute pericarditis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage 2, typically seen in the first week, is characterized by normalization of the ST and PR segments.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage 3 is characterized by the development of diffuse T-wave inversions, generally <strong>after</strong> the ST segments have become isoelectric. It is typically seen in the subacute phase, and its duration is not well documented and likely highly variable.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage 4 is represented by normalization of the ECG. It can occur directly from stage 1 in self-limited cases or with prompt response to medical therapy.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H323562299"><span class="h3">Atypical ECG findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pericarditis does not always result in the typical ECG changes described above. In many patients, the ECG returns to normal without going through the above stages if the disease responds well to treatment or spontaneously resolves. Moreover, some patients have no subepicardial inflammation, and the ECG remains normal, as discussed below.</p><p>Atypical ECG changes are seen in up to 40 percent of patients with acute pericarditis [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Additionally, localized ST elevation and T-wave inversion occur before ST-segment normalization in a minority of patients with acute pericarditis without myocardial involvement. These changes can simulate ECG changes seen in patients with an acute coronary syndrome. (See <a class="local">'Differentiation from acute myocardial infarction'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2125.html" rel="external">"ECG tutorial: Myocardial ischemia and infarction"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2121.html" rel="external">"ECG tutorial: ST and T wave changes"</a>.)</p><p>Changes in the ECG in patients with acute pericarditis signify inflammation of the epicardium, since the parietal pericardium itself is electrically inert. However, some causes of pericarditis do not result in significant inflammation of the epicardium and, as such, may not alter the ECG. An illustration of this is uremic pericarditis, in which there is prominent fibrin deposition but little or no epicardial inflammation. As a result, the ECG often shows none of the changes associated with pericarditis [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>The temporal evolution of ECG changes with acute pericarditis is highly variable from one patient to another. Treatment can accelerate or alter ECG progression. The duration of the ECG changes in pericarditis also depends upon its cause and the extent of associated myocardial damage [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3989495045"><span class="h3">Arrhythmias</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Sustained arrhythmias are uncommon in acute pericarditis, except in the postthoracotomy setting. This was illustrated in a review of 100 consecutive patients in which only seven arrhythmias were identified; all were atrial and all occurred in patients with underlying heart disease [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. In a separate report comparing patients with myopericarditis and uncomplicated acute pericarditis, cardiac arrhythmias were more commonly present in patients with myopericarditis (odds ratio 17.6, 95% CI 5.7-54.1) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Thus, the presence of atrial or ventricular arrhythmias is suggestive of concomitant myocarditis or an unrelated cardiac disease.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2301545"><span class="h3">Differentiation from acute myocardial infarction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While both acute pericarditis and acute myocardial infarction (MI) can present with chest pain and elevations in cardiac biomarkers, the ECG changes in acute pericarditis differ from those in acute ST-elevation MI (STEMI) in several ways  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115285" href="/d/graphic/115285.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. These distinctions assume that the pericarditis does not occur during or soon after an acute MI. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2095.html" rel="external">"Electrocardiogram in the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia and infarction"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4937.html" rel="external">"Pericardial complications of myocardial infarction"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2121.html" rel="external">"ECG tutorial: ST and T wave changes"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2125.html" rel="external">"ECG tutorial: Myocardial ischemia and infarction"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Morphology</strong> – The ST-segment elevation in acute pericarditis begins at the J point, which represents the junction between the end of the QRS complex (termination of depolarization) and the beginning of the ST segment (onset of ventricular repolarization), rarely exceeds 5 mm, and usually retains its normal concavity  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef77572" href="/d/graphic/77572.html" rel="external">waveform 1</a>).

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

Cases are most commonly idiopathic (most probably viral in etiology). Other etiologies include bacterial infections, malignancy, and autoimmune disorders  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60949" href="/d/graphic/60949.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). The distribution of etiologies varies with geography and type of clinical setting (community hospital versus tertiary referral center). (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical features</strong> – Acute pericarditis can present with a variety of nonspecific signs and symptoms, depending on the underlying etiology. Common clinical manifestations include chest pain (typically pleuritic), pericardial friction rub, characteristic ECG changes (diffuse ST elevation and PR depression), and pericardial effusion. Pericarditis should also be suspected in a patient with persistent fever and pericardial effusion or new unexplained cardiomegaly. (See <a class="local">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic evaluation</strong> – For all patients with suspected acute pericarditis, the initial evaluation includes a comprehensive history and physical examination, selective blood work (assessing for markers of inflammation and myocardial damage), chest radiography, ECG, and echocardiography. Follow-up testing is performed in selected cases as needed and may include additional laboratory evaluation (eg, blood cultures, antinuclear antibody titer, HIV and hepatitis C virus serology) and additional cardiac imaging. (See <a class="local">'Our approach to diagnostic testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis </strong>– Acute pericarditis is diagnosed by the presence of at least two of the following four criteria  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74376" href="/d/graphic/74376.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) (see <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Typical chest pain (sharp and pleuritic, improved by sitting up and leaning forward). (See <a class="local">'Chest pain'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pericardial friction rub (a superficial scratchy or squeaking sound best heard with the diaphragm of the stethoscope over the left sternal border)  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef56608" href="/d/graphic/56608.html" rel="external">movie 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Pericardial friction rub'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Characteristic changes on the ECG (typically widespread ST-segment elevation)  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef77572" href="/d/graphic/77572.html" rel="external">waveform 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Electrocardiogram'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>New or worsening pericardial effusion. (See <a class="local">'Echocardiogram'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indications for hospitalization</strong> – Patients with acute pericarditis with one or more high-risk features (including fever, subacute course, suspected cardiac tamponade, immunosuppression, acute trauma, treatment with oral anticoagulation, or elevated cardiac troponin) are at increased risk for complications and should generally be admitted to initiate appropriate therapy and to expedite a thorough initial evaluation. Conversely, patients with uncomplicated (ie, low-risk) acute pericarditis can usually be evaluated and sent home, with outpatient follow-up. (See <a class="local">'Assessment of risk and need for hospitalization'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Role of testing to determine etiology</strong> – Given the relatively benign course associated with the common causes of pericarditis and the low yield of much diagnostic testing, it is not necessary to establish a definite etiology in all patients with acute pericarditis. Initial evaluation should focus on excluding a significant pericardial effusion or cardiac tamponade and identification of patients in whom a more comprehensive evaluation should be performed to exclude causes that require specific therapy (eg, malignancy, tuberculosis, or purulent pericarditis). (See <a class="local">'Establishing a definite etiology'</a> above.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Kytö V, Sipilä J, Rautava P.
