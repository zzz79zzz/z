Survivors of both adult and childhood cancers are at risk for developing therapy-related complications, including second cancers, now aptly termed an "iatrogenic disease of success" [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16613.html" rel="external">"Overview of cancer survivorship care for primary care and oncology providers", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Therapeutic radiation has long been recognized as an inducing agent in the development of malignant neoplasms [<a href="#rid2">2-5</a>]. The first case reports of bone sarcomas in patients who had received radiation therapy (RT) for benign bone conditions were published in 1922, and a report of bone sarcomas in the jaws of radium-dial painters followed in 1929 [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>].</p><p>Sarcomas are rare malignant tumors that arise from mesenchymal tissues at any location. The histopathologic spectrum of sarcomas is broad, reflecting the fact that the embryonic mesenchymal cells from which they arise have the capacity to mature into striated skeletal and smooth muscle, adipose and fibrous tissue, bone, and cartilage. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14259.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma", section on 'Histopathology'</a>.)</p><p>Besides exposure to RT, pathogenetic factors include genetic predisposition, exposure to chemotherapy, and for certain types of soft tissue sarcoma, chronic edema, and viral infection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7737.html" rel="external">"Pathogenetic factors in soft tissue and bone sarcomas"</a>.) </p><p>This topic review will cover secondary soft tissue and bone sarcomas that arise after therapeutic irradiation in adults and children.

As an example, a report from the UK Registry of Childhood Tumors included a cohort of 13,175 pediatric patients, seen from 1940 to 1983, who had survived for at least three years following treatment of a primary tumor [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The estimated 20-year risk for developing bone cancer did not exceed 0.9 percent unless the underlying disease was inherited retinoblastoma (7.2 percent), Ewing sarcoma (5.4 percent), or other malignant bone tumors (2.4 percent). </p><p></p><p>Radiation-associated osteosarcomas are the most frequent second primary cancer occurring during the first 20 years following RT for a solid cancer in childhood [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Secondary osteosarcomas and soft tissue sarcomas are particularly common in individuals with hereditary retinoblastoma. (See <a class="local">'Genetic predisposition'</a> below.)</p><p>The mean age at diagnosis for a radiation-associated sarcoma is between 50 and 67 years for adults [<a href="#rid26">26-29</a>]. Children are typically diagnosed as teenagers or young adults, reflecting the long average latency period of between 16 and 33 years [<a href="#rid27">27,30,31</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Latency period'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H62615503"><span class="h2">Most common primary cancers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common primary cancers associated with a later radiation-associated sarcoma in adults are breast cancer, lymphoma, head and neck, and gynecologic cancers [<a href="#rid9">9,11,28,29,32-36</a>]. This distribution likely reflects the fact that larger numbers of patients are treated for, and survive, these tumors (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3365.html" rel="external">"Management of late complications of head and neck cancer and its treatment", section on 'Second malignancies'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/754.html" rel="external">"Overview of long-term complications of therapy in breast cancer survivors and patterns of relapse", section on 'Risks associated with radiation therapy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90926.html" rel="external">"Treatment-related toxicity from the use of radiation therapy for gynecologic malignancies", section on 'Bone and bone marrow'</a>). Because of the association with cancers that predominantly occur in women, they are more commonly affected, with a female to male ratio of 2:1. For gender-neutral tumors, there is no obvious female-male predisposition.</p><p>The most common primary tumors associated with a secondary radiation-associated sarcoma in children include retinoblastoma, Ewing sarcoma family of tumors, rhabdomyosarcoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, brain tumors, and Wilms tumor [<a href="#rid12">12,25,37-42</a>]. Issues related to chemotherapy exposure are addressed below. (See <a class="local">'Chemotherapy agents'</a> below.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H709392415"><span class="h2">Histologic distribution</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Postradiation sarcomas can arise in soft tissue or bone, with soft tissue sarcomas predominating. For most series that include them, bone sarcomas represent 20 to 30 percent of all radiation-associated sarcomas [<a href="#rid9">9,10,26,43,44</a>], although bone sarcomas predominate in a minority [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. </p><p>Most postradiation soft tissue sarcomas are high grade, and they can be of a variety of histologies, the most common of which are malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), undifferentiated/unclassified soft tissue sarcoma (formerly a subset of tumors referred to as "malignant fibrous histiocytoma" [MFH] and now including undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma [UPS], as well as morphologically round cell and spindle cell variants [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]), angiosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma (particularly in retinoblastoma survivors)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66154" href="/z/d/graphic/66154.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid9">9-11,26,29,31,32,46-49</a>]. In one large series of over 69,000 five-year childhood cancer survivors, retinoblastoma survivors experienced the highest risk of developing a secondary soft tissue sarcoma (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 72.8, 95% CI 56.1-93.0), especially leiomyosarcoma (SIR 342.9, 95% CI 245-466.9) [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. However, 76.9 percent of the leiomyosarcomas observed after retinoblastoma treatment developed outside of the irradiated field, and they were mostly attributed to an inherited cancer predisposition syndrome. The absolute excess risk among retinoblastoma survivors increased substantially with increasing years since diagnosis, and attained age. (See <a class="local">'Genetic predisposition'</a> below.)</p><p>The most common sarcoma to occur after RT for breast cancer is angiosarcoma. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14259.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma", section on 'Histopathology'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/811.html" rel="external">"Breast sarcoma: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging", section on 'Histologic classification'</a>.)</p><p>Radiation-associated bone sarcomas are typically high-grade and are predominantly osteosarcomas; fibrosarcomas, undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcomas of bone (previously termed malignant fibrous histiocytomas of bone), and chondrosarcomas are diagnosed less frequently [<a href="#rid12">12,50,51</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7739.html" rel="external">"Bone sarcomas: Preoperative evaluation, histologic classification, and principles of surgical management", section on 'Histologic classification'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H110695235"><span class="h1">RISK FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>By definition, a radiation-associated sarcoma is an iatrogenic disease that is related to prior radiation exposure. Radiation-associated sarcomas have been reported to occur as early as a few months following completion of radiation therapy (RT), to as long as 54 years later [<a href="#rid52">52</a>]. In most adult series, the average duration between RT and diagnosis of a secondary sarcoma ranges from 7 to 16 years [<a href="#rid10">10,19,28,29,32,35,43,44,52-62</a>]. Among breast cancer survivors, the average latency period for secondary postradiation breast sarcomas is 10 to 11 years, but it is variable and tends to be shorter (four to eight years) for angiosarcomas [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. A secondary angiosarcoma has been reported as early as 14 months following breast irradiation [<a href="#rid63">63</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/811.html" rel="external">"Breast sarcoma: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging", section on 'Radiation exposure in breast cancer survivors'</a>.) </p><p>Among childhood cancer survivors, the duration between RT and secondary sarcoma averages 12 to 13 years in most series, but in some, it is as low as 5.5 years [<a href="#rid12">12,22,25,41,64-66</a>]. </p><p>Sarcomas after a primary diagnosis of retinoblastoma occur on average one year earlier in irradiated patients as compared with nonirradiated patients (12 versus 13 years in one series) [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. In this series, leiomyosarcomas were the most common histology, and the majority were diagnosed 30 or more years after the retinoblastoma treatment. </p><p>A latency period is necessary to differentiate a radiation-associated sarcoma from a primary sarcoma that is unrelated to RT. However, there is no consensus as to the interval to distinguish the two. This subject is discussed in detail below. (See <a class="local">'Latency period'</a> below.)</p><p>The development of radiation-associated sarcoma may be influenced by factors such as dose, age at initial exposure, exposure to chemotherapeutic agents (particularly alkylating agents), and genetic tendency. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H709392528"><span class="h2">Radiation dose and age of exposure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The frequency of a radiation-associated sarcoma increases with the dose of radiation, as the postradiation observation period lengthens, and with younger age at the time RT was administered [<a href="#rid22">22,67-70</a>]. </p><p>Sarcoma appears to be a complication of high-dose therapy, although it can be seen with lower doses (&lt;40 Gy) [<a href="#rid70">70</a>]. To induce a tumor, the radiation dose must be great enough to cause genetic damage but not so great that it kills the cell. This often happens to tissues that are near the edge of the radiation field. Above a certain "curative" dose, cells theoretically lose their proliferative potential along with their carcinogenic capacity. However, there is great uncertainty concerning the risk for radiation-associated carcinogenesis at high doses [<a href="#rid71">71</a>]. While some animal and human data suggest a decrease in secondary sarcomas at very high doses, other data suggest a plateau in risk. A systematic review of epidemiologic studies of the radiation dose-response relationship concluded that there was little evidence that the dose-response curve was nonlinear in the direction of a downturn in risk with higher RT doses, even at organ doses ≥60 Gy [<a href="#rid71">71</a>].</p><p>It is also not known whether newer radiation techniques such as intensity-modulated RT (IMRT; which decreases the volume of normal tissue exposed to high RT doses, but increases the volume exposed to lower doses of irradiation [<a href="#rid72">72,73</a>]) or hypofractionated regimens may influence the risk of a radiation-associated sarcoma. Similarly, the use of partial breast irradiation may help limit this and other toxicities of breast irradiation.

Although findings on plain radiographs can suggest the diagnosis of malignancy by demonstrating cortical bone destruction or a mineralized soft tissue mass, the definition of tumor size and local intraosseous and extraosseous extent is most accurately achieved by cross-sectional imaging, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In a series of 63 cases of radiation-associated sarcoma, the cross-sectional imaging findings of secondary bone sarcomas included a soft tissue mass (96 percent), cortical bone destruction (83 percent), tumor matrix mineralization (48 percent), and a periosteal reaction (38 percent) [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].

Complete surgical resection was an important prognostic factor: None of the eight patients treated with chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy and incomplete tumor resection survived, compared with 12 survivors of the 15 patients who underwent complete resection.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Secondary osteosarcomas of the calvarium and skull base can be particularly challenging. In a series of 16 such patients who were treated at MD Anderson Cancer Center over a 32-year period, the average age at diagnosis was 35 years old, and the median latency period was 12.5 years; the primary tumor was a brain tumor, leukemia, retinoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, or nasal cavity squamous cell cancer [<a href="#rid57">57</a>]. Of the 14 who underwent resection, nine were gross-total (five with histologically confirmed negative margins), and five underwent subtotal resection; all patients received adjuvant chemotherapy.

There are few primary data addressing the benefit of chemotherapy in radiation-associated sarcomas. The contribution of chemotherapy to outcomes was addressed in a retrospective analysis of 80 cases of radiation-associated sarcomas diagnosed and treated from 1975 to 1995; 70 percent were soft tissue sarcomas, and the remainder bone [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. Treatment included surgery alone (n = 28), surgery plus chemotherapy (n = 18), surgery plus RT with or without chemotherapy (n = 13), chemotherapy alone (n = 15), RT alone (n = 1), and no therapy (n = 5). Median survival in the entire cohort was 23 months, and two- and five-year recurrence-free survival rates were 54 and 32 percent. Overall survival was shortest in those patients undergoing chemotherapy alone (median six months), and longest for those who underwent surgery alone (median 42 months). It was intermediate in the patients who underwent surgery plus chemotherapy (median 28 months), but the authors noted a wide variety of different chemotherapy drugs, which were not always given in an optimal manner, and limited by performance status.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H185408284"><span class="h4">Angiosarcoma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Angiosarcomas unfortunately have a particularly high rate of distant recurrence, including sites such as the lung, liver, bone marrow, and brain. In one report of 95 cases of radiation-associated angiosarcoma following surgery and RT for breast cancer, after a median follow-up of 10.8 years, local recurrences developed in 48 percent of patients, while distant metastases occurred in 27 percent [<a href="#rid60">60</a>]. There are no trials specifically addressing the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast sarcomas, including radiation-associated angiosarcomas. Results from retrospective series are mixed, and as a result, it is difficult to conclude from any of these series that adjuvant chemotherapy is definitely beneficial.</p><p>Nevertheless, at some institutions, patients with high-risk sarcomas, such as large, high-grade secondary angiosarcomas, have been offered adjuvant chemotherapy if they have a good functional status.

Although the use of radiation therapy (RT) increases the risk of sarcoma compared with no irradiation, the absolute risk is low overall (1 percent or less). Children are more susceptible to radiation-associated sarcoma than are adults. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology and histologic distribution'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Common histologies </strong>– Most postradiation soft tissue sarcomas are high grade, and they can be of a variety of histologies, the most common of which are undifferentiated/unclassified soft tissue sarcoma (formerly called malignant fibrous histiocytoma [MFH] or undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma [UPS]), angiosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma. The most common sarcoma to occur after RT for breast cancer is angiosarcoma. In series that report them, radiation-associated bone sarcomas account for approximately 20 to 30 percent of radiation-associated sarcomas, and the most common histology is osteosarcoma. (See <a class="local">'Histologic distribution'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk factors</strong> – Radiation-associated sarcomas have been reported to occur as early as a few months following completion of RT, to as long as 54 years. The average latency period in adults ranges from 7 to 16 years; it is shorter for children (5.5 to 12 years) and for angiosarcomas after breast cancer treatment (four to eight years). (See <a class="local">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The development of radiation-associated sarcoma may be influenced by factors such as dose, age at initial exposure, exposure to chemotherapeutic agents (especially alkylating agents), and genetic tendency. (See <a class="local">'Radiation dose and age of exposure'</a> above and <a class="local">'Potential effect modifiers'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical presentation</strong> – In general, radiation-related sarcomas present in a manner that is similar to sporadic primary sarcomas of the bone or soft tissue. However, the diagnosis is often delayed, in part because radiation-associated sarcomas may be more difficult to identify by physical examination because of RT-associated tissue changes. (See <a class="local">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic evaluation</strong> </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Imaging</strong> – Although findings on plain radiographs can suggest the diagnosis of malignancy by demonstrating cortical bone destruction or a mineralized soft tissue mass, the definition of tumor size and local intraosseous and extraosseous extent is most accurately achieved by cross-sectional imaging, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (See <a class="local">'Imaging evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Biopsy</strong> – Examination of tissue is required to establish the diagnosis of a soft tissue or bone sarcoma. The diagnostic biopsy must be carefully planned to ensure that adequate tissue is obtained in a manner that does not compromise definitive therapy. Core needle biopsy is considered the preferred method to achieve an initial biopsy in most cases. (See <a class="local">'Biopsy'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Radiation-associated and sporadic sarcoma</strong> – There are no specific molecular or pathologic markers to guide distinction between radiation-associated and sporadic sarcomas in the radiation field. The presumptive diagnosis of a sarcoma as radiation associated and not sporadic is made on the basis of the following criteria (see <a class="local">'Radiation-associated versus sporadic sarcoma'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>RT must have been given previously, with the sarcoma arising in the area included within the 5 percent isodose line of the radiated field.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The histologic features of the original lesion and the postradiation sarcoma should be different.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients with inherited syndromes that predispose to sarcomas even in the absence of RT, such as Li-Fraumeni or Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, should be excluded.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Initially, the minimal latency period (the time period in years between the initiation of RT and the histologic diagnosis of the second neoplasm) was suggested to be over five years, but subsequently, shorter time frames (at least three years) have been thought to be adequate. (See <a class="local">'Latency period'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Staging work-up</strong> – The lung is the predominant site of metastases for both soft tissue and bone sarcomas, whether primary or radiation-associated. CT of the chest is typically performed to detect pulmonary metastases in patients with either a soft tissue or bone sarcoma. Positron emission tomography (PET) or bone scan is recommended for patients with bone sarcoma. (See <a class="local">'Staging workup'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prognosis and treatment</strong> – The prognosis of patients with radiation-associated sarcomas is poorer than that of patients with primary sarcomas. However, aggressive management is warranted because secondary sarcomas are potentially curable. (See <a class="local">'Prognosis and treatment'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Surgical resection</strong> – The main treatment is surgery with wide local excision. Outcomes are best if a wide surgical margin can be achieved. (See <a class="local">'Local treatment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Reirradiation</strong> – There are very few literature reports of reirradiation for sarcoma arising in a previously irradiated field. In general, the benefits of reirradiation must be balanced against the risks of retreatment. (See <a class="local">'Reirradiation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Chemotherapy </strong>–<strong> </strong>Radiation-associated bone sarcomas are generally treated with chemotherapy in addition to surgery, as are primary tumors of bone. In addition, systemic chemotherapy is a routine component of treatment for several soft tissue sarcomas that occur predominantly in children (ie, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma), although these soft tissue sarcoma subtypes are particularly rare as radiation-associated sarcomas. (See <a class="local">'Role of chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">As is the case with primary soft tissue sarcomas, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy for the more common adult subtypes of radiation-associated soft tissue sarcoma (such as UPS, synovial sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, angiosarcoma) remains uncertain, and this approach cannot be adopted as a standard treatment, especially since patients may have received prior chemotherapy. Decisions about chemotherapy must be individualized.
