         Pelvic pain most often involves the gastrointestinal or the urinary systems in prepubertal girls. However, gynecologic conditions become more prevalent as etiologies for pelvic pain, especially during late adolescence. The gynecologic causes of acute pelvic pain in adolescent females are listed in the table  (

         Important nongynecologic causes of acute pelvic pain include appendicitis, kidney stones, and urinary tract infection. (See

         Complications of pregnancy (eg, ectopic pregnancy, acute abruption, uterine rupture) comprise the most frequent life-threatening gynecologic causes of pelvic pain in adolescent females. Gastrointestinal causes of pelvic pain can be life-threatening if they lead to peritonitis and sepsis. Of these, appendicitis is most common and will be presented briefly here. Other conditions (eg, abscess, bowel obstruction) are reviewed separately. (See

         Life-threatening pelvic trauma in female adolescents is usually the result of a high-energy mechanism, such as a fall from a height or motor vehicle crash. Injury patterns and management are similar to the approach in adults and are discussed elsewhere. (See

         Patients usually present with vaginal bleeding and crampy pelvic pain approximately six to eight weeks after the last menstrual period although later presentation is possible, especially if the pregnancy is not in the fallopian tube. Incidence is increased in those with a prior history of ectopic pregnancy, tubal surgery, and pelvic infection, along with those who use an intrauterine device for contraception.
         <strong>
         </strong>
         Rupture may initially bring temporary relief of pain; however, massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage may ensue with high maternal mortality soon after rupture. (See

         An acute, clinical abruption classically presents with vaginal bleeding, abdominal and/or back pain, and uterine contractions. Peak incidence is between the 24

         week of gestation although placental abruption may occur at any time. The contractions are usually high frequency and low amplitude, but a mild to moderate contraction pattern is also possible. In the presence of a severe abruption (≥50 percent placental separation), both fetal and maternal compromise may occur. Acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) develops because blood is exposed to large amounts of tissue factor over a brief period of time. This exposure leads to massive generation of thrombin, resulting in the acute triggering of coagulation. The clinical consequence is a profound systemic bleeding diathesis in the mother and due to widespread intravascular fibrin deposition, tissue ischemic injury, and a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.

         Signs and symptoms of uterine rupture can include nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracing or fetal death, uterine tenderness, peritoneal irritation, vaginal bleeding, loss of fetal station, and shock. Most uterine ruptures occur in laboring women with a prior cesarean delivery or prior uterine surgery. Rupture of the unscarred uterus during labor is rare. (See

         Acute appendicitis is the most common cause for emergency abdominal surgery in children; incidence increases with age and peaks in adolescence. Initial periumbilical pain, which later localizes to the area of peritoneal irritation, usually the right lower quadrant, followed by fever, vomiting, and anorexia is the most common presentation. Obstruction of the appendiceal lumen can lead to thrombosis, necrosis, and if untreated, perforation. Complications involve ileus, abscess formation, intestinal obstruction, peritonitis, sepsis, and shock. (See

         Ovarian torsion refers to twisting of the adnexa upon its pedicle and typically presents with an acute onset of sharp, intermittent abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting. Formation of ovarian cysts may predispose to torsion, and therefore, torsion has a higher incidence in adolescents than prepubertal girls. This condition requires prompt surgical intervention to prevent necrosis and loss of the ovary. Although typically not life-threatening, ovarian torsion does present a significant risk to the viability of the ovary. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3305.html" rel="external">
          "Ovarian and fallopian tube torsion", section on 'Clinical presentation'

         There have been a number of case reports of fallopian tube torsion in both pre- and postmenarchal females [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-8
         </a>
         ]. Fallopian tube torsion appears to present in a similar manner as ovarian torsion, but with normal imaging of the ovary itself with discovery of the condition during surgical exploration. As with ovarian torsion, prompt consideration of this diagnosis and surgical detorsion may prevent irreversible ischemic damage. (See

         Dysmenorrhea is the most common gynecologic cause of pelvic pain during adolescence. Pelvic inflammatory disease and mittelschmerz are also frequent. Urinary tract infections (cystitis, pyelonephritis) are very common causes of lower abdominal pain. Nephrolithiasis is an increasingly common cause of pelvic pain in adolescents. Other common urologic etiologies (eg, urinary tract infection) as well as gastrointestinal conditions (eg, constipation, gastrointestinal infection, functional abdominal pain) are discussed separately.

         usually crampy and intermittent. Nausea, vomiting,
         <strong>
         </strong>
         diarrhea, headache, dizziness, or back pain may accompany the crampy abdominal pain. The pain and associated symptoms typically begin several hours prior to the onset
         <strong>
         </strong>
         of menstruation and continue for one to three days. The severity of the disorder can be categorized by a grading system based upon the degree of menstrual pain, presence of systemic symptoms, and impact on daily activities  (

         This ovulatory event causes recurrent midcycle pain in females with regular ovulatory cycles. This pain is caused by normal follicular enlargement just prior to ovulation or to normal follicular bleeding at ovulation. The pain is typically mild and unilateral; it occurs midway between menstrual periods and lasts for a few hours to a couple of days. (See

         Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is most commonly caused by
         <em>

         and
         <em>

        </p>
        <p>
         Lower abdominal pain is the cardinal presenting symptom in adolescents with PID, although the character of the pain may be quite subtle. The recent onset of pain that worsens during coitus or with jarring movement may be the only presenting symptom of PID; the onset of pain during or shortly after menses is particularly suggestive. About half of patients with PID have fever. On pelvic examination, the findings of a purulent endocervical discharge and/or acute cervical motion and adnexal tenderness with bimanual examination are strongly suggestive of the diagnosis. Additional nonspecific symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, dysmenorrhea, vaginal discharge, or gastrointestinal symptoms. (See

         In a postmenarchal female, an ovarian cyst that ruptures can cause sudden, severe, unilateral pelvic pain without fever or any gastrointestinal, urinary, or vaginal symptoms. Historically, they occur preceding a menstrual period. The pain often begins during strenuous physical activity, such as exercise or sexual intercourse. Blood from the rupture site may seep into the ovary, which can cause pain from stretching of the ovarian cortex, or it may flow into the abdomen, which has an irritant effect on the peritoneum. Significant hemorrhage leading to shock is rare. (See

         <strong>

         to the lower abdomen and groin regions. The pain is usually colicky and causes the patient to writhe about because they are unable to find a position of comfort. Nausea, vomiting, and urinary symptoms (dysuria and urgency) may accompany the pain. The diagnosis of kidney stones is initially suspected by the presentation and clinical evaluation (including urinalysis). It is confirmed by the detection of a stone on imaging studies or by retrieval of a passed stone. (See

          Pregnancy
         </strong>
         – Intrauterine pregnancy is the most common diagnosis for the presentation of secondary amenorrhea. Other common symptoms include morning sickness, breast tenderness, urinary frequency, weight gain, fatigue, and abdominal pain. Pelvic pain is an uncommon primary presenting symptom for pregnancy, although round ligament pain, pubic symphysis separation, or pelvic girdle pain (sacroiliac joint pain) is relatively common. Care must be taken not to miss other causes of pelvic pain (eg, appendicitis, ovarian torsion) in pregnant females. (See

         – Abortion is the outcome of at least 20 percent of all pregnancies, presenting with crampy pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, and passage of some or all of the products of conception. In the face of a nonsterile abortive procedure or incomplete evacuation of all fetal and placental tissue, sepsis may develop. Clinical findings of a septic abortion include fever, diffuse pelvic pain, and malodorous vaginal discharge. Complications, such as septic shock and rarely, pelvic thrombophlebitis, can occur. (See

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Germ cell tumors are the most common histologically, and the most common of these is the dermoid cyst, or mature cystic teratoma, a benign neoplastic cyst. These tumors contain ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal tissue (ie, hair, bone, teeth, brain, adipose tissue, skin, etc). They can present with dull abdominal pain or a mass, but they are frequently asymptomatic and found incidentally on imaging due to calcification or increased echogenicity. They may be bilateral in 10-15% percent of adolescents. They may also increase the risk of ovarian torsion, and approximately 1 to 3 percent can rupture. (See

         The first goal of the evaluation of the adolescent female with acute pelvic pain is to identify life-threatening conditions that require emergent interventions. Once this has been accomplished, other causes of pelvic pain can often be identified through deliberate evaluation with careful attention to the clinical features of the illness (eg, the pain characteristics, sexual history, presence of pregnancy, related symptoms, physical findings, and selected diagnostic studies)  (

          Pregnancy test
         </strong>
         – Urine pregnancy testing must be done in a menstruating adolescent and may also be appropriate in the ostensibly premenstrual girl in the face of an ambiguous history or clinical picture. Urine beta human chorionic gonadotropin testing is rapid and sensitive for detecting early pregnancy. If the patient is pregnant, quantitative beta hCG testing and Rh(D) typing may be indicated and the status of the pregnancy should be determined (eg, ectopic, intrauterine, threatened abortion). It is important to keep in mind that a positive pregnancy test does not exclude a nongynecologic cause of pelvic pain. (See

         Ultrasound is the preferred initial method for evaluating pelvic pathology [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,23,24
         </a>
         ]. The ultrasound examination is usually initiated transabdominally. The bladder does not have to be full; however, if the ovaries cannot be visualized, it may be necessary to have the patient fill her bladder to a comfortable capacity. This is especially important for those teenagers who have never had sexual intercourse or are unable to tolerate placement of a transvaginal ultrasound probe. Often in these cases, the entire examination can be performed transabdominally. Transabdominal scanning is important for evaluating the upper pelvis and abdomen, and can detect appendicitis, in some cases, nephrolithiasis, ovarian cysts, tumors, and tuboovarian abscess. Doppler flow studies can assist in the urgent diagnosis of ovarian torsion, although a normal study may not rule it out. (See

         Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis may be helpful in patients in whom diagnostic uncertainty persists after laboratory and ultrasound evaluation, especially those in whom nephrolithiasis or appendicitis is suspected. Contrast should

         Laparoscopy is sometimes indicated in the evaluation of acute pelvic pain, especially when the diagnosis is not clear after less invasive evaluations and the differential diagnoses include potentially life-threatening or organ-threatening disorders. Examples are appendicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, ovarian and tubal torsion. Laparoscopy also has a role in the treatment of many surgical disorders. On the other hand, most adolescent females with acute pelvic pain, normal imaging and laboratory studies, and a normal physical examination (including absence of vaginal/cervical discharge and abnormal uterine bleeding) will improve without need for intervention.

          Evaluation
         </strong>
         – Pain characteristics, associated symptoms, menstrual status, and sexual history help to differentiate among the various gynecologic causes of pelvic pain in the adolescent female. (See

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The adolescent female with pelvic pain warrants a complete examination with particular focus on vital signs and examination of the abdomen, pelvis, and genitalia. Hemodynamically unstable patients require resuscitation of shock prior to a comprehensive physical examination  (

          algorithm 2
