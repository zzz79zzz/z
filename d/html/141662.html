As such, patients with gross hematuria should be evaluated and managed in a systematic fashion. Isolated hematuria rarely represents a true emergency unless non-glomerular hematuria is so brisk that it results in significant or symptomatic anemia or clots obstruct the ureter(s) or bladder outflow (ie, urethra). Regardless of the severity of bleeding or the underlying cause, the appearance of gross hematuria is often distressing to patients and caregivers. Every adult with gross hematuria, whether a single or multiple episodes, and no evidence of glomerular disease, infection, or urethral trauma (eg, post-catheter insertion) ultimately requires urologic evaluation, which will include cystoscopy and cross-sectional imaging of the kidneys and ureters. </p><p>This topic discusses the management of atraumatic gross hematuria in adults  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef143665" href="/z/d/graphic/143665.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).

In a male patient, the presence of clots confirms hematuria (clots can be from menstruation in a female patient). Glomerular bleeding does not form clots or cause bladder outflow obstruction  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65786" href="/z/d/graphic/65786.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The diagnosis of gross hematuria is discussed separately.

Symptomatic blood loss is typically secondary to chronic bleeding from a urinary system malignancy, radiation cystitis, benign prostatic hypertrophy, or a renal arteriovenous malformation. It is seldom caused by an acute process, such as a ureteroarterial fistula from ureteral stent erosion into an iliac artery. Management of clinically significant anemia typically requires the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Establish intravenous (IV) access</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Obtain laboratory studies (complete blood count, serum chemistries, coagulation studies, and ABO/RhD typing)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Administer blood products (eg, red blood cells, platelets) and/or anticoagulation reversal agents (eg, prothrombin complex concentrate) as indicated (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7948.html" rel="external">"Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for RBC transfusion in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7931.html" rel="external">"Massive blood transfusion"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1367.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult with a suspected bleeding disorder", section on 'Actively bleeding patient'</a>)</p><p></p><p>A patient with hypotension or signs of shock with gross hematuria from suspected cystitis or a ureteral stone (which are common causes of gross hematuria) should be evaluated for infection and/or sepsis since these rarely cause clinically significant blood loss.

A patient with AUR typically has considerable lower abdominal and/or suprapubic pain and may be in distress from pain and urinary urgency. Examination may reveal abdominal or suprapubic tenderness or firmness from a distended and palpable urinary bladder. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6883.html" rel="external">"Acute urinary retention", section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>AUR can be diagnosed by measuring bladder volume with either a bladder scan or point-of-care ultrasound. A bladder volume ≥300 mL suggests AUR and warrants decompression with a urinary catheter. If the patient is in discomfort and unable to void (regardless of the estimated volume) or if a bladder scan and ultrasound are not available, a urinary catheter should be placed, and the initial volume of drainage used to establish the diagnosis of AUR. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6883.html" rel="external">"Acute urinary retention", section on 'Prompt diagnosis of retention'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4111373419"><span class="h1">PATIENT WITH BLADDER OUTFLOW OBSTRUCTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In a patient with acute urinary retention (AUR) from gross hematuria and blood clots, management focuses on relieving the urinary obstruction, removing existing clots, and preventing the formation of new clots. These steps represent distinct interventions that are often combined, which can lead to treatment failures or complications. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1307747039"><span class="h2">Place a urinary bladder catheter</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Promptly placing a urinary bladder catheter is critical since AUR can be quite painful, distressing, and can result in acute kidney injury or bladder perforation. For a patient with AUR in the setting of gross hematuria, we place a large bore (22 Fr or greater) urethral catheter. The only absolute contraindication to the placement of a urethral catheter is the presence of urethral injury, which is typically associated with pelvic trauma. Relative contraindications are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8090.html" rel="external">"Placement and management of urinary bladder catheters in adults", section on 'Contraindications'</a>.)</p><p>Insertion of a urinary catheter is generally a safe procedure. In a patient with recent urologic surgery that may have affected the integrity of the urethra (eg, prostatectomy, urethroplasty, or neo-bladder), we recommend consulting a urologist before attempting placement. </p><p>In a male patient, we instill <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/z/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a> 2 percent jelly ("Urojet") 5 to 30 mL directly into the urethra to decrease patient discomfort, dilate the urethra, and facilitate catheter placement. </p><p>Catheters with large lumens (≥ 20 Fr) permit more successful and effective manual clot irrigation. Smaller catheters can be used but have a higher likelihood of being obstructed by blood clots. Any catheter type can be placed for the initial bladder decompression and manual irrigation, but unless the catheter has three lumens, it will need to be replaced if continuous bladder irrigation (CBI) is required. Thus, the benefits of a catheter with less than three lumens (eg, larger lumen) have to be balanced against the increased patient discomfort and risk of local trauma and complications with repeated catheter placements or placement attempts. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8095.html" rel="external">"Complications of urinary bladder catheters and preventive strategies", section on 'Urethral catheters'</a>.)</p><p>The following factors impact our choice of the catheter we place for manual irrigation (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8090.html" rel="external">"Placement and management of urinary bladder catheters in adults", section on 'Specialized catheters'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Suspected clots in the bladder – We prefer a red rubber Robinson catheter since it does not have a balloon or outflow channel and has a larger lumen, permitting removal of larger clots. Most experts consider the red rubber catheter as ideal for hematuria irrigation, but other catheters may be used because of circumstances and available equipment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Desire to avoid repeat urethral catheterization – We prefer a triple-lumen (ie, three-way) catheter since this can also be used for CBI. Upon insertion, apply a catheter plug (or the sterile cap of a 60cc catheter tip syringe) to block the smaller irrigation port.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Enlarged prostate – A Coudé (ie, bent) catheter may be helpful since it has a curved tip that facilitates placement. </p><p></p><p>The catheter placement procedure is described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8090.html" rel="external">"Placement and management of urinary bladder catheters in adults", section on 'Transurethral catheter placement'</a>.)</p><p>Catheter insertion should be aborted during placement if significant resistance is encountered, the patient complains of pain, or new bleeding at the meatus develops. If the catheter is inserted to the flared portion (ie, hub) and no urine is obtained, an assistant can be asked to apply gentle pressure to the suprapubic region, which may initiate urine flow. Gentle irrigation through the end of the catheter using 10 to 20 mL sterile <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> may displace a clot and also initiate urine flow. Do not inflate the balloon (if present) unless placement is confirmed by return of urine or point-of-care ultrasound. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8090.html" rel="external">"Placement and management of urinary bladder catheters in adults", section on 'Troubleshooting urethral catheter placement'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3887351314"><span class="h2">Role of intravesicular tranexamic acid</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Topical (intravesicular) <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10011" href="/z/d/drug information/10011.html" rel="external">tranexamic acid</a> (TXA) may help control hematuria. A trial that included 50 patients with hematuria found that instilling TXA 500 mg into the bladder for 15 minutes prior to bladder irrigation decreased the volume of required irrigation fluid but did not affect degree of blood loss [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. A retrospective before-and-after study that included 159 patients found that instilling TXA 1 gram into the bladder for 15 minutes prior to bladder irrigation was associated with shorter emergency department length of stay, duration of urinary catheter, and fewer return visits [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Although these findings are promising, further research is needed before we can recommend routine use of topical TXA for hematuria. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2279757109"><span class="h2">Perform manual irrigation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>After the urinary catheter is placed, we perform manual irrigation to remove all existing clots from the bladder [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The steps are as follows: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Confirm that the catheter is in the bladder (typically observing return of urine). Point-of-care-ultrasound may be used to confirm that the catheter is in the bladder and/or quantify the amount of clot prior to initiating the procedure.

In a patient without residual hematuria and clots following manual irrigation, further bladder irrigation is not required. Catheter care and further evaluation are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'After-care and follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p>Some clots may be refractory to standard irrigation techniques. We define a failure of manual irrigation as the continued presence of clots or frank blood after irrigation with at least one liter. However, evidence does not exist to support an exact volume of irrigation fluid to employ before deciding that manual irrigation has failed. In a patient with failed manual irrigation, we recommend consulting a urologist. They may recommend or place a specialized "hematuria catheter," perform manual irrigation or CBI, request bladder imaging to assess clot burden, request reversal of anticoagulation (if present and not contraindicated), consult interventional radiology, or perform cystoscopy for bladder irrigation and fulguration of bleeding points.

In a male patient, the presence of clots confirms hematuria (clots can be from menstruation in a female patient). A patient with suspected gross hematuria (ie, presence of red or brown urine) should have the hematuria confirmed by microscopic analysis of a fresh, centrifuged urine specimen to exclude hematuria mimics  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef55923" href="/z/d/graphic/55923.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63501" href="/z/d/graphic/63501.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).
