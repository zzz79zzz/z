         The number of adults living with congenital heart disease (CHD) has increased steadily due to advances in diagnosis and management of these conditions in children [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. Some patients present as adults with CHD requiring surgical correction due to failure to detect a mild lesion in childhood or lack of resources for repair in some geographic regions. Also, adults with known CHD who had surgical procedures during infancy and childhood often require reoperation for management of residual lesions after a previous repair or for further palliation after previous palliative surgery.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic reviews general anesthetic management of adult patients presenting for surgical repair of CHD defects [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Management for adults undergoing primary surgical repair or reoperations for specific congenital lesions is discussed separately. (See

         An important aspect of the preanesthesia consultation is to ensure understanding and appropriate management of clinically relevant cardiac and noncardiac sequelae of the specific congenital heart disease (CHD) lesion [

         General considerations for preanesthetic consultation before cardiac surgery are described separately. (See

         The preanesthesia consultation includes a thorough review of the patient’s diagnosis, complications, cardiac surgical and catheter-based interventional history, current physiology, recent imaging studies (eg, cardiac catheterization, echocardiography, chest computed tomography), and laboratory data  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef126173" href="/z/d/graphic/126173.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Risk stratification of adults with CHD undergoing cardiac surgery depends on several factors including the complexity of the lesion, physiological status, concurrent conditions and risk factors, and the planned surgical procedure  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef126173" href="/z/d/graphic/126173.html" rel="external">

         <a href="#rid8">
          8-10
         </a>
         ]. Mortality risk is determined by patient-specific factors (eg, univentricular physiology, cyanosis, presence of genetic syndrome, PH, arrhythmias, acute infective endocarditis, subaortic atrioventricular valve regurgitation, ventricular dysfunction, ischemic coronary disease, presence of aortic aneurysm), as well as overall CHD complexity and surgical repair options risk [
         <a href="#rid7">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Few studies have examined risk-scoring systems for adults with CHD undergoing cardiac surgery. The existing risk scores have been validated in the pediatric population but not in adults. Several groups have attempted to derive risk scores to predict in-hospital mortality in adults undergoing congenital heart surgery.

         A US study looked at mortality associated with procedural groups based upon 12,513 procedures performed at 116 centers and found that the highest risk of operative mortality was associated with Fontan revision, followed by heart and lung transplants [

         A European study of patients &gt;16 years old undergoing 1782 congenital heart surgery procedures developed a score predictive of in-hospital mortality. Worse outcomes were associated with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III/IV, urgent surgery, more than two sternotomies, active endocarditis, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;60, extremely high or low hemoglobin values, and high perioperative adult congenital heart surgery (PEACH) score (ie, in-hospital mortality following cardiac surgery in patients with a score &gt;3 was 17.2 percent [

         A risk model for death within four years after surgery for adult CHD was developed in a prospective cohort of 602 patients with moderate/complex ACHD treated at a tertiary care center clinic in the Netherlands. The model was validated in a retrospective cohort of 402 ACHD patients treated in the Czech Republic. Variables including age, congenital diagnosis, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, current medications, body mass index, N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide, and need for revision after initial corrective surgery [

          16

         Heart failure (HF) – Left, right, or biventricular HF may be present in patients with long-standing CHD due to volume and/or pressure overload of one or both ventricles. In patients with HF, left and right ventricular ejection fractions may be reduced or preserved. Volume overload typically occurs due to uncorrected or residual shunts or cardiac valve incompetence. Pressure overload typically occurs due to residual outflow tract obstruction. Many patients with CHD have combined volume and pressure overload. Furthermore, myocardial damage may have occurred in patients who had a previous cardiac surgical repair due to prolonged duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with poor myocardial preservation, or because of a large incisional scar or previous ventriculotomy [
         <a href="#rid17">

         </span>
         Right-sided HF – Patients with right-sided HF may have coexisting pulmonary hypertension (PH). The presence of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is associated with progressive right ventricular (RV) dysfunction; TR may occur due to a congenital tricuspid valve abnormality, or as a result of RV dilation or dysfunction [
         <a href="#rid2">

         Anesthetic management goals include maintaining preload in an optimal range while avoiding fluid overload, and maximizing RV oxygen supply (ie, RV perfusion and subendocardial blood flow), while minimizing RV oxygen demand (ie, RV afterload, tachycardia) [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Since the failing RV is exquisitely afterload sensitive, a key goal is to maintain pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) as low as possible to maintain forward flow. Factors that increase baseline pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) are avoided (eg, hypoxemia, hypercarbia, acidosis). The figure shows various factors during anesthesia and surgery that can precipitate RV failure with rapid hemodynamic decompensation  (

         Left-sided HF – Management of failure of the systemic left ventricle in adults with CHD is similar to management of left-sided HF due to other causes. The limited available evidence on medical therapy for systemic right ventricles is inconclusive [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Patients with single-ventricle physiology or an RV functioning as the systemic ventricle have a high incidence of myocardial dysfunction with progressive HF. Examples include patients born with a hypoplastic left ventricle, those with levo-transposition of the great arteries (L-TGA), or dextro-TGA (D-TGA) with a Senning or Mustard atrial switch repair in childhood [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. In such patients, management of RV failure chronically and in the perioperative period is particularly challenging. Diastolic dysfunction is common, often with preserved systolic function, and high filling pressures may be required to maintain oxygenation and cardiac output. (See

Patients with PH and congenital heart disease (PH-CHD) are predominantly classified in group 1 (precapillary or pulmonary arterial hypertension [PAH]), but some are in group 2 (due to left heart disease), group 3 (due to lung disease and/or hypoxia), group 4 (chronic thromboembolic PH), or group 5 (unclear or multifactorial mechanisms)  (

         Arrhythmias – The patient’s history of cardiac arrhythmias and current electrocardiogram (ECG) should be reviewed. Both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias are common in adults with unrepaired or palliated CHD defects, particularly in those who had late intracardiac repairs [

         Atrial arrhythmias – During the perioperative period, supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVT) are most common, particularly intra-atrial reentrant tachycardia (IART) that originates from the right atrium and is paroxysmal in nature. The incidence of supraventricular arrhythmias is highest in patients who have had a Mustard, Senning, or Fontan procedure, and in those who presented for ASD closure later in life. These defects are associated with increased right atrial volumes [

         Hyperviscosity with stasis due to erythrocytosis – Some patients with cyanotic CHD develop secondary erythrocytosis due to chronic hypoxemia causing overproduction of erythropoietin, in order to maintain oxygen delivery despite low blood oxygen saturation [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,29

         ]. This leads to hyperviscosity with slow flow and stasis in arterioles and capillaries, and impaired tissue perfusion. Clinical manifestations of hyperviscosity include headache and fatigue and increased risk of thrombotic events such as stroke. Volume depletion can exacerbate hyperviscosity; thus, volume repletion is first-line therapy in patients with cyanotic heart disease and hyperviscosity symptoms. (See

         Patients are questioned about nonspecific symptoms of poor tissue perfusion (eg, fatigue, headache, and vision changes) during the preoperative workup. Coagulation studies are typically performed. However, an important caveat for preoperative coagulation testing is that increased red cell mass reduces the plasma volume contained in a given volume of whole blood in patients with erythrocytosis; thus, the coagulation laboratory should be contacted for instructions on proper specimen collection to appropriately adjust the amount of anticoagulant. Otherwise, test results will show elevated prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), falsely suggesting a diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). (See

         Preparations must be made to avoid systemic air embolism if intracardiac and/or extracardiac shunts may be present. For this reason, each intravenous (IV) line must be meticulously flushed to remove all air bubbles and avoid the possibility of systemic air embolism. Also, air filters are used in all IV infusion lines. During administration of any IV medication, introduction of new bubbles is avoided by first attaching the syringe containing the medication to the IV line, then aspirating fluid from the line into that syringe to remove any bubbles in its hub or the attachment port. Only then is the medication administered. (See

         In addition to standard American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) monitors, before induction of anesthesia, multifunction external pacing/defibrillation/cardioversion pads attached to an external defibrillator with pacing capability are placed on most patients with CHD. This is particularly important for those undergoing redo sternotomy due to the high risk of arrhythmias leading to hemodynamic instability during sternotomy and subsequent surgical dissection. (See

         An intra-arterial catheter is inserted prior to induction so that hemodynamic changes during and immediately after induction may be immediately identified and treated. This is particularly important in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) or poor ventricular function. (See

         Notably, the anatomy of the patient’s original cardiovascular defect or previous palliative procedures may affect site selection for arterial catheter insertion. For example, patients with a previous classic Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt have an end-to-side anastomosis of the subclavian artery to the pulmonary artery (PA)  (

         Following induction, a large central venous introducer sheath is inserted, which allows for administration of large volumes of blood and crystalloid if necessary, as well as infusion of vasoactive agents, and monitoring of central venous pressure (CVP). Again, it is important to understand the patient’s cardiovascular anatomy and to be aware of previous palliative procedures that may alter plans for central venous catheter (CVC) insertion and subsequent monitoring [

         Patients who have had multiple previous procedures or history of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may have ligated or permanently thrombosed central vessels, so cautious insertion of any central venous catheter is accomplished with ultrasound guidance after confirmation of vessel patency. Note that in patients with Glenn or Fontan shunts, the CVP value actually reflects the mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). In addition, patients with single ventricle physiology with a Glenn shunt or Fontan circulation are at risk for thrombotic complications and have a high risk for thrombosis of any indwelling central catheter.

         If anxiolytics are administered shortly before induction, only small carefully titrated doses are employed (eg,

        </p>
        <p>
         Selection of anesthetic induction agents is based on the expected hemodynamic effects of each anesthetic agent, the hemodynamic goals for the patient's specific CHD lesion (ie, maintaining a balance between systemic and pulmonary blood flow), and the presence of ventricular dysfunction. The choice of anesthetic induction and maintenance agents is not as important as maintaining hemodynamic stability in the individual patient with a specific congenital cardiac lesion  (

          table 4
         </a>
         ). There is no evidence supporting use of any individual IV or volatile anesthetic agent in patients with CHD. However, any agent with myocardial depressant effects (eg,

          "Anesthesia for adults with congenital heart disease undergoing noncardiac surgery", section on 'Choice of induction agent'
         </a>
         ). Patients are encouraged to hyperventilate with 100 percent oxygen during induction, and respiratory depressants (such as opiates) are best avoided. Patients should be deeply anesthetized prior to laryngoscopy to prevent excessive sympathetic stimulation. Once controlled ventilation is established, elevated peak airway pressures and high tidal volumes are avoided, as these settings may decrease venous return and/or increase PVR thereby worsening right-to-left shunting and cyanosis. Inspired concentration of oxygen should be quickly adjusted to maintain the patient's baseline oxygen saturation, as significant deviation from baseline affects PVR and pulmonary blood flow.

         Maintenance of anesthesia is usually accomplished with a carefully titrated potent volatile inhalation agent, supplemented with judicious doses of an opioid and a neuromuscular blocking agent. (See

          Hemodynamic management
         </strong>
         – General hemodynamic goals are to maintain optimal end organ perfusion and oxygen delivery by maintaining near-normal heart rate (HR), preload, afterload, and contractility, as well as avoiding exacerbation of preexisting PH. Specific hemodynamic goals depend on the underlying pathophysiology of the CHD lesion, as noted in the table  (

          table 4
         </a>
         ), although modifications may be necessary in individual patients. Notably, intraoperative changes in patient positioning, ventilation, blood loss, and administration of anesthetic agents all cause changes in the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and/or PVR that may adversely affect the balance of pulmonary blood flow (Qp) versus systemic blood flow (Qs).

          Assessment of cardiac and noncardiac sequelae
         </strong>
         – Common cardiovascular sequelae in adults with CHD include heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and arrhythmias. Common noncardiac sequelae include pulmonary disorders (eg, restrictive lung disease, respiratory effects of cyanosis), hematologic abnormalities (eg, anemia, hyperviscosity, bleeding or thrombosis), renal dysfunction, and gastrointestinal abnormalities (eg, hepatic dysfunction, protein-losing enteropathy). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Assessment of cardiovascular sequelae'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Intraoperative management approach
         </strong>
         – The anesthetic plan for cardiac surgery in adults with CHD should be individually designed considering patient-specific cardiac anatomy and function, as well as procedure-specific requirements:

         <strong>
          Intravascular access
         </strong>
         – Preparations to avoid systemic air embolism include meticulous flushing to remove all air bubbles and use of air filters for all intravenous (IV) lines. Large-bore IV catheter insertion should also be accomplished prior to induction of anesthesia. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Intravascular access'

         <strong>
          Monitoring
         </strong>
         – Invasive cardiovascular monitors include an intra-arterial catheter inserted prior to anesthetic induction, and a large central venous introducer sheath that allows for administration of large fluid volumes and monitoring of central venous pressure (CVP), as well as a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe inserted after induction. Many centers also employ neurological monitoring with near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Anesthetic induction and maintenance
         </strong>
         – Selection of anesthetic induction agents is based on the expected hemodynamic effects of each anesthetic agent, the hemodynamic goals for the patient's specific CHD lesion (ie, maintaining a balance between systemic and pulmonary blood flow), and the presence of ventricular dysfunction. The choice of anesthetic induction and maintenance agents is not as important as maintaining hemodynamic stability in the individual patient with a specific congenital cardiac lesion  (

          Management of intraoperative problems

          Postoperative management
