Lower extremity chronic ulcers predominate with individuals with diabetes and those over 65 particularly affected [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. </p><p>Chronic wounds are commonly related to the same comorbidities that increase the risk for death from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly contagious and spreads through human-to-human transmissions with a relatively long incubation period (median time of six days) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. During the incubation period, asymptomatic carriers can infect others [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Thus, during the care of patients with wounds, observing proper precautions is important to reduce the risk in this susceptible population. The task of protecting both high-risk patients and health care providers by minimizing exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is essential. </p><p>The spread of COVID-19 rapidly progressed to become a pandemic event, causing major disruption in health care services, including the care of patients with wounds [<a href="#rid7">7-10</a>]. Out of necessity, the delivery of wound care, which should be regarded as an essential medical service, shifted [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. The major goals of wound care during this time have been to prevent serious wound complications to minimize hospitalization and surgery, when possible, rather than necessarily to complete wound healing. </p><p>The impact of COVID-19 on the care of patients who require wound care is reviewed. Other issues relevant to these patients pertaining to COVID-19 are reviewed separately.

Acute wounds in those who do not have risk factors for nonhealing generally resolve through defined stages of healing with basic wound care.

patients</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H789632641"><span class="h3">Risk for COVID-19 in patients with chronic wounds</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A nonhealing wound is often a culmination of multiple underlying medical problems. Most patients with chronic wounds have multiple comorbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/128323.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Clinical features", section on 'Risk factors for severe illness'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/112216.html" rel="external">"Risk factors for impaired wound healing and wound complications"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15079.html" rel="external">"Clinical assessment of chronic wounds"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/99040.html" rel="external">"Overview of treatment of chronic wounds"</a>.). </p><p>These same risk factors place many patients with chronic wounds in a high-risk category for developing severe consequences if they become ill with COVID-19  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef127477" href="/d/graphic/127477.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). In a systematic review and meta-analysis of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), malignancy, and chronic kidney disease were among the most common comorbid conditions [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. In another review that analyzed data of 1590 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized patients across mainland China from 575 hospitals, the risk of serious outcomes in patients with COVID-19 was stratified by comorbidity status [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. One-fourth of patients reported had at least one comorbidity, and just under 10 percent had two or more comorbidities. Patients with COPD, diabetes, hypertension, and malignancy were at risk of reaching the composite endpoints, which were admission into the intensive care unit (ICU), utilization of invasive ventilator, or death. Overall, the patients with any comorbidity yielded poorer clinical outcomes than those without. A greater number of comorbidities also correlated with poorer clinical outcomes [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. In addition, delayed wound care results in more infections and hospital admissions, leading to increased amputations.</p><p>Because of this increased risk, efforts to decrease exposure to the virus are of the utmost importance in patients with chronic wounds. In addition to using the standard practices for preventing person-to person transmission (as mandated by governing health agencies), reducing the number of wound care visits, reducing the time interval, and selecting the optimal environment for wound care may help reduce exposure to COVID-19. (See <a class="local">'Frequency of wound care visits'</a> below and <a class="local">'Triaging wound care'</a> below.)</p><p>There is still some risk for transmission of COVID-19 from nurses or physicians, but with the use of personal protective equipment during care in an inpatient or outpatient environment, the risk is less likely. For the patient who requires care in the inpatient or outpatient hospital settings, the patient should wear a mask covering their nose and mouth. If they do not have a mask, one should be provided for them. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127501.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Infection prevention for persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2918426560"><span class="h3">Risk for chronic wounds in COVID-19 patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In addition to the traditional risk factors for developing wounds (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/112216.html" rel="external">"Risk factors for impaired wound healing and wound complications"</a>), SARS-CoV-2 is associated with physiologic changes that may affect healing. Whether these changes promote de novo wound development or further impair healing of chronic wounds in patients infected with COVID-19 is unknown. However, these changes may contribute to the already increased risk for pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury in patients with COVID-19 who require prolonged hospitalization. Pressure-induced injuries have been reported related to prone positioning and face masks [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2884.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and risk assessment of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2885.html" rel="external">"Prevention of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury"</a>.)</p><p>COVID-19-associated vascular skin lesions appear as violaceous macules with "porcelain-like" appearance, or livedo, non-necrotic purpura, necrotic purpura, thrombotic retiform purpura, and chilblain appearance [<a href="#rid19">19-23</a>]. The pathophysiology of these lesions is unclear but may include immune dysregulation, vasculitis, vessel thrombosis, or neoangiogenesis. Severe COVID-19 may define a type of microvascular injury syndrome mediated by activation of complement pathways resulting in the cytokine release including interleukin 6 from the endothelium in severe cases of COVID-19 and an associated procoagulant state. In addition, with downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in association with SARS-CoV-2 infection, accumulation of angiotensin II occurs, leading to vasoconstriction and increased vascular permeability [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Direct thrombogenic effects can also lead to tissue ischemia [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Additional pathways include T cell and type I interferon-driven inflammatory mediators from the mannan-binding lectin pathway activation and humoral-driven immune complex-mediated vasculitic cutaneous reactions with mild and moderate COVID-19 [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>].</p><p>Clinical findings of acro-ischemia such as toe cyanosis, skin bulla, and gangrene with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) were reported during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. In a histopathological study, skin and lung tissue samples taken from five patients with respiratory failure and a purpuric skin rash showed significant deposits of the terminal complement components C5b-9 (membrane attack complex), C4d, and mannose binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine protease (MASP) 2 in the microvasculature, consistent with sustained, systemic activation of the alternative and lectin-based complement pathways [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. The purpuric skin lesions similarly showed a pauci-inflammatory thrombogenic vasculopathy, with deposition of C5b-9 and C4d in both grossly involved and normal-appearing skin demonstrating small-vessel and capillary occlusion. SARS-CoV-2 can infect human cells that express the ACE2 receptor for the spike glycoprotein, creating a hypercoagulable state affecting multiorgan systems, which may explain the atypical cutaneous presentation [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. In support of a hypercoagulable state is the demonstrated increased risk for pulmonary embolism, and amputations secondary to arterial thrombosis [<a href="#rid31">31,32</a>]. Due to the high incidence of thrombosis involving multiple organs, patients who exhibit signs of hypercoagulability are fully anticoagulated. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1370.html" rel="external">"Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and parenteral direct-acting anticoagulants: Dosing and adverse effects"</a>.)</p><p>A variety of other skin lesions/ulcerations are associated with COVID-19 and include more widely distributed manifestations (eg, exanthematous eruptions, vesicular eruptions, urticaria, papulovesicular rashes) and also more focal lesions that can occur in the extremities with relapsing manifestations (eg, livedo reticularis, painful acral papules, pruritic erythematous plaques, petechiae pernio-like lesions) [<a href="#rid33">33-47</a>]. Some of these skin lesions arise before the signs and symptoms more commonly associated with COVID-19 [<a href="#rid35">35,48,49</a>]. These lesions have also been seen in children [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. Most heal spontaneously, and studies have reported no correlation between COVID-19 severity and healing [<a href="#rid51">51,52</a>]. However, the overall immunologic condition of the patient could impair wound healing depending on the severity of the COVID-19 infection. In addition, hypersensitivity reactions may occur with the vaccine. However, these similar reactions are mild, self-limited, and primarily due to type IV delayed dermal hypersensitivity reactions [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127978.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Cutaneous manifestations and issues related to dermatologic care"</a>.)</p><p>Patients admitted to intensive care units requiring multiorgan support are at higher risk of developing pressure injuries due to immobility, sedation, vasopressors, and hypoxia. Skin presentation may appear related to pressure; however, the extent of the skin damage reflects a more involved vascular inflammatory process [<a href="#rid54">54</a>].</p><p>In addition, to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Centers for Disease Control in the United States provided guidance for residents in long-term facilities. Most residents were confined to their room, limiting their mobility [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]. Limited mobility is a risk factor for pressure injury development and loss of musculoskeletal fitness, resulting in secondary consequences such as fall risk and respiratory conditions [<a href="#rid56">56</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2884.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and risk assessment of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3093875088"><span class="h2">Protecting health care workers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Health care workers can expose themselves to SARS-CoV-2 when taking care of patients, including during the care of patients needing chronic wound care [<a href="#rid57">57</a>]. COVID-19 testing was not implemented for routine wound care.</p><p>SARS-CoV-2 is present in respiratory droplets [<a href="#rid58">58,59</a>], but little is known about the shedding of the virus in bodily fluids and associated risks. While SARS-CoV-2 has also been identified in saliva and mucosal secretions, there has been no identification of SARS-CoV-2 in wound tissue or fluid [<a href="#rid58">58,60,61</a>]. </p><p>To prevent person-to-person transmission, home health care workers are mandated to wear a mask and gloves upon entering a patient's residence. Hospital policies may vary across health systems. In the hospital setting, governing policies should be followed. As PPE became more readily available, personnel were fitted with N95 masks with competency in donning and doffing PPE upon entering rooms with patients positive for COVID-19. For managing patients in routine care, face mask covering is required [<a href="#rid62">62</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/130296.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: General approach to infection prevention in the health care setting"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3285051846"><span class="h1">TRIAGING WOUND CARE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Wounds can be treated in a variety of settings. A common model provides care in a dedicated location using an interdisciplinary approach (ie, wound care center). For chronic lower extremity wounds, the need for amputation is reduced when care is undertaken at a dedicated wound center [<a href="#rid63">63-65</a>]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, typical wound care paradigms have been severely affected  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef127043" href="/d/graphic/127043.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). Disruption of wound care centers, which are often closely associated with hospitals, required modifications to the delivery of wound care  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef128955" href="/d/graphic/128955.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). These include alterations in the goals of wound care and a shift in care to other health care environments, with greater emphasis on care in the home environment, which is a lower-risk environment for patients to receive wound care [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Goals of wound care'</a> below.)</p><p>The tremendous stress put on health care systems as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic created the need for triage systems for better resource utilization to overcome obstacles, which have included shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and health care workers and reduced supplies [<a href="#rid66">66,67</a>]. Potentially useful classifications that can be used to triage patients with wounds are briefly reviewed.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2964829748"><span class="h2">Useful classifications</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diabetic foot ulcer (and wounds in general)</strong> – For managing patients with diabetic foot problems, a triaging system was suggested to help inform the best setting in which to treat patients [<a href="#rid68">68</a>]. This system is applicable and can be extended to triaging a variety of wound etiologies and complications with only minor modifications [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Patients with wounds are categorized by wound severity as critical, serious, guarded, or stable (high- to low-priority groups 1 through 4, respectively) to determine the appropriate initial site of care  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef128956" href="/d/graphic/128956.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). Wound priority can be escalated or reduced depending on changes in the patient's condition. Low-priority wounds can be managed in the home by providing additional support to the patient through visiting nurse services with physician oversight through telehealth. Communication between providers can be assisted by using the SINBAD classification [<a href="#rid69">69</a>]. High-priority wounds will require additional services available in the clinic or hospital setting.

A higher clinical stage increases the risk for amputation. The presence of infection and advanced wound grades are the major drivers for higher clinical stage and the need for inpatient care.

However, patients with infected pressure-induced skin or soft tissue injury would classify as Priority 1 as described for the diabetic foot ulcers above. Prevention of pressure-induced injury during prone positioning includes using pressure redistribution surface and positioning devices, repositioning medical devices, and avoiding contract over areas of prior pressure injury [<a href="#rid71">71</a>]. Adequate staffing to reposition the patient helps to avoid friction sheer. Positioning frequency is dependent on the patient's activity, ability to independently reposition, and tissue tolerance. "Turning" is limited to microshifts and changing the position of the head, arms, and upper body according to "swimmer position" protocols [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Soft silicone multilayered foam over pressure points and under medical devices is recommended.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Skin manifestations that are purpuric or nonblanchable purple skin lesions seen with COVID-19 are not consistent with deep tissue pressure injury (DTPI) because they lack pressure-induced injury. Skin changes likely represent tissue ischemia due to thrombosis. Skin changes can appear purpuric progressing to necrosis. If vessels are thrombosed, reperfusion is not achievable even in the presence of offloading. After confirming that the skin change is not due to pressure, wound care providers should not label these skin changes as DTPI, but rather potential skin manifestations from COVID-19. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2887.html" rel="external">"Clinical staging and general management of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Proper nutrition contributes to the prevention of pressure injuries and has a significant role for patients who are critically ill. Infections, such as COVID-19, lead to a hypermetabolic state and increase the risk for nutritional deficiency [<a href="#rid72">72</a>]. Nutrition support can be delayed in severely ill patients with COVID-19. Patients being ventilated with prone positioning receive significant amounts of sedation and paralytic agents, which slow digestive function resulting in decreased absorption of nutrients. Additionally, development of diarrhea, which can damage the skin, creates incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) and further increases the risk for pressure injury [<a href="#rid73">73</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3322687962"><span class="h2">Promotion of home care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>To expand sites available for treating patients during the pandemic, delivery of care from health care providers in the home setting was promoted to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. During the initial phase of the pandemic, the US Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights had relaxed rules regarding the use of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant software to perform telehealth visits [<a href="#rid74">74</a>]. HIPAA-compliant telehealth services became available and can now help assist in the continuity of care for patients who are unable to travel. </p><p>Wound consults by telehealth also can be performed on hospitalized inpatients, in the emergency department, or in an extended care facility. Additionally, providers can bill for similar services provided in a wound care setting at a patient's home setting. Health care practitioners should include their legal and billing teams as early in the process as possible and check with their malpractice insurance carrier to ensure coverage for the telehealth service provided [<a href="#rid75">75</a>]. For CMS reimbursement, a provider can be licensed in a state other than the patient's state of residence, but providers should check with the respective state medical boards. [<a href="#rid76">76,77</a>]. In the home, CMS directed providers to use the telehealth reimbursing office evaluation and management codes with Place of Service 02 for Medicare Telehealth Visits.

Diabetic foot ulcers seen at a frequency of 7.5 times or more per four weeks healed faster than the wounds seen at intervals of two weeks or less. More frequent wound care visits enabled clinicians to identify issues that impair wound healing, including patient compliance issues, challenges that might affect adherence to the treatment, early signs of infection, whether home nursing services are carried out appropriately, and whether the wound needed debridement. Increased patient interaction also reduced social isolation, which had a positive influence on patients. The authors recommend that patients be seen at least once every two weeks, preferably more often [<a href="#rid82">82</a>]. Another study found similar results, with diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers closing over twice as fast on average for weekly compared with the every-other-week visits [<a href="#rid83">83</a>]. One study suggested even more frequent debridement. In a review of over 150,000 wounds of all etiologies, wounds that were debrided every &lt;1 week healed faster than wounds that were debrided every 1 to 2 weeks or &gt;2 weeks [<a href="#rid84">84</a>]. As an example, for diabetic foot ulcers, the median time to heal for weekly or higher-frequency debridement was 21 days compared with 64 and 76 days for one- to two-week or two-week or more intervals between debridement, respectively.</p><p>Wound deterioration and need for re-evaluation or intervention are determined based on clinician and nurse discretion and the following criteria:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increasing necrotic tissue</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Appearance of any signs of infection</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Failure to show signs of healing in a timely manner</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Appearance of excessive fibrotic tissue that requires sharp debridement</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4110281250"><span class="h2">Wound dressings/adjuncts</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Standard wound care practices can be followed.

Most cellular tissue-based products are applied in wound centers or in the operating room since the use of cellular tissue-based products or biologics requires clinicians or facilities in the United States to have a tissue license. Licensing maintenance requires keeping a log of all living and nonliving skin equivalents, which includes the type of skin substitute, name of manufacturer, temperature monitoring for storage of cellular tissue-based products, dates received from the manufacturer, and date of application. In addition, the facility is inspected annually by the US Department of Health. With reduction in performance of nonemergency surgical procedures, the demand for tissue allografts may be reduced.

A streamlined process can be created to establish wound care in the home or a nursing facility with telehealth and face-to-face encounters, when necessary. At the author's institution, the hospital mandated that telehealth comprise 30 percent of clinical practice, including wound services. (See <a class="local">'Telehealth'</a> below.)</p><p>Home care services also include social services and physical therapy. Social services also provide at-home meals to those eligible. The goals of skilled nursing care at home typically include assessment of pain, monitoring for adverse reaction to wound treatments, and patient education regarding signs and symptoms of infection. In addition to typical in-home nursing services (blood draws for laboratory testing, wound cultures), a visiting physician can provide additional services more typically performed in a clinic setting, such as wound debridement, complete vascular assessment, and more advanced wound care (eg, contact casting). </p><p>Remote wound care can take place in the home (self-care, nursing services) or at an extended care facility. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Self-care</strong> – Self-care is an acceptable option if the patient (or family or other caregiver) can perform wound cleansing and dressing changes with ease and can communicate any problems or complications with their clinician as they arise.

In some settings, noninvasive vascular testing (eg, pulse volume recordings, ankle-brachial indices, duplex ultrasound, perfusion studies), can also be obtained. At the author's institution, patients are screened 24 hours prior to an office visit for flu-like symptoms and redirected to a telehealth visit if the patient reports testing positive for COVID-19.</p><p>Basic procedures such as surgical debridement, application of cellular tissue-based products, and other therapies can also be performed in the office setting. To reduce the utilization of hospital services, it may be desirable to expand the procedural capability in the office or wound center setting to include other procedures (eg, more extensive debridement, minor amputation, abscess drainage). To accomplish this, appropriate space as well as identification of additional equipment and medications would be needed to safely perform these procedures.</p><p>In addition to the ability to perform more extensive debridement, additional advantages of the wound center include better access to subspecialty care (eg, infectious disease specialists, podiatry, vascular surgery). Typically, there are more options for wound care, and supplies are typically more plentiful. Other therapies may also be initiated more easily (eg, hyperbaric oxygen, negative pressure wound therapy, compression therapy, offloading). However, wound care centers that were located within a hospital setting during the crisis may not have been available for use, and care in this setting may an increase the risk for COVID-19 exposure.

The patient can be scheduled for a weekly telehealth visit with a nurse, and patients with deterioration of wound progress can be directed back to the office for further evaluation  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef128302" href="/d/graphic/128302.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1338423877"><span class="h2">Types</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are three main types of virtual services that the health care providers can offer: telehealth visits, virtual check-ins, and e-visits [<a href="#rid74">74</a>].

Telehealth visits seem to be the most useful in evaluating the wound patient [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Telehealth visits</strong> – When conducting Medicare telehealth visits, the provider must establish an interactive audio and video telecommunication system that permits real-time communication with the patient at home. These visits are considered the same as in-person visits and are paid at the same rate as in-person visits. The patients can receive care in any health care facility or in their home, and the patients can be new or established. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Virtual check-ins including telephonic communication</strong> – Virtual check-ins entail a brief communication service between established Medicare patients and practitioners over a telephone, through video or image, secure text messaging, email, or use of a patient portal to avoid unnecessary trips to the doctor's office. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>E-visits</strong> – Established Medicare patients can also use e-visits, which means that the patient may have non-face-to-face, patient-initiated communication with doctors using online patient portals [<a href="#rid74">74</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3716445168"><span class="h2">Efficacy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Multiple studies have pointed to the efficacy of telehealth for improving wound care outcomes as well as high patient satisfaction rates with these services [<a href="#rid96">96-99</a>]. Telehealth has been used to care for patients with diabetes for over two decades with good results [<a href="#rid100">100</a>]. In a meta-analysis that included two trials, 213 patients treated using telehealth were compared with 301 patients treated with usual care [<a href="#rid96">96,101,102</a>]. The telehealth system comprised a trained nurse who collected data and took digital images of the wound. Collected data included questions about quality of life, such as nutrition, movement, and pain levels, as well as patient satisfaction with the treatment. The information was then sent to the physician for decision-making. Complete ulcer healing (odds ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.57-1.33), healing time (43 versus 45 days), and amputation rate (6.2 versus 7.7 percent) were similar between the groups. The telehealth group had a significantly higher mortality rate (4.1 percent [8 of 193] versus 1.2 [1 of 181]) without clear underlying reasons. No adverse events were attributed to using telehealth. The studies in the systematic review also reported that supplementing outpatient clinic visits with telehealth consultations increased the frequency of complete healing and the healing rate of diabetic foot ulcers, as well as reduced frequency of limb amputation. Several studies reported good patient satisfaction with their telehealth experience [<a href="#rid97">97-99</a>].</p><p>Telehealth has also been widely used in many countries to provide cost-effective and less resource-demanding medical care. The first conceptual framework for telehealth implementation during outbreaks was published in 2015 [<a href="#rid103">103</a>]. Telehealth was shown to be helpful in treating patients during the severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Ebola, and Zika viruses [<a href="#rid104">104,105</a>]. At the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth, especially video consultation, was promoted to reduce the risk of transmission. However, most countries lack a regulatory framework to authorize, integrate, and reimburse the service. A call to adopt the necessary regulatory changes supporting wide implementation of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic for countries without the integrated service was made [<a href="#rid103">103</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H464314240"><span class="h2">Challenges and barriers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are many technical barriers to telehealth services. Adequate internet capability, whether wired (ethernet) or wireless, of the provider and patient is essential and determines the speed and image quality in demonstrating wounds to the provider. Some patients are unable to download the appropriate applications owing to the age of their devices. Older devices have less memory capacity for the newer apps needed for telehealth. Increasing the broadband capability allows faster transmission of video images and less "freezing." Poor image quality makes it difficult to provide a proper diagnosis.</p><p>Patients who lack resources for data transmission and photos via a smartphone may resort to correspondence via the hospital or patient portal system, if available. The patient can email photos or discuss their concerns directly with their provider over the phone (ie, telephonics). With email, there may be delays in transmission of patient health information due to its encryption. </p><p>It is also important to note that coding and billing reimbursement for telephonics differs from telehealth face-to-face visits.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3316043116"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

During the care of patients with wounds, observing proper precautions is of the utmost importance to reduce the risk in this susceptible population. The risk of transmission is likely less in the home care setting with appropriate precautions, compared with other health care settings. (See <a class="local">'Protecting patients'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Wound healing and SARS-CoV-2</strong> – SARS-CoV-2 is associated with physiologic changes that may affect healing. Whether these changes promote de novo wound development or further impair healing of chronic wounds in patients infected with COVID-19 is not known for certain. Patients with COVID-19 can present with novel vascular skin lesions which may represent the sequelae of microvascular injury. Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 have an increased risk for thrombotic events, which can include arterial thrombosis. (See <a class="local">'Risk for chronic wounds in COVID-19 patients'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Triaging wound care</strong> – Timely wound care is important to prevent complications and reduce the time to healing. Disruption of wound care paradigms led to modifications in the delivery of wound care. A triaging system can be used to help identify the most appropriate location to treat patients who require wound care. The general aim for wound management during the COVID-19 pandemic has been to ensure a level of wound care that prevents deterioration while limiting unnecessary in-person visits to minimize exposure to the virus for both patients and health care providers. (See <a class="local">'Triaging wound care'</a> above and <a class="local">'Goals of wound care'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Wound care delivery</strong> – Delivery of wound care in the home setting is promoted to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission, and barriers to telehealth services access have been reduced. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients were considered homebound and thus qualify for home care services for wound care regardless of the type of wound. Remote wound care can take place in the home (self-care, in-home visits) or at an extended care facility. (See <a class="local">'Promotion of home care'</a> above and <a class="local">'Remote care'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The accessibility of the provider, home care agency, and patient will dictate what form of telehealth (telehealth visits, virtual check-ins, e-visits) is provided. Telehealth visits seem to be the most useful in evaluating the wound patient. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The model of wound care adopted during the pandemic, which places emphasis on remote care, can help manage patients in the future. (See <a class="local">'Telehealth'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>When remote care visits cannot be performed or would be inadequate, as in the case of more complex wounds, the patient will need to be seen in the clinician's office or treated in the hospital (eg, severe infection, limb-threatening ischemia). Prior to undergoing surgery, the patient may require symptom screening or COVID-19 testing, depending on the location of the procedure and institutional practices.
