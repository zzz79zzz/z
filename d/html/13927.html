Performance of a high-quality colonoscopy examination requires understanding and mastery of cognitive and technical skills. A joint American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy/American College of Gastroenterology Taskforce on Quality in Endoscopy advocated the following quality indicators before, during, and after colonoscopy [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>] (see <a class="local">'Quality indicators'</a> below): </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Preprocedure – Attention must be paid to the general issues of timely scheduling, appropriate patient preparation, targeted history and physical examination, evaluation of bleeding risk, assessment for appropriate sedation, and team pause before commencing sedation. It is also important to understand appropriate indications and recommended surveillance intervals based upon the patient's risk factors (eg, family history of colorectal cancer, prior adenomatous polyps, hereditary colon cancer syndrome, or inflammatory bowel disease). Finally, obtaining informed consent with a detailed explanation of the risks associated with colonoscopy is essential. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intraprocedure – Performing a high-quality examination requires careful visualization of the entire colonic mucosa. Metrics such as cecal intubation rates, withdrawal times, and adenoma detection rates serve as surrogate, though imperfect, markers of careful visualization. In addition, a high-quality examination requires appropriate tissue acquisition (eg, surveillance biopsies in inflammatory bowel disease) and endoscopic removal of all polyps less than 2 cm. Removal of polyps larger than 2 cm may require special endoscopic skills. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Postprocedure<strong> </strong>– There must be immediate, complete, and accurate documentation (both written and photographic) of preparation quality and findings, as well as explicit recommendations for follow-up. Tissue samples taken during colonoscopy must be documented. Pathology results should be reviewed with results and recommendations communicated to the patient and referring providers. Finally, there should be a system for tracking adverse events. </p><p></p><p>This topic will review factors associated with performing a colonoscopy including indications, patient preparation, technical aspects, and adverse events. Issues related to colon cancer screening recommendations, bowel preparations for colonoscopy, procedural sedation, and the management of antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications in patients undergoing endoscopy, and special considerations for colonoscopy in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7565.html" rel="external">"Screening for colorectal cancer: Strategies in patients at average risk"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7572.html" rel="external">"Screening for colorectal cancer in patients with a family history of colorectal cancer or advanced polyp"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2594.html" rel="external">"Overview of colon polyps"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2665.html" rel="external">"Bowel preparation before colonoscopy in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2567.html" rel="external">"Gastrointestinal endoscopy in adults: Procedural sedation administered by endoscopists"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2632.html" rel="external">"Management of antiplatelet agents in patients undergoing endoscopic procedures"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2609.html" rel="external">"Management of anticoagulants in patients undergoing endoscopic procedures"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127965.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Issues related to gastrointestinal disease in adults", section on 'Implications for endoscopy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H133249359"><span class="h1">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patient selection for colonoscopy focuses on the indication for the procedure and patient comorbidities to enable proper risk stratification.</p><p>The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy has outlined general principles for the appropriate use of endoscopy [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Endoscopy may be appropriate if any of the following criteria are fulfilled:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The results are likely to change the patient's management </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Empiric treatment of a benign disease has failed</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A therapeutic intervention is anticipated</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>It is being used as an alternative to radiologic evaluation</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, endoscopy is not indicated when the results are not expected to impact management or for the follow-up of benign diseases that have healed, unless surveillance of a premalignant condition is appropriate. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H133249366"><span class="h2">Indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Colonoscopy is performed for both diagnostic and therapeutic indications  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef83296" href="/z/d/graphic/83296.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Diagnostic indications include screening or surveillance for colon cancer, evaluating signs and symptoms suggestive of possible colonic or distal small bowel disease, assessing a response to treatment in patients with known colonic disease (eg, inflammatory bowel disease), and evaluating abnormalities found on imaging studies. Therapeutic indications include stricture dilation, stent placement, colonic decompression, and foreign body removal. In addition, lesions found during diagnostic procedures may require therapeutic intervention (eg, polypectomy or treatment of a bleeding lesion). (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Screening or surveillance for colon cancer</strong> – Colonoscopy is considered the gold standard for colon cancer screening and surveillance. The age at which screening starts will depend upon the patient's medical and family history. If polyps are found during colonoscopy, they should be removed endoscopically if at all possible. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7565.html" rel="external">"Screening for colorectal cancer: Strategies in patients at average risk"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7572.html" rel="external">"Screening for colorectal cancer in patients with a family history of colorectal cancer or advanced polyp"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4079.html" rel="external">"Surveillance and management of dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease"</a> and <a class="local">'Polypectomy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The interval for repeat screening or surveillance will again depend upon the patient's medical and family history, as well as the findings on prior colonoscopies. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2594.html" rel="external">"Overview of colon polyps"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2493.html" rel="external">"Post-treatment surveillance after colorectal cancer treatment"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lower gastrointestinal bleeding</strong> – Patients with active or recent hematochezia, positive fecal occult blood, or melena after an upper gastrointestinal source has been excluded should undergo colonoscopy for diagnosis and, if a source of bleeding is identified, potentially endoscopic therapy. In addition, unexplained iron deficiency anemia should be evaluated via colonoscopy, as colon cancer is an important cause of iron deficiency anemia in adults. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2547.html" rel="external">"Approach to acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7150.html" rel="external">"Causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in adults", section on 'Search for source of blood and iron loss'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lower gastrointestinal symptoms</strong> – Colonoscopy should be performed in patients with chronic, clinically significant diarrhea without an explanation. Random colon biopsies should be obtained throughout the colon to rule out microscopic colitis. Colonoscopy is generally not indicated as part of the evaluation for chronic constipation unless warning signs are present (eg, anemia, weight loss) or the patient has not undergone recommended screening or surveillance. Whether to perform a colonoscopy in a patient with chronic abdominal pain will depend upon patient risk factors (eg, age &gt;45 years), the character and location of the pain, and associated signs and symptoms. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2637.html" rel="external">"Etiology and evaluation of chronic constipation in adults", section on 'Endoscopy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6862.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Abnormal imaging</strong> – Colonoscopy is indicated to evaluate abnormalities detected on imaging studies, including but not limited to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9180" href="/z/d/drug information/9180.html" rel="external">barium</a> enema, abdominal computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography CT, or magnetic resonance imaging. Radiographic findings requiring colonoscopic evaluation include thickening of the wall of the colon or terminal ileum  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79520" href="/z/d/graphic/79520.html" rel="external">image 1</a>), mass lesions  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83618" href="/z/d/graphic/83618.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>), filling defects  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75818" href="/z/d/graphic/75818.html" rel="external">image 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82202" href="/z/d/graphic/82202.html" rel="external">image 3</a>), and strictures  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63411" href="/z/d/graphic/63411.html" rel="external">image 4</a>). In addition, colonoscopy may be indicated in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary or who are found to have polyps on CT colonography (virtual colonoscopy), depending upon the size of the polyp  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71187" href="/z/d/graphic/71187.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2526.html" rel="external">"Overview of computed tomographic colonography", section on 'Indications'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4878.html" rel="external">"Overview of the classification and management of cancers of unknown primary site", section on 'Adenocarcinoma'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation for synchronous or metachronous cancer in patients with colon cancer</strong> – Patients with colon cancer are at risk for synchronous cancer. As a result, patients with colon cancer require a complete examination of the colon. Ideally, this is done prior to surgery, though in some patients complete preoperative colonoscopy will not be possible (eg, due to inability to pass the colonoscope beyond an obstructing tumor). Such patients require colonoscopy soon after resection of the primary tumor. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2493.html" rel="external">"Post-treatment surveillance after colorectal cancer treatment", section on 'Perioperative colonoscopy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Following treatment of the primary tumor, patients require routine surveillance to look for new polyps or metachronous cancer. Several expert groups have made recommendations regarding the timing and frequency of posttreatment endoscopic surveillance. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2493.html" rel="external">"Post-treatment surveillance after colorectal cancer treatment", section on 'Postoperative endoscopic surveillance'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2493.html" rel="external">"Post-treatment surveillance after colorectal cancer treatment", section on 'Guidelines from major groups'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intraoperative lesion localization</strong> – Colonoscopy may be performed intraoperatively to identify a lesion identified on imaging or prior colonoscopy that is not apparent at surgery, such as a bleeding site or small mass. More commonly, colonoscopy is used to mark lesions identified during the procedure  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77062 graphicRef69334 graphicRef78733" href="/z/d/graphic/77062.html" rel="external">picture 2A-C</a>). In such cases, lesions are typically tattooed a few centimeters distal to the lesion. Exactly where the tattoo was performed in relationship to the lesion must be clearly documented and communicated to the surgeon. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2566.html" rel="external">"Tattooing and other methods for localizing gastrointestinal lesions"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inflammatory bowel disease</strong> – Colonoscopy is often performed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease to assess the extent and/or severity of disease and to assess treatment responses. In addition, patients with colitis require routine surveillance for colonic dysplasia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4072.html" rel="external">"Endoscopic diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4079.html" rel="external">"Surveillance and management of dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation of the terminal ileum</strong> – In patients with suspected disease involving the distal small bowel, such as Crohn disease, carcinoid, and bleeding, colonoscopy can be used to evaluate the terminal ileum.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Therapeutic indications</strong> – Therapeutic indications for colonoscopy include hemostasis, foreign body removal, decompression of sigmoid volvulus or colonic pseudoobstruction, balloon dilation of strictures, palliative treatment of bleeding or stenosed neoplasms, and percutaneous endoscopic cecostomy tube placement. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1377.html" rel="external">"Rectal foreign bodies"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2555.html" rel="external">"Sigmoid volvulus"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2531.html" rel="external">"Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15687.html" rel="external">"Management of anastomotic complications of colorectal surgery"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2678.html" rel="external">"Enteral stents for the management of malignant colorectal obstruction"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H133249373"><span class="h2">Contraindications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Colonoscopy is contraindicated in the following situations:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When the risks of the colonoscopy outweigh the expected benefits</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Consent cannot be obtained for a non-urgent procedure</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A perforation is known or suspected</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Documented acute diverticulitis</p><p></p><p>It is important that the expected benefits of colonoscopy be carefully weighed against the risks, particularly in older adults and patients with comorbid illnesses because these patients are at increased risk for serious adverse events from colonoscopy. (See <a class="local">'Adverse events'</a> below.)</p><p>If a patient cannot be adequately sedated despite a reasonable attempt at moderate procedural sedation, colonoscopy should be delayed until adequate sedation can be provided (eg, monitored anesthesia care or general anesthesia). Finally, a suspected poor preparation is a relative contraindication to colonoscopy. (See <a class="local">'Patient preparation'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2567.html" rel="external">"Gastrointestinal endoscopy in adults: Procedural sedation administered by endoscopists"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H133249697"><span class="h2">Important considerations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Before the procedure, patients should be evaluated for factors that may affect the ability to perform a colonoscopy safely and successfully, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anatomic issues, such as recent colonic surgery, history of abdominal and/or pelvic surgeries, abdominal hernias, and presence of a colostomy</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Comorbidities that may increase the risks associated with sedation (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2567.html" rel="external">"Gastrointestinal endoscopy in adults: Procedural sedation administered by endoscopists", section on 'Presedation evaluation'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Comorbidities that may impact the ability of an assistant to apply abdominal pressure and/or position the patient during colonoscopy</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Presence of an implanted cardiac defibrillator and some pacemakers that may require special management during application of electrocautery </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chronic use of medications such as benzodiazepines or narcotics or cannabinoid use [<a href="#rid4">4</a>] that may increase a patient's tolerance to the effects of sedation or may affect the quality of the bowel preparation</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A history of difficult intubation by anesthesia</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H133249380"><span class="h1">PATIENT PREPARATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H133249388"><span class="h2">Diet</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients need to consume a low-residue diet or clear liquids for at least one day prior to elective colonoscopy [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. A low-residue diet is low in fiber, and patients should be instructed to avoid foods that are high in fiber such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82094" href="/z/d/graphic/82094.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Clear liquids include water, clear broth, coffee or tea (without milk), ices, gelatin, and fruit juices such as apple, grapefruit, and lemonade. Liquids that are red can be mistaken for blood in the colon or can obscure mucosal details and should be avoided. One trial found that there was no significant difference in preparation quality between patients treated with 4L of polyethylene glycol who were assigned to receive either a low-residue diet or clear liquids the day prior to the examination [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Similarly, a randomized trial with 230 patients who were receiving a sodium sulfate-based preparation assigned patients to either a low-residue diet for breakfast and lunch the day prior to the colonoscopy or to clear liquids [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Again, there was no difference between the groups with regard to preparation quality. However, patients in the low-residue arm reported greater satisfaction with the preparation and were less likely to cancel their procedure (9 versus 20 percent). Whether similar results would be seen outside of a randomized trial is not yet known. Our approach is to recommend a low-residue diet for three days prior to colonoscopy, with only clear liquids allowed the day prior to the examination.</p><p>Patients typically take no food by mouth for four to eight hours prior to the procedure (sometimes longer if there is known or suspected delayed gastric emptying) and no liquids (other than sips with medications) for two hours [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Recommendations differ with regard to preprocedure fasting for elective procedures. The American Society for Anesthesiology (ASA) guidelines state that prior to a procedure, patients should fast a minimum of two hours following clear liquid ingestion or six hours for a light meal [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. By contrast, the American College of Emergency Physicians states "recent food intake is not a contraindication for administering procedural sedation and analgesia, but should be considered in choosing the timing and target level of sedation" [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].

This includes a complete history of factors that might make sedation more difficult such as prior difficulties with sedation, chronic narcotic or benzodiazepine use, diminished mental capacity, and agitation or severe anxiety. Special attention should be paid to whether the patient has an increased risk for difficult airway management (eg, obesity, non-visibility of the uvula, prior history of difficult intubation) or increased cardiopulmonary adverse events of endoscopy (eg, comorbidities, obesity, older age).

Furthermore, when administered by an anesthesiologist or dedicated nurse, deep sedation substantially increases the total cost of the procedure [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. It is important to note that in some cases the additional costs associated with the administration of deep sedation may not be covered by a patient's health insurance.

Both adult and pediatric colonoscopes are used for colonoscopy in adults (with pediatric colonoscopes often being used for women or patients with a history of abdominal surgery). The choice of colonoscope does not affect cecal intubation rates or times [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Adult colonoscopes have a diameter of approximately 13 mm, whereas pediatric colonoscopes have a diameter of approximately 11 mm. Use of a pediatric colonoscope may enable easier passage through narrowed or fixed areas of the colon. However, the smaller diameter makes the pediatric colonoscope more flexible, which predisposes to loop formation. The choice of an adult versus pediatric colonoscope is typically a matter of endoscopist preference. Occasionally the endoscopist may need to change from one type of colonoscope to the other to facilitate completion of the colonoscopy (see <a class="local">'Looping'</a> below). An ultra-slim colonoscope with a diameter of approximately 9.5 mm may be particularly helpful in patients with tight turns. </p><p>Variable stiffness colonoscopes allow the endoscopist to stiffen the shaft of the colonoscope and appear to increase cecal intubation rates [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Often the colonoscope is stiffened after passage through the sigmoid colon to reduce loop formation. The colonoscope is typically loosened during withdrawal, retroflexion, or passage around tight turns.</p><p>Various accessories are available that can be passed through the accessory channel of a colonoscope. These include biopsy forceps, brushes, snares, baskets, nets, injection needles, hemostatic clips, and argon plasma coagulation probes. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H60870338"><span class="h1">COLONOSCOPE ADVANCEMENT AND MUCOSAL INSPECTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Colonoscopy routinely begins with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position, with the exception of patients with a colostomy, who typically remain supine. The first step is inspection of the perianal region and digital rectal examination. Topical anesthetic lubricating gel should be used for patients with perianal discomfort, whereas standard lubricant can be used for patients without discomfort. The tip of the colonoscope is then inserted into the rectum with air or CO2 insufflation, suctioning of residual fluid, and pulling back of the colonoscope to enable visualization. The rectosigmoid junction is at approximately 15 to 20 cm, at which point the colon enters the peritoneum. Particular care must be taken when advancing the colonoscope in patients with colonic strictures or significant diverticulosis, as air insufflation can increase the risk of perforation in such patients. (See <a class="local">'Perforation'</a> below.)</p><p>Important techniques used during colonoscopy include using the up-down and left-right knobs and aspirating air. Using the knobs is particularly helpful in negotiating turns. Although gentle air insufflation helps visualization as the colonoscope is advanced, filling the colon with air lengthens and distends the colon, which may cause discomfort and increase the difficulty of the procedure. Aspirating the air will deflate and shorten the colon, bringing the next fold closer to the tip of the colonoscope, reducing abdominal discomfort and often aiding with scope advancement. The use of carbon dioxide instead of air to insufflate may reduce distension and patient discomfort as well [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Although limited data suggest that carbon dioxide insufflation in patients with underlying pulmonary disease is not associated with an increased risk of respiratory depression or carbon dioxide retention, additional studies are needed [<a href="#rid28">28-30</a>]. </p><p>Distending the lumen of the colon with water may facilitate advancement of the colonoscope with decreased pain [<a href="#rid31">31-33</a>]. This technique may be especially helpful when navigating a left colon filled with numerous diverticula that make it difficult to identify the colonic lumen. Studies support decreased sedation requirements and improved patient tolerance with the use of water rather than air insufflation; however, some studies suggested decreased adenoma detection rates (ADRs) [<a href="#rid32">32,34-36</a>]. In a meta-analysis with 16 randomized trials that compared insufflation with water and insufflation with air, insufflation with water was associated with less pain (-1.57 point difference in pain score on a 0 to 10 scale, 95% CI -2.00 to -1.14), a higher likelihood of being able to complete the examination without sedation or analgesia (risk ratio [RR] 1.20, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.27), and higher ADRs (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.30) [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. There was no difference in cecal intubation rate.</p><p>Intubating the terminal ileum can be performed with two different approaches. The colonoscope may be advanced through the opening of the valve by direct visualization during forward movement. Alternatively, the colonoscope may be positioned in the cecum near the appendiceal orifice and slowly withdrawn, with the tip of the colonoscope angled toward the direction of the valve opening in an attempt to "hook" the valve.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H63022593"><span class="h2">Looping</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A major barrier to successful advancement of the colonoscope to the cecum is looping. Looping occurs due to the attachment of the sigmoid and transverse colon to a mobile mesentery  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82950" href="/z/d/graphic/82950.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). Advancing the colonoscope becomes more difficult, and in some cases, attempts to advance the colonoscope result in reverse movement of the colonoscope tip, termed paradoxical movement. In addition to impeding advancement of the colonoscope, looping can cause pain and perforation. Pain occurs due to the presence of sensory receptors in the mesentery responding to torsion, distension, compression, and stretching. Repeated loop reduction during the colonoscopy is critical and requires pulling back the colonoscope while applying torque, often clockwise. Stopping any maneuver if it causes significant pain, pressure, or difficulty is important to decrease the risk of adverse events. Loops formed in the instrument shaft outside the patient should be removed by rotating the colonoscope, keeping the lumen in view.</p><p>Applying abdominal pressure and changing the patient's position are important adjunctive techniques to enable passage of the colonoscope to the cecum. Abdominal pressure was the most important non-instrumental factor for cecal intubation in patients referred for incomplete colonoscopy [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Loops should be removed before the assistant applies pressure to help prevent loop further formation. </p><p>Asking the patient to demonstrate the location of abdominal discomfort may also help identify the appropriate area to apply pressure. In addition, abdominal pressure should be applied to abdominal hernias. In such patients, loops that form within the hernia may lead to entrapment of the colonoscope [<a href="#rid38">38</a>].</p><p>The use of a lower abdominal compression device may reduce the need for manual pressure and patient repositioning in patients with a BMI 30 to 40 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>[<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. Furthermore, the use of this type of device may reduce the frequency of staff-related musculoskeletal pain experienced [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. While not widely available, an alternative method for determining where to apply pressure is magnetic endoscopic imaging. Magnetic endoscopic imaging provides real-time three-dimensional views of the colonoscope shaft configuration and its location within the abdomen. This information can aid with loop reduction and can be used to identify where to provide external pressure [<a href="#rid41">41,42</a>]. </p><p>Changing the patient's position also may aid advancement of the colonoscope. In addition to the standard left lateral position, patients may be positioned in a supine, right lateral, or prone position. One study demonstrated that position changes were effective two-thirds of the time in allowing forward advancement of the colonoscope or improved luminal visualization [<a href="#rid43">43</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H63022615"><span class="h2">Inspection</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H113342220"><span class="h3">Essential elements</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Careful inspection of the colonic mucosa is primarily performed during withdrawal of the colonoscope.

In a systematic review and network meta-analysis that compared the efficacy of different endoscopic techniques in increasing ADRs, low-cost measures optimizing existing resources (water-aided colonoscopy, second observer, dynamic position change) were associated with a moderate increase in ADR compared with high-definition colonoscopy alone (odds ratio [OR] 1.29, 95% CI 1.17-1.43) [<a href="#rid53">53</a>].

The reported rates of postpolypectomy bleeding vary (typically 1 to 2 percent), with higher rates seen with the removal of larger polyps (ie, &gt;2 cm) especially on the right side of the colon [<a href="#rid78">78-85</a>]. The risk of postpolypectomy bleeding may be increased in patients with thrombocytopenia or coagulopathies. It has been suggested that overall, endoscopists should have postpolypectomy bleeding rates of less than one percent [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. In addition to the increased risk seen with polypectomy, the risk of bleeding is increased with other therapeutic maneuvers such as stricture dilation and endoscopic mucosal resection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2553.html" rel="external">"Gastrointestinal endoscopy in patients with disorders of hemostasis"</a>.)</p><p>Postpolypectomy bleeding may be immediate or delayed. Immediate bleeding is associated with polypectomy techniques that may occur with or without the use of cautery current polypectomy. It often is recognized during the colonoscopy, in which case it typically can be treated immediately and controlled using endoscopic hemostatic methods. If not recognized at the time of colonoscopy, it can usually be managed by a repeat colonoscopy to identify and treat the bleeding site. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2671.html" rel="external">"Management and prevention of bleeding after colonoscopy with polypectomy", section on 'Immediate bleeding'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2668.html" rel="external">"Endoscopic clip therapy in the gastrointestinal tract: Bleeding lesions and beyond", section on 'Postpolypectomy bleeding'</a>.)</p><p>Delayed bleeding is typically seen five to seven days after the procedure, but it has been reported up to four weeks later. It is thought to occur due to sloughing of an eschar that was covering a blood vessel or due to extension of the cautery-induced zone of thermal necrosis to non-injured tissue, which could result in bleeding if it involves a blood vessel. Patients may present with hematochezia or with melena, depending upon the location of the bleeding (bleeding from the right colon may present as melena). Delayed bleeding can often be managed with colonoscopy to identify and treat the bleeding site.

However, other studies have not noted this association [<a href="#rid89">89,91,92</a>]. Additional risk factors for perforation include reduced mobility of the colon, existing weakness in the colon wall, previous incomplete attempt at endoscopic removal of a colonic lesion, performance of colonoscopy by a non-gastroenterologist, and endoscopist inexperience [<a href="#rid74">74,89,93-96</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reduced colon mobility can result from adhesions, diverticula, radiation therapy, malignancy, or infection.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mucosal abnormalities may occur as a result of inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy, infection, radiation therapy, necrosis, or a partial tear.

Colonic perforation may be retro- or intraperitoneal. The ascending colon, hepatic and splenic flexures, and descending colon are retroperitoneal, whereas the distal rectum is below the peritoneum  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81248" href="/z/d/graphic/81248.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). The most common symptom of a colonic perforation is abdominal pain. Other symptoms include fever, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, chest pain, scapular pain, and neck pain. However, patients with retroperitoneal perforations may have minimal or atypical symptoms. The physical examination may be notable for diffuse or localized abdominal tenderness with peritoneal signs.</p><p>If perforation is suspected, immediate abdominal radiographs (plain and upright or lateral decubitus) and an upright chest radiograph should be obtained to look for free air under the diaphragm, retroperitoneal air, pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, or subcutaneous emphysema. If plain films are normal but there is a high suspicion of perforation, an abdominopelvic computed tomography scan with water-soluble contrast should be obtained since it has higher sensitivity for detecting extraluminal air than plain films (particularly for retroperitoneal perforations) [<a href="#rid98">98</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15075.html" rel="external">"Overview of gastrointestinal tract perforation"</a>.)</p><p>Management includes giving the patient nothing by mouth and starting intravenous fluids and intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics. Surgical consultation should be obtained immediately. Large perforations typically require surgery. A minority of patients can be managed nonsurgically. Such patients have a clean colon with no signs of peritonitis and improve symptomatically over 24 hours. Usually these patients have a retroperitoneal perforation and/or sustained the perforation during a therapeutic colonoscopy. Reported success rates for nonsurgical management are variable (between 33 to 64 percent in some series) [<a href="#rid99">99-101</a>]. Successful endoscopic clip closure of perforations has been reported and may be attempted if the perforation is visualized at the time of the colonoscopy and is accessible [<a href="#rid102">102,103</a>].

In a report from a US-based registry (GI Quality Improvement Consortium) of 2,646,833 colonoscopies performed between 2014 and 2018, the average ADR for screening colonoscopies per endoscopist was 37 percent, 44 percent in males and 31 percent in females [<a href="#rid111">111</a>]. This suggests that higher ADR performance can be routinely achieved by practicing endoscopists.</p><p>One factor that has received significant attention is withdrawal time [<a href="#rid112">112-115</a>]. In a study of 2053 screening colonoscopies, endoscopists with a mean withdrawal time of ≥6 minutes had a higher neoplasia detection rate than those with a withdrawal time of less than 6 minutes (28 versus 12 percent), including advanced neoplasia (6 versus 3 percent) [<a href="#rid112">112</a>]. Similarly, in a prospective study of 315 gastroenterologists and 15,955 patients, endoscopists with a mean withdrawal time of ≥6 minutes were 1.8 times more likely to detect one or more polyps [<a href="#rid113">113</a>]. However, another prospective study that included 4429 consecutive colonoscopies performed by 67 endoscopists failed to find a statistically significant difference in polyp detection for polyps ≥5 mm for those who had median withdrawal times of ≥6 minutes compared with those with shorter withdrawal times (odds ratio 1.2; 95% CI 0.9-1.6) [<a href="#rid114">114</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H999312321"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Most medications may be continued up to the time of colonoscopy, but management of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants must take into account the procedure-related risk of bleeding and the risk of thrombosis. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not required for patients undergoing colonoscopy.

Postpolypectomy bleeding occurs in approximately 1 to 2 percent of polypectomies, with higher rates seen with the removal of larger polyps. Patients may present with hematochezia or melena days to weeks after the colonoscopy. The majority of patients can be managed with a repeat colonoscopy to both identify and treat the source of bleeding.

The most common symptom of a colonic perforation is abdominal pain. Other symptoms include fever, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, chest pain, scapular pain, and neck pain. However, patients with retroperitoneal perforations may have minimal or atypical symptoms. The physical examination may be notable for diffuse or localized abdominal tenderness with peritoneal signs. (See <a class="local">'Perforation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If perforation is suspected, immediate abdominal radiographs (plain and upright or lateral decubitus) and an upright chest radiograph should be obtained. If plain films are normal but there is a high suspicion of perforation, an abdominopelvic computed tomography scan with water-soluble contrast should be obtained. All patients with perforations should receive intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Many patients with perforations will require surgery, though nonsurgical management may be possible in those with small perforations without evidence of peritonitis.</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Bjorkman DJ, Popp JW Jr. Measuring the quality of endoscopy.
