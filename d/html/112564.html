         Friction blisters are intraepidermal blisters that occur when epidermal injury results from repetitive shearing forces in the skin. The most common sites of involvement are the hands, fingers, feet, and toes  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef118749 graphicRef118750" href="/z/d/graphic/118749.html" rel="external">
          picture 1A-B
         </a>
         ). Prolonged walking or running is a common inciting activity for friction blisters on the foot. Unusually severe or frequent friction blisters may occur in the setting of underlying disorders of skin fragility  (

         The causes, clinical features, and management of friction blisters will be reviewed here. An overview of the approach to the diagnosis of cutaneous blistering is provided separately. (See

         Friction blisters result from shearing forces within the epidermis rather than simple rubbing of the epidermis [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The fundamental components of the mechanism of blister formation are moving bone, high friction force (the force opposing the movement of one surface against another), and repetition of the resulting shear events [

          1
         </a>

         <strong>
          Effects of shearing forces on the epidermis
         </strong>
         – The shearing forces produce necrosis and dissociation of keratinocytes, leading to an intraepidermal split in the stratum spinosum  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef119008" href="/z/d/graphic/119008.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Hydrostatic pressure causes the area of separation to fill with fluid similar in composition to plasma but with lower protein levels [

         <strong>
          Factors influencing the likelihood of blister formation
         </strong>
         – The magnitude of the frictional force and the number of passes of an object on the skin determine the likelihood of blister formation [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Moist skin produces higher frictional forces than dry or wet skin, increasing the risk for blistering [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Blisters are most likely to occur in skin areas that have a thick stratum corneum held tightly to underlying structures, such as the palms of the hands or soles of the feet. Friction injury in sites of very thin skin (eg, atrophic or sun-damaged skin) is less likely to result in blistering. Rather, the overlying epithelium may be sloughed, and an erosion may result immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Experimental studies support large variability in the susceptibility to friction blister formation among individuals [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. The reasons for differences in susceptibility to blistering after exposure to similar shearing forces are unclear.

          5,6
         </a>

         Underlying conditions can increase risk for friction-induced blistering. Epidermolysis bullosa, a group of inherited disorders characterized by mechanical fragility of epithelial and basement membrane zone tissues, presents with blister, erosion, or ulcer formation in sites of minor skin trauma.

        <p>
         Acquired diseases that cause skin fragility, such as epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, porphyria cutanea tarda, and pseudoporphyria, can also predispose to friction-induced blisters [

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Underlying disorders can influence sites of predilection. For example, although patients with localized epidermolysis bullosa simplex, the most common variant of epidermolysis bullosa, primarily develop blisters on the feet or hands  (

          Course
         </strong>
         – Friction blisters may rupture soon after formation or persist for hours to several days depending on the thickness of the overlying stratum corneum. Compared with blisters on skin sites with a thinner stratum corneum, blisters in sites with a thick stratum corneum, such as the palms or soles, tend to persist for longer periods.

          Impact of predisposing disorders

         – The histopathologic appearance of friction-induced blisters can vary in patients with disorders that predispose to blistering. In epidermolysis bullosa simplex, the separation may be suprabasilar or within basal keratinocytes. Friction-induced blisters in porphyria cutanea tarda and pseudoporphyria occur at the basement membrane within the lamina lucida. (See

         – The patient history is critical for diagnosis. Patients should be asked about recent rubbing trauma in the affected area and preceding symptoms. Pain or a burning sensation often precedes friction blister formation. A supportive history for foot blisters may include new shoes or recent vigorous physical activity. (See

         <strong>
          Physical examination
         </strong>
         – The physical examination should involve assessment of the blister site and surrounding skin. Prominent inflammation (eg, erythematous papules or plaques) is not typical and suggests an alternative diagnosis or secondary infection. (See

          Role of biopsy
         </strong>
         – Although rarely needed, if the diagnosis remains uncertain after the patient history and physical examination, a skin biopsy may help to confirm the diagnosis. Skin biopsies may also be appropriate for the diagnosis of associated disorders of skin fragility. The differential diagnosis determines the type of biopsy indicated and the need for supplemental pathologic tests or other tests. The general approach to the diagnosis of skin blistering is reviewed separately. (See

         Further evaluation is indicated for patients presenting with features that suggest an underlying predisposing disorder. Suspicion for such disorders should arise when blistering is more frequent or severe than expected based upon the patient history or when there is evidence for impaired healing, milia formation, or scarring  (

         ). Blisters related to porphyria cutanea tarda, rarer forms of porphyria (congenital erythropoietic porphyria and variegate porphyria), pseudoporphyria, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, and some presentations of epidermolysis bullosa tend to heal with scarring or milia formation  (

         – Epidermolysis bullosa is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous inherited skin fragility disorder. Although the typical clinical findings differ based upon the subtype of epidermolysis bullosa, characteristic features include blisters, erosions, nonhealing ulcers, and scars following minor trauma. In localized epidermolysis bullosa simplex (the most common variant of epidermolysis bullosa), blisters primarily develop on the feet or hands  (

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Patients with epidermolysis bullosa often have onset of blistering in infancy or childhood and report a chronic course. Patients with epidermolysis bullosa simplex, which is most often transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion, may report similar blistering in family members.

         Nonpainful, nonexpanding blisters that do not cause functional limitations may be left intact and allowed to resolve spontaneously. The advantage of an intact blister is maintenance of a sterile environment during re-epithelialization, minimizing the risk for infection.

         Drainage is suggested for painful blisters and blisters that cause functional limitations. Clinical experience suggests that a drainage procedure that maintains the blister roof minimizes postprocedure discomfort and may also reduce risk for secondary infection.

        <p>
         Blister drainage is a relatively simple procedure that may be performed by a clinician or the patient at home. The blister surface should be cleansed with alcohol. A sterile needle is used to puncture the blister, ideally at or around the edge or base of the blister to keep the roof of the blister intact. For large blisters, performing more than one puncture helps to remove blister fluid easily.

        <p>
         Light pressure can be applied to aid with removal of the fluid. The blister roof should be allowed to collapse over the blister site to serve as a biologic dressing. Topical or oral antibiotic therapy is not necessary in the absence of infection.

         Measures that reduce shear forces on the skin are the mainstay of prevention.

Preventive measures may be particularly helpful for individuals whose occupations or athletic activities are associated with high risk for recurrent episodes of friction blisters.

         – Measures to reduce contributory skin trauma may include reducing skin moisture, changing the surfaces in contact with the skin, and addressing biomechanical factors (eg, orthopedic or gait abnormalities) that may increase shear forces on the skin [

         Despite the common occurrence of friction blisters, high-quality trials are lacking, and the value of products to reduce frictional and shearing forces on the skin and protect from blistering remain uncertain. Examples of proposed interventions include paper tape [

         Our typical approach for foot friction blisters is to advise routine wearing of socks with shoes during physical activity (as opposed to no socks) to reduce moisture at the skin surface and reduce friction; we also address obvious physical abnormalities that may contribute to increased shear forces on the skin [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. We approach use of other interventions, such as specific socks, shoe insoles, paper tape, orthotic devices, or physical therapy, on a case-by-case, trial-and-error basis.

          Overview
         </strong>
         – The friction blister is a common disorder that occurs when shearing forces repeatedly applied to the skin lead to separation within the epidermis. Friction blisters are most likely to occur on the hands and feet. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Risk factors'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Clinical manifestations
         </strong>
         – Friction blisters generally present as vesicles or bullae in linear or oval configurations  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef118749 graphicRef118750" href="/z/d/graphic/118749.html" rel="external">
          picture 1A-B
         </a>
         ). The blister cavity typically contains clear fluid. Hemorrhagic vesicles or bullae may also occur. Discomfort is common. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical manifestations'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Friction blisters can be diagnosed based upon a history of rubbing trauma in the affected area and consistent physical examination findings  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef143250" href="/z/d/graphic/143250.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Skin biopsies are not usually necessary. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnosis'

         above.)

         <strong>
          Recognition of predisposing disorders
         </strong>
         – Infrequently, friction blisters are a manifestation of disorders associated with skin fragility  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef143250" href="/z/d/graphic/143250.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Examples include epidermolysis bullosa, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, porphyria cutanea tarda, and pseudoporphyria. Such disorders should be suspected when blistering is more frequent or severe than expected or exhibits impaired healing. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Predisposing disorders'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Management
         </strong>
         – Friction blisters can heal spontaneously provided the causative frictional force is removed. Treatment is focused on reducing symptoms and minimizing risk for secondary infection. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Management'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Asymptomatic, nondisabling blisters
         </strong>
         – For patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic blisters that are not causing functional limitations, we suggest leaving blisters intact rather than deliberate drainage (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>

         <strong>
          Painful or disabling blisters
         </strong>
         – For patients with painful blisters or blisters that cause functional limitations, we suggest deliberate blister drainage (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). In our experience, patients often have improvement in symptoms with blister drainage. A drainage technique that leaves the blister roof may help to reduce risk for secondary infection after drainage. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Painful or disabling blisters'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Ruptured blisters
         </strong>
         – Ruptured blister sites should be cleansed daily and covered with a clean, dry dressing. When patients must continue physical activity that will irritate the blister site, application of a hydrocolloid dressing can provide a cushioning effect and may help to reduce discomfort during activity. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Ruptured blisters'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Prevention
         </strong>
         – Measures to reduce blister recurrence are aimed at reducing frictional and shear forces on the skin. Potential measures to reduce exposure to factors that may contribute to blister formation should be reviewed, such as adjusting the inciting activity and allowing gradual introduction of activities and gear that may contribute to friction blisters.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Efficacy data for products to reduce risk for blistering are limited. We advise that individuals planning to participate in activities associated with risk for foot blisters (eg, prolonged walking, hiking, or running) wear socks during these activities. We approach use of other interventions, such as specific socks, shoe insoles, paper tape, orthotic devices, or physical therapy, on a case-by-case, trial-and-error basis. (See
