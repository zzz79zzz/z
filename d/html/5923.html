AA is caused by immune-mediated destruction of pluripotent hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Acquired AA must be distinguished from other causes of pancytopenia, including inherited BM failure syndromes (IBMFS), which are caused by inherited gene variants and may be associated with extra-hematopoietic manifestations and high risk for development of acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, and other cancers. Management of AA is distinctly different from IBMFS and other causes of hypoplastic/aplastic marrow.</p><p>This topic discusses pretreatment evaluation, management, and outcomes with acquired AA in children and adolescents.</p><p>Evaluation, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of AA are discussed separately.

Treatment of AA requires potentially toxic treatments that are distinct from those used to manage other causes of cytopenias. However, severe AA can cause life-threatening complications, and treatment should <strong>not</strong> be delayed while awaiting all results from testing for other causes of cytopenias.</p><p>Examples of conditions that should be excluded in children and adolescents with AA include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS)</strong> – Inherited disorders should be excluded at the time of diagnosis of AA. Initial evaluation for IBMFS by clinical evaluation and functional screening tests is followed by genetic testing, as described below. (See <a class="local">'Clinical/laboratory evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">IBMFS may be associated with hematopoietic disorders and extra-hematopoietic findings. The cytopenias may be mild or of gradual onset, but they may also be associated with a hematologic malignancy. Other findings may include skeletal or urogenital anomalies, cutaneous findings (eg, premature hair graying), unexplained liver or lung dysfunction/fibrosis, and other findings.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Management of children with IBMFS is distinct from that for AA, as children are at risk for complications from organ dysfunction, excessive sensitivity to chemotherapy and other treatments, and they require specific surveillance for cancer and other effects.
