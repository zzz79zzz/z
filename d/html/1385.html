Other types of urogenital or anorectal fistulas are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8071.html" rel="external">"Urogenital tract fistulas in females"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83103.html" rel="external">"Anorectal fistula: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H549416795"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Anovaginal fistulas (AVFs) and rectovaginal fistulas (RVFs) most frequently result from obstetric trauma, especially in resource-limited countries where prolonged obstructed labor can lead to pressure necrosis of the rectovaginal septum. These fistulas can also occur following a failed repair of a third- or fourth-degree laceration of the perineum, from unrecognized injury at the time of vaginal delivery, and from episiotomy infection. Radiation damage and Crohn disease are two other important causes of RVFs [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. </p><p>RVFs may also occur following difficult hysterectomies, especially those performed for severe endometriosis with involvement or obliteration of the posterior cul-de-sac (pouch of Douglas); from extension or rupture of perirectal, perianal, and, rarely, Bartholin's abscesses; and from any surgical procedures involving the posterior vaginal wall, perineum, anus, or rectum. </p><p>In older women, RVFs can occur as a result of diverticulitis, colon cancer, or fecal impaction. In addition, treatment options for pelvic organ prolapse such as pessaries [<a href="#rid3">3</a>] and various mesh repair procedures have been associated with RVFs [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H549416900"><span class="h1">CLASSIFICATION OF FISTULAS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although the term "rectovaginal fistula" is sometimes used loosely in clinical practice to refer to all fistulas that involve the bowel and vagina, it is preferable to subclassify female genital fistulas according to anatomic landmarks:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fistulas that occur below the dentate line are called anovaginal fistulas (AVFs) or low fistulas. AVFs are usually found within the first 3 cm from the anal verge. Fistulas that open on the perineal body are called anoperineal fistulas.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fistulas cephalad to the dentate line are true rectovaginal fistulas (RVFs) and are classified by some experts as high fistulas. The distinction between AVFs and RVFs is important as the anal sphincter complex is often involved with the former. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fistulas of the colon above the rectum are referred to as colovaginal fistulas.</p><p></p><p>Although a variety of classification systems exist for these fistulas by size, location, or etiology, none is correlated with patient outcomes [<a href="#rid5">5-7</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Women suffering from anovaginal fistulas (AVFs) or rectovaginal fistulas (RVFs) present with uncontrollable passage of gas or feces from the vagina. A malodorous vaginal discharge and fecal soiling of the undergarments are also common complaints. These symptoms may be more pronounced when patient bowel movements are loose. Occasionally, a small fistula may be asymptomatic. </p><p>Patients suspected of having AVFs should also be questioned about symptoms of fecal urgency as well as fecal incontinence associated with urgency. These additional symptoms often suggest disruption of the external anal sphincter. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3270.html" rel="external">"Delayed surgical management of the disrupted anal sphincter"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H549417489"><span class="h1">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All patients suspected of having anovaginal fistulas (AVFs) or rectovaginal fistulas (RVFs) should undergo a vaginal examination. The diagnosis is made on vaginal examination.</p><p>In addition, patients diagnosed with fistulas should have a complete evaluation of their anal sphincter complex to rule out concomitant sphincter injury. If a surgeon is unclear as to whether the anal sphincter is intact, endoanal ultrasound can detect defects in both the internal and external anal sphincter complexes [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>It is critical that the clinician evaluate the entire sphincteric mechanism in women with RVFs to exclude coexisting causes for incontinence, such as a disrupted anal sphincter. Although concomitant sphincter injury has been reported to exist in up to one-third of women presenting with RVFs [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>], concomitant internal or external sphincter injuries (or both) are probably more frequent when the location of the fistula is within the distal 3 cm of the anal canal. Anatomic and physiologic studies have shown that this is the normal length of the sphincter complex. Failure to recognize and repair such a sphincter injury may result in continued incontinence following a successful fistulectomy.</p><p>Pinpoint fistulas can be difficult to locate on vaginal examination. The use of a Sims speculum and magnification, such as a colposcope, may be helpful. Lacrimal duct or silver wire probes can also be used to assist in identifying the fistula tract. A few drops of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9636" href="/d/drug information/9636.html" rel="external">methylene blue</a> dye can be mixed with lubricating gel and massaged into the anterior rectal wall. Alternatively, an enema consisting of warmed <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> and a few drops of methylene blue dye can be instilled into the rectum using a genitourinary syringe. Using a peroxide solution will avoid staining the tissues [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. If a tract cannot be found easily, the patient's hips can be elevated, water placed in the posterior vagina, then air (50 to 100 cc) placed in the rectum with a catheter-tip syringe connected to a Robertson catheter. Air will generally pass anteriorly through a small tract and bubble through the vaginal water. Proctoscopy or an anorectal speculum may also be useful in visualizing the fistulous tract from the rectal side. The role of imaging tests, such as endoanal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, in the diagnosis of fistulas is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2580.html" rel="external">"The role of imaging tests in the evaluation of anal abscesses and fistulas"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H549417034"><span class="h1">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The differential diagnosis of anovaginal and rectovaginal fistulas (AVFs and RVFs) includes conditions that cause fecal soiling, such as fistula-in-ano, perianal abscess, and anal incontinence, and conditions that cause malodorous vaginal discharge, such as vaginal infection. AVFs and RVFs can be distinguished from these entities based upon the patient's symptoms and the physical examination. Among the conditions in the differential diagnosis, fistula-in-ano is most commonly confused with AVF.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H549417002"><span class="h2">Distinguishing AVFs and RVFs from fistula-in-ano</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Another type of perineal fistula, fistula-in-ano, is an abnormal connection between the anal canal and the perianal or perineal skin. Fistula-in-ano can occur as a complication of episiotomy [<a href="#rid9">9</a>] but is caused far more often by perianal abscesses or trauma. A detailed discussion of fistula-in-ano can be found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83103.html" rel="external">"Anorectal fistula: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>Clinically, fistula-in-ano is characterized by chronic purulent drainage or cyclical pain. Palpation of the fistula tract is painful for the patient with a fistula-in-ano, in contrast to the relatively painless tract of an AVF or RVF. The location of a fistula-in-ano is usually lateral to the midline, whereas most AVFs and RVFs are located close to the midline (related to their obstetric origin). Morphologically, an anal fistula tract is lined with chronically inflamed granulation tissue, instead of the epithelialized tract typical of AVFs and RVFs. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H549417618"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For women with small fistulas and minimal symptoms, nonsurgical management is appropriate [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Optimizing the patient's bowel function, particularly controlling diarrhea, is beneficial. However, for the majority of patients with anovaginal or rectovaginal fistulas, the symptoms are intolerable. Thus, surgical repair is indicated. </p><p>The surgical approaches to fistula repair vary by the etiology of the fistula, its location and size, the quality of the surrounding tissue, the patient's underlying comorbidities, and any previous attempts at repair. Most published studies are small case series, which makes comparison of techniques and outcomes difficult [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">PREOPERATIVE PREPARATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is no consensus regarding the best preoperative regimens for women undergoing repair of anorectal fistula (AVF) or rectovaginal fistula (RVF). In our practice, we prescribe a liquid diet for 24 to 48 hours prior to surgery, followed by a mechanical bowel cleansing; we give a single dose of preoperative antibiotic 30 minutes before surgery. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Diet</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Dietary manipulation is required in all women undergoing AVF or RVF repair. The ultimate goal is to avoid fecal seeding of the wound during the procedure and to decrease the amount of stool that will pass over the repaired area in the first few weeks of healing. In most cases, a liquid diet should be followed for 24 to 48 hours prior to surgery. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Mechanical bowel cleansing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mechanical bowel cleansing is routinely recommended. The author prefers to give oral agents (32 ounces of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9580" href="/d/drug information/9580.html" rel="external">magnesium citrate</a> or 4 to 6 liters of Golytely) 48 hours preoperatively. Administering these agents within 24 hours of the procedures can result in a thin fecal effluent being present at the time of the repair. </p><p>In addition, a tap water enema or a Fleet enema can be given the night before surgery to complete the emptying of the lower colon and rectum. Alternatively, a Fleet enema can be given an hour prior to surgery.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Antibiotic prophylaxis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We administer a single dose of a broad-spectrum antibiotic, such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9223" href="/d/drug information/9223.html" rel="external">cefoxitin</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9222" href="/d/drug information/9222.html" rel="external">cefotetan</a>, intravenously 30 minutes before the procedure. Alternatively, a combination of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9214" href="/d/drug information/9214.html" rel="external">cefazolin</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9646" href="/d/drug information/9646.html" rel="external">metronidazole</a> also provides adequate coverage. For patients with a beta-lactam allergy, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9275" href="/d/drug information/9275.html" rel="external">clindamycin</a> plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8489" href="/d/drug information/8489.html" rel="external">gentamicin</a> can be used as an alternative regimen; gentamicin should be dosed based upon actual patient weight [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Additional antibiotic therapy is typically not indicated, unless there is fecal soiling during the procedure. In most patients, prophylactic antibiotics should be discontinued within 24 hours after the surgical procedure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h1">SURGICAL PRINCIPLES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H609251239"><span class="h2">Basic principles</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The basic principles essential to all successful fistula repairs include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Wide mobilization of the adjacent tissue planes</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Complete excision of the fistula tract</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Multilayered closure, which reapproximates broad tissue surfaces without tension and avoids "dead space"</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Proper timing of the repair </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H549417085"><span class="h2">Timing of repair</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most rectovaginal and anovaginal fistulas are amenable to early repair, provided there is no infection, induration, or inflammation present in the tissues involved. </p><p>When active wound infection or tissue induration is present, patients should be provided with aggressive wound care (eg, sitz baths, debridement) and a 10 to 14 day course of broad-spectrum oral antibiotics. In addition, a low residue diet helps to decrease the frequency of bowel movements, prevent continuous seeding of the wound with liquid stool, and restore some degree of fecal continence. In these patients, surgery is deferred until all signs of infection, induration, and inflammation have subsided. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Choice of sutures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The choice of suture materials is determined by individual surgeon preference. We prefer to use delayed absorbable sutures, such as polyglactin or polyglycolic acid, instead of chromic catgut in the repair of these fistulas. The tensile strength of delayed absorbable sutures is maintained for longer, and the knot is more secure and smaller in size when compared with catgut sutures. Tissue reaction is also less with these suture types. There may also be a role for small-diameter monofilament delayed absorbable and permanent nonbraided sutures in selected patients.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h1">SURGICAL APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surgical approaches to anovaginal or rectovaginal fistula repair are dictated by fistula etiologies. Given that most rectovaginal fistulas result from obstetric trauma, the discussion below will focus on obstetric fistulas.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h2">Fistulas due to obstetric injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For women with anovaginal or rectovaginal fistulas from childbirth, we suggest a simple local repair with or without sphincteroplasty. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17"><span class="h3">Fistulas with intact sphincter: Simple fistulectomy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Small rectovaginal fistulas that do not involve the anal sphincter complex can often be repaired by simple fistulectomy via a transvaginal or transrectal approach. </p><p>An incision is first made around the fistula opening (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81075" href="/d/graphic/81075.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The surgeon's nondominant index finger can be inserted into the rectum during the procedure to assist the repair (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77833" href="/d/graphic/77833.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). Sharp mobilization of the vagina and rectum in a circumferential fashion should be accomplished next by providing traction and countertraction on the edges of the fistula (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73114" href="/d/graphic/73114.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>).</p><p>After the tissue planes are widely mobilized, the entire fistulous tract and any adjacent scar tissue are excised (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56251" href="/d/graphic/56251.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). The edges of the surgical wound should only contain fresh, viable tissue. The edges of the anterior rectal wall are then inverted, either by placing interrupted submucosal stitches of 3-0 or 4-0 delayed absorbable sutures (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52097" href="/d/graphic/52097.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>) or by placing a pursestring suture. The most cephalad and most caudal sutures should be placed at least 5 mm above and below the fistula. A second layer of sutures of 2-0 delayed absorbable type is then placed in the muscularis of the anterior rectal wall to invert and take tension off of the first suture line (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63815" href="/d/graphic/63815.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>). This layer should begin and end approximately 5 mm above and below the first suture line.</p><p>An additional layer of adjacent rectovaginal tissue is then approximated to provide a third layer of closure and take tension off of the underlying layers of repair (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75611" href="/d/graphic/75611.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>). If necessary, a modified Martius graft can be interposed between the rectum and vagina before this step (see <a class="local">'Modified Martius graft'</a> below). Finally, the vaginal mucosa is approximated with a continuous 3-0 suture (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55071" href="/d/graphic/55071.html" rel="external">figure 8</a>). </p><p>Complete hemostasis and closure of all potential dead space must be ascertained. Depending upon the extent of repair, we frequently will place a small vaginal pack soaked in a very dilute Betadine solution or use a petroleum-impregnated gauze to promote hemostasis and provide gentle pressure against the incision line. If placed, the vaginal pack is typically removed within the first 12 to 24 hours postoperatively.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18"><span class="h3">Fistulas with injured sphincter: Transsphincteric approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with concomitant sphincter injury and absent perineal body or a small bridge of perineal skin, fistula repair may be performed in conjunction with repair of the external and internal sphincters and reconstruction of the perineal body and rectovaginal septum. The preferred approach in these patients is a midline perineal incision (transsphincteric or perineoproctomy) with wide mobilization of the posterior vaginal wall, followed by a multilayered closure as described for a chronic third- or fourth-degree laceration (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3270.html" rel="external">"Delayed surgical management of the disrupted anal sphincter"</a>). In all cases, it is important that the fistula tract be excised in its entirety, as discussed above.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19"><span class="h3">Fistulas above the sphincter: Transverse transperineal approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Rectovaginal fistulas located above the sphincter complex should be approached with a transverse transperineal incision. This approach allows the surgeon to preserve the intact internal and external anal sphincter and allows wide mobilization of the rectal and vaginal tissue [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. A transverse incision is made across the perineal body above the sphincter complex. Dissection is then carried out in the true rectovaginal space between the anterior rectal wall and the posterior vaginal wall to mobilize the tissues widely laterally and cephalad to the fistula tract (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62973" href="/d/graphic/62973.html" rel="external">figure 9</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77809" href="/d/graphic/77809.html" rel="external">figure 10</a>). Dissection above the fistula tract is usually easy because the vagina and rectum are only loosely connected above this point.</p><p>The fistula tract and any adjacent scar tissue are then excised with Metzenbaum or Cooley scissors (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57814" href="/d/graphic/57814.html" rel="external">figure 11</a>). The rectal wall defect can be closed either longitudinally or transversely with interrupted 3-0 or 4-0 delayed absorbable sutures to invert the rectal mucosa without tension. We prefer to close the other layers longitudinally in all but the smallest fistulas (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64462" href="/d/graphic/64462.html" rel="external">figure 12</a>). By closing the rectal mucosal and perirectal fascial layers longitudinally, the anal canal is lengthened, which may help to reestablish the high-pressure zone of the anal canal. Closing the vaginal mucosa and perineal body longitudinally helps to avoid narrowing the vaginal introitus and also lengthens the perineal body.</p><p>Alternatively, the rectal and vaginal defects may be closed in perpendicular directions to each other to avoid overlapping suture lines. With this approach, the rectal defect should be closed transversely and the vaginal mucosa closed longitudinally to minimize narrowing of the vaginal introitus and avoid creation of a transverse ridge across the posterior vaginal wall, which can cause dyspareunia.</p><p>The second layer of closure is placed into the muscularis of the rectum in the same direction as the first layer, thus imbricating the first layer and reinforcing the closure (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77342" href="/d/graphic/77342.html" rel="external">figure 13</a>). The puborectalis muscles are approximated in the midline, providing an additional reinforcing layer between the anterior rectal and posterior vaginal walls (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55330" href="/d/graphic/55330.html" rel="external">figure 14</a>).</p><p>The subcutaneous tissues and skin of the perineal body can be approximated with a running nonlocking suture. The skin is closed with interrupted mattress sutures or a running closure of 4-0 delayed absorbable suture (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64822" href="/d/graphic/64822.html" rel="external">figure 15</a>). </p><p>Following this procedure, patients are generally hospitalized overnight for pelvic rest (no vaginal insertions), pain control, observation for bleeding, and vaginal pack removal.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H609251481"><span class="h2">Fistulas due to radiation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Fistula formation following radiotherapy is believed to be the result of progressive endarteritis obliterans and tissue hypoxia. These fistulas can occur years after the completion of radiotherapy, can be large, and can appear high in the posterior vaginal wall. They are often associated with rectal stricture due to perirectal fibrosis. Refinements in modern radiotherapy have led to a decline in radiation-induced fistulas.</p><p>Radiation-induced fistulas can be either low fistulas or high fistulas. Low fistulas can be repaired locally with interposition of a fat graft, usually of a modified Martius type. High fistulas need to be approached transabdominally with interposition of an omental flap, a muscle flap, or a bowel onlay patch (Bricker-Johnson procedure). Permanent diverting colostomy should be performed when radiation necrosis is extensive, and temporary colostomy or ileostomy should be considered for all radiation-related fistulas.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H609251613"><span class="h3">Low fistulas: Local repair with Martius graft interposition</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Successful local repair of radiation-induced fistulas needs to follow the basic surgical principles of other fistula repairs (see <a class="local">'Basic principles'</a> above). Repair should be delayed until the radiation-induced necrosis process has resolved. A preoperative diverting colostomy diverts fecal stream away from the fistula area to allow for healing. At the beginning of the repair, margins of the fistula should be biopsied to exclude residual or recurrent malignancy. At the end of the repair, a Martius graft should be interposed between the vagina and the rectum to bring in new blood supply, especially in patients with extensive tissue excision. Before the temporary diverting ostomy is taken down, the closure of the defect should be tested by placing water in the vagina and air in the rectum as described above. The success of radiation-induced fistula repair varies widely between series [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Modified Martius graft'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H609251619"><span class="h3">High fistulas: Transabdominal repair with tissue interposition</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>High rectovaginal fistulas caused by radiation damage often need to be approached transabdominally. The transabdominal approach is facilitated by use of long instruments and retractors, such as those used in thoracic or deep pelvic surgery. A preoperative diverting colostomy diverts fecal stream away from the fistula area to allow for healing.</p><p>First, the rectum and vaginal apex are widely mobilized from the fistulous communication. All of the scarred, fibrous, and nonviable tissues are then resected from the fistulous site. This is then followed by multilayered closures of the rectum and vagina.</p><p>Serosal dissection on the rectal side can be extensive, especially when the fistula opening is large. Excessive dissection can disrupt a significant portion of the blood supply to the bowel, thereby interfering with successful closure and healing of the fistula. If extensive bowel ischemia is present, a segmental resection and primary anastomosis of compromised bowel may be necessary. Extensive radiation-induced bowel ischemia may necessitate the use of a permanent diverting colostomy as the definitive procedure to control a rectovaginal fistula.</p><p>In repairing high fistulas due to radiation, it is also essential to interpose well-vascularized tissue between the rectum and the vagina to bring in new blood supply, fill in dead space, and therefore prevent recurrence. Such well-vascularized tissues include omentum, muscle, or healthy bowel, as long as they can be mobilized to the deep pelvis [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An omental J-flap is created by detaching the omentum from the transverse colon while leaving it attached to the stomach. A J-shaped incision is then made approximately 4 cm inside the lateral border of the omentum adjacent to the edge of the stomach, down past the most distal and lateral termination of the mesenteric vessels within the omental apron. This flap is then rotated down to the fistula site and sutured in place between the rectum and the vagina.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A segment of the rectus abdominis muscle can be interposed between the rectum and vagina. This also provides excellent neovascularity and tissue support to the fistula repair site.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Because patients will have undergone a diverting colostomy, it is possible to use the proximal end of the bypassed colon as an onlay patch for the fistula repair (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101764" href="/d/graphic/101764.html" rel="external">figure 16</a>). The proximal colon is nonradiated and brings its own blood supply. The procedure requires minimal dissection of the rectal ampulla, and the presacral space is never entered. After fistula healing is confirmed, the colostomy can be reversed by suturing to the loop of colon used in the fistula repair [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H609251550"><span class="h2">Fistulas due to inflammatory bowel disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Rectovaginal fistulas have been associated with inflammatory bowel disease, particularly Crohn disease. Successful local repair is predicated upon controlling the disease process itself and timing the repair during periods of remission. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4070.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of Crohn disease in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Fistulas associated with Crohn disease may be single or multiple, and a single vaginal opening may be connected with multiple tracts leading to the anus with microabscesses developing along the way. </p><p>Local repair of Crohn fistula should not be attempted until the patient's Crohn symptoms are fully controlled and there is no longer any evidence of active proctitis on proctoscopy examination. The timing of such a repair procedure is usually decided jointly by a gynecologist, a colorectal surgeon, and a gastroenterologist treating the patient. </p><p>A transverse, transperineal approach is often ideal in these women as the sphincter complex tends to be uninvolved (see <a class="local">'Fistulas above the sphincter: Transverse transperineal approach'</a> above). All branches of the fistulous tract should be resected. A modified Martius graft can bring in additional tissue and blood supply to cover large tissue defects resulting from complete excision of the affected area (see <a class="local">'Modified Martius graft'</a> below). A colostomy is often performed in these patients to promote healing by diverting fecal stream. Despite all these efforts, recurrence rates remain high in this group of patients. Thus, they need to be appropriately counseled. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20"><span class="h2">Other complex fistulas</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Rectovaginal fistulas can also develop from pelvic malignancies or as complications following pelvic surgeries done for endometriosis or diverticular disease. These fistulas are usually high fistulas, and therefore a transabdominal procedure should be used for their repair. Minimally invasive, including robotic, techniques have been employed successfully, using the same surgical principles described above to achieve adequate visualization and bowel mobilization [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. (See <a class="local">'High fistulas: Transabdominal repair with tissue interposition'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17777376"><span class="h2">Adjuvant techniques</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17777382"><span class="h3">Modified Martius graft</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A modified Martius graft is a bulbocavernosus muscle or labial fat pad graft used in closing large or difficult rectovaginal or vesicovaginal fistulas. A Martius graft does not provide any significant structural support to the repair, but it provides neovascularity, fills in dead space, and enhances granulation tissue formation at the site of repair. </p><p>A modified Martius graft can be used in patients with complex fistulas caused by inflammatory bowel disease or radiation injury, as well as in patients with recurrent fistulas. It is most useful in the repair of rectovaginal fistulas located in the middle to upper third of the vaginal vault, where there may not be sufficient tissue to transpose between the vagina and the rectum. </p><p>The procedure involves transposing a vascularized graft made of healthy tissue to the repair site [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. First, a vertical incision is made over the labia majora to expose the labial fat pad (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64244" href="/d/graphic/64244.html" rel="external">figure 17</a>). The labial fat pad is then sharply mobilized with care taken to preserve the blood supply either superiorly or inferiorly (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74982" href="/d/graphic/74982.html" rel="external">figure 18</a>). For most repairs, the base of the pedicle should be on the inferior border of the graft, thus allowing the graft to be rotated medially without significant tension. The graft is tunneled subcutaneously beneath the vaginal mucosa and labia minora to overlay the repaired fistula site (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50922" href="/d/graphic/50922.html" rel="external">figure 19</a>) and secured at its edges with interrupted sutures of 3-0 chromic or delayed absorbable sutures (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65715" href="/d/graphic/65715.html" rel="external">figure 20</a>). The labial incision is closed in two layers (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78486" href="/d/graphic/78486.html" rel="external">figure 21</a>). A typical Martius graft repair of a rectovaginal fistula is depicted in a video clip (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef105453" href="/d/graphic/105453.html" rel="external">movie 1</a>). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17777388"><span class="h3">Diverting colostomy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Diversion of the fecal stream is not required in the management of most anovaginal or rectovaginal fistulas. However, a colostomy is a useful adjunct to the care of complex fistulas associated with a lower healing rate. Examples of such complex fistulas include radiation-induced fistulas, large rectovaginal fistulas with diameter greater than 4 cm, and some fistulas secondary to inflammatory bowel disease. Retrospective series reported improved outcomes with fecal diversion in the management of rectovaginal fistulas associated with Crohn disease [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>].</p><p>In patients with preexisting stoma, surgical repair of the fistula should be delayed until all evidence of inflammation and cellulitis has resolved, typically 8 to 12 weeks after the start of fecal diversion. Takedown of the colostomy is usually performed three to four months after the fistula repair.</p><p>The construction and maintenance of a diverting colostomy is discussed elsewhere.
