         Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) encompasses a spectrum of disorders caused by local proliferation of
         <em>
          Aspergillus
         </em>
         hyphae in patients with underlying structural lung disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will discuss the management of each of the five clinical forms of CPA. The epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of CPA are discussed separately. (See

         A simple aspergilloma is a single aspergilloma that is stable on serial imaging obtained several months apart. Most patients have minimal to no symptoms, although hemoptysis can be a serious complication  (

         Further information about manifestations and diagnosis of simple aspergillomas is found separately. (See

         For patients with minimal to no symptoms and no hemoptysis, we do not treat with antifungal therapy or any other therapeutic intervention  (

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         We obtain annual imaging (with x-ray or low-dose computed tomography [CT], depending on diagnostic certainty) to confirm stability or improvement; typically, annual imaging continues indefinitely because these patients have underlying chronic lung disease that warrants annual screening. Most aspergillomas do not spontaneously resolve.

         Enlargement or development of surrounding parenchymal disease suggests evolution to chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis (CCPA) or a concomitant process (eg, mycobacterial infection, cavitary lung cancer), as discussed separately. (See

         Hemoptysis is not uncommon in patients with CPA, including those with simple aspergilloma. Life-threatening hemoptysis is the most feared complication of simple aspergilloma.

          Low-grade hemoptysis
         </strong>
         – For patients with simple aspergilloma whose hemoptysis is low grade (ie, blood-streaked sputum only) or infrequent, we typically follow these patients in the same manner as patients without hemoptysis, as described above  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef142609" href="/z/d/graphic/142609.html" rel="external">

          Surgery
         </strong>
         – For patients with simple aspergilloma undergoing surgery, we typically do not provide preoperative antifungal therapy. However, if spillage of fungal contents is anticipated during surgery because of pleural involvement or surgical complexity, we prescribe oral antifungal therapy with an azole for two to three weeks prior to surgery, if possible; if surgery is imminent or there is concern for azole resistance, we give an echinocandin (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10141" href="/z/d/drug information/10141.html" rel="external">
          micafungin

         ) on the day of surgery. Antifungal options are the same as for other forms of CPA. (See

          'Azoles as the preferred antifungal'

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         In our experience, surgery results in resolution of hemoptysis in most patients with simple aspergilloma. However, relapse of fungal disease is not uncommon, occurring in 12 (43 percent) of 28 patients with surgically treated simple aspergilloma in one observational study; relapse usually occurred within three years [

If the nodule has resolved or is unchanged, we stop antifungal therapy and repeat a CT scan in one year. If the nodule is reduced, we continue antifungal therapy and repeat a CT scan in three to six months. If the nodule has enlarged, we typically pursue biopsy or resection.

         For patients who have not received antifungal therapy and their imaging reveals an enlarging or changing nodule, progression to CCPA should be considered, particularly with compatible radiological features, such as progression to a cavitating nodule with or without intracavitary material.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients whose imaging shows recurrent or worsening disease despite antifungal therapy often require repeat tissue sampling. Potential diagnoses include malignancy, a concomitant process (eg, mycobacterial infection), progression to CCPA, antifungal resistance, and suboptimal drug levels. Tissue sampling (via biopsy or excision) allows diagnosis of many of these conditions; all samples should undergo histopathologic examination as well as fungal, mycobacterial, and bacterial cultures with susceptibility testing. Recurrence of nodules after resection or resolution should not be assumed to be due to
         <em>
          Aspergillus
         </em>
         [

        </p>
        <p>
         Imaging that reveals new or worsening cavitation in a nodule without evidence of nodule enlargement can be difficult to interpret. Cavitation can be an inconsequential finding in an
         <em>
          Aspergillus
         </em>
         nodule. However, it can also be indicative of evolution to CCPA or a concomitant process (eg, cavitary lung cancer, mycobacterial infection). We typically increase the frequency of imaging in these patients and have a low threshold for tissue sampling.

         CCPA is a chronically progressive disease that is challenging to treat. Although cure of the disease is sometimes possible, in many cases the goals of treatment are to achieve clinical and radiographic stability or improvement and to prevent hemoptysis. Although improvement is the primary aim, stability is often what is achieved and may be considered a satisfactory outcome in patients who had been significantly deteriorating before treatment and/or have high burden of disease. Clinical and radiological improvement may take several months to achieve.
        </p>
        <p>
         Available data suggest that 60 to 80 percent of patients with CCPA achieve stability or improvement on therapy [

         For most patients with CCPA, we suggest treatment with antifungals starting at the time of diagnosis.

        <p>
         Therapy may be deferred in a select group of patients, specifically those who have no or very mild symptoms and have no evidence of progression on recent radiologic assessments. Untreated patients need frequent clinical and radiographic assessments, since untreated CCPA typically progresses over time. We typically clinically assess untreated patients with CCPA every three months and obtain CT scans every 6 to 12 months.

         Four weeks after initiating antifungal therapy, we see patients in clinic for their first follow-up visit. The visit allows us to evaluate clinical status and identify adverse effects from the antifungal medication. We do not anticipate significant improvement in the patient's clinical status by this time; in fact, some patients will appear to be worsening because it sometimes takes weeks for antifungals to reverse the underlying disease process.
        </p>
        <p>
         For most patients, we evaluate clinical and radiographic response (with CT scan) six months after initiation of therapy. Clinical improvement manifests as weight gain, improvement in constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, and reduction in respiratory symptoms such as productive cough or hemoptysis. To assess clinical response, some experts utilize the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]; others use the Respiratory Symptom Score (RSS), which assesses cough, sputum production, dyspnea, hemoptysis, chest tightness, and nocturnal awakening on a visual 10-point analog scale [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26

        <p>
         A favorable response on a CT scan is a reduction in pleural thickening, consolidation, cavity size, thickness of the cavity wall, and size and number of aspergillomas and nodules  (

          Drug-related adverse effects

          Patients on oral azole therapy
         </strong>
         – Most patients require extended courses of therapy. We assess for response after six months but usually continue treatment for at least 12 months. We discontinue therapy if clinical improvement has occurred and imaging reveals no evidence of active disease. Active disease on imaging is manifest as continued aspergilloma, thick walls on cavities, consolidation, or pleural thickening. We tend to recommend indefinite antifungal therapy in patients with a history of significant hemoptysis who have persistent disease such as aspergillomas. Patients with extensive and/or bilateral disease often remain on antifungals for years or for the rest of their lives  (

         In some cases, radiologic findings persist over long periods on antifungal therapy without appreciable change over serial imaging and with minimal symptoms. In those cases, the decision to stop should be individualized considering tolerability of antifungals, patient preference, and risk of relapse. (See

         – For the subset of patients on intravenous therapy because oral antifungals are not an option, determining the appropriate duration can be challenging. Our approach is to provide intravenous therapy, preferably via an OPAT service, for three to six weeks, after which we assess clinical and radiographic response. For patients who have a favorable response and subsequently deteriorate, we repeat intravenous courses as needed. Patients with unfavorable responses are discussed below. (See

         – For patients on an oral azole, ensure that drug levels are within the therapeutic range and adjust dosages if necessary.

         – In some patients, antifungals are unable to overcome high burden of disease. For these individuals, we sometimes give a course of intravenous antifungal therapy; in our experience, a brief course of intravenous therapy may lead to clinical improvement that can be maintained with subsequent oral azole therapy, even if failure of initial azole therapy was documented [

         For patients with unilateral localized disease failing to respond to antifungal therapy, we sometimes offer surgical consultation to debulk the infection. In this subset of patients, surgery is performed with a curative intent (ie, by removing all affected lung tissue). In the weeks leading up to surgery, we try to optimize patients' surgical outcome by maximizing nutritional and cardiopulmonary status. Even without cure, surgery may debulk the infection enough to allow antifungal therapy to be effective against residual disease.

         CFPA represents an advanced form of CCPA; therefore, these patients may have already received antifungal treatment and may have developed toxicity or resistance [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients who have progressed from CCPA to CFPA while on antifungal therapy, non-azole agents are often required. For patients whose initial diagnosis is CFPA, treatment is the same as CCPA. Antifungal regimens are outlined above. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Antifungal therapy'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Because of the refractory nature of CFPA, lifelong therapy is usually necessary. These patients should be managed in conjunction with CPA specialists, if possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         The prognosis for CFPA has not been adequately studied, but it is worse than that of CCPA based on our experience. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Mortality'

         Unlike other forms of CPA, SAIA is characterized by invasion of lung tissue by
         <em>
          Aspergillus
         </em>
         hyphae. For this reason, antifungal selections for SAIA are the same as for invasive aspergillosis. (See

          "Treatment and prevention of invasive aspergillosis"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, the duration of treatment for SAIA is usually longer than the 6- to 12-week duration usually recommended for invasive aspergillosis. Often, a six-month course is provided [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In some cases, SAIA progresses into cavities with aspergillomas, at which point it is treated as CCPA.
        </p>
        <p>
         SAIA is treated with the intention to cure more often than CCPA [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. While SAIA responds slower than invasive aspergillosis, response is usually faster and more complete than CCPA. The more rapid response of SAIA is thought to be due to its shorter onset and lack of pre-existing cavities as well as the capability of reducing immunosuppression in some patients [
         <a href="#rid49">

         A small subset of patients may simultaneously have CPA and other infections, usually non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM).
        </p>
        <p>
         Although many of these patients have significant comorbidities, the main challenge is the drug interaction between azoles and rifamycins that often causes subtherapeutic or undetectable azole levels. However, therapeutic levels of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9479" href="/z/d/drug information/9479.html" rel="external">
          posaconazole

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         If we are unable to treat both infections simultaneously, our approach is to prioritize the treatment of the condition felt to contribute most to the patient's disease. For example, we may prioritize NTM treatment in patients with smear-positive disease whereas CPA treatment may be prioritized in patients with large aspergillomas.

         – For patients with simple aspergilloma who have no or minimal hemoptysis, we suggest not administering antifungal therapy  (

         For patients with severe hemoptysis, we suggest surgical resection rather than antifungal therapy or bronchial artery embolization  (

          Chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis (CCPA)

         – Patients with CCPA usually require antifungal therapy; CCPA is otherwise a chronic progressive disease. The available evidence (mostly uncontrolled observational reports) suggests that 60 to 80 percent of patients stabilize or improve on treatment. We administer a minimum of six months of antifungal therapy and often provide longer or lifelong therapy due to persistent residual disease while on therapy. (See
