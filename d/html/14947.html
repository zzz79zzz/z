Obesity is increasing in prevalence in the United States (US), Canada, and worldwide [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 42.4 percent of the US population has obesity [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) reports that the number of bariatric surgeries performed annually continues to rise in the US [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5372.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Prevalence, screening, and evaluation", section on 'Screening'</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will focus on the criteria for accreditation as a Center of Excellence in bariatric care and the structural adjustments, appropriate allied health staffing, and training that are necessary for a facility to properly accommodate bariatric surgical patients. The general approach to the management of obesity and a description of the operations, indications and preoperative preparation, and outcomes are discussed elsewhere.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5371.html" rel="external">"Obesity in adults: Overview of management"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/586.html" rel="external">"Bariatric surgery for management of obesity: Indications and preoperative preparation"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/88536.html" rel="external">"Bariatric procedures for the management of severe obesity: Descriptions"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90469.html" rel="external">"Outcomes of bariatric surgery"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2116156"><span class="h1">CRITICAL REVIEW</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The criteria for designation as a United States (US) bariatric Center of Excellence (COE) discussed in this topic are the best practices for bariatric surgical care. They represent the guidelines endorsed by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) and the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) and follow the criteria established for a US bariatric COE. We advise that hospitals that perform bariatric surgery be accredited as at this time accreditation is the best approach to ensure adherence to these criteria, which are associated with improved patient outcomes. (See <a class="local">'Criteria for accreditation'</a> below.)</p><p>In 2006, prompted by concern regarding perioperative safety, the US Centers for Medicaid &amp; Medicare Services (CMS) had restricted coverage of bariatric surgery to hospitals designated as COEs [<a href="#rid7">7-9</a>]. These criteria were scrutinized in a retrospective, longitudinal study that included outcomes data on Medicare patients undergoing bariatric surgical procedures before (n = 6723) and after (n = 15,854) implementation of the policy and found no significant differences for any complication (8.0 versus 7.0 percent), serious complication (3.3 versus 3.6 percent), or reoperation (1.0 versus 1.1 percent) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. In addition, hospitals designated as COEs (n = 179) had similar outcomes data as hospitals without COE accreditation (n = 519), including rates of serious complications (2.2 versus 2.5 percent, respectively). Hence, in light of equivalent complication rates, the CMS has decided not to require COE accreditation for hospitals that perform bariatric surgery for Medicare patients [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. This decision was made, at least in part, to ensure that Medicare patients would not have limited access to bariatric surgical care.</p><p>By contrast, a 2016 systematic review identified 13 studies that examined the impact of bariatric accreditation on surgical outcomes in over 1.5 million patients [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Overall, 10 of 13 studies reported benefit associated with achieving COE accreditation. A mortality benefit for COEs over nonaccredited facilities was reported by six of eight studies, with odds ratios ranging from 2.26 to 3.57. Similarly, morbidity benefit was reported by 8 of 11 studies, with odds ratios ranging from 1.09 to 1.39.</p><p>As such, the CMS decision has been evaluated and strongly criticized by several surgical societies that include the ACS, the ASMBS, the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons, the Obesity Society, and the American Society of Bariatric Physicians [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The criticism of the societies is based upon the consensus that CMS used flawed data to arrive at its conclusions. The rationale for not accepting the CMS new course of action includes:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Outcomes </strong>– The outcomes data referenced by the CMS did not compare the potentially sicker population of Medicare patients who typically are older and have multiple comorbid illnesses. In addition, a cohort study using nationwide Medicare data (n = 47,030) comparing pre-COE and post-COE designation requirements for 90 day outcomes found a 50 percent reduction in mortality, 25 percent reduction in readmission rate, 20 percent reduction in costs, and 33 percent reduction in reoperation rate [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. While some of the improvements may be secondary to the change in procedures performed pre- and post-COE designation requirement, such as the introduction of the laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding procedure to the open and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedures in the post-era, the post-COE designation cohort was comprised of more patients over age 65 years with more comorbidities. Other studies also suggest that accredited centers continue to have better outcomes and lower mortality rates than do nonaccredited centers [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/88536.html" rel="external">"Bariatric procedures for the management of severe obesity: Descriptions"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Volume </strong>– Volume alone does not improve outcomes, as high-volume accredited centers report a lower mortality rate compared with low-volume centers as well as high-volume nonaccredited hospitals. In a retrospective review of 277,760 laparoscopic stapling bariatric surgical procedures performed between 2006 and 2010, the in-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher in low-volume centers (&lt;50 stapling cases/year) compared with high-volume centers (0.17 versus 0.07 percent) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. In addition, the in-hospital mortality rate was significantly lower in the accredited high-volume centers compared with nonaccredited high-volume centers (0.06 versus 0.22 percent). The mortality rates between nonaccredited high-volume centers and low-volume centers was equivalent; hence, the impact of accreditation may be more substantial than volume alone.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Access </strong>– The concern that accreditation would limit access to bariatric surgical care is unfounded. There is no documented evidence that Medicare patients are denied access to accredited centers. Since the initial requirement for COE hospital accreditation, the number of procedures for Medicare beneficiaries has increased [<a href="#rid10">10,14</a>]. The literature does not support the notion that COE accreditation limits access for patients [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Safety</strong> – A major benefit of the hospital COE designation requirement is the ability to collect and analyze data to improve patient safety and outcomes on a national level. Without the COE designation, access to data on this large scale would be extremely difficult. In addition, at this time it is unclear how the private payers (private insurers) will proceed or how access to accredited or nonaccredited centers will be affected with the US Affordable Care Act (ACA). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Access to health care is anticipated to expand in the US because of the ACA, and hence, the number of bariatric procedures performed is most likely to increase. The patient safety concern is that bariatric operations performed at nonaccredited hospitals will continue to have higher mortality rates, independent of volume, as well as higher reoperation rates and higher costs. In addition, Medicare and privately insured patients may not have access to allied health care professionals who provide nutritional, lifestyle, and psychologic counseling and postoperative follow-up that are standard of care in accredited centers. (See <a class="local">'Commitment to high-quality care and the role of allied health care personnel'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Adhering to the standards for the best practices outlined by the ACS and the ASMBS is more important than the official designation as an accredited COE. If there is an institutional commitment to these practices, then, most likely, outcomes will be equivalent to those of the accredited hospitals. However, the accreditation process is the best approach to determine if an individual hospital adheres to the best practice guidelines; it is also the best approach for monitoring individual institutional performance and patient outcomes with the added benefit of comparison to national standards and outcomes data.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8836874"><span class="h1">CRITERIA FOR ACCREDITATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The American College of Surgeons (ACS) and the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) have combined their recommendations and criteria for bariatric Centers of Excellence into the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Project (MBS-AQIP) in order to provide a single resource of the best practices for obesity care for providers and hospitals [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Patient accommodations should be included in every part of the hospital, including outpatient clinics, radiology, the operating room, and the nursing floors. Thus, new guidelines for the design and construction of health care facilities now include bariatric-specific design considerations [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. </p><p>The guidelines include monitoring patient outcomes for COE reaccreditation every three years.</p><p>The 2012 goals of MBS-AQIP include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Accredit metabolic and bariatric surgery programs according to outcomes-based standards</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Establish national/regional and state collaborative to improve care</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decrease morbidity by 50 percent in the next five years</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Improve the value of metabolic surgery by increasing safety, improving efficacy, and decreasing the cost of health care</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Share best practices</p><p></p><p>The accreditation process includes credentialing surgeons, creating a national data registry of 100 percent of cases done by the accredited facilities, and performing bariatric center site visits. The criteria also include establishing a national collaborative network to include outreach to payers and patients centered on safety. The seven core standards for accreditation under MBS-AQIP are case volume, commitment to quality care, data collection, critical care support, appropriate equipment and instruments, continuum of care, and continuous quality improvement process [<a href="#rid12">12,20</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2450958032"><span class="h2">Surgeons and case volume</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The 2012 ACS/ASMBS guidelines for credentialing bariatric surgeons include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hospital privileges to perform gastrointestinal and advanced laparoscopic operations. The hospital must perform 50 bariatric stapling procedures annually in a comprehensive center. In a low-acuity center, 25 bariatric procedures are required annually. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Formal didactic training in bariatric procedures with documentation. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If no formal training, documented experience in bariatric surgery, such as case logs or participation in a Center of Excellence program. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Participation in the bariatric surgery service call schedule so that surgical coverage is provided 24 hours per day, 7 days per week for bariatric patients.

General surgeons can be used in lieu of or in conjunction with bariatric surgeons if they are credentialed with general surgery privileges and they undergo training so they are familiar with the bariatric procedures performed at their center, the signs and symptoms of postoperative complications, and the center's clinical care pathways.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22371056"><span class="h2">Facilities/equipment/instruments</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Appropriate adjustments for patients with obesity should be made in all areas where patient care is given. The following are guidelines for the essential requirements for most bariatric patients. For the rare patient whose body mass index (BMI) is over 60 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, a protocol should be in place regarding where to rent or lease equipment [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Hospitals that are performing bariatric surgery should ensure that all of the minimum recommendations are followed [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22371063"><span class="h3">Nursing floors and space</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Structural changes may require major reconstruction to make sure that all areas of the hospital can accommodate the larger stretchers and wheelchairs used to transport patients [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. The Facility Guidelines Institute recommends the following dimensions for hospitals that care for bariatric patients [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Building entry points should have door widths with a minimum of 3 feet 2 inches. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ample-sized wheelchairs should be available at the front door of the hospital.

(See <a class="local">'Toilets'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clearance of 5 feet should be provided on both sides of each bed and at the foot of the bed between patient beds to allow for staff assistance.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bathroom doors should be at least 3 feet 9 inches wide. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient room doors should be at least 4 feet 4 inches wide to allow for the passage of stretchers.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Corridor hallways should be 5 feet wide.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22371070"><span class="h3">Beds</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most regular hospitals beds can handle patients up to 440 lbs; however, these beds are probably too narrow at 35 to 36 inches, making it difficult for bariatric patients to reach the adjustment buttons or operate the side rails [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Bariatric beds should be at least 44 inches wide and support up to 1000 lbs. The mattresses should be the low air loss type so patients will not tend to sink in their beds [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. The low air loss mattresses make it easier for patients to get out of bed and thus assist with preventing skin breakdown. It is optimal if the beds can be automatically adjusted into a chair position so patients can walk out of their beds from the seated position [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22371077"><span class="h3">Walkers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Walkers should be at least 28 inches wide and support up to 750 lbs.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22371084"><span class="h3">Toilets</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Floor-mounted toilets help prevent patient falls and damage to the facilities. Floor-mounted bariatric toilets can support up to 1000 lbs (453 kg), while most standard wall-mounted commodes have a 250 lb weight limit [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Toilets should have enough room to allow a person on each side of the commode to assist with the transfer of a bariatric patient on and off the toilet. In addition, handrails should be placed on the walls so that patients can lift themselves onto and up from the toilet. Often these toilets need to be set 24 inches off a wall with handrails, which is 6 inches further than the Americans with Disabilities (ADA) act requirements. Patients who weigh over 500 pounds cannot sit comfortably on a standard toilet, because it is too close to the wall.</p><p>Appropriately sized bedside commodes are also necessary for patients who cannot ambulate safely to the bathroom.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1036774509"><span class="h3">Showers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>To accommodate bariatric patients, shower stalls should be 4 x 5 ft (1.2 m x 1.5 m) rather than the standard 3 x 3 ft (0.9 m x 0.9 m), and handheld nozzles should be mounted on the sidewalls of the shower rather than the back so they are easier to reach and use. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22371091"><span class="h3">Patient lifts</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patient lifts are essential for moving bariatric patients and need to be ceiling mounted. Most standard lifts can accommodate up to 600 lbs, while the bariatric ones can handle up to 1000 lbs [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. The use of proper lifting equipment protects staff from injury and is safer for patients [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22371098"><span class="h3">Wheelchairs and chairs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bariatric wheelchairs should be 30 to 39 inches wide and be able to accommodate up to 800 lbs.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22371105"><span class="h3">Monitoring and safety devices</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Immediate postoperative bariatric patients should be placed in a monitored setting because tachycardia and respiratory distress are two of the most sensitive symptoms of a gastrointestinal leak [<a href="#rid28">28</a>] and other complications. Extra wide blood pressure cuffs, appropriately sized sequential compression devices, biphasic defibrillators, and emergency airway equipment should be readily available [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Because obstructive sleep apnea is often diagnosed in this population, continuous positive airway pressure devices (CPAP) should be available [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13518.html" rel="external">"Postoperative management of adults with obstructive sleep apnea"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22371119"><span class="h3">Operating rooms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A bariatric operating room (OR) should be 600 square feet. According to the Association of Operating Room Nurses (AORN) bariatric surgery guidelines, OR bariatric beds should have the capacity to hold 1000 lbs with 600 lbs tilt capacity [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. The OR tables should also have side extenders, footboards, sufficient arm holders, and foam padding available for the arms, heels, and feet to prevent falls and pressure injuries [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Because bariatric patients are not likely to be able to transfer themselves after recently having had general anesthesia, lifts or other appropriate moving devices, like an air mattress, should be utilized to facilitate easy transfer [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].

To evaluate for leak, most bariatric surgeons will opt for a fluoroscopic upper gastrointestinal series or a computed tomography (CT) scan with oral contrast. Bariatric patients should not be asked to ingest several hundred milliliters of contrast. Most studies can be effectively done with 100 milliliters taken just prior to lying down for the studies. Most CT scanners have a weight limit of 400 lbs, which should be enough for most bariatric patients, although scanners with a weight capacity of 600 lbs are available [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. However, standard fluoroscopic units usually have a weight limit of 300 to 350 lbs and have only 45 to 50 cm of clearance between the tabletop and the image intensifier, and 70 cm is recommended for bariatric patients [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Large round hoops can be employed to measure the patient before transport to ensure that the patient will fit in the imaging apparatus [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. If the facilities for CT scan or fluoroscopy cannot accommodate the patient, then the best option to effectively rule out a leak is a laparoscopy or laparotomy.

It may require two nurses instead of one to help a patient bathe or get out of bed to a chair. Caring for bariatric patients without appropriate staffing or equipment can result in injury to the provider, lost days of work, and loss of income for the hospital and the worker.

RDs should work with the hospital food service department to develop post-bariatric surgery meals that are high in protein and low in carbohydrates and fat in the appropriate portion sizes, ensuring that if a "regular" diet is ordered for a post-bariatric patient, a proper diet is delivered. Bariatric-specific diets can be especially helpful in the immediate postoperative period when the recommendations are for clear liquids and full liquids, ensuring that the meals are augmented with protein drinks to ensure adequate protein intake. RDs can help prepare bariatric patients for the postoperative diet changes by educating patients on portion control and maintenance of adequate nutrition. Without such education, patients may eat more fat and calories than they realize.

The lifelong incidence of malnutrition after weight loss surgery can be as high as 44 percent and can occur many years after the procedure [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. This is usually a consequence of poor eating habits. In addition, patients do not always understand the need for careful, long-term follow-up and may not be taking vitamins or may be taking the wrong doses or types of nutrient and vitamin supplementation for the type of bariatric surgical procedure they underwent. In one study of 133 admissions of patients who had undergone a bariatric procedure, only 33 percent of these patients were taking a multivitamin [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. The diagnosis and management of nutritional deficiencies after bariatric surgery is discussed elsewhere.

In addition, higher rates of suicide, substance abuse, and divorce after bariatric surgery have been documented when compared with the general population [<a href="#rid49">49,50</a>]. While none of these are a contraindication to surgery, these disorders should be controlled prior to undergoing surgical weight loss in an effort to reduce recidivism and produce greater sustained weight loss [<a href="#rid47">47</a>].
