         Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), one of the most common neuropsychiatric disorders of childhood and adolescence, often persists into adulthood [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Studies have found that a majority of people diagnosed with ADHD in childhood continue to meet criteria for the disorder as adults [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. More recent studies have found that a substantial proportion of those with adult ADHD did not
         <strong>
         </strong>
         have the condition in childhood. ADHD in adulthood is associated with significant impairment in occupational, academic, and social functioning.
        </p>
        <p>
         ADHD in adults is characterized by symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and restlessness, resulting in functional impairment. Impairment in executive function is common. Emotional dysregulation is often seen in these patients.

         This topic discusses the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of ADHD in adults. Treatment overview of ADHD in adults, including treatment choices, pharmacotherapy, and psychotherapy are discussed elsewhere and in algorithms  (

As people with ADHD age, the likelihood of anxiety, depression, SUD, and antisocial personality disorder increases and often becomes more evident, while the underlying ADHD becomes less evident. In our clinical experience, adults with ADHD are commonly diagnosed and treated for a comorbid condition, while ADHD is often unrecognized and untreated.

         The pathogenesis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults is not known. The most noticeable deficits in the area of attention are, in general, related to frontal-subcortical dysfunction and deal with executive function [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. However, adults with ADHD also suffer from impairments unrelated to executive functioning, including memory impairments, and information processing speed deficits. (See

          Neuroimaging
         </strong>
         – Both structural and functional imaging studies of adults, using either computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, show evidence of structural brain abnormalities among ADHD patients. These abnormalities are related to the functional impairments seen in ADHD [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. The most common findings are smaller volumes in the frontal cortex, cerebellum, and subcortical structures and abnormalities in the prefrontal (especially right fronto-subcortical) and parietal circuits [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Additionally, in individuals with ADHD, dysfunction is found in the caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus, three subcortical structures which are part of the neural circuitry underlying motor control, executive functions, inhibition of behavior, and the modulation of reward pathways. These frontal-striatal-pallidal-thalamic circuits provide feedback to the cortex for the regulation of behavior [
         <a href="#rid12">

          Neurotransmitters
         </strong>
         – Because of the catecholaminergic nature of many of these brain circuits, hypoactivity of dopamine and norepinephrine in frontal-subcortical circuits underlies the brain and functional dysfunction in ADHD [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Noradrenaline and dopamine exert neuromodulatory influences over behavior and cognition through fronto-striato-cerebellar circuitry [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. ADHD medications that block the dopamine transporter or the norepinephrine transporter increase free brain levels of noradrenaline and dopamine by blocking reuptake and triggering release. These medications are thought to target the systems to ameliorate problems with impulsivity, inattention, and hyperactivity. [

         The risk of ADHD in parents and siblings of children with ADHD is increased two to eight times [
         <a href="#rid18">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Results of behavioral genetic investigations using family, twin, and adoption studies converge with those of molecular genetic studies in showing that genes influence susceptibility to ADHD. Several genes have been implicated in the etiology of ADHD, however small their effects. Polymorphisms in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1
         <em>
          ,
         </em>
         SLC6A3) and the dopamine 4 (D4) receptor gene (DRD4) have been most often associated with ADHD [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. This suggests a complex genetic mechanism by which the disorder is caused by the combined actions of several genes interacting with environmental risk factors.

         In a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies on persistent ADHD in adults and ADHD in children, samples from over 17,000 cases and 32,000 controls were analyzed. Results support a shared contribution of common genetic variants to ADHD in children and adults [

         Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults is characterized by symptoms of executive dysfunction, inattention, impulsiveness, restlessness, and emotional dysregulation. These symptoms collectively lead to marked deficits in functioning [

        <p>
         The predominant features of ADHD in adults differ from typical ADHD features in children. Symptoms of hyperactivity or impulsivity are less obvious or overt in adults (eg, impulsivity may be seen in verbalizations rather than physical behavior); symptoms of inattention are more prominent.

         The predominant inattention symptoms of ADHD in adults are primarily manifested in problems remaining focused on a task, especially for long periods. Such adults often have difficulties in organizing activities, prioritizing tasks, following through and completing tasks, forgetfulness, and time management (eg, missing appointments or deadlines) [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23,24
         </a>
         ]. Adults with ADHD will often report that tasks are finished only at deadlines, often late or even not at all. Increased problems related to driving, including increases in driving errors, traffic tickets, and speeding may be related to attention deficits. For example, in a prospective study including 2832 older adult drivers (age 65 to 79 years; mean = 71 years) individuals with ADHD had an increased risk of self-reported traffic ticket events (relative risk 2.02, 95% CI 1.42-2.88), increased risk of self-report vehicular crashes (relative risk 1.74, 95% CI 1.26-2.40), and higher incidence of hard-braking events (relative risk 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.12) as compared with older adults without ADHD [

         Impulsivity in adult ADHD is characterized by excessive involvement in activities or speech that has a high potential for consequences. Impulsivity in adults often results in more serious consequences than during childhood and may include premature termination of relationships or quitting jobs without having any alternative [

These mood symptoms are commonly referred to as emotional dysregulation, which is the inability to manage uncomfortable emotions when necessary, and to engage in appropriate behavior (eg, go to work, engage in social relationships) when distressed. In a meta-analysis of 13 studies involving 2535 adults with ADHD, subjects with ADHD showed higher levels of general emotional dysregulation than healthy controls [

Excess mortality remained present in persons without more common, higher risk co-morbidities of ADHD (oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and substance use disorder). Accidents were the most common cause of death among persons with ADHD. Excess mortality was higher among individuals diagnosed with ADHD as adults compared to those diagnosed prior to age 18 years.

         Several patient and family characteristics have been identified as increasing the likelihood of persistence of adult ADHD symptoms. In a multivariate analysis of longitudinally collected data from 453 participants with ADHD (mean age 25 years), patient, parent, and family characteristics collected at initial assessment were examined [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. The most important childhood predictors of adult ADHD symptom persistence were initial ADHD symptom severity (odds ratio 1.89, standard error 0.28), comorbidities (odds ratio 1.19, standard error 0.07), and parental mental health problems (odds ratio 1.30, standard error 0.09).
        </p>
        <p>
         Additionally, in one prospective follow-up study of 344 Brazilians with childhood ADHD, the persistence of ADHD into adulthood was associated with higher numbers of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms, and with co-occurring oppositional defiant disorder and social phobia at study entry [

         Some evidence suggests that a proportion of patients with adult ADHD experience a reduction or remission of symptoms. As an example, in the prospective follow-up study of Brazilians with ADHD, one-third of participants did not meet diagnostic criteria for the disorder after an average 7.3 years and 12.4 percent of the sample met criteria for full remission (less than four symptoms) [

         The domains of emotional, educational, and social adjustment follow variable courses in individuals with ADHD, ranging from poor to good.

         The primary objectives of the assessment of an adult for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is to identify symptoms and behaviors consistent with the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for ADHD, evaluate the patient for impairment attributable to these symptoms, and rule out other disorders such as mood and/or anxiety disorders. The patient’s symptoms should be persistent and severe enough to have contributed to significant psychosocial impairment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Specific impairments should be documented, along with the age of onset of symptoms and impairments. Recall bias can affect the reliability of self-assessment, particularly with ADHD patients [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. Many adults have difficulty recalling when ADHD symptoms began. Obtaining patient history from another adult informant (eg, parent, significant other, friend) can be very useful in making a valid ADHD diagnosis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'DSM-5 diagnostic criteria'

        </p>
        <p>
         The best approach to the assessment of adult ADHD may be to use a combination of a structured or semi-structured diagnostic interview along with a dimensional rating scale that provides quantitative measures of symptom severity and impairment. Neuropsychological testing may be used to complement the interview and rating scale if indicated by other cognitive deficits. (See

         The clinical interview should focus on adult manifestations of ADHD. The DSM criteria for the disorder (DSM-5 and earlier versions) were developed to diagnose ADHD in children, and this is reflected in their content. To assess possible ADHD in adults, the clinician should also ask about common adult manifestations [

         ]. The CAARS comes in formats for self-report and observer report, which provide multimodal assessments of the same behaviors and problems, and contain an identical set of scales, subscales, and indexes. CAARS forms are available in long, short, and screening versions. The reliability and validity of the CAARS-S are satisfactory. Nine empirically derived scales that help assess a broad range of problem behaviors, including:

         A study of the ability of the CAARS to discriminate between 249 postsecondary students with carefully diagnosed ADHD and 507 clinical controls found that the overall discriminant validity of the CAARS was 69 percent, and it had an unacceptably high false positive and false negative rate [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ]. At lower prevalence rates, a high score on the CAARS displayed only a 22 percent chance of accurately identifying individuals with ADHD. As it frequently misidentifies individuals with other psychological problems as having ADHD, it should not be the sole method of diagnosis.

         — For assessing adults in primary care for ADHD, the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) is a brief and practical choice. ASRS is the World Health Organization's (WHO) rating scale for adult ADHD and is designed to measure current ADHD symptoms [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,53
         </a>
         ]. It consists of 18 items based on DSM-IV symptoms/criteria adapted to adults with ADHD, which are measured on a five-point scale (0 = never/seldom and 4 = very often). ASRS has normative data and information on psychometric properties are available for several populations [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53,54
         </a>
         ]. A shorter self-administered version of ASRS has been developed for screening purposes  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_form graphicRef60498" href="/z/d/graphic/60498.html" rel="external">
          form 1

         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ]. Revision of adult ADHD diagnostic criteria from DSM-IV to DSM-5 has prompted an update in the brief screening scale, which consists of six items from the ASRS [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55
         </a>
         ]. The revised screen has high sensitivity and specificity as well as excellent concordance with blinded clinical diagnosis of ADHD in adults. A study of two general population samples showed that the ASRS resulted in considerable overestimation of ADHD, indicating probable ADHD in 26.0 and 17.3 percent of participants, as compared with expected prevalence of 2.5 percent [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56
         </a>
         ]. These results emphasize the need for rating scales to be complemented by clinical assessment in determining possible cases.

Changes from the DSM-IV include modifications to criterion B, which now requires that several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present prior to age 12 years, versus age 7 years in DSM-IV. Some examples of ADHD symptom manifestations in adults were added to the criteria, which are described as follows:

         The use of a structured or semistructured diagnostic interview, such as the Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in adults (DIVA 5.0) may be best basis for a definitive diagnosis. Although less commonly used than the ADHD scales listed above, the use of a structured interview allows the clinician to inquire about the presence of ADHD symptoms in both adulthood and childhood, the chronicity of these symptoms, and significant impairments resulting from these symptoms. The DIVA provides typical examples of the manifestation of these symptoms which can be used to prompt the assessor and guide clinical judgement.

         The differential diagnosis of ADHD in adults includes disorders that are also commonly comorbid with ADHD such as mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs). Psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia also have prominent cognitive symptoms similar to those noted in ADHD. (See

         Anxiety disorders – ADHD is often accompanied by anxiety. Patients with anxiety disorders can be distracted by the focus of the disorder, which can present similarly to the distractibility seen in ADHD. In contrast to ADHD, distraction with an anxiety disorder only occurs in the presence of the focus of that disorder (eg, when the patient is experiencing obsessional thinking in OCD or is preoccupied with self-conscious ideation in social phobia). The onset of anxiety disorders may be later than the onset of ADHD in adults.

          Epidemiology
         </strong>
         – Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), one of the most common neuropsychiatric disorders of childhood and adolescence, often persists in adults. Studies have found that a majority of people diagnosed with ADHD in childhood continue to meet criteria for the disorder as adults. However, a substantial proportion of those with adult ADHD did not have the condition in childhood. Prevalence studies show widely varied results. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Epidemiology'

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Worldwide, individuals with ADHD are more likely to have comorbid mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders (SUDs) than those without ADHD. (See

         <strong>
          Clinical manifestations
         </strong>
         – ADHD in adults is characterized by symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, restlessness, executive dysfunction, and emotional dysregulation. These symptoms collectively lead to marked deficits in functioning. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical manifestations'

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The predominant features of ADHD in adults differ from typical ADHD features in children. Symptoms of hyperactivity or impulsivity are less obvious or overt in adults (eg, impulsivity may be seen in verbalizations rather than physical behavior). Symptoms of inattention are more prominent in adults.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Adults with ADHD have higher rates of occupational difficulties, criminal activity, substance abuse problems, traffic accidents, and motor vehicle citations compared to adults without ADHD.

          Possible late-onset subtype
         </strong>
         – Studies examining the existence of a late-onset subtype have had mixed results. While some studies have suggested the existence of two syndromes, childhood-onset and adult (or late)-onset ADHD, with distinct developmental trajectories others have questioned the validity of the data supporting the late-onset subtype. (See

         Clinically significant impairments in neuropsychological functioning have been found in some studies of adults with ADHD, although those with adult-onset ADHD may be much less likely to show impaired neuropsychological function and impact on intelligence quotient (IQ) compared with adults who had childhood-onset ADHD.
