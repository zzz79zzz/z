         Foot pain is common among adults and a frequent reason for primary care visits. Nevertheless, as the differential diagnosis for foot pain is broad, and exposure to foot-related problems is often limited during medical training, many clinicians may not be adequately prepared to assess the patient with foot complaints.

         The anatomy and biomechanics of the foot are reviewed separately. Aspects of foot anatomy and biomechanics of special relevance to midfoot conditions and injuries are discussed here  (

        </p>
        <p>
         The midfoot plays a unique role in enabling humans to adapt to uneven surfaces while standing and during gait. The structure and relationship among midfoot bones allows both rotation and stability. This arises primarily from the Chopart joint, which is the articulation of the rear foot with the proximal midfoot bones (the navicular and cuboid)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71857" href="/z/d/graphic/71857.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The motions of the navicular and cuboid involve tendons that assist in gait. The navicular has attachments from the posterior tibialis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef93193" href="/z/d/graphic/93193.html" rel="external">
          figure 3
         </a>
         ), and during propulsion (heel-off and toe-off  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53103" href="/z/d/graphic/53103.html" rel="external">
          figure 4
         </a>
         )), the contraction of this muscle allows the navicular to pronate sufficiently to give a mechanical advantage. The cuboid has a shallow groove on its lateral aspect through which the peroneus (fibularis) longus tendon  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93699" href="/z/d/graphic/93699.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ) passes before traveling medially underneath the foot to plantar attachments at the bases of the metatarsals (MTs). During supinated foot strike, the peroneal tendons provide stability as they are maximally stretched to hold the foot taut. During the push-off phase of gait, the pronation of the foot repositions the peroneal tendons so they are no longer stretched taut and thus can contract to assist plantar flexion.
        </p>
        <p>
         Midfoot rotation is part of a kinetic chain that involves subtalar joint motion. When the calcaneus is in eversion (foot pronation), the axes of the talus and calcaneus are parallel. This allows normal plantarflexion and dorsiflexion. When the calcaneus is in inversion (supinated foot strike), the axes of the calcaneus and talus are not parallel; they intersect. This blocks motion at the Chopart joint [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The second function of the midfoot is to provide a stable base for the MTs. This enables the MTs to function more effectively as levers aiding propulsion at the Lisfranc joint complex  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103036" href="/z/d/graphic/103036.html" rel="external">
          figure 5
         </a>
         ). The more proximal recession of the articulation of the second MT at the tarsometatarsal (TMT) joint provides additional stability, enabling the second ray of the foot to act as the longitudinal axis for foot rotation.

          EPIDEMIOLOGY OF LOCALIZED MIDFOOT PAIN
         </span>
         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         While the incidence of midfoot pain in younger adults varies widely by activity and sport participation, adults over age 50 frequently experience midfoot pain. Surveys from the United Kingdom report that symptomatic midfoot osteoarthritis is present in 12 percent of adults [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Risk factors for midfoot osteoarthritis include female sex, age over 75 years, lower socioeconomic status, and particular occupational exposures. The reason for the higher incidence among females remains uncertain. Subgroup analyses do not show an association between wearing high-heeled shoes and developing midfoot osteoarthritis. Factors such as obesity, previous foot or ankle injury, and generalized joint pain, as well as the presence of osteoarthritis in interphalangeal joints, are all associated with increased incidence. Comorbidities such as diabetes and neurologic conditions are associated with higher rates of midfoot osteoarthritis and foot pain.
        </p>
        <p>
         Any anatomic variant that alters biomechanics and places excessive stress on the midfoot can contribute to midfoot pain and injury. As an example, tarsal coalitions block normal foot rotation and often lock the foot in rigid pronation or, more rarely, supination [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. As rotation helps to dissipate force in the midfoot, this anatomic abnormality increases the risk of injury, particularly to the navicular or cuboid.
        </p>
        <p>
         Arch structure affects the amount of force absorbed by the midfoot. Epidemiologic studies suggest an increased risk of midfoot pain in individuals with either pes cavus (high arch) or pes planus (flat foot), particularly those with chronic pronation [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Pes planus is normal for infants and young children, who have ligamentous laxity, and arch structure evolves as part of normal development. By 10 years, only 4 percent of children manifest pes planus, while adults have a prevalence of 15 to 23 percent. The increased prevalence of pes planus from childhood to adulthood suggests that breakdown of supporting structures, such as the posterior tibialis tendon and spring ligament, occurs throughout life. Obesity may increase the risk [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Individuals who have abnormal arch structure or anatomic problems in the midfoot are more likely to experience pain from demanding weightbearing sports. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6521.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         The Framingham foot study, a structured assessment of foot health in 3378 individuals, included evaluations of arch posture and dynamic foot strike with pronation and supination [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Individuals with pes planus and pronation experienced increased rates of foot pain. Among athletes and military personnel in the study, cavus feet were associated with increased foot pain and injuries. Among older adults whose primary activity was walking, cavus foot and supinated foot strike were not associated with increased pain and were in fact associated with decreased arch and rearfoot pain in females. Arch pain affected significant numbers of study participants, including 5.3 percent of the 1403 males and 8.1 percent of the 1794 females (average age was 66).

         Observation is important when examining the patient complaining of midfoot pain  (

          figure 9
         </a>
         ). Visual inspection allows the clinician to determine whether there is excessive arch height  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82600" href="/z/d/graphic/82600.html" rel="external">
          picture 4

         ) or collapse of the arch  (

          picture 5
         </a>
         ). An extremely prominent navicular tuberosity suggests the possibility of an accessory navicular  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef115869" href="/z/d/graphic/115869.html" rel="external">
          picture 6
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Observing a standing patient from the rear enables the clinician to identify foot pronation and, when this is present, whether the pronation arises from a drop of the midfoot  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef131606" href="/z/d/graphic/131606.html" rel="external">
          picture 7
         </a>
         ) or from rear foot shift secondary to subtalar joint subluxation. Such subluxation manifests as calcaneal valgus  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98818" href="/z/d/graphic/98818.html" rel="external">
          picture 5
         </a>
         ). If such a patient performs a heel raise, the clinician should see inversion of the calcaneus. If not, the patient likely has a posterior tibial tendon rupture.
        </p>
        <p>
         Observing the patient walking or running helps the examiner to determine if there is excess pronation or supination. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113980.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical assessment of walking and running gait"

        <p>
         When osteoarthritis affects the TMT joint (Lisfranc joint)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103036" href="/z/d/graphic/103036.html" rel="external">
          figure 5

          image 1
         </a>
         ), a common site for osteoarthritis of the foot, a ridge is often seen at the articulation of the MT and tarsal bones. This common finding appears like a bump on the medial aspect of the dorsal arch  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98817" href="/z/d/graphic/98817.html" rel="external">
          picture 8
         </a>
         ). Palpation of the TMT joints may reveal warmth, swelling, or tenderness in the setting of osteoarthritis. Bone spurring at the TMT joints feels like a ridge. To assess Lisfranc joint stability (and pain due to an injury causing instability), the examiner stabilizes the midfoot with one hand while grasping the forefoot with the other and moving it into dorsal- and plantarflexion.
        </p>
        <p>
         Palpation of the navicular focuses on the navicular tuberosity. This is the attachment site for an accessory navicular and the site of attachment for the posterior tibialis tendon. The "N spot" is the high point of the dorsal navicular, between the tibialis anterior and extensor hallucis longus tendons, and a common site of tenderness in patients with navicular stress fracture  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105685" href="/z/d/graphic/105685.html" rel="external">
          picture 3
         </a>
         ). Along with palpation, gentle manipulation of the navicular in the vertical plane may reveal excess motion when the spring (calcaneonavicular) ligament is torn or insufficient.
        </p>
        <p>
         Palpation of the cuboid may reveal pain or excess motion. To identify the cuboid, palpate the base of the fifth MT and move proximally until you feel a small bone approximately the width of the thumb. Grasping this bone between the thumb and index finger allows the examiner to assess dorsal and plantar motion  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116333" href="/z/d/graphic/116333.html" rel="external">
          picture 9

         ). When laxity seems greater than the opposite foot, cuboid subluxation may be present.

         The authors begin their assessment of the patient with midfoot pain by obtaining a history. The first determination is whether the pain stems from acute trauma or developed suddenly, or whether it developed in a more chronic manner. If chronic, it is important to ask about any underlying medical condition (eg, diabetes mellitus, arthritis, gout) and whether the pain is associated with or follows a particular activity. It is also important to know about any long-standing structural problems with the foot.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once the distinction between acute and chronic pain is made, location of the pain helps to narrow the likely differential diagnosis. A table and flow chart summarizing common diagnostic considerations in the patient with midfoot pain are provided  (

         In patients with acute traumatic pain along the medial midfoot, the clinician should carefully assess the navicular for swelling and tenderness.

         Location is important for helping to determine the cause of chronic midfoot pain as well. Chronic pain along the medial midfoot should direct the clinician's attention to the navicular and posterior tibial tendon. If the examination reveals focal tenderness or dysfunction involving either structure, the diagnostic evaluation should focus on key problems. These include chronic posterior tibial tendinopathy, partial tear or pain from a symptomatic accessory navicular, and arthritic changes.
        </p>
        <p>
         When there are no obvious positive findings on examination, the clinician should assess the degree of pes planus (ie, flat foot) and assess the patient's gait to detect whether there is significant pronation during the stance phase  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114686" href="/z/d/graphic/114686.html" rel="external">
          picture 10
         </a>
         ), which places increased stress on the medial aspect of the arch and is a likely cause of pain. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113980.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical assessment of walking and running gait"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The approach is similar for chronic lateral foot pain. Important structures to assess include the cuboid, peroneal tendons, and base of the fifth MT. When there are no obvious positive findings on examination, the clinician should assess cuboid stability  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116333" href="/z/d/graphic/116333.html" rel="external">
          picture 9

          movie 1
         </a>
         ). If there are no signs of cuboid instability, the next step is to assess the patient's gait looking for supination during foot strike. This finding suggests that increased stress is being placed on lateral foot structures.

         For patients with chronic plantar surface pain, the clinician should look for signs of tearing in the midportion of the plantar fascia and for abnormal structures that may contribute to pain, such as deep nodules, cysts, atypical bursae, and neuromas. Ultrasound and other imaging tools can help to guide this diagnostic workup [

         The proximal base of the fifth metatarsal (MT) is highly prone to injury. Fractures at the base of the fifth MT and acute tendinous injury of the peroneal tendon (primarily peroneus brevis) near its insertion onto the base of the fifth MT can cause acute pain in this area. Patients complain of pain at the outer aspect of the midfoot and may think they have an ankle sprain. Often, they point directly to the styloid prominence of the fifth MT as the site of pain. The styloid is where the peroneus brevis tendon inserts and is a common location for tendon injury and avulsion fracture  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef98917" href="/z/d/graphic/98917.html" rel="external">
          image 2
         </a>
         ). Other injuries of the proximal fifth MT include proximal diaphyseal (Jones) fractures  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52209" href="/z/d/graphic/52209.html" rel="external">

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Tenderness elicited by squeezing the fifth MT (not the tendon insertion) or by percussion of the bone, or sensitivity in the bone when a tuning fork is placed, suggests a higher likelihood of bone injury. Observational research suggests that Jones fractures may occur more often in those with a high medial arch and a longer fifth MT, anatomic features that increase stress at the proximal portion of the bone [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Injuries of the proximal fifth MT can be difficult to diagnose, and some have high complication rates and so warrant close evaluation, including imaging and possibly referral. Less common clinical conditions that may trigger pain in this location include apophysitis in adolescents or trauma to an os vesalianum (an accessory ossicle found at the base of the fifth MT). (See

         Injuries to the navicular bone and related structures jeopardize the structural integrity of the medial foot arch and thus can lead to severe disability and chronic pain. Therefore, navicular injury is considered high risk, particularly for runners. Such injuries include navicular stress fractures, tendinopathy of the posterior tibialis tendon insertion onto the navicular, traumatic separation of an accessory navicular, and partial or complete tears of the attachment of the plantar calcaneonavicular (ie, spring) ligament. Unless the clinician has experience managing injuries of the medial arch, consultation with a foot and ankle surgeon should be obtained for navicular injuries, including fractures or separation of an accessory navicular, and complete or partial ruptures of the posterior tibialis tendon or spring ligament, as such injuries often compromise the integrity of the longitudinal arch. A rare injury is an isolated dislocation of the navicular without associated fracture [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The navicular serves as the keystone for the medial or longitudinal arch  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97769" href="/z/d/graphic/97769.html" rel="external">
          figure 6
         </a>
         ). Neighboring structures that help to maintain arch integrity include the spring ligament and the posterior tibialis tendon, a large portion of which attaches to the navicular. Complete or partial tear of the spring ligament is the most common cause of loss of longitudinal arch height, followed by complete or partial tears of the posterior tibialis tendon [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16375.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         When a patient complains of medial arch pain, the first thing to determine is whether the longitudinal arch remains intact. This must be done by observing the patient bearing their full weight. Whether the arches of both feet are symmetric can generally be determined by observation alone, but when doubt exists, the examiner can measure the arch height from the floor to a fixed landmark (eg, navicular prominence) while the patient is standing. Acute loss of the arch in one foot implies rupture of either the spring ligament or the posterior tibialis tendon. With either condition, swelling and tenderness are present below the medial malleolus. Unilateral failure of the heel to move into varus during a heel raise suggests the injury is a posterior tibialis rupture. This observation is made most easily by observing the patient from behind while they perform a heel raise  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef131606" href="/z/d/graphic/131606.html" rel="external">

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Anteroposterior and lateral foot radiographs may demonstrate a tarsal coalition  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66078" href="/z/d/graphic/66078.html" rel="external">
          image 5
         </a>
         ) or arthritic spurring in the tarsal tunnel or along the medial malleolus. Depending on available resources, clinicians may choose magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound to help diagnose posterior tibial tendon injury as limited studies demonstrate comparable accuracy for diagnosing tendinopathy. Spring ligament and accessory navicular injury are better assessed with MRI, although ultrasound may be used [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. The management of posterior tibial tendon injury is discussed in detail separately. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Palpation of the medial arch should focus on identifying tenderness directly over the navicular. The navicular prominence is inferior and anterior to the medial malleolus  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105685" href="/z/d/graphic/105685.html" rel="external">
          picture 3
         </a>
         ). Palpation may identify tenderness arising from a partial avulsion of the insertion of the posterior tibialis tendon, a partial separation of an accessory navicular, or a stress fracture of the navicular bone. Tenderness directly over the body of the navicular in the superior medial arch alongside the anterior tibialis tendon (the "N spot") suggests a navicular stress fracture, and such an injury should be assumed until ruled out by diagnostic imaging [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Unless a standard radiograph of the foot with navicular views reveals the fracture, an MRI or computed tomography (CT) study should be ordered at the initial evaluation  (

         While uncommon in most sports, tarsal navicular stress fractures are relatively common among long-distance runners and participants in track and field, particularly sprinters, hurdlers, and jumpers. These fractures have a higher risk of complications, and advanced imaging should be performed early if one is suspected. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/102920.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with a navicular stress fracture typically present anywhere from a few weeks to many months following the onset of pain, often after conservative measures have failed to alleviate symptoms. Pain typically begins insidiously and gradually develops into a nagging, deep, dull ache that may occur with simple ambulation in some but only with high-impact activities (eg, running) in others. Rest typically relieves the pain. While some patients localize the pain to a focal point over the dorsomedial midfoot, others may struggle to localize their symptoms and may indicate maximal pain anywhere between the MTs and the tibial (medial) malleolus. Persistent medial arch pain, particularly pain that occurs during sleep, is highly suggestive. Tenderness at the navicular is the most common examination finding  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105685" href="/z/d/graphic/105685.html" rel="external">
          picture 3

         ), but physical findings may be absent.
        </p>
        <p>
         Navicular stress fractures, particularly larger ones, are at high risk of delayed union, nonunion, and avascular necrosis, and athletes may not be able to return to sport successfully without appropriate treatment. The classic study of navicular stress fractures suggests that they rarely heal if the patient remains weightbearing [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Thus, definitive treatment includes several weeks of nonweightbearing and immobilization using a removable boot or short leg cast and referral to a foot and ankle specialist.

         Accessory ossicles are common along the medial superior border of the navicular, contiguous with the posterior tibial tendon  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef115869" href="/z/d/graphic/115869.html" rel="external">
          picture 6

         ). These are called accessory naviculars, and there are three basic types  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef115870" href="/z/d/graphic/115870.html" rel="external">
          image 7
         </a>
         ). In a review of 1240 patients presenting with chronic foot pain, plain radiographs revealed an accessory navicular in 20.9 percent [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. According to this study, the accessory navicular accounted for foot pain in 2 percent of cases, or up to 10 percent of the patients identified with the ossicle. Other studies report a prevalence ranging from 2 to 20 percent.
        </p>
        <p>
         Accessory navicular bones are often associated with pes planus  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef115869" href="/z/d/graphic/115869.html" rel="external">
          picture 6
         </a>
         ). If they create pressure or friction within the patient's shoe, this can produce pain. Severe pain may represent an avulsion of a fibrous or bony union (type 2  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116891" href="/z/d/graphic/116891.html" rel="external">
          picture 11
         </a>
         ) or 3 accessory navicular). A shearing force created by an accessory navicular that lies close to the posterior tibialis tendon can cause pain and may contribute to tendinopathy.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important to determine whether a bony irregularity represents an avulsion fracture involving the navicular tuberosity, rather than an accessory navicular. In general, avulsion fractures occur acutely and cause greater swelling and discoloration. On plain radiograph, the cortical margins of avulsion fractures are irregular, while those involving an accessory navicular are smooth. The difference in the appearance of the borders of an avulsion fracture and an accessory ossicle is well seen in the following radiograph  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef110547" href="/z/d/graphic/110547.html" rel="external">

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Many accessory navicular injuries, including minor avulsions, are treated initially with conservative care focused on control of pain and inflammation with over-the-counter analgesics and custom orthotics [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Surgery is needed for some injuries to allow a full return to activity. If symptoms and function fail to improve with six to eight weeks of conservative care or if an avulsion fracture is large, referral to a foot and ankle surgeon is appropriate. Limited observational evidence suggest that surgical treatment is effective [
         <a href="#rid17">

         While acquired flat foot (pes planus) in adults most often indicates a posterior tibial tendon tear, in some cases, collapse of the medial arch is caused by a rupture of the spring ligament  (

         ]. Distinguishing this condition from a posterior tibial tendon injury by examination alone is difficult; both cause localized swelling and tenderness. MRI and ultrasound findings may indicate that the ligament is injured. In most cases involving significant medial arch collapse, both the posterior tibial tendon and the spring ligament show pathologic changes. Surgical exploration to confirm the diagnosis of isolated spring ligament injury and surgical repair are reserved for individuals experiencing persistent pain not relieved by conservative measures.

        </p>
        <p>
         A large retrospective review of cuboid fractures identified five patterns of injury. The most common mechanism, accounting for 48 percent of all fractures, consisted of an avulsion at the calcaneal cuboid articulation. Fractures of the body of the cuboid and intra-articular fracture extending through the body accounted for 13 and 6.8 percent, respectively. The remaining 30 percent of injuries were more complex trauma involving the cuboid and the Lisfranc joint, crush injuries of the lateral column, or extensive joint displacement [

         Injuries to the tarsometatarsal (TMT) joint complex (including the Lisfranc joint) are serious but uncommon causes of midfoot pain typically due to significant trauma, either direct or indirect. Patients with TMT joint complex injuries typically present with significant pain and swelling in the midfoot immediately following such trauma. Physical examination reveals swelling, tenderness over any of the TMT joints, and inability to bear weight or walk without a limp.

         While high-energy mechanisms (eg, motor vehicle collision) are the most common cause, TMT injuries can occur from low-energy mechanisms, typically involving an axial load placed on a plantarflexed foot. This can occur from missing a step when descending a stairway or during sport when one player lands on the heel of another whose foot is plantar-flexed. When necessary, definitive diagnosis may require advanced diagnostic imaging. In a review of 82 sports-related Lisfranc injuries sustained by college athletes in the United States, American football and basketball were the sports most often involved, and return to sport required an average of 7.5 months [

         While not common, major midfoot trauma occurs in motor vehicle collisions, falls, crush injuries, and sometimes sport. Such trauma may entail crush injuries involving multiple structures, fractures of multiple tarsal bones and the bases of MTs, and dislocations of the Chopart or Lisfranc joints. Major trauma involving the Lisfranc or Chopart joints that requires open reduction and internal fixation often has negative effects on mid- to long-term quality of life [

         The most common injury leading to post-traumatic arthritis in the midfoot is a Lisfranc sprain, fracture, or fracture dislocation. Major crush injuries or traumatic complex fractures involving tarsal bones also trigger long-term midfoot arthritis  (

         ]. Activities including frequent beach walking, stair or ladder climbing, and ballet or modern dancing all can potentially cause overuse injuries that affect extensor tendons. As these tendons play a less significant role than others during walking, running, and jumping, injury is less common. In most cases, extensor tendinopathy of the foot presents as redness, swelling, and pain over the dorsum of the midfoot. There are case reports of gonococcal and tuberculous tendon sheath infections in these tendons, so it is important to consider infection if the history does not reveal an activity or injury that is likely to account for the clinical findings.

         Cuboid subluxation causes extreme lateral foot pain that may prevent patients from bearing weight [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33-35
         </a>
         ]. Painful episodes can begin acutely following an inversion (supination) injury of a plantarflexed ankle or possibly from minor foot trauma. Ballet is the activity most often associated with cuboid subluxation. In one series, just over 6 percent of such sprains caused some degree of cuboid subluxation [
         <a href="#rid34">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         More commonly, cuboid subluxation is diagnosed after months of intermittent lateral ankle pain that is often sharp. This condition is commonly termed "cuboid syndrome," and most case reports involve ballet or running. A proposed mechanism involves minor injuries to the multiple ligaments that stabilize the cuboid, leading to intermittent subluxation and varying degrees of pain.
        </p>
        <p>
         The cuboid articulates medially with the navicular and the lateral cuneiform, posteriorly with the calcaneus, and anteriorly with the fourth and fifth MT bases. Subluxation occurs if the intertarsal ligaments between one or more of the articulations that stabilize the cuboid tear, allowing the bone to shift position [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. The tendon of the peroneus longus passes below the cuboid before traversing the foot, and forceful contraction of this muscle-tendon unit can displace the cuboid from its normal position.
        </p>
        <p>
         The examiner can readily palpate the cuboid, which lies anterior to the calcaneus and behind the base of the fifth MT  (

         ). In contrast to peroneal tendinopathy, focal tenderness over the cuboid is often present, and the midtarsal adduction test elicits pain. This test is performed by stabilizing the ankle and subtalar joint with one hand while the other hand applies an adduction (or varus) force to the midfoot  (

         Dorsal exostosis of the TMT bones, also referred to as TMT bossing, refers to a prominence and deformity along the dorsum of the articulation of the MT base with the adjacent tarsal bone  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98817" href="/z/d/graphic/98817.html" rel="external">

         <a href="#rid36">
          36
         </a>
         ]. This is a common problem for adults over 40 and younger patients with a neuropathic foot. The TMT joints are located between the cuneiforms, cuboid, and base of the MTs. The second TMT joint is recessed proximally by approximately 1 cm and is crossed by the Lisfranc ligament, which runs from the lateral aspect of the first cuneiform to the base of the second MT  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103035" href="/z/d/graphic/103035.html" rel="external">
          figure 11
         </a>
         ). This entire complex forms the Lisfranc joint  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103036" href="/z/d/graphic/103036.html" rel="external">
          figure 5
         </a>
         ). Degenerative change to this joint complex usually stems from traumatic injury. Excessive pressure from gait abnormalities, subclinical injuries, chronic micro-trauma in a neuropathic foot, and congenital issues such as brachymetatarsia likely contribute in many cases.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with TMT bossing typically notice a rigid, bony bump on the dorsum of the foot, most commonly along the medial column at the intersection of the midfoot and forefoot. Initially, the prominence is asymptomatic, but as the deformity increases, most patients begin experiencing pain over the dorsum of the midfoot either from arthritic change or pressure from their shoe. They may notice some swelling and redness after prolonged standing or after wearing shoes with minimal support.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some patients may experience numbness at the dorsal foot that extends into the great toe from pressure exerted on the overlying medial dorsal cutaneous nerve, a branch from the superficial peroneal (fibular) nerve  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108652" href="/z/d/graphic/108652.html" rel="external">
          figure 12
         </a>
         ). This nerve travels superficial to the first TMT joint and supplies sensation to the medial foot and great toe. With the patient standing or seated, the examiner can see spurring at the Lisfranc joint, often over the first and second TMT joints but sometimes extending across the entire joint complex. These rigid spurs may be tender to palpation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Confirmation of TMT bossing requires standard posteroanterior and lateral radiographs of the foot. Standing radiographs are preferred to look for signs of a remote, untreated Lisfranc joint dislocation. Signs of such an injury include wider than normal separation of the first and second rays, a fleck sign, and dorsal displacement of the second MT shaft on a standing lateral view. The diagnosis of many Lisfranc joint injuries is delayed. Virtually all grades of Lisfranc injury lead to chronic pain and midfoot dysfunction and degenerative change resulting in TMT bossing [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37

        </p>
        <p>
         Additional imaging is rarely indicated, but bone scan or MRI can demonstrate the degree of inflammatory response around this joint. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms with analgesics, including topical or oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or other medication, and support with customized arch pads or standard store-bought arch supports. Custom orthotics may relieve pain and assist gait more effectively in certain cases, particularly patients with structural breakdown of other areas of the foot.
        </p>
        <p>
         While some evidence supports surgical intervention for TMT arthritis involving TMT joints of the great (first) and adjacent (second and third) toes, this has primarily been studied in patients with concomitant hallux valgus or who developed osteoarthritis following a Lisfranc injury. Outcomes for surgery of TMT joints four and five (smaller toes) have been poor, and such procedures are used sparingly. Referral to foot and ankle surgeons is reserved for patients with intractable pain following conservative interventions, to include custom orthotics and specialized shoe modifications.

The affected bones may ultimately fuse. Charcot changes, caused by diabetes in most cases in developed countries, can arise from any idiopathic neuropathy, including those that arise from vasculitis or as a complication of chemotherapy. Tabes dorsalis is a late manifestation of neurosyphilis that affects the posterior columns of the spinal cord and leads to ataxia and sensory loss over the lower extremity that has been associated with midfoot arthropathy.

         Tarsal coalitions are defined as abnormal fibrous, cartilaginous, or bony unions found most commonly between the calcaneus and navicular and less commonly between the calcaneus and talus or cuboid  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66078" href="/z/d/graphic/66078.html" rel="external">
          image 5
         </a>
         ). Symptomatic patients with tarsal coalition may complain of pain over the subtalar joint of the foot. Pain may worsen with activity, walking on uneven ground, or running. Examination reveals a rigid pes planus, hindfoot valgus, loss of subtalar motion, and limited, painful inversion of the foot.
        </p>
        <p>
         While clinicians may suspect these in patients with a rigid pes planus, they are often identified only when a plain radiograph or CT reveals the anomaly. However, as many are fibrous or cartilaginous, the sensitivity of radiographs and CT is limited. In a study of 100 cadaver feet, CT identified only 55.5 percent of the tarsal coalitions noted on dissection [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>

         <a href="#rid40">
          40

         Surgery for tarsal coalition is performed most often in children or young adults. The indication is persistent pain, often accompanied by gait impairment. In adults, tarsal coalition is usually an incidental finding. Even in pediatric cases, surgeons often prefer a minimum of six months of conservative care before surgical intervention. Nonoperative care entails orthotics, rehabilitation exercises, cryotherapy, and medication for symptom relief. A systematic review of 25 retrospective studies with a high risk of bias, involving 760 tarsal coalitions, reported a surgical success rate of just under 80 percent and a complication rate of about 5 percent [

         ). Ganglia are the most common nodule found in the foot, accounting for nearly 40 percent of lesions that present to surgeons. They typically involve the dorsum of the mid- or forefoot and the toes. They are less common over the heel and the flexor tendon sheaths in the foot. Common locations include the various TMT joints, the tarsal-tarsal joints, and talonavicular or calcaneocuboid joints. Up to 85 percent of cases affect females [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Ganglia are firm nodules that typically are not painful unless constrictive shoes rub against them. Most nodules have limited mobility and are partially compressible with manual pressure or a change in foot position. Imaging studies are unnecessary unless the diagnosis is in doubt. Ultrasound allows easy identification of ganglia and may enable the examiner to see if the lesion connects to a proximal joint capsule  (

         ). Conservative treatment may include foot pads and compression of the ganglion with an arch strap. Definitive treatment is reviewed separately. (See

         Plantar fibromatosis is a relatively rare hyperproliferative disease affecting the plantar fascia [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. The condition may be isolated to areas of the plantar fascia anywhere from the heel throughout the arch  (

         ). While thought to be more common in males and older adults, cases have been described in children and adolescents.
        </p>
        <p>
         The condition sometimes occurs with other fibromatous disorders like Dupuytren contracture, Peyronie disease, and knuckle pads. The patient notices nodules on the plantar surface of the foot. These often cause pain with standing or walking after the nodules become larger. The nodules are usually visible to the examiner and on palpation are movable.
        </p>
        <p>
         Simple interventions such as cutouts placed in sports insoles or donut-type cushions may adequately relieve symptoms. In other situations, direct injection of a low-dose glucocorticoid into the nodules may reduce their size. Accurate injection requires ultrasound guidance. Adjunctive treatments include orthotics, stretching, and antiinflammatory drugs. Surgery is ineffective as recurrence is common.

         <strong>
          Anatomy
         </strong>
         – The midfoot extends from the proximal portion of the metatarsal (MT) bones to the proximal ends of the tarsal bones, namely the cuboid and the tarsal navicular  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52540" href="/z/d/graphic/52540.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The midfoot plays an important role in enabling humans to adapt to uneven surfaces while standing and during gait. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Anatomy and biomechanics'
         </a>

          Epidemiology
         </strong>
         – The incidence of midfoot pain in younger adults varies widely by activity and sport participation, but adults over age 50 frequently experience midfoot pain. Pain is commonly caused by direct or chronic trauma and medical conditions affecting joints (eg, osteoarthritis) or soft tissues. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Epidemiology of localized midfoot pain'
         </a>
