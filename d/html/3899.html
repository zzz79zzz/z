Infection in these patients often results in excessive morbidity and mortality, and antimicrobial therapy is often less effective than in the unimpaired host [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Although immunization appears to be an obvious way to prevent infection, many patients with impaired immunity are unable to mount a protective immune response to active vaccination. Furthermore, immunization with live-virus vaccines may result in unchecked proliferation of attenuated strains.</p><p>The risk of acquiring infection and the inability to prevent infection by immunization are directly related to the patient's "net state of immunosuppression" or severity of disease. The greater the degree of immunosuppression, the less likely the patient is to respond to immunization. Although certain existing vaccines provide some benefit to the immunocompromised patient, a vaccine response cannot be assumed. Successful protection of the immunocompromised adult may require the use of vaccines and/or passive immunization (ie, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a>) as well as adjunctive measures, such as antiviral drug prophylaxis during influenza A outbreaks. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7017.html" rel="external">"Seasonal influenza in adults: Role of antiviral prophylaxis for prevention"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5985.html" rel="external">"Seasonal influenza in children: Management"</a>.)</p><p>The rationale for immunizing adults who have undergone chemotherapy for treatment of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors or who have other immunocompromising conditions will be reviewed here. Issues related to immunizations in patients who have had hematopoietic cell transplants or solid organ transplants or who are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as well as in healthy children and adults are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3882.html" rel="external">"Immunizations in hematopoietic cell transplant candidates and recipients"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3892.html" rel="external">"Immunizations in solid organ transplant candidates and recipients"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3706.html" rel="external">"Immunizations in persons with HIV"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3884.html" rel="external">"Standard immunizations for nonpregnant adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2876.html" rel="external">"Standard immunizations for children and adolescents: Overview"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">GENERAL APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Adults with cancer are at increased risk of serious infection, although the degree of risk varies based on underlying malignancy and type of immunosuppressive treatments used. Many of these infections are vaccine preventable. Patients with hematologic malignancies tend to be more immunocompromised than those with solid tumors. However, patients with solid tumors are also at risk of infection on the basis of debility, malnutrition, and, in some cases, anatomic obstruction (eg, lung masses obstructing bronchial drainage).</p><p>Vaccines are important for patients with cancer, but ideally should not be given during periods of immunosuppression from chemotherapy because, at such times, they may not be effective and live vaccines may result in vaccine-derived infections. The timing of immunizations in patients with cancer is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Timing of immunizations'</a> below.)</p><p>Treatment for many cancers has intensified greatly in recent years, resulting in improved patient outcomes, but few studies of immunity and vaccination have been published during this time period. Immunization recommendations for immunocompromised patients in the United States have been developed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) also includes recommendations for immunocompromised patients in their guidelines  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62130" href="/z/d/graphic/62130.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Our recommendations are generally in keeping with those of the IDSA and the ACIP.</p><p>When both inactivated and live formulations of a given vaccine are available, the inactivated formulation is preferred in patients with cancer.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H200099564"><span class="h1">TIMING OF IMMUNIZATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The timing of administration of immunizations in patients with cancer is summarized as follows [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Immunizing prior to chemotherapy</strong> – All indicated vaccines should be given to adult cancer patients before initiation of chemotherapy, before therapy with other immunosuppressive drugs, and before radiation or splenectomy, when feasible  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62130" href="/z/d/graphic/62130.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Indicated inactivated vaccines should be given ≥2 weeks prior to chemotherapy, and indicated live-virus vaccines should be given ≥4 weeks prior to chemotherapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Avoidance of live vaccines during chemotherapy</strong> – Patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy or other immunosuppressive therapy should <strong>not</strong> receive live-virus vaccines because of the risk of vaccine-derived infections.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inactivated immunizations during chemotherapy</strong> – Inactivated vaccines should generally be avoided in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy or other immunosuppressive therapy because they may be less effective.

Detailed recommendations about the timing of influenza vaccination administration are presented below. (See <a class="local">'COVID-19 vaccine'</a> below and <a class="local">'Influenza vaccine'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If other inactivated vaccines are given during chemotherapy, they should not be considered valid doses unless protective antibodies are documented. In such patients, vaccines should be readministered after the recovery of immune competence. Revaccination of individuals after chemotherapy or radiation is generally unnecessary if the prior vaccination occurred before chemotherapy, with the exception of hematopoietic cell transplant recipients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3882.html" rel="external">"Immunizations in hematopoietic cell transplant candidates and recipients"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Immunizing following completion of chemotherapy</strong> – Patients with leukemia, lymphoma, or other malignancies whose disease is in remission, who haven't received anti-B cell antibodies (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8725" href="/z/d/drug information/8725.html" rel="external">alemtuzumab</a>), and whose chemotherapy has been terminated for at least three months may receive inactivated vaccines as well as live-virus vaccines such as the vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, and the live attenuated zoster vaccine.

Although inactivated vaccines are generally avoided in patients receiving intensive chemotherapy (eg, induction or consolidation chemotherapy for acute leukemia), we favor giving an inactivated influenza vaccine to such patients given the need for annual administration to protect against circulating seasonal strains of influenza. Immunization of family members and hospital staff is also strongly recommended. The recommendations do not support administration of a second dose of the influenza vaccine within the same season [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>As the immune response to the influenza vaccine is likely to be impaired in patients receiving chemotherapy, the vaccine is optimally administered at least two weeks before chemotherapy starts or following completion of chemotherapy if the patient is expected to finish chemotherapy early in the influenza season. If neither of these options is possible, we suggest immunizing patients about a week after the start of a chemotherapy cycle. This recommendation is based upon limited data from patients with solid tumors receiving chemotherapy, suggesting that immunization on day 4 or 5 of a chemotherapy cycle is more immunogenic than on day 16 [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. There have been conflicting results regarding the immunogenicity of immunization on the first day of the chemotherapy cycle, with one study showing poor immunogenicity [<a href="#rid8">8</a>] but another study showing good immunogenicity [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Annual immunization of all family members and other close contacts is also recommended. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7007.html" rel="external">"Seasonal influenza vaccination in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5960.html" rel="external">"Seasonal influenza in children: Prevention with vaccines"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6999.html" rel="external">"Infection control measures for prevention of seasonal influenza"</a>.)</p><p>Patients with acute leukemia undergoing induction chemotherapy are at greatest risk of morbidity and mortality associated with influenza [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Most infections in such patients are acquired nosocomially [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Reported seroconversion rates to the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9055" href="/z/d/drug information/9055.html" rel="external">inactivated influenza vaccine</a> in patients with cancer have ranged between 24 and 78 percent [<a href="#rid11">11-13</a>]; a two-dose regimen does not appear to improve the response [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. In a 2012 meta-analysis, seroconversion and seroprotection rates following influenza vaccination in patients with cancer were approximately one-third of those observed in immunocompetent patients [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The likelihood of response is affected by the intensity and type of chemotherapy and the timing of vaccine administration in the chemotherapy cycle.</p><p>Patients receiving anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8725" href="/z/d/drug information/8725.html" rel="external">alemtuzumab</a>) have an attenuated immune response to vaccines. In a study of lymphoma patients who received a rituximab-containing treatment regimen within the previous six months, none of the 67 patients developed seroprotective titers following administration of an adjuvanted inactivated pandemic H1N1 influenza A vaccine compared with 42 of the 51 (82 percent) healthy controls [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. </p><p>Intranasally administered <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9056" href="/z/d/drug information/9056.html" rel="external">live attenuated influenza vaccine</a> (LAIV) is <strong>not</strong> recommended in immunocompromised individuals. LAIV is considered safe for healthy nonpregnant individuals between 2 and 49 years of age [<a href="#rid2">2,5</a>]. Either the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9055" href="/z/d/drug information/9055.html" rel="external">inactivated influenza vaccine</a> or LAIV can be used in household contacts and health care workers caring for patients with cancer; However, only the inactivated influenza vaccine should be used among contacts of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients within two months of transplant and of HCT recipients with graft-versus-host disease [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7007.html" rel="external">"Seasonal influenza vaccination in adults", section on 'Choice of vaccine formulation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3889.html" rel="external">"Immunizations for health care providers", section on 'Recommendation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7007.html" rel="external">"Seasonal influenza vaccination in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3882.html" rel="external">"Immunizations in hematopoietic cell transplant candidates and recipients"</a>.)</p><p>Antiviral prophylaxis should be considered for those undergoing the most intense chemotherapy under certain circumstances, such as within the first 48 hours following an exposure in an unvaccinated individual or when there is a poor match between the vaccine and circulating viruses. Detailed recommendations regarding antiviral prophylaxis are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7017.html" rel="external">"Seasonal influenza in adults: Role of antiviral prophylaxis for prevention", section on 'Postexposure antiviral prophylaxis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/132409.html" rel="external">"Seasonal influenza in children: Prevention with antiviral drugs", section on 'Outpatient settings'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Pneumococcal vaccine</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All patients with cancer should be vaccinated against <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae </em>(pneumococcus) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].

Responses to PPSV23 vary but are better (even close to normal) if the vaccine is administered prior to the onset of therapy [<a href="#rid23">23-27</a>]. Response to PPSV23 is greatly diminished after chemotherapy. Vaccine responses are particularly poor after initiating cancer treatment in patients with leukemia [<a href="#rid28">28</a>] and head and neck cancers [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Among patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, for example, vaccine responses remain impaired for as long as seven years after treatment [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. At least in Hodgkin lymphoma, priming with the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7; Prevnar 7) appears to improve the response to the subsequent administration of PPSV23 [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].

Timing of vaccine administration relative to cancer treatment is discussed above (see <a class="local">'Timing of immunizations'</a> above). For patients who have received ZVL prior to oncologic diagnosis and treatment, we suggest revaccination with RZV.

In a randomized trial of 262 patients ≥18 years of age with solid tumors who received RZV (given as two doses one to two months apart) or placebo either before or during chemotherapy, RZV was safe and immunogenic; both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses persisted one year after vaccination [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. Although all patients receiving RZV developed humoral immune response, those who received the vaccine prior to initiation of chemotherapy had higher immune responses compared with those who received the vaccine during chemotherapy. In a randomized trial of 569 patients ≥18 years of age with hematologic malignancies who received RZV (given as two doses one to two months apart) versus placebo, 80.4 percent of the vaccinated group developed a humoral immune response to herpes zoster compared with 0.8 percent in the unvaccinated group [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].

In a cohort study of individuals ≥60 years of age receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy for solid tumors (4710 of whom had previously received ZVL and 16,766 of whom had not), the adjusted hazard ratio for herpes zoster among previously vaccinated individuals was 0.58 (95% CI 0.46-0.73) [<a href="#rid41">41</a>].
