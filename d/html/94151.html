         Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a neuromodulation technique that is used to treat neuropathic and sympathetically mediated chronic pain. SCS involves percutaneous or surgical implantation of electrodes in the epidural space, with power supplied by an implanted battery.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will discuss placement of spinal cord stimulators, management of anesthesia for spinal cord stimulator placement, and management of SCS for patients who undergo other surgical procedures. It does not address the technique for laminectomy and surgical lead placement, dorsal root ganglion, or peripheral nerve stimulation. Evaluation of chronic pain, alternatives for therapy of chronic pain, and SCS for the treatment of specific conditions are discussed separately.

         The complex mechanism of action of SCS has not been fully elucidated and is multifactorial, involving neuromodulation of dysregulated pain pathways [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The mechanisms described below pertain to conventional or standard SCS. Knowledge about the mechanisms underlying pain relief from the newer SCS technologies, such as high-frequency (HF), burst, and most recently, closed loop evoked compound action potential (ECAP) stimulation, is evolving.

         <strong>
          Neuropathic pain relief
         </strong>
         – SCS was originally thought to work through a gate control mechanism in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Thus, spinal cord stimulators were called dorsal column stimulators. According to gate control theory, the substantia gelatinosa in the dorsal horn was a functional "gate system" where pain was modulated. Small (painful A-delta and C) nerve fibers and large (A-beta) nerve fibers synapse at the "gate." Large A-beta fiber activation inhibited the painful small fibers, closing the "gate" and relieving pain [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Paresthesias are generated via depolarization of A-beta fibers [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The mechanism for pain relief with conventional SCS is now known to be more complex, involving both spinal and supraspinal mechanisms. Much of what is known comes from laboratory and animal studies. Relief of neuropathic pain by paresthesia-based SCS is mediated in part by wide dynamic range neuron suppression in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, through A-beta mediated inhibitory factors involving gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), cholinergic, and other transmitter systems [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,5-7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Supraspinal mechanisms of SCS occur via descending inhibitory pathways and are also thought to contribute significantly to the effects of SCS [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]. Pain relief from SCS can often be realized for days or even weeks after the stimulation has been turned off, which underscores the importance of supraspinal mechanisms of action [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. An electroencephalographic (EEG) study of patients with chronic lower extremity neuropathic pain found that long-term SCS influenced both pain thresholds and cortical signaling, further evidence of a more central mechanism of analgesia [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Cortical inhibition by paresthesia-based SCS has also been demonstrated via amplitude reduction in somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) monitoring [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The mechanism of action for paresthesia-free forms of SCS (ie, burst, HF SCS) may be different from conventional SCS, and is the subject of ongoing research. As examples, conventional and burst SCS have different effects on the dorsal horn, the gracile nucleus in the dorsal column, and the brain [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ], and pain relief from burst SCS does not appear to involve GABAergic systems [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. HF SCS does not generate action potentials to the dorsal horn as is seen in paresthesia-based SCS, and does not appear to involve supraspinal mechanisms [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In 2020, an animal study found that paresthesia-independent SCS with a novel waveform (differential target multiplexed programming) had the ability to modulate glial cells in the CNS, specifically microglia and astrocytes [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. The activation of these cells has been implicated in the development chronic neuropathic pain. (See

          Ischemic pain relief
         </strong>
         – SCS analgesia in ischemic pain is more likely related to restoring the oxygen supply and demand imbalance [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. Reduction of tissue ischemia is thought to be the result of increasing and/or redistributing blood flow to the area of tissue ischemia and/or decreasing tissue oxygen demand [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Vasodilatory effects of SCS may include the release of vasodilatory substances by sensory fibers via antidromic activation or actions on the sympathetic nervous system [

         </span>
         In general, SCS should be considered for patients with chronic pain who have failed conservative approaches. A spinal cord stimulator is not effective for all types of chronic pain, and is not effective for every patient with categories of pain that may respond. In the United States, the most common indication for spinal cord stimulator placement is chronic pain from failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS), which is also referred to as persistent spinal pain syndrome [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16-19
         </a>
         ], although SCS may be effective for pain from other etiologies. A 2019 meta-analysis of 12 randomized trials including approximately 1000 patients with intractable spine or limb pain related to various disorders (ie, FBSS; chronic back, leg or trunk pain; diabetic neuropathy; peripheral vascular disease; complex regional pain syndrome [CRPS]) found that SCS was associated with increased odds of &gt;50 percent pain reduction, compared with continued medical therapy [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. High frequency and burst stimulation were associated with greater benefit than conventional SCS. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Implantable pulse generators'
         </a>
         below.)

         In Europe, spinal cord stimulators are commonly placed for painful peripheral vascular disease and for refractory angina.

The IPG delivers electrical stimulation that can be modified by altering the pulse width, frequency, and amplitude to achieve maximal pain suppression. The distinguishing characteristics include the method used for controlling electrical energy (ie, constant current versus constant voltage), the frequency range, stimulation waveform, rechargeable versus non-rechargeable IPG, characteristics of the leads, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatibility/conditionality.

         </span>
         With a rapid evolution of new SCS waveforms, there has been a transition toward sub-threshold or paresthesia-free therapy. Waveforms including burst, differential target multiplex, and high-frequency (HF) stimulation are considered paresthesia-independent. Traditionally, SCS systems were based on paresthesia-based stimulation for accurate placement and effective analgesia. Paresthesias are not required for pain relief with burst and HF SCS. Not all patients report total lack of paresthesia with burst stimulation, though the majority do, and the area of paresthesias that do occur is less for most patients [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Because patient feedback is not always required for placement of paresthesia-free stimulators, the trial and implant procedure time is shortened by the time normally spent obtaining coverage of the painful areas with paresthesias. The trial and the implant can theoretically be performed under general anesthesia (GA), if necessary. Caution must be used with percutaneous placement under GA due to the risk of undetected nerve or spinal cord trauma. For this safety reason, GA is not commonly chosen for trial or final implantation. If placement under GA is preferred, strong consideration should be given to using neuromonitoring during placement for patient safety. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Choice of anesthetic technique'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The onset of pain relief may be delayed by up to several days after starting paresthesia-free stimulation, whereas analgesia usually occurs within minutes of starting paresthesia-based stimulation. This delay or “wash-in period” must be considered when programming the pulse generator and making adjustments.
        </p>
        <p>
         The choice of pulse generator should be individualized based on the type of pain to be treated, and provider and patient preferences. Some patients prefer to feel paresthesias in the area of pain, while others find them unpleasant. Some newer generators offer options for the patient to change the type of stimulation to optimize pain control and comfort.

         Closed loop evoked compound action potential (ECAP) stimulation is a novel form of SCS that uses a feedback algorithm to determine the stimulus amplitude. Standard SCS is an open loop system that may result in alteration of stimulation with postural changes due to changes in the distance between the SCS lead and the spinal cord. For example, when a patient lies supine, the spinal cord moves posteriorly, toward the epidural space. Closed loop stimulation aims to keep the recruitment of neural fibers constant by continually adjusting the stimulation input in real time, based on real time evoked action potentials. ECAP stimulation received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in the United States in 2022.

         SCS IPGs are powered by lithium-ion batteries, which are recharged through the patient's skin with external chargers, typically held in place with adhesive patches or in pouches that are held in place with a strap. Some manufacturers make devices with primary cell (non-rechargeable) batteries, with battery life that depends on the settings. The manufacturer stated lifespan of the IPG is approximately four to seven years for those with non-rechargeable batteries and nine years for those with rechargeable batteries. The non-rechargeable batteries are larger than the rechargeable batteries and may not be suitable for patients with very little subcutaneous fat.
        </p>
        <p>
         With evolving technology and improvements in waveform delivery, rechargeable IPGs have gotten increasingly smaller and less burdensome to charge. In some cases, patients may only have to recharge their IPG five times yearly [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         IPGs are replaced when the battery runs down, or at an interval specified by the device manufacturer. Replacement involves a surgical procedure similar to IPG implantation.

Concerns include the possibility of lead movement or heating, hardware damage, and reprogramming as a result of radiofrequency (RF) energy. Most spinal cord stimulator components are designated as MRI conditional and can safely be used for MRI of the head and extremities under specific conditions. Some systems are MRI conditionally safe for whole-body MRI; manufacturers' specifications vary and should be followed.

         Percutaneous spinal cord stimulators are placed in two stages that consist of a trial period to prove efficacy followed by final implantation. Both trial and implantation are performed under fluoroscopic guidance and are outpatient procedures. These procedures are performed with strict aseptic technique, with full surgical skin preparation and draping, and with pre-procedure administration of antibiotics.

         The SCS trial is performed to test the effect on pain control and tolerability before permanent implantation. For trial, temporary leads are placed percutaneously and connected via an extension cable to an external generator for the duration of the trial. For standard, paresthesia-based SCS, correct lead placement is confirmed by the paresthesias in the area of the patient's pain. For systems with paresthesia-independent stimulation, leads are frequently inserted using anatomic placement (AP), meaning placement based on the location of the pain [
         <a href="#rid53">

         For burst stimulation, some clinicians (including the author) use low frequency tonic stimulation with paresthesias for lead placement during the trial and final implantation, whereas others place the leads for burst stimulation anatomically, similar to HF stimulator leads.

        <p>
         After the trial period, the leads are removed, and the permanent implantation is performed at a later date. We wait approximately two weeks after trial completion to perform implantation to make sure there has been no infection. The utility of SCS trials has been called into question. In a European study, pain outcomes were similar in patients with failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) who did not undergo a trial compared with patients who had a successful trial [
         <a href="#rid63">
          63

         ]. More data are needed to determine whether a "no-trial" pathway is a reasonable option for certain populations of patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         Alternatively, a tunneled trial can be performed in high-risk patients or for patients with challenging epidural access. For a tunneled trial, the trial leads become the permanent leads and are sutured in place as part of the trial. The leads are then connected to extensions, which are tunneled to flank area and connected to an external generator. After the trial period, the permanent implantation (or explantation if the trial fails) can be performed under local anesthesia (LA) with sedation or general anesthesia (GA), since the lead location has already been established [

         Options for thoracic or lumbar spinal cord stimulator implant include MAC, spinal anesthesia, and GA. The plan for anesthesia should be coordinated with the pain clinician, depending on patient factors and procedural requirements.

         Since these procedures are performed in the prone position, options for airway management during the procedure are limited.

         The most common anesthetic for percutaneous spinal cord stimulator implant is MAC with sedation, with local anesthetic (LA) infiltration by the pain clinician. During needle insertion, lead placement, and testing for paresthesia, the level of sedation, if any, must allow the patient to report pain that might indicate nerve trauma, and once the lead is placed, paresthesia coverage of their chronic pain. Once paresthesia testing is complete, the level of sedation can be increased.

         The tunneling track that is necessary for connecting the lead to the IPG must be anesthetized to avoid discomfort. Deeper sedation should be titrated carefully while assessing ventilation and airway patency. We often administer a low-dose, titrated

         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         Neuraxial anesthesia (ie, spinal, epidural, and combined spinal-epidural) should not be performed at the site of lumbar or thoracic spinal cord stimulator implant, to avoid lead disruption or entanglement. In addition, spread of epidural local anesthetic (LA) solutions may be altered by fibrous tissue or scarring after SCS placement, and may result in patchy or incomplete analgesia or anesthesia. Spinal radiographs should be reviewed for lead placement before performing neuraxial techniques for anesthesia in order to avoid needle or catheter placement that could disrupt spinal cord stimulator leads.

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The decision to perform neuraxial anesthesia and/or analgesia for patients with SCS should be individualized based on patient factors and other alternatives.

         – For patients who require perioperative MRI, spinal cord stimulator MRI compatibility should be confirmed, and the manufacturer's guidelines should be followed. (See

         There are limited data, in the form of a small number of case reports, on the use of SCS during pregnancy [
         <a href="#rid99">
          99
         </a>
         ]. The effects of SCS on the developing fetus and the risks of miscarriage and preterm delivery are unknown. Spinal cord stimulators are not placed in patients known to be pregnant, partly because of the need for imaging studies and fluoroscopy to guide the placement of the trial and permanent leads. However, patients with existing SCS may become or plan to become pregnant. In those cases, the lack of information on the risks associated with SCS should be discussed with the patient. The decision to continue using stimulation should be individualized.

         Technical concerns regarding SCS during pregnancy include the following:

         For internal pulse generators (IPGs) placed in the flank or abdomen, the leads may be stretched as the abdomen expands during pregnancy, which can result in breakage or pain. In one reported case, the spinal cord stimulator lead extender was divided surgically for pain during the second trimester in a patient with an IPG in the low abdomen [

         A spinal cord stimulator may affect the options for regional labor analgesia and for regional anesthesia for cesarean delivery. Prenatal anesthesia consultation should be performed early in pregnancy to plan for labor analgesia and potential instrumental or operative delivery. In particular, prepregnancy radiographs or reports should be reviewed to help guide placement of an epidural catheter or spinal anesthesia.

         SCS is a neuromodulation technique that may be used to treat neuropathic and sympathetically mediated chronic pain. (See

         SCS is most effective for radicular pain associated with failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS), complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), painful ischemic peripheral vascular disease, and ischemic cardiac disease. (See

         Newer forms of SCS (ie, burst, high-frequency [HF], differential target multiplex) do not require paresthesias to be effective, and may provide more effective pain relief for some conditions. (See

         SCS placement is a two-stage process. A trial is performed, followed by permanent implantation for successful trials. (See

         Most SCS trials are performed under local anesthesia (LA) with or without sedation. SCS final implantation may be performed with monitored anesthesia care (MAC) or general anesthesia (GA), depending on the need for patient feedback and patient factors. For most patients, we prefer MAC rather than GA, to allow patient report of pain that might indicate nerve damage, and use neuromonitoring if GA is required. (See
