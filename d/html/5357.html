The assessment of the adequacy of the dietary intake of the breastfed infant is based on the following (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4986.html" rel="external">"Initiation of breastfeeding"</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Frequency and duration of breastfeeding – The breastfed infant should be allowed to nurse within an hour after birth. The exclusively breastfed infant typically nurses every two to three hours while awake, or 8 to 12 times per day. After suckling at one breast, the infant should be repositioned at the second breast. The average duration of each nursing is 5 to 20 minutes per breast. "Appetite spurts" or periods of increased feeding frequency may occur at or near 10 days, four weeks, and three months of life.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Frequency of urination and stooling – The breastfed infant usually has at least six wet diapers per day after the first week of life and an average of four bowel movements per day when consuming an adequate amount of milk. However, stooling patterns in healthy breastfed infants vary markedly, ranging from less than one per day to one after each feeding [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rate of weight gain – Breastfed infants usually gain 15 to 30 g/day during the first six months as they grow from an average weight of approximately 3.5 kg at birth to 7.5 kg at six months [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Use of growth charts based on World Health Organization standards provides the most accurate assessment of a breastfed infant's growth. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2845.html" rel="external">"Normal growth patterns in infants and prepubertal children", section on 'Normal patterns'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5356.html" rel="external">"Measurement of growth in children", section on 'Recommended growth charts with calculators'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Supplements – Ask about vitamin D supplements, which are recommended for all breastfed infants. (See <a class="local">'Vitamins and minerals'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H844361117"><span class="h3">Formula-fed infants</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Iron-fortified infant formulas are acceptable substitutes when mother's milk is not available. The assessment of the adequacy of the dietary intake of the formula-fed infant is based on the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Type of formula – The primary distinction among infant formulas is their protein source, which classifies them into the following categories:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Standard cow's milk formulas (nonhydrolyzed or "intact")</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Partial whey hydrolysate formulas</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Extensively hydrolyzed formulas (whey- and casein-based)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Soy protein-based formulas</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Amino acid-based formulas</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Goat's milk-based formulas</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">All infant formulas are designed to be nutritionally complete and have ratios of macronutrients (protein, fat, and carbohydrate) that are similar to breast milk. A few formulas used for infants with specific metabolic disorders may be nutritionally incomplete, but these are highly unusual. Formulas are sometimes changed empirically for nonspecific symptoms such as reflux or irritability, but a favorable response may or may not be causally related. Extensively hydrolyzed or amino acid-based formulas are used predominantly in infants with established food allergy or protein intolerance and infants at high risk of developing an allergy. These considerations are discussed in separate topic reviews. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5749.html" rel="external">"Introducing formula to infants at risk for allergic disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5897.html" rel="external">"Food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis of infancy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Formula preparation – Infant formulas are available in three forms: ready-to-feed liquid, concentrated liquid, and powder. All three types of formula preparations are nearly identical in nutrient composition, although small differences may exist for technical reasons. The clinician should review formula preparation with the caregiver to confirm that it is prepared according to manufacturer's directions:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Concentrated liquid formula should be mixed with an equal volume of potable water.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Standard powdered infant formulas should be prepared according to directions, usually as 1 scoop per 2 ounces of water; the water should be added to the mixing container or bottle first, followed by the powder. Specialized infant formulas, such as the amino acid-based formula, may have different proportions of powder to water.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dietary energy intake – Infant formulas designed for healthy full-term infants contain 0.67 kcal/mL (20 kcal/oz) when properly prepared. Other formulas or formulas with additives may have different caloric densities. The daily energy intake of the formula-fed infant can be determined by multiplying the caloric density of the formula by the volume of formula consumed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Frequency and volume of feedings – The frequency with which the formula-fed infant feeds is highly variable because of the variability in gastric emptying time (one to four hours). Ideally, the feeding schedule should be regulated "on demand" by the infant. Most infants rapidly increase their intake from 30 to 90 mL (1 to 3 oz) every three to four hours during the first week of life. After the first week of life, most infants will demand six to nine feedings per 24 hours. Some infants will be satisfied with feedings every three to four hours, whereas others will require feedings every two to three hours. Most young infants require feedings throughout the day and night.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H32162487"><span class="h3">Solid foods</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Solid foods (also known as complementary foods) are optimally introduced between four and six months of age. The dietary history should include the quantity, frequency, and variety of these foods. Intake of iron-rich foods (eg, fortified infant cereals and meats) is particularly important. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2855.html" rel="external">"Introducing solid foods and vitamin and mineral supplementation during infancy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1395857190"><span class="h2">Dietary history in children and adolescents</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>No standard approach exists for estimating the dietary intake in children. Several methods that differ in ease of use and reliability are available [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3432847204"><span class="h3">Dietary recall</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The dietary history of the child can be assessed with a 24-hour dietary recall or a food frequency questionnaire. These methods of dietary analysis can be misleading because the child or caregiver must rely on memory to describe typical eating patterns.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>24-hour dietary recall</strong> – For the 24-hour dietary recall, the child or caregiver is asked to report the type and quantity of food consumed in the preceding 24 hours. This approach provides some quantitative information but can be misleading because it does not accurately assess foods that are consumed intermittently [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Food frequency questionnaire</strong> – A food frequency questionnaire is more qualitative but may provide a better assessment of the intake of episodically consumed foods [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The questionnaire consists of a finite list of foods, beverages, or supplements with response categories to indicate usual frequency of consumption over a specific time period. The questionnaire also elicits information on usual portion sizes and, in some cases, includes portion size images to assist with accuracy. Food frequency data can be used to assess total dietary intake and/or particular aspects of diet.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">One study that used a food frequency questionnaire found that 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> grade students could provide valid estimates of intake of calories, carbohydrates, calcium, phosphorus, iron, and vitamin C, while 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> grade students could not [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3004295096"><span class="h3">Dietary diary</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The dietary diary is a three-day written food record that lists all foods consumed during a period of two weekdays and one weekend day, performed while the child is at home. It is a more valid tool to quantify actual dietary intake compared with the dietary recall methods described above. The parent or caregiver records the types of food served to the child, manner in which the food was prepared, and use of additional condiments. The amount of food consumed should ideally be determined by measuring the weight of each food using a digital scale; if this is not possible, record the food volume using common household measurements. Increasingly, caregivers are using smartphone apps to record dietary intake.</p><p>Even when caregivers attempt to record intake objectively, estimates are imprecise because anxious parents/caregivers tend to over- or underestimate the child's food consumption, depending on the nature of the nutritional problem. Despite these difficulties, every effort should be made to document the possibility that altered dietary intakes contribute to the nutritional problem of the child. Unusual meal patterns such as excessive fruit juice consumption may become apparent from the written document and serve as an explanation for poor weight gain in the young child [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H582573693"><span class="h3">Infants and children fed enteral nutrition</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>"Blenderized" feedings prepared from foods at home are increasingly used for children who are dependent on enteral feeds [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In some cases, families choose this approach because of a preference for feeding their child unprocessed organic foods with minimal sugar. The recipe should be reviewed periodically by an experienced clinician to ensure that the blenderized formula provides adequate fluids, micronutrients, and macronutrients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15643.html" rel="external">"Overview of enteral nutrition in infants and children", section on 'Formula selection'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2066756433"><span class="h3">Complementary feeding</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Complementary (solid) foods are added between four and six months of age; most infants in this age group have sufficient neuromuscular development and coordination to swallow puréed foods without complications. Timely introduction of complementary foods is necessary to optimize nutritional and developmental progress [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2855.html" rel="external">"Introducing solid foods and vitamin and mineral supplementation during infancy"</a>.)</p><p>At approximately six months of age, the volume of human milk ingested becomes insufficient to meet the nutritional requirements of energy, protein, iron, zinc, and some fat-soluble vitamins (A and D). Between four and six months of age, the clinician should assess the infant's developmental readiness for complementary feeding:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Loss of the primitive reflexes of extrusion, sucking, and rooting</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Attainment of truncal stability</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ability to signal satiety by moving the head away from the spoon</p><p></p><p>Once complementary foods are introduced, the clinician should periodically review the infant's intake and the variety of foods offered, particularly whether the diet includes foods high in iron and/or fortified complementary foods or vitamin mineral supplements. Fruit juices and foods with added sugars should generally be avoided. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2855.html" rel="external">"Introducing solid foods and vitamin and mineral supplementation during infancy", section on 'What to feed and how to advance'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3171438643"><span class="h2">Determining nutrient content</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once a history has been obtained, food servings should be converted into nutrient content to allow comparison with the dietary reference intakes (DRIs) for specific nutrients.

Consultation with a dietitian is helpful in calculating the nutrient content of the child's diet. (See <a class="local">'Dietary reference intakes'</a> below.)</p><p>Alternatively, Atwater conversion factors can be used to estimate the energy content of the diet based on the reported intake of each macronutrient. The following conversion factors are used:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Protein – 4 kcal/g</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Carbohydrate – 4 kcal/g</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fat – 9 kcal/g</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY FOR DIETARY STANDARDS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Two sets of standards have been developed to describe optimal nutritional intake: dietary reference intakes (DRIs) and daily values (DVs).

The components of the DRIs include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Recommended dietary allowance (RDA)</strong> – The RDA is the level of dietary intake that is sufficient to meet the daily nutrient requirements of 97 percent of the individuals in a specific life stage group.
