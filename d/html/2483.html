         The liver is the dominant metastatic site for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), and although two-thirds of affected patients have extrahepatic spread, some have disease that is isolated to the liver. For patients with isolated liver metastases, regional treatment approaches may be considered as an alternative to or in combination with systemic combination chemotherapy. The majority of patients with isolated liver metastases are not eligible for surgical resection and will be referred for palliative systemic chemotherapy. For some individuals with a limited number of small lesions who are unsuitable for resection because of tumor location, impaired health status, or an insufficient future liver remnant to resect all lesions nonsurgical locoregional liver-directed treatments are an appropriate alternative to initial systemic chemotherapy. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         However, for patients with potentially resectable metastases, surgical resection is the treatment of choice, when feasible. Among patients with four or fewer isolated hepatic lesions, five-year survival rates range from 24 to 58 percent, averaging 40 percent. Many of these patients are potentially cured. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients who have potentially resectable isolated liver metastases, systemic chemotherapy is an important component of treatment, and is often administered postoperatively. However, some patients who are surgical candidates may be offered initial systemic chemotherapy with deferred resection:

         In the setting of synchronous metastatic disease, a major advantage of this approach is that it allows an understanding of the natural history of the metastatic disease before subjecting the patient to surgery that might not be curative. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15802.html" rel="external">

         Initial chemotherapy may also be chosen for patients with isolated, initially unresectable CRC liver metastases who might be considered surgical candidates if their metastases were smaller. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Patients with initially unresectable metastases'

         This topic review will focus on the integration of resection and systemic chemotherapy in patients with potentially resectable CRC liver metastases. Outcomes from resection and the optimal selection of patients for resection, the timing and order of resection in patients who present with synchronous CRC liver metastases, issues related to surgical margins and repeat resection for recurrent liver metastases; surgical techniques for hepatic resection; results for local ablation, regional chemotherapy and embolization, and RT; surgical management of CRC pulmonary metastases; and other locoregional methods of management for patients presenting with stage IV CRC (ie, stenting, resection or cytoreductive surgery, and intraperitoneal chemotherapy) are addressed elsewhere.

         Compared with other nonsurgical liver-directed therapies, resection offers the greatest likelihood of cure for patients with liver-isolated potentially resectable CRC hepatic metastases. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2515.html" rel="external">
          "Nonsurgical local treatment strategies for colorectal cancer liver metastases", section on 'Surgical candidates'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Appropriate patient selection is key to ensuring the best perioperative and long-term oncologic outcomes from hepatic metastasectomy. Determining if a patient is a candidate for resection involves consideration of patient, tumor, and anatomic factors, several of which have been incorporated into a "clinical risk score" that can be used to determine the risk of recurrence and survival after metastasectomy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115954.html" rel="external">
          "Hepatic resection for colorectal cancer liver metastasis", section on 'Patient selection'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Preoperative imaging is used to assess the number and extent of liver metastases, their anatomic distribution, and to identify the presence of extrahepatic disease spread, which largely precludes hepatic metastasectomy (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115954.html" rel="external">
          "Hepatic resection for colorectal cancer liver metastasis", section on 'Preoperative evaluation'
         </a>
         ):

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often preferred over a high-quality contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan for liver imaging because it is most sensitive in detecting additional lesions that might preclude resection. Some of these patients may be candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and re-evaluation for later resection if the metastases become potentially resectable. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Patients with initially unresectable metastases'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Integrated fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scanning can be used in preoperative planning, particularly in detecting extrahepatic metastases, which generally precludes potentially curative hepatic metastasectomy. However, its utility in selecting optimal surgical candidates is less certain.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         An important point is that restaging PET scans after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (particularly if negative) must be carefully interpreted. Chemotherapy may reduce the sensitivity of PET for the detection of liver metastases, possibly due to decreased cellular metabolic activity following chemotherapy [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. In one study, the false negative rate for hepatic metastases of a PET scan performed within four weeks of chemotherapy was 87 percent [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Thus, surgical decision-making following neoadjuvant chemotherapy should not be based on PET scan results in the liver.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinical risk scores that incorporate several of these factors can be used to counsel patients by determining the risk of recurrence and overall survival (OS) after metastasectomy  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116620" href="/z/d/graphic/116620.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Notably, none of these risk scores include preoperative chemotherapy, but a response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is one of the most important prognostic factors. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115954.html" rel="external">
          "Hepatic resection for colorectal cancer liver metastasis", section on 'Patient selection'

         </span>
         A biopsy is often indicated to confirm the diagnosis, although if the clinical picture is compatible with isolated liver-only metastatic CRC (ie, characteristic appearance on cross-sectional imaging in a patient with a prior diagnosis of CRC, elevated carcinoembryonic antigen) and the patient appears to have resectable metastases, a biopsy may not be necessary. If the diagnosis is in doubt or if neoadjuvant therapy is chosen prior to hepatic resection, a biopsy is indicated. In patients with multiple suspicious liver lesions, biopsy of a single lesion to confirm the presence of metastases is generally sufficient.
        </p>
        <p>
         The risk of tract seeding from percutaneous fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy appears small (only a handful of case reports are described in journals listed in Medline [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-10
         </a>
         ]), although this complication was described in 5 of 51 cases of biopsy-proven hepatic CRC metastases in one series [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Needle tract seeding more often complicates FNA biopsies of primary liver tumors.

         Modern combination chemotherapy regimens are highly active in metastatic CRC, and some patients will have an apparently complete radiographic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, even with the most effective regimens, the complete
         <strong>
          pathologic
         </strong>
         response rate after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is only 4 to 9 percent [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,12,13
         </a>
         ]. The majority of radiographic completely responding lesions (83 percent in one series [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]) contain viable tumor. Thus, even in the setting of a complete clinical response, resection is still needed.
        </p>
        <p>
         To locate these "disappearing liver metastases," at the time of resection, liver metastases that are &lt;2 cm in diameter or located &gt;1 cm deep in the liver parenchyma may be marked with a fiducial marker (eg, coil) before initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. (See

         For most patients with initially unresectable CRC hepatic metastases, we suggest initial systemic chemotherapy  (

          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Initial chemotherapy allows assessment of the natural history of the metastatic disease (which is particularly important for patients with a synchronous presentation of metastases), and it also has the potential to convert some patients with initially unresectable large or critically located liver metastases to potentially resectable disease, although the true frequency with which this occurs is probably low.

         The term "conversion therapy" has been proposed to designate the use of induction chemotherapy in patients with isolated but initially unresectable CRC liver metastases [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. In several reports (a few prospective uncontrolled studies and mostly retrospective series), there is wide variability in the fraction of patients with "initially unresectable" hepatic metastases who have a sufficient objective response to permit a subsequent complete (R0) resection, ranging from 12 to 83 percent [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,15-24
         </a>
         ]. A systematic review of 30 randomized trials published after 2003 found that the median rate of conversion to resectability was 7.3 percent, with an interquartile range 5 to 12.9 percent; the inclusion of triplet regimens, and treatments targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (for
         <em>
          RAS
         </em>
         /
         <em>
          BRAF
         </em>
         wild-type disease) were associated with the highest conversion rates [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Choice of regimen'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Five-year survival rates for such patients who successfully undergo later surgery average 30 to 35 percent, results that are substantially better than expected using chemotherapy alone (five-year survival 20 percent, even with the most active regimens). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15802.html" rel="external">
          "Systemic therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer: General principles", section on 'Systemic therapy versus supportive care'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, the definition of "initially unresectable" in these reports is subjective and based in part on the aggressiveness of the liver surgeon. In our own experience, the frequency of converting a patient with truly unresectable disease to the point of resectability through the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is fairly low (no higher than 30 percent), even in the hands of aggressive surgeons.

         The role of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) in the neoadjuvant setting remains uncertain, and we do not suggest this approach outside of the context of a clinical trial.
        </p>
        <p>
         The rationale for administering chemotherapy into the hepatic artery is that liver metastases derive their blood supply predominantly from the hepatic artery. Uncontrolled series combining HAIC plus systemic chemotherapy for patients with initially unresectable CRC liver metastases suggest a high response rate and that many patients are converted to potentially resectable disease [
         <a href="#rid45">

         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ]. Twenty-three (47 percent) were able to undergo a later resection; 16 had concurrent ablation. At histologic analysis, 15 of the 23 resected specimens had negative margins. It is unclear how much of the increase in the observed rate of conversion from unresectable to resectable was a result of tumor regression and how much was a result of the use of thermal ablation as an adjunct to resection. At a median follow-up of 38 months, median survival was 38 months.

         was combined with systemic FU and LV in a series of 87 patients, most of whom had initially unresectable but isolated hepatic CRC metastases. Twenty-two percent of patients were chemotherapy naive [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. The median number of HAIC courses was eight. A total of 23 patients underwent surgery, and resection was successfully performed in 14 (16 percent of the total). Among all patients undergoing surgery, the five-year survival was 56 percent (versus 0 percent in those who did not get surgery), but only one patient remained recurrence free.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         While these results seem promising, others note that the likelihood of achieving a response sufficient to allow a later resection with initial HAIC plus systemic chemotherapy for unresectable hepatic metastases is fairly small (3 out of 40) [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49
         </a>
         ]. The only way to define benefit from the addition of HAIC to neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy is with a randomized controlled trial. NCCN guidelines do not include HAIC as a neoadjuvant chemotherapy option for patients with initially unresectable disease [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42

         Our preference for surgery in these cases is because of the growing number of reports describing liver toxicity and higher rates of perioperative morbidity in patients undergoing resection after receiving oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Randomized trials have also not confirmed a survival benefit for perioperative chemotherapy, particularly in patients with a small number of initially resectable liver metastases. (See

          Metachronous

         – Metachronous CRC liver metastases develop at a later date after the primary CRC has been removed. Surgical management for most patients whose disease involves entirely or predominantly one lobe is reasonably straightforward and decision making is similar to surgery for any other hepatic lesion.

         In most cases, patients who have categorically resectable metastases are referred for initial resection, and systemic chemotherapy is offered postoperatively unless adjuvant chemotherapy had been administered within the 12 preceding months. The role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in these patients is controversial and discussed below. (See

         The management of patients with bilobar disease is more complex, especially if it is extensive albeit initially potentially resectable. Patients who have numerous hepatic metastases throughout both lobes cannot be cured with a single operation, but curative resection might be possible in a subset if performed in two stages. Decision making about integration of chemotherapy and hepatic metastasectomy must be individualized in these cases. One typical scenario is that in the first stage metastases in one lobe are strategically removed. Systemic chemotherapy is then administered to control the remaining disease while the patient recovers and the remnant liver hypertrophies. Portal vein embolization can be performed after the first operation to promote the extent of liver hypertrophy. In such cases, neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be continued while awaiting hypertrophy as this practice significantly reduces rates of hepatic tumor progression and does not inhibit liver hypertrophy. As with all patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the duration of preoperative chemotherapy should be limited to no more than four months. (See

          Synchronous, colonic primary
         </strong>
         – Patients with colon cancer with synchronous presentation of potentially resectable liver metastases have the option of undergoing simultaneous resection of the primary tumor and the metastases or a staged resection, which can be colon first (classic) or liver first (reverse approach). The order of surgical events should be individualized to each patient. In general, simultaneous resection of the primary tumor and the hepatic metastases is clearly preferable from the patient's perspective, but the timing and sequence of the surgeries mostly depends on the acuity of symptoms and disease burden. These surgical issues are discussed in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115954.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Regardless of the timing and sequence of surgeries, for most patients we suggest surgery first and then chemotherapy. However, others disagree, because a major advantage of starting with systemic chemotherapy in this setting is that it allows an understanding of the natural history of the metastatic disease before subjecting the patient to surgery that might not be curative. (See

         On the other hand, for patients with potentially resectable but initially unresectable hepatic metastases, initial chemotherapy is appropriate. If hepatic surgery is anticipated, limiting the duration of preoperative chemotherapy to no more than four months is advisable to minimize the likelihood of hepatic damage and impaired healing. (See

         We consider upfront surgery to be the preferred option, even for patients with a synchronous presentation of potentially resectable hepatic metastases. Although observational data suggest that neoadjuvant/perioperative chemotherapy is associated with improved overall survival (OS) [

          51,52

         ]. This recommendation is consistent with year 2022 guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology on management of metastatic CRC, which recommend surgery with or without perioperative chemotherapy for patients who are candidates for potentially curative resection, with shared decision making to include a discussion of the potential benefits (improved progression-free survival) and harms (reversible postoperative complications) [

         Sixty-seven of the 182 patients assigned to chemotherapy had an objective response (four complete), while 11 progressed, eight of whom were no longer considered resectable. Overall, 83 percent of patients were successfully resected, similar to the number of patients who were successfully resected in the surgery alone group (84 percent). Thus, the fear that initial chemotherapy would cause resectable liver metastases to become unresectable was not realized in this study. Furthermore, initial chemotherapy improved patient selection for hepatic resection. Among those undergoing upfront surgery, 18 of 170 (11 percent) had a nontherapeutic laparotomy, compared with only 8 of 159 (5 percent) in the initial chemotherapy group.

         The postoperative complication rate was significantly higher in the chemotherapy group (25 versus 16 percent, RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.02-2.45). Patients receiving perioperative chemotherapy had higher rates of reversible hepatic failure (7 versus 5 percent), biliary fistulas (8 versus 4 percent), and intra-abdominal infection (7 versus 2 percent).

         There is no consensus which, if any, patients with potentially resectable CRC liver metastases are appropriate for initial chemotherapy, and the approach differs. Our approach, if the hepatic metastases are resectable and the patient has a primary colon cancer, is to offer upfront surgical resection rather than initial chemotherapy for medically fit patients with four or fewer metastases.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some groups may be better served by initial chemotherapy  (

         ). These include patients in whom response to upfront chemotherapy might be anticipated to allow a significantly less complex operation (eg, allow the surgeon to more easily achieve a margin-free resection, more easily avoid a critical hepatic vein, or convert from an open to a laparoscopic resection) or patients with a good performance status who have more than four metastases (unless all are localized to a single lobe), radiographic suspicion for portal node involvement, a

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         However, others disagree with this position. At other centers, two to three cycles of preoperative chemotherapy would be offered to nearly all patients with potentially resectable liver metastases, in part to select those patients who are most likely to benefit from resection [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ]. Initial systemic chemotherapy will allow early aggressive disease progression to become manifest, followed by re-evaluation for surgery. If there is widespread disease progression, resection will likely provide no specific benefit. If, on the other hand, the disease has responded or is stable, resection of both the primary tumor and the metastatic disease could be attempted.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         An important point is that if preoperative chemotherapy is selected, the number of cycles should be minimized prior to hepatic resection. Radiographic response assessment should be performed at six- to eight-week intervals, and surgery should be undertaken as soon as the metastases are clearly resectable.

          Is there a role for immunotherapy for tumors with deficient DNA mismatch repair

         </span>
         For most patients with potentially resectable CRC liver metastases and tumors with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mismatch repair deficiency, we suggest cytotoxic chemotherapy rather than upfront immunotherapy, although this is an evolving area.
        </p>
        <p>
         Approximately 3.5 to 6.5 percent of stage IV CRCs have deficiency in DNA mismatch repair enzymes (dMMR), the biologic footprint of which is high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H). Cancers with dMMR/MSI-H appear to be uniquely susceptible to inhibition of immune checkpoints, tolerance mechanisms that suppress the body's immune response to self-antigens in order to minimize autoimmune disease, which may also serve to blunt the immune response to tumor antigens in vivo. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2485.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Most of the data on benefits of immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy are in previously treated patients, after failure of conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129349.html" rel="external">
          "Systemic therapy for nonoperable metastatic colorectal cancer: Approach to later lines of systemic therapy", section on 'Microsatellite unstable/deficient mismatch repair tumors'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, the KEYNOTE-177 trial suggests that front-line monotherapy
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="96957" href="/z/d/drug information/96957.html" rel="external">
          pembrolizumab

         offers better outcomes than first-line chemotherapy with either an
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10180" href="/z/d/drug information/10180.html" rel="external">
          oxaliplatin
         </a>
         or irinotecan-containing regimen in patients with dMMR/MSI-H tumors [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57
         </a>
         ]. As a result of these data, first-line immunotherapy has become a preferred approach over cytotoxic chemotherapy alone for many patients with metastatic CRC. Concerns have been raised about the nearly one-third of patients treated initially with pembrolizumab in this trial who experienced progressive disease as their best response, and immunotherapy as a sole approach may not be the best option for those with high-volume or critically located metastatic disease. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2503.html" rel="external">
          "Systemic therapy for nonoperable metastatic colorectal cancer: Selecting the initial therapeutic approach", section on 'Patients with deficient DNA mismatch repair/microsatellite unstable tumors'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Furthermore, at least in the setting of dMMR rectal cancer, early data suggests that neoadjuvant immunotherapy leads to a high rate of clinical complete responses, potentially sparing patients from local treatments including radiation therapy or surgery. Early data also support benefit for neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy in colon cancer (eg, in the NICHE-1 and 2 trials) although fewer data are available on nonoperative management. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2507.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of the management of primary colon cancer", section on 'Neoadjuvant therapy'

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, follow-up intervals on the patients enrolled in these studies are short, and we await longer term results to better define response durability. There are few data available about how and when to best deploy these agents in patients with liver-limited metastatic disease. In one study of 121 patients with advanced dMMR metastatic CRC undergoing checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy, 14 subsequently underwent surgery of the primary or metastatic tumor; four had hepatic metastasectomy, three for curative intent [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]. The majority (&gt;80 percent) had received systemic chemotherapy prior to immunotherapy rather than immunotherapy alone. The median time from initiation of immunotherapy to resection was 12 months (range 2 to 28). Overall, a pathologic complete response was noted in the resected specimens in 13 patients, despite the presence of residual tumor on preoperative imaging in 12 patients. With short median follow-up (nine months), no patients had relapsed or progressed.
        </p>
        <p>
         While these data provide some support for front-line
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="96957" href="/z/d/drug information/96957.html" rel="external">
          pembrolizumab
         </a>
         as a potential component of neoadjuvant therapy for patients with dMMR/MSI-H metastatic CRC, the fact that nearly one-third of patients progressed immediately on pembrolizumab in the KEYNOTE-177 study is concerning, and this leaves its use in the possibly resectable patient uncertain. Nevertheless, some clinicians will undoubtably choose to try immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy drugs in the neoadjuvant setting. In the event that patients treated in this way have apparent complete responses, close observation with surgical intervention to resect recurrent liver disease if it is manifested seems a reasonable management choice based upon the reports of prolonged remissions in both the advanced disease and neoadjuvant settings.

         For patients selected for neoadjuvant therapy, regardless of the specific regimen chosen, the duration should be limited to no more than four months, radiographic response assessment should be performed at approximately six- to eight-week intervals, and surgery should be undertaken as soon as the metastases become clearly resectable. When indicated, we time liver resection to take place at least four weeks after completion of chemotherapy, six weeks if

         Emerging data suggest utility for superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced MRI in the preoperative detection of sinusoidal damage in patients who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In one report, 24 of 60 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (mostly 12 or more weeks of an oxaliplatin-based regimen) were suspected of having moderate to severe sinusoidal obstruction by MRI, and 23 cases were confirmed at surgery [
         <a href="#rid68">
          68

        <p>
         Furthermore, whether patients who are identified noninvasively as having this pattern of liver damage after neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be more safely resected after a delay and how much of a delay is needed are uncertain.

         Preoperative PVE is the elective obliteration of portal blood flow to a selected portion of the liver a few weeks prior to planned major liver resection, especially a two-stage liver resection for bilobar disease. PVE elicits a hypertrophic physiologic response in the nonembolized portion, augmenting the volume and the function of the future liver remnant to a safe threshold to permit potentially curative liver resection. For patients undergoing preoperative PVE, neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be continued while awaiting hypertrophy as this practice significantly reduces rates of hepatic tumor progression and does not inhibit liver hypertrophy. This subject is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         Following complete resection of liver metastases, the best postoperative strategy is uncertain. In the absence of published randomized trials to guide clinical practice following metastasectomy, we suggest completion of a full six-month course of oxaliplatin-containing systemic chemotherapy except in patients who received adjuvant oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in the prior 12 months.
        </p>
        <p>
         This recommendation is consistent with updated guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), which also recommend a total of six months of perioperative therapy with an active systemic chemotherapy regimen for patients who have undergone resection of hepatic metastases from CRC, unless they received prior oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ]. This recommendation is also consistent with a year 2022 guideline from the American Society of Clinical Oncology on management of metastatic CRC, which recommends shared decision making on the risks and potential benefits of perioperative chemotherapy in patients undergoing potentially curative resection of CRC liver metastases [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53
         </a>
         ]. If chemotherapy is chosen, it is recommended to a total preoperative plus postoperative duration of six months, as was done in the EORTC 40983 trial. (See

Notably, only 67 of the 151 patients in the adjuvant therapy arm completed all six months of chemotherapy. Among the reasons postulated for the detrimental impact of adjuvant chemotherapy on survival were the restricted use of

         The relative benefit and indications for postoperative hepatic intra-arterial (HIA) chemotherapy in patients with hepatic metastases from CRC remain uncertain. We suggest that this approach, if it is chosen as an alternative to postoperative systemic chemotherapy, be restricted to institutions with expertise in both the medical and surgical oncologic aspects of this procedure.

         The liver is the dominant site of recurrence in over one-half of patients undergoing potentially curative resection. This observation, coupled with the proven efficacy of adjuvant FU-based systemic chemotherapy in patients with node-positive colon cancer, led to the study of regional treatment.

         after resection of CRC liver metastases (NSABP C-09) was closed for lack of accrual. The experience with that study reflects the reasons why HAIC after liver resection has not gained widespread acceptance. The concern that pump placement increases the complexity of the operation, and that surgical complications and the hepatobiliary toxicity of floxuridine delivered regionally may compromise the high response rates with modern systemic chemotherapy regimens limits the use of HAIC after hepatic resection.

The rationale is based upon the observation that in contrast to clinically detectable metastases, which derive 90 percent of their blood supply from the hepatic artery, hepatic micrometastases (as well as the biliary tree) are primarily dependent on the portal vein for their blood supply. Like HAIC, portal vein infusion (PVI) carries with it a significant regional exposure advantage.

Systemic administration of FU and LV was given in conjunction with PVI floxuridine, which was administered for 14 days on and 14 days off at a dose approximately twofold higher than that used with HAIC floxuridine. Although there was a low incidence of hepatic drug-induced toxicity, overall and disease-free survival (42 and 19 percent, respectively, at three years) were somewhat lower than what have been reported with HAIC floxuridine and systemic FU plus LV following resection of hepatic metastases [

All were followed with a similar surveillance protocol, which included outpatient clinical examinations at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, and annually thereafter, with measurement of CEA and cancer antigen 19-9 levels at each visit. In addition, all patients had CT of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis every three months for the first two years, at six-month intervals for three more years, then annually from year 6 to 10.

         Of the 444 patients with a recurrence diagnosed on surveillance CT, 404 were detected within two years.

The mean number of scans performed per resectable recurrence was 35.3, and the cost per life-year gained was £2883, a value that compares favorably with other cost-effectiveness ratios that are considered acceptable in the United States and elsewhere.

         For patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastases who might be candidates for hepatic metastasectomy, preoperative cross-sectional imaging (usually liver MRI) is indicated to assess the number and extent of liver metastases, their anatomic distribution, and to identify the presence of extrahepatic disease spread, which largely precludes hepatic metastasectomy. (See

         A biopsy is indicated if the diagnosis is in doubt or if neoadjuvant therapy is planned prior to hepatic resection. (See

         If neoadjuvant chemotherapy is being planned, liver metastases &lt;2 cm in diameter or located &gt;1 cm deep in the liver parenchyma should be marked with a fiducial marker before treatment initiation. (See

         In most cases, we suggest initial surgery rather than neoadjuvant chemotherapy (

          Grade 2C

Our preference for surgery in these cases is because of the growing number of reports describing liver toxicity and higher rates of perioperative morbidity in patients undergoing resection after receiving oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy; randomized trials have also not confirmed an overall survival (OS) benefit from perioperative chemotherapy. However, others disagree, recommending two to three courses of preoperative chemotherapy for all patients with potentially resectable liver metastases, in part to select those most likely to benefit from resection.

         One potential exception is in patients for whom a response to upfront chemotherapy might be anticipated to allow a significantly less complex operation (eg, allow the surgeon to more easily achieve a margin-free resection or avoid a critical hepatic vein, or convert from an open to a laparoscopic resection). In such cases, decision making must be individualized.

         For patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we complete a full six-month course of systemic chemotherapy that includes the courses that were administered preoperatively, unless adjuvant FOLFOX was previously administered in the prior 12 months. (See
