         Many patients in intensive care units (ICUs) are difficult-to-wean off of mechanical ventilation, thereby delaying extubation. The management of patients who are difficult-to-wean in the ICU is reviewed here. Details regarding readiness testing, methods of weaning, and the management of patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation in long-term care facilities are provided separately. (See

         Simple wean – Patients are considered to have undergone a simple wean when they pass their first spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). Approximately half to two-thirds of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) undergo simple weaning, many of which will proceed with extubation. Details regarding what constitutes an SBT and extubation management are discussed separately [

         Difficult-to-wean – Patients are considered difficult-to-wean if they fail their first SBT and then require up to three SBTs or seven days to pass an SBT [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. This population mostly includes patients intubated in the first few weeks of acute ICU admission. This population is discussed in this topic review.

         </span>
         Prolonged weaning – Patients are considered to have undergone prolonged weaning if they fail at least three SBTs or require more than seven days to pass an SBT. The incidence ranges from 6 to 14 percent [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. Patients who require more than seven days to wean are at increased risk for death [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ] and are also more likely to fail extubation compared with those who undergo simple weaning [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. While in the ICU, many of these patients are managed similarly to patients who are difficult to wean, many will require tracheostomy and be managed accordingly. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4389.html" rel="external">
          "Tracheostomy: Rationale, indications, and contraindications"

        <p>
         Recognizing that some patients are weaned (or separated) from invasive mechanical ventilation without a well-defined SBT, a modification of the above classification system has been proposed [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. A "separation attempt" was defined as an SBT (with or without extubation) or extubation (planned or unplanned) without a preceding SBT. Successful separation (or weaning) was defined as extubation within seven days or discharge from the ICU without invasive mechanical ventilation. Among 2907 patients, 24 percent never had attempted weaning or separation, 57 percent had weaning of less than 24 hours (short weaning) with 95 percent success, 10 percent had weaning duration from two to six days (difficult weaning) with 84 percent successful, and in 9 percent weaning to more than one week (prolonged weaning) with 62 percent eventually successful. Importantly, mortality rates rose from one group to the next (short 5 percent, difficult 15 percent, prolonged 30 percent) [
         <a href="#rid5">

         </span>
         Repeat unsuccessful attempts at weaning usually signify incomplete resolution of the illness that precipitated mechanical ventilation and/or the development of one or more new problems that prevent weaning. The clinician should identify and treat these issues before resuming further weaning trials.

         Identify the cause(s) – Numerous factors contribute to failure to wean  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115677" href="/z/d/graphic/115677.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ) by causing an imbalance between respiratory muscle strength and the work of breathing. Respiratory and cardiac issues are common while psychological, ventilator, or nutrition-related issues are less common. Most of the etiologies are apparent on routine clinical examination, laboratory testing, arterial blood gas analysis, electrocardiography, and chest radiography, as well as an assessment of sedative medications and the ventilator circuit. Additional investigations may be indicated depending upon the suspicion for select etiologies. (See
         <a class="local">

         </span>
         Treat the cause – When feasible, identified etiologies that contribute to difficult weaning should be treated to improve the probability of successful weaning. As an example, in a series of 12 difficult-to-wean patients who failed weaning due to the development of hypertension during their spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), antihypertensive therapy during the SBT was associated with successful weaning in the majority (92 percent) [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. In another study of 42 patients who failed weaning, nine of whom were assessed as having heart failure succeeded on a later occasion after diuretic therapy [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>

         Resume weaning – Once it is felt that the likely cause of ventilator dependency has been corrected, readiness testing  (

         Routine testing including chest, cardiac, and neurologic examination (including an assessment for delirium), complete blood count and chemistries (including calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), chest radiography, arterial blood gas analysis, and nutrition assessment will narrow the differential considerably. Additional testing is individualized and targeted at specific suspected etiologies (eg, computed tomography [CT] of the chest and/or abdomen, CT pulmonary angiography, thoracic ultrasound [lung, pleura, diaphragm, cardiac], nerve conduction studies, bronchoscopy [to look for airway pathology]).

         Overventilation – A common mistake made is to ventilate patients who have chronic hypercapnia with a minute ventilation that normalizes the arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         ). This causes the pH to rise and prompts renal excretion of bicarbonate over three to five days until the pH normalizes. When the patient resumes spontaneous ventilation, such as that during an SBT, an acute respiratory acidosis will result because there is insufficient bicarbonate for buffering (thereby constituting a failed SBT). Thus, patients with chronic hypercapnia should be mechanically ventilated in between SBTs with a minute ventilation that maintains the patient's usual PaCO

         Imposed work of breathing by endotracheal tubes – Small-sized endotracheal tubes (ETTs) or ETTs narrowed by secretions can significantly increase the work of breathing and produce a pattern of rapid shallow breathing observed in patients with weaning failure (akin to breathing through a straw) [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Use of a pressure support SBT may overcome the imposed work of breathing by the ETT, and facilitate successful weaning [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Moderate to large pleural effusions are common in ventilated patients at the time of SBTs and in one prospective observational study, were found to be an independent predictor of weaning failure [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. However, while drainage may improve oxygenation and lung volumes [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ] and improve diaphragmatic contractility and respiratory system compliance [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ], it has not been conclusively shown to reduce mechanical ventilation days. Thus, we typically avoid large volume thoracentesis in this setting unless indicated for another reason.

         Weaning-induced myocardial ischemia or cardiac dysfunction (called "weaning-induced pulmonary edema") may contribute to difficult weaning in 20 to 60 percent of patients and when identified, should be treated accordingly (eg, optimize beta-blockade, diuresis)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115677" href="/z/d/graphic/115677.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ]. Because of the increased work involved in spontaneous breathing, myocardial demand increases, thereby resulting in ischemia in susceptible individuals and pulmonary edema in those with underlying cardiac dysfunction. Ischemia and/or pulmonary edema, in turn, further increase the work of breathing, creating a vicious cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because PEEP is a treatment for heart failure, weaning-induced cardiac dysfunction may be hard to detect when SBT strategies that include PEEP, rather than a T-tube or non-PEEP strategies, are used [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Thus, cardiac dysfunction should be suspected in patients who pass an SBT that included PEEP but who fail extubation and require re-intubation because of acute heart failure.
        </p>
        <p>
         Manifestations include tachycardia, tachypnea, oxygen desaturation, hypertension or even hypotension during a breathing trial. Patients rarely complain of chest pain, and ST depressions are only occasionally appreciated on a bedside monitor. Risk factors identified in one retrospective study included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), previous cardiomyopathy, and obesity [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         When ischemia is suspected, most experts use continuous multi-lead electrocardiography (EKG) during the SBT, or record an EKG pre- and post-the trial. Rarely, patients require cardiac catheterization for diagnosis. If ischemia is identified, it should be treated. The treatment of myocardial ischemia and cardiac dysfunction are described separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/68.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         When weaning-induced pulmonary edema is suspected, transthoracic echocardiography is used in conjunction with clinical examination and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) to justify optimizing cardiac medications and altering fluid management. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3461.html" rel="external">

         BNP levels – The possibility that weaning is limited by cardiac dysfunction is suggested by an elevated BNP or N-terminal pro-BNP prior to the weaning trial, an elevated N-terminal pro-BNP at the end of the trial, or a &gt;20 percent increase in BNP during the SBT [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,16-18

         Ventilator circuit-related problems can increase the work of breathing and contribute to SBT failure.

         An elevated peak inspiratory airway pressure (Ppeak) with a sizeable difference between the Ppeak and plateau pressure (Pplat) may suggest an obstructed ETT or abnormally increased resistance in ventilator circuit tubing (assuming that the patient is on volume cycled ventilation). Examining the ETT and circuit for obstructions or secretions may reveal an obvious source that needs to be treated accordingly (eg, replace ETT or tubing, frequent suctioning, remove the obstruction).

         An increase in both Ppeak and Pplat may suggest a malfunction of the exhalation valve, which should be checked if this waveform abnormality is found. However, such changes may also result from issues not related to the ventilator circuit (ie, processes that decrease respiratory system compliance such as pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, pleural effusion).

         Ventilator asynchrony may be evident on waveforms. This manifests as minimal or no inspiratory flow, despite patient inspiratory effort due to continued neural inspiration (contraction of inspiratory muscles) after the ventilator has cycled to the expiratory phase (ie, premature opening of the exhalation valve). This may lead to a transient but prominent decrease in peak expiratory flow, followed by increase and then a slow decrease again as neural expiration ends [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32

         Patients should be placed in the posture that they prefer during a weaning trial. For example, patients with diaphragmatic paralysis generally prefer and perform better in an upright position because their vital capacity decreases when they are horizontal. In contrast, patients with intercostal muscle weakness (eg, due to a low cervical cord lesion) may prefer being supine because their lung volumes tend to increase when they move from an upright to a supine position. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the optimal posture varies. Some patients have less dyspnea when they are lying supine, whereas others prefer to lean forward.

         In our clinical practice, we favor once daily SBTs to wean patients who have failed an initial weaning attempt. We return the patients to a supportive mode of mechanical ventilation after a failed SBT, look for and correct reversible causes of weaning intolerance, and reassess their readiness to wean the next day.

         PEEP; this preference ensures that weaning-induced heart failure is not concealed by the use of PEEP (which is a therapy for heart failure). We do not use intermittent mandatory ventilation weaning. (See

         A strategy of extubation with immediate application of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) may facilitate earlier extubation in select patients who might otherwise be difficult to wean. While this approach is not necessary as a routine, it is an option for patients who fail the initial SBT and are at risk of failing extubation, including patients with COPD or chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. This approach should not be used in patients with difficult airways, excessive secretions, or an impaired mental status.
        </p>
        <p>
         The practice of early extubation to NIV is supported by randomized trials and meta-analyses [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39-42
         </a>
         ]. In a meta-analysis of 16 trials (1156 patients), hospital mortality was lower in the NIV weaning group compared with control (14 versus 20 percent; odds ratio [OR] 0.58, 95% CI 0.29-0.89) [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. However, the difference was largely accounted for by the large effect size in trials involving patients with COPD (10 versus 20 percent; OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.13-0.81); whereas mortality rates were similar in both groups in trials involving mixed ICU populations (18 versus 20 percent; OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.25-1.48). NIV weaning also reduced mechanical ventilation duration and ICU length of stay, with little to no effect on hospital length of stay. The effect on these outcomes was also largely accounted for by the effect in trials involving patients with COPD, with smaller effect sizes or no effect in trials involving mixed ICU populations. NIV weaning reduced rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) both in trials involving patients with COPD and trials in mixed ICU populations (overall VAP rates 10 versus 38 percent; OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.13-0.33). However, VAP definitions varied between trials and many trials had unusually high rates of VAP in the control arm.

Although the median time to liberation from ventilation (invasive or noninvasive) was no different (4.3 versus 4.5 days), the NIV group, as expected, received fewer days of invasive mechanical ventilation (1 versus 4 days) and had a lower ICU length of stay (10.8 versus 12.2 days). However, despite fewer invasive and total ventilation days, early extubation to NIV had no impact on mortality or rates of reintubation or tracheostomy. Notably, most of the included patients had hypoxemic non-hypercapnic respiratory failure and only 4 percent had an admission diagnosis of COPD or asthma exacerbation. Similarly, in a small randomized study of hypoxemic patients early extubation to NIV reduced the duration of mechanical ventilation and length of hospital stay without reducing mortality [

Similarly, appropriate ventilatory settings must be used to allow respiratory muscles to rest after a failed weaning trial (between SBTs), where the risk for respiratory muscle fatigue is substantial. In contrast, inappropriate settings can create more work than is required for spontaneous breathing, leading to respiratory muscle fatigue and impairing successful weaning.

         Trigger method, trigger sensitivity, and inspiratory flow – A reasonable initial approach is to use flow triggering in patients receiving intermittent mandatory ventilation and in patients receiving PSV who have increased inspiratory effort during triggering. Either pressure or flow triggering is acceptable in other patients. A trigger sensitivity of -1 to -2 cm H
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         O during pressure triggering or -1 to -2 L/min during flow triggering is appropriate. An initial inspiratory flow rate of 60 L/min reasonable for most patients. The flow rate can be increased to as needed if a patient appears to be struggling. (See

         Respiratory muscle weakness is common among mechanically ventilated patients; it may be present at the time of intubation or result from ICU-acquired paresis or ventilator-induced respiratory muscle weakness. As an example, lower diaphragm thickness, measured by ultrasonography within 36 hours of intubation, was associated with prolonged weaning [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ]. One study found diaphragm dysfunction, defined by vertical excursion of &lt;10 mm or paradoxical motion during inspiration, in 29 percent of patients ready for weaning. Another study found that 27 percent of patients demonstrated less than a 30 percent increase in diaphragm thickening during inspiration, an indication of dysfunction [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. Another study reported that 41 percent of patients developed signs of diaphragm atrophy (&gt;10 percent decrease in thickness) by day 4 of mechanical ventilation [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Respiratory muscle strength is typically evaluated by clinical examination at the bedside by asking the patient to take a maximal inspiratory effort; weak effort or low lung volumes suggest respiratory muscle weakness. While not routine, more objective bedside measures such as a low negative inspiratory force (eg, &lt;60 cm H
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         O) and poor diaphragmatic excursion by ultrasound can be used to support clinical findings. Respiratory muscle strength can also be inferred by measurement of handgrip strength using handheld dynamometry [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. (See

         Physical therapy is the mainstay of treatment. Inspiratory muscle strength training (IMST) is of unclear benefit and not routinely used. Importantly, methods that improve muscle strength typically take days to weeks for efficacy. (See

         Early mobilization/physical therapy in mechanically ventilated patients is supported by the American Thoracic Society and American College of Chest physicians as a preventive measure to promote liberation from mechanical ventilation [

          39,49

         ]. Meta-analyses suggest that early mobilization/physical therapy shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation, but these analyses must be interpreted cautiously because of the heterogeneity of included studies [

         Inspiratory muscles can be trained to improve strength and endurance so that fatigue occurs less easily [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52,53
         </a>
         ]. However, whether IMST consistently results in earlier liberation from mechanical ventilation remains unproven. Consequently, it is not routinely used.
        </p>
        <p>
         IMST is performed by adding a resistance device to the inspiratory limb of the ventilator circuit. A systematic review of small randomized trials and observational studies reported that compared with sham or no training, inspiratory muscle training improved maximal inspiratory pressures (increase by -7 cm H
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         O), rapid shallow breathing index (+15 breaths/minute/L) (see

          "Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing", section on 'Rapid shallow breathing index'

         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ]. Duration of mechanical ventilation improved only in the subgroup with known weaning difficulty. However, there was significant heterogeneity among trials suggesting that larger trials are needed to confirm or exclude this benefit. In a subsequent trial of tracheostomized patients, IMST resulted in improved muscle strength, 60-day survival (70 versus 49 percent), and weaning success (75 versus 45 percent) compared with traditional T-piece weaning [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53
         </a>
         ]. However, the trial was small and had several limitations. A randomized trial of 104 tracheostomized patients found no improvement in weaning success or duration when comparing electronically assisted IMST with spontaneous breathing with T-piece [

         The number of patients in specialized weaning units increased three-times between 1997 and 2006, reflecting the trend to manage such patients outside of the ICU [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55
         </a>
         ]. Observational data suggests delaying ventilated patients' discharge to an LTAC may decrease the likelihood of successful weaning [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56
         </a>
         ]. However, one single institution LTAC ventilator weaning trial reported that as many as a third of this population could have completed their wean in the ICU [

        </p>
        <p>
         Several factors are considered when determining whether a patient is appropriate for transfer to a specialized weaning center. First, the acute illness should be resolved. Second, the patient should not be dyspneic or hypoxemic during mechanical ventilation. Third, patients should have a stable airway and route to receive nutrition, which usually consists of a tracheostomy and enteral feeding tube, respectively [
         <a href="#rid58">

         LTAC facilities provide a site where weaning and rehabilitation are the primary focus of care. They foster involvement of the patient in decision-making and provide an environment that integrates the family and other caregivers into a supportive health care team. This team includes intensivists, internists, nurses, and respiratory therapists who identify weaning goals and coordinate the weaning process. In addition, there is daily patient-centered rehabilitation that includes physical exercise for regaining muscle strength and practice performing activities of daily living. Skilled therapists are also available to focus on issues such as speech and communication, nutrition support, physical and recreational activities, and counseling. Strategies for weaning patients who are in an LTAC facility for prolonged mechanical ventilation and their outcomes are described in detail separately. (See

          Definition
         </strong>
         – Patients are considered difficult-to-wean if they fail their first spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and then require up to three SBTs or seven days to pass an SBT. Up to 40 percent of patients mechanically ventilated for an acute illness in the intensive care unit (ICU) are difficult-to-wean. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Definition and incidence'

         <strong>
          Correct the cause
         </strong>
         – Repeat unsuccessful attempts at weaning usually signify incomplete resolution of the illness that precipitated mechanical ventilation and/or the development of one or more new problems that prevent weaning. The clinician should identify and treat these issues (eg, respiratory, cardiac, psychological, circuit, nutritional)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115677" href="/z/d/graphic/115677.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Resume weaning
         </strong>
         – Once the potential causes have been identified and treated, weaning trials may resume. SBTs are similar to those undergoing first time weaning except special attention should be paid to comfortable posture, airway management, and appropriate ventilation in between trials; in addition trials are typically longer (up to two hours) and PSV without PEEP or T-piece trials may be preferred in those with cardiac dysfunction.
