Acute injuries usually are related to falls, whereas chronic injuries occur with repetitive motion. Individuals who injure their elbows usually are throwers (eg, baseball and javelin), power grippers (eg, weightlifters, racquet athletes, gardeners, and carpenters), or those who use the elbow as a weightbearing joint (eg, gymnasts).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H420628210"><span class="h1">BASIC ANATOMY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The elbow is made up of three interrelated joints  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66874" href="/d/graphic/66874.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) and their stabilizing ligaments  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58982" href="/d/graphic/58982.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97474" href="/d/graphic/97474.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) are as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The radiocapitellar joint is formed laterally by the articulation of the capitellum of the humerus with the radial head.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The ulnohumeral joint is formed medially by the articulation of the humerus with the coronoid process, trochlear notch, and olecranon of the ulna. The ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) is a triangle-shaped ligament complex that connects the medial epicondyle to the proximal ulna. The anterior band of the UCL is the most clinically important portion that originates at the medial epicondyle and inserts on the sublime tubercle of the ulna.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The radioulnar joint is formed by the articulation of the radial head with the radial notch of the ulna and is surrounded by the annular ligament.</p><p></p><p>The medial and lateral epicondyle and olecranon process of the humerus are the bony landmarks that are easily palpated  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef141003" href="/d/graphic/141003.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). The medial epicondyle is the origin of the wrist and finger flexors and pronators. The lateral epicondyle is the origin of the wrist and finger extensors. The olecranon process is the insertion of the elbow extensors (triceps). The olecranon bursa is the most superficial of the 12 bursae surrounding the elbow.</p><p>The muscles of the elbow and forearm can be divided according to their major actions: flexion or extension and supination or pronation:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Muscles of elbow flexion or extension</strong> – Flexion or extension of the elbow occurs at the ulnohumeral joint. Elbow flexion is controlled by the biceps brachii and brachialis muscles  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59976" href="/d/graphic/59976.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). The biceps brachii has insertions on the radial tuberosity and the forearm flexor fascia through the bicipital aponeurosis or lacertus fibrosis. The brachialis lies deep to the biceps and originates from the distal humerus and inserts on the coronoid process of the ulna.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Elbow extension is primarily controlled by the triceps and some of the anconeus. The normal arc of motion in children and adolescents ranges from -15 to 0 degrees in full extension to 150 degrees in flexion. At least 30 degrees from full extension and 130 degrees of flexion are necessary for the activities of daily living.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Muscles of supination or pronation</strong> – Supination or pronation of the forearm, with the radius rotating over the stationary ulna, occurs at the radiohumeral and proximal radioulnar articulations. The pronator quadratus and the pronator teres pronate the wrist. The pronator quadratus runs obliquely from the distal ulna to the more distal radius. The pronator teres originates from the medial epicondyle and the proximal ulna and inserts on the lateral midshaft of the radius.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The supinators are much stronger than the pronators and include the supinator and the biceps brachii. The supinator originates on the proximal posterior ulna and inserts on the proximal radius. The biceps brachii has insertions on the radial tuberosity and the forearm flexor fascia through the bicipital aponeurosis or lacertus fibrosis. The normal range of motion is approximately 90 degrees for both supination and pronation. At least 50 degrees of pronation and supination are necessary for the activities of daily living.</p><p></p><p>Sensation and voluntary movement of the elbow and wrist are under control of the median, radial, ulnar, and musculocutaneous nerves  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82540" href="/d/graphic/82540.html" rel="external">figure 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53902" href="/d/graphic/53902.html" rel="external">table 2</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The median nerve crosses the elbow in the antecubital fossa just medial to the biceps tendon and brachial artery and primarily innervates the wrist flexor/pronators, finger flexors, and thenar muscles.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The ulnar nerve crosses the elbow posteriorly and medially in the cubital tunnel of the humerus and innervates the intrinsic muscles of the hand and the flexor carpi ulnaris.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The radial nerve crosses the elbow anterior to the lateral epicondyle and innervates the wrist extensors and supinators.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The musculocutaneous nerve crosses the elbow in the lateral antecubital fossa and innervates the elbow flexors.</p><p></p><p>The brachial artery is the major artery that transverses the antecubital fossa  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82540" href="/d/graphic/82540.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>); injury to the brachial artery will cause radiating pain, decreased skin temperature, decreased pulses, and pallor of the distal arm and may result in Volkmann's contracture.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">SKELETAL DEVELOPMENT AND OSSIFICATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Skeletal maturity in children and adolescents is classified according to the appearance and fusion of the secondary ossification centers of the distal humerus and proximal radius and ulna. Childhood, in relation to bone age, ends with the appearance of all the secondary ossification centers; adolescence with the fusion of all secondary ossifications centers; and young adulthood with the completion of all bone growth.</p><p>The appearance of these ossification centers proceeds in an orderly fashion, usually occurring approximately one year earlier in girls than in boys  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61591" href="/d/graphic/61591.html" rel="external">table 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73226" href="/d/graphic/73226.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. One mnemonic aid to remember the order of their appearance is CRITOE, as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>C – Capitellum </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>R – Radial head</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>I – Inner or medial epicondyle</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>T – Trochlea</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>O – Olecranon</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>E – External or lateral epicondyle</p><p></p><p>The secondary ossification centers fuse to create the mature bony elbow. The lateral epicondyle, trochlear, and capitellar centers fuse first  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79600" href="/d/graphic/79600.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>); this unit then fuses with the distal humerus; the last fusion occurs at the medial epicondyle. Similar to the appearance of the ossification centers, fusion proceeds in an orderly fashion and usually occurs earlier in girls than in boys  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61591" href="/d/graphic/61591.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3836011"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The crucial elements of the history vary depending upon whether the complaints are acute or chronic.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H400120311"><span class="h3">Acute injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute complaints begin with a discrete event. Before focusing on the elbow, the clinician should differentiate shoulder and cervical spine injury with pain radiating to the elbow from true elbow injuries. Patients with trauma to the head or neck and neck pain should have the cervical spine immobilized pending further evaluation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13885.html" rel="external">"Traumatic causes of acute shoulder pain and injury in children and adolescents"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6561.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and acute management of cervical spine injuries in children and adolescents", section on 'History'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6329.html" rel="external">"Pediatric cervical spinal motion restriction"</a>.) </p><p>Once cervical spine injury is excluded or addressed, the mechanism of injury and details of elbow joint mobility and stability and neurovascular symptoms are key components of the history as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mechanism of injury</strong> – The mechanism of injury helps to indicate the most likely region of the elbow that is injured:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Contact trauma – Area that was impacted</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Valgus force applied with the hand planted – Medial components of the elbow joint</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Fall on an outstretched hand – Proximal forearm or distal humerus</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Acute pain while throwing – Depending upon the patient's skeletal maturity, medial epicondyle apophysitis, medial epicondyle avulsion fracture, or ulnar collateral ligament injury  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef55341" href="/d/graphic/55341.html" rel="external">table 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61591" href="/d/graphic/61591.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) (see <a class="local">'Little League elbow'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hyperextension – Distal humerus and proximal ulna from posterior dislocation or impingement</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Axial traction on the arm with the elbow in full extension (eg, forcefully pulling on the wrist of a young child) – Radial annular ligament (nursemaid's elbow) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6331.html" rel="external">"Radial head subluxation (pulled elbow): Evaluation and management"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Joint mobility and stability</strong> – In addition to the mechanism of injury the clinician should determine the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Did the patient feel a pop, crack, or snap sensation at the time of the injury? These sensations suggest a fracture, tendon rupture, or ligament tear.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Does the patient have shifting or instability of the elbow?

Chronic elbow injuries typically are caused by repetitive activity or start of a new activity. The frequency, intensity, duration, progression, and mechanics of the activity should be determined. This determination is particularly true for throwing because it causes medial traction and lateral compression of the elbow. In addition, the elbow is the weakest link in the kinetic chain, the connection of joints from the foot through the arm that is used to throw an object; biomechanical change especially in the shoulder and scapula caused by an injury can cause abnormal mechanics and stress that will result in secondary injury at the elbow. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94703.html" rel="external">"Throwing injuries of the upper extremity: Clinical presentation and diagnostic approach"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H400120327"><span class="h3">Additional questions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Questions of importance regardless of the timing of the injury include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pain</strong> – The location, quality, radiation, and intensity of pain (eg, on a 10-point scale) as well as aggravating and alleviating factors.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mechanical sensations</strong>- The elbow may have clicking, popping, and locking sensations especially associated with pain may indicate loose bodies or osteochondritis dissecans.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Interventions</strong> – Any interventions the athlete has tried to improve the symptoms (eg, medications, application of heat or cold, or activity modification) and whether they were successful.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Functional performance </strong>– Has the athlete experienced a change in functional performance? Throwers with medial epicondyle apophysitis, for example, may complain initially of loss of control (eg, the tendency of the ball to sail higher than the intended target), followed by loss of endurance, pain, and finally loss of velocity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Recent illnesses</strong> – Athletes being treated with quinolone antibiotics have been noted to have an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture. The athlete should also be asked about recent illness because arthritis is a well-recognized and relatively common accompaniment to infection by a number of viruses. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/490.html" rel="external">"Fluoroquinolones", section on 'Tendinopathy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5614.html" rel="external">"Viral arthritis: Causes and approach to evaluation and management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Interventions</strong> – Any interventions the athlete has tried to improve the symptoms (eg, medications, application of heat or cold, activity modification, rehabilitation, or surgery) and whether they were successful.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Age</strong> – The age and bone maturity of the patient affect the differential diagnosis (see <a class="local">'Skeletal development and ossification'</a> above). For example, with medial elbow pain children are more likely to have apophysitis while skeletally immature adolescents are more likely to have a medial epicondyle avulsion fracture  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef55341" href="/d/graphic/55341.html" rel="external">table 4</a>).</p><p></p><p>Past medical history, family history, and review of systems must be included to evaluate for other causes of joint pain and swelling.

Most fractures in older children result from higher falls from playground equipment (eg, monkey bars, swings) or another high energy mechanism. The child with a supracondylar fracture typically has elbow pain, swelling, and limited to no range of motion at the elbow.

Lateral condylar fractures occur after a fall on an outstretched hand where lateral force to the forearm puts varus stress on the elbow joint.

A lateral condylar fracture may also result from a fall on the palm with the elbow flexed. In this mechanism, the radial head is driven directly into the lateral condyle. The child with a lateral condylar fracture typically has elbow pain and swelling over the lateral elbow with a decreased range of motion including limited extension and supination or pronation.

However, radiographs demonstrate a separation of the medial epicondyle apophysis  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef101432" href="/d/graphic/101432.html" rel="external">image 5</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97475" href="/d/graphic/97475.html" rel="external">figure 17</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Treatment for chronic avulsion fractures involves avoiding all throwing and forceful contraction of the wrist flexors/pronators (some patients may need a sling for one to two weeks). Most patients can be limited to activities of daily living. While throwing is restricted, it is important to identify any shoulder or kinetic chain issues that can be rehabilitated to avoid stress on the elbow. After six to eight weeks of no throwing, if the clinical exam is normal, a graduated throwing program can be started in conjunction with proper throwing techniques. Treatment of acute minimally displaced (&lt;2 mm) medial epicondyle avulsion fractures involves splint immobilization for six weeks. Early range of motion exercises out of the splint can be started once the athlete can perform them without pain (usually one to two weeks). Referral to an orthopedic surgeon is advised if greater than 2 mm displacement of the apophysis has occurred or if concomitant ulnar nerve findings are present.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Radial head or neck fracture</strong> – Radial head or neck fractures typically occur after a fall on the outstretched hand with the elbow extended.

The clinician should suspect a proximal radial fracture if there is tenderness over the radial head, and supination and pronation of the forearm produces pain on the lateral side of the elbow. Approximately half of children with proximal radial fractures will have a second elbow injury such as a ligament rupture, a medial epicondyle fracture, or an olecranon or other ulnar fracture. Radial head and neck fractures and their management are discussed in more detail separately.

Radiographs should be obtained to rule out associated fracture.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Neurovascular complications are relatively uncommon, but they are imperative to diagnose [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Transient ulnar neuropathy, with the classic findings of altered sensation involving the ring and little fingers and hypothenar eminence, occurs in approximately 10 percent of cases. Median nerve injury occurs less frequently and is characterized by severe pain that is not relieved by elbow relocation. Brachial artery injuries, a rare complication of posterior elbow dislocation, cause radiating pain, decreased skin temperature, decreased pulse, and pallor in the distal arm. Early microvascular repair of brachial artery injuries decreases the long-term sequelae, including the development of contracture of the flexor muscles and median and ulnar nerve palsies (Volkmann's ischemic contracture) [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong> – Unreduced dislocations should be immobilized "as is" pending evaluation and reduction by an experienced practitioner or orthopedic surgeon [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].
