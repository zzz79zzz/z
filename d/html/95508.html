         Dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, occurs in many patients with serious life-limiting illnesses. In fact, swallowing disorders, distinct from diminished appetite, are part of the natural process at the end of life, irrespective of the etiology. Difficulty swallowing can impact the quality of life of the patient as well as of caregivers, whose natural instinct to nurture and comfort with food is curtailed. Dysphagia is a poor prognostic sign in patients nearing the end of life, and for many patients with a life-limiting illness, the inability to swallow may represent a pivotal symptom that prompts the decision to consider end-of-life or hospice care. In the final weeks to months of life, functional decline can impair the desire or ability to eat or drink [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Swallowing disorders occur frequently in patients with malignancies of the upper aerodigestive tract and brain as well as with progressive degenerative neurologic disorders, including dementia or as a result of the general debility that develops in patients with multisystem diseases [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Muscle wasting, cachexia, and asthenia affect the coordination and muscle strength needed for swallowing, which in turn, can lead to poor appetite and inefficient oral intake. In addition to inefficient swallowing, dysphagia is a major predisposing condition for aspiration, or entry of secretions, liquids, or foods into the lungs, which can lead to pneumonia and can contribute to malnutrition, dehydration, and, in some cases, death [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The consequences of aspiration can vary widely, from no injury at all to pneumonia or asphyxiation due to airway obstruction [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Sometimes the impact is immediate, as occurs with asphyxiation, or it may develop slowly, depending on the volume and chemical composition of the aspirated material. Most importantly, the effectiveness of the patient's pulmonary defenses and airway clearance mechanism can predict the implications of aspiration of food or liquid into the airway. Providers, patients, family, and caregivers would be well served in recognizing the signs of dysphagia, securing airway protection, and determining appropriate ways to provide nutrition and hydration and to administer medications.
        </p>
        <p>
         Management of swallowing disorders is especially challenging in this unique patient population, and the risk for aspiration may persist even with therapeutic intervention. Adherence to recommendations for safe swallowing is problematic. Patients may not choose to change their diet consistency, and serious illness may impact their vigilance and attention to treatment recommendations. Given these multiple variables, it is daunting for providers to quantify the true implication of aspiration, even if swallowing is only somewhat impaired.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic review will cover the assessment and management of swallowing disorders in patients with life-limiting illness. A review of normal and disordered swallowing and a description of types of swallowing disorders are presented elsewhere, as are reviews of speech and swallowing rehabilitation for patients treated for head and neck cancer, aspiration pneumonia in adults, and aspiration due to swallowing dysfunction in children.

         Specific clinical features, disease states, patient characteristics, and medical interventions that can predict an increased risk of swallowing dysfunction are outlined in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116401" href="/z/d/graphic/116401.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         ). Recognizing factors that are clinically associated with or cause a swallowing impairment can guide referral for appropriate assessment and management.
        </p>
        <p>
         Detection of a swallowing disorder may elude the attention of both patients and caregivers. Silent aspiration (where liquid or food enters the upper airway without overt signs of coughing or choking) is a common correlate of dysphagia. In fact, 40 percent of patients aspirate silently, and this is more likely in individuals with a serious life-limiting illness where multiple causative factors coexist. Because there may not be overt signs of distress, clinicians rely on surrogate markers of dysphagia, such as general frailty, unexplained fever or cough with chills, alterations in secretion volume, color, or viscosity, chest pain, or dyspnea. Weight loss and poor appetite are predictable at the end of life, but when they coexist with respiratory findings and signs of struggling during eating, a swallowing disorder may be the possible cause [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,7,8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         With their expert knowledge of the assessment and management of oropharyngeal dysphagia, speech-language pathologists (SLPs) play a critical role in the multidisciplinary team by providing careful assessment to determine swallowing potential, prognostication to assist in decision-making, and guidance to maximize safe eating and drinking and medication administration.

         Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) assess and manage oropharyngeal swallowing disorders across all care settings. The goals of a clinical swallowing assessment are to identify the pathophysiology, nature, and extent of the disorder and to determine relevant interventions [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. The assessment must be framed by an understanding of the overall health status of the patient in conjunction with the patient and caregiver's wishes and preferences, particularly in relation to nutrition and hydration. As such, a holistic evaluation reaches beyond the physiology of swallowing. Together with the multidisciplinary team caring for patients with advanced life-threatening illness, the SLP must carefully weigh which swallowing interventions might benefit the patient against those that will be excessively burdensome. The SLP provides patients, families, and the medical team with an increased understanding of the normal and dysfunctional swallowing processes and suggests methods for maximizing comfort and quality of life in the face of the progressive symptoms of dysphagia that accompany the patients at this stage [

         </span>
         A detailed clinical history and patient description of swallowing complaints is essential in framing the nature and etiology of the swallowing problem [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Frequently encountered patient complaints regarding swallowing and their potential physiologic counterparts are outlined in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95389" href="/z/d/graphic/95389.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). As an example, the swallowing history may suggest a mechanical obstruction from tumor burden or stricture, or an underlying neuromuscular weakness. Patients who complain of dysphagia with solid food and who localize the area of difficulty to the throat may have either esophageal or pharyngeal dysphagia, and thus both locations must be investigated [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Alterations in eating behaviors, the severity and specific nature of the complaints, the details of disease progression, and prior treatment can provide clues to factors that might predispose the patient to silent aspiration. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/85949.html" rel="external">
          "Swallowing disorders and aspiration in palliative care: Definition, pathophysiology, etiology, and consequences"

        </p>
        <p>
         Length of meal time and effort required are indicators of eating efficiency. Dependence for feeding, changes in eating habits or diet, and total calorie intake should be investigated. Validated patient-reported outcome measures, such as the Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10) or the Swallowing Quality of Life Questionnaire (Swal-QOL), can provide important insights into perceived symptoms and impact on quality of life [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Additional areas of inquiry include factors that alleviate or exacerbate the problem, such as body position and time of day, the ability to swallow medication, and the presence of pain on swallowing. Potential indicators of a swallowing disorder, based upon the clinical history and direct observation, are outlined in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95389" href="/z/d/graphic/95389.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Direct observation of swallowing function'

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Understanding the emotional and psychologic impact of the swallowing disorder on the patient and family is as important as ascertaining the physiologic correlates of the problem and provides a helpful framework for determining the next steps in the workup and management of the problem. A patient with a poor appetite, fatigue, and a sense of hopelessness may be less motivated to engage in a complex diagnostic and treatment program. Alternatively, a patient who derives much satisfaction from eating and drinking and wishes to continue with a regular diet may not be satisfied with significant alterations in food texture, smell, and consistency. There are often competing benefits and risks regarding swallowing function and nutrition, and attention to the patient's preferences is paramount in providing appropriate psychosocial support. Sometimes there is an imbalance between the patient and caregivers' goals around nutrition, a dynamic that should be factored in when decisions are being considered.

         The status of the oral mucosa and general oral hygiene reflect the patient's ability to manage secretions, patient comfort, and ease of swallowing solid boluses and can provide prognostic clues regarding the impact of aspiration if it occurs. Oral health is often compromised in those who are seriously ill, and oral hygiene may be neglected. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/86293.html" rel="external">

         Severe illness and polypharmacy may alter the normal oral environment, salivary production, and growth of oral bacteria [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Aspiration of colonized bacteria can introduce inoculum into the lower airways that may be difficult to clear. Saliva is essential for the maintenance of oral health as it neutralizes acid, lubricates the hard and soft tissues, and aids in bolus formation. Persistent dry mouth (xerostomia) is also a strong predictor of patient comfort. Xerostomia may cause, contribute to, or exacerbate dysphagia. Xerostomia is a frequent complication of radiation therapy to the head and neck region, polypharmacy, and the use of supplemental oxygen [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16

         It is not uncommon to find dry secretions and/or thrush crusted along the tongue, palate, and pharynx in patients who have not eaten orally in some time. Dental caries and dentures that are not well cared for can also contribute to poor oral hygiene. Dried oral secretions may also loosen during trials of oral food or fluids and inadvertently obstruct the airway. Before giving the patient food or liquids, even for assessment purposes, the oral cavity should be carefully cleared of extraneous secretions using mouth swabs, tongue scrapers, toothbrushes, and oral suction, if necessary.

         To the extent possible, assessing the structures and muscles associated with swallowing and airway protection is an integral component of swallowing assessment (CN V, VII, IX, X, and XII)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef96249" href="/z/d/graphic/96249.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). Motor responses are evaluated for symmetry, speed, strength, accuracy, and range of movement. For example, unilateral tongue weakness may affect formation of a solid bolus, a facial palsy may cause drooling, and a weak cough response may be associated with aspiration and reduced airway clearance. Sensory input is also a key contributor to swallowing integrity and can influence the force of mastication, the timing of the swallow response, and the presence and effectiveness of airway protection such as cough response [

         Observation of the patient while eating, drinking, or taking medications can yield valuable information regarding swallowing ability, the likelihood of aspiration, and the efficiency of swallowing function. Additional indicators of a potential swallowing disorder, derived from the initial clinical examination, are outlined in the table  (

        <p>
         Effective airway protection is a critical predictor of safe swallowing and entails timely and complete laryngeal closure during swallowing, with a strong cough at the glottis and pharyngeal expectoration in response to aspiration. Patients with a weak voice and/or reduced expiratory strength for coughing are at a higher risk for impaired airway clearance after aspiration [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. A delayed cough, even if it is strong, may signal impaired airway protection. (See

          "Swallowing disorders and aspiration in palliative care: Definition, pathophysiology, etiology, and consequences", section on 'Normal swallowing'

        </p>
        <p>
         Patients who do not respond to aspiration with a cough or throat clear are "silent aspirators," a phenomenon that cannot be definitively discerned from the clinical observation alone and can only be confirmed definitively with an instrumental examination, such as videofluoroscopy, or laryngoscopy [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. Occult signs of aspiration include a wet vocal quality or gurgling; other signs/symptoms include frequent throat clearing, delayed coughing, and/or oral or pharyngeal residue after a swallow [

         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. Cultural norms and preferences play a distinct role in relation to nutrition and feeding across the lifespan but especially at the end of life. Food preferences evoke memories of connection, and food preparation and the act of feeding can be intrinsically associated with demonstrating love. Often families hold on to specific and favorite cultural foods and liquids that are believed to bring comfort and relief and may butt up against physiologic indicators of dysphagia. Cultural beliefs should be explored using the shared decision-making framework of open communication, creative problem solving, and respect for difference and patient autonomy.
        </p>

         Making difficult decisions about optimal nutrition may require several meetings among the patient, caregiver, and treatment team and can be emotionally exhausting. Continuing to orally feed a patient who is a known aspirator or the corollary (withholding food and liquid because of the danger of aspirating) causes medical providers and caregivers to feel that they may be willfully inflicting harm on the patient. Decision aids regarding the pros and cons of non-oral nutrition can be useful to assist in advanced care planning, as can a structured approach to serious illness conversations [

         Dysphagia management in patients with life-limiting illness will vary according to where the patient is in their illness relative to the end of life.

         The physiologic information obtained from clinical and instrumental swallowing assessment facilitates the selection of interventions that are aimed at increasing swallowing safety and efficiency. These strategies may compensate for impaired swallowing function by altering head or neck posture to redirect bolus flow, heighten sensory awareness, or change bolus characteristics to improve the safety of swallowing; their purpose is not rehabilitative in nature. The chief advantage of these strategies is that they are simple for the patient and caregiver to implement and require no complex instruction.

         The chin tuck posture, a commonly recommended strategy, narrows the lumen of the pharynx by increasing tongue base retraction and pressure on the bolus and decreases the opening of the larynx during swallowing. These functional effects potentially reduce the risk of laryngeal penetration and aspiration. However, in cases of delayed onset of the swallow response, the chin tuck posture may induce or exacerbate aspiration, and therefore it is not safe in all cases. Only a direct imaging of swallowing during food and liquid trials with laryngoscopy or fluoroscopy can determine its effectiveness.

        <p>
         Head rotation toward the weak side may benefit patients with asymmetric swallowing function, such as neurologically based dysphagia or following treatment for head and neck cancer. This postural change may promote bolus flow down the intact side by obstructing the weak side, thereby preventing post-swallow residue or aspiration.

         These and other postural modification strategies may be used in isolation or in combination, depending on the nature of the underlying swallowing pathophysiology.

         Intact sensation is essential for a timely and organized swallow. Sensory input for swallowing can be impaired due to certain neurologic dysfunctions, such as brainstem stroke and dementia, as well as in patients treated with radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. Some patients benefit from receiving food or liquid at a slower rate, changes in flavor characteristics, while others are more efficient with larger boluses [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38,39
         </a>
         ]. Enhancing the bolus properties to include more texture (such as small particles of crunchy foods) can sometimes induce mastication more readily than a bolus that is both flavorless and homogeneous in texture. This is particularly relevant for patients with advanced dementia.

         The guiding principle is to ingest the maximum amount of calories and hydration for the least amount of effort, with the understanding that the patient may be unlikely to consume the same volume as before the illness, and to do this in a way that honors the patients goals for comfort, autonomy, pleasure, and risk-taking. Nutritionists can provide individualized suggestions for calorie-dense foods or high-calorie supplements, taking the patient's metabolic status into consideration. Although difficult to implement, caregivers are urged to provide gentle encouragement of small meals or a few sips for comfort but not necessarily for complete nutrition.

         The texture of solid foods may be modified to accommodate dysphagic symptoms. Foods may be pureed, chopped, or diced; prepared soft; and served with gravies and sauces to moisten them. Patients are frequently loathe to relinquish favorite foods and may prefer to eat less of a more textured item than to alter the food to a consistency that is easier to chew and swallow. However, altered food consistency or high-calorie nutritional supplements may offer a way for the patient to continue to eat orally.

         Aspiration on thin liquids is extremely common in both normal and dysphagic patients, especially those with weak lingual and pharyngeal musculature and limited sensation in the oropharynx and larynx. The properties of slower flow and increased viscosity in thick liquids may reduce misdirection of the bolus into the airway. Liquids can be thickened to a range of viscosities from slightly thick to extremely thick [

          44

Unfortunately, few naturally occurring dietary fluids are sufficiently viscous to offer protection from aspiration, although some commercially available thick fruit or yogurt drinks and homemade liquids may be helpful. Beyond these, thin liquids can be thickened with a powder form of modified cornstarch, which can become too thick over time and lose their appeal if too much is added. Xanthan gum or cellulose gel-based thickeners offer greater consistency and have a greater likeability factor [

         The decision to pursue the option of nonoral nutritional support has significant ramifications for both the patient and the family. While aspiration of food or liquid could result in aspiration pneumonia, the decision to commit a patient who is aspirating to nonoral feeding or to nil per os (NPO, nothing by mouth) status is fraught and must be carefully considered [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50
         </a>
         ]. Some patients with progressive disorders may already have a feeding tube in place prior to the terminal period. For others, patients, families, and caregivers may consider nonoral feeding options as the terminal stage approaches. The presence of a feeding tube does not inherently imply NPO or freedom from aspiration risk. Some patients may continue to take food or liquid for their pleasure and comfort. Additionally, patients likely will continue to aspirate oral secretions. Families may feel that they have neglected their obligation to nourish their loved one in selecting one modality over another and may have cultural backgrounds that influence how different modalities are viewed. These complex issues are best discussed openly and nonjudgmentally with caregivers, patients (if able), and a multidisciplinary team to assure the patient's goals are centered in the decision about initiation of, continuation of, or supplementation with feeding tube nutrition.

         An overabundance of secretions or change in secretion viscosity and composition may result from impaired swallowing. Airway clearance can be compromised in dysphagic individuals because of weak cough and/or capacity to expel secretions from the upper airways. This significant functional deficit can increase the risk for infections as well as affect oxygenation and respiration. Additionally, a struggle to clear the airway and resume comfortable respiration is concerning and potentially frightening for patients and their caregivers. A reliable and readily available mechanism for physical removal of secretions can be extraordinarily helpful [

         High-frequency oscillating devices generate intra- or extrathoracic oscillations either via an oral route (positive expiratory pressure valve) or externally at the chest wall (vest-like apparatus). Their purpose is to mobilize secretions and mucus, and by extension, aspirated material, which eventually is expectorated. These devices can be used by the patients themselves or can be administered by caregivers. There is anecdotal evidence that these relatively noninvasive techniques are effective as part of a comprehensive airway clearance program in patients with life-limiting disease [

         Reversible causes should be addressed, such as treatment of oral infection, elimination of precipitating medications (if possible), and improvement of hydration. In the early stages, first-line management includes behavioral and compensatory management by an SLP to enhance oral motor function and sensation, to teach self-management of saliva and triggers/reminders to swallow, and to provide physical therapy and/or supportive neck collars for optimizing body and head posture. Portable oral suction machines can be very effective in clearing excessive secretions but are often noisy and need to be used frequently.

         Anticholinergic medications can be used to block parasympathetic stimulation to the salivary glands and thus reduce saliva production in cases of pervasive sialorrhea (eg, as experienced by those suffering from motor neuron disease)  (

         An equally debilitating symptom is dry mouth (xerostomia), which affects quality of life and increases frustration when the problem cannot be eliminated. Management largely focuses on alleviating, rather than eradicating, symptoms and in many cases need to be performed for the patients who are not independent for oral care. Frequent moistening of the mouth with sips of fluid or crushed ice is recommended for those who are able to swallow. Swabbed mouthwash may increase comfort if the patient is unable to swallow liquids. The lips should be kept moist at all times.

         Tracheostomy tubes are placed to relieve an airway obstruction, as a means of mechanically ventilating the patient, or for secretion clearance. The presence of a tracheostomy tube, with or without mechanical ventilation, does not preclude safe oral intake in and of itself. In addition, an inflated tracheostomy tube cuff is not fully protective against aspiration as secretions and/or liquid material may collect above the inflated cuff and can be aspirated [

         </a>
         ]. In the palliative care environment, patients with tracheotomies benefit from strategies to relieve shortness of breath and secretion management. Facilitating phonation, even if faint, allows the patient to communicate needs and wishes. A device, such as the Passy Muir or Montgomery speaking valves, may be useful for facilitating vocalization in patients with tracheostomies without requiring finger occlusion.

         <strong>
          Clinical relevance
         </strong>
         – Difficulty swallowing occurs frequently in patients with life-limiting illness and may represent a pivotal symptom that prompts the decision to consider end-of-life or hospice care. Dysphagia can predispose the patient to aspiration and impair the ability to maintain nutrition and hydration and to adhere to medication regimens. (See
         <a class="local">

         </a>

         <strong>
          Causes
         </strong>
         – Specific clinical features, disease states, patient characteristics, and medical interventions predictive of an increased risk of swallowing dysfunction are outlined in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116401" href="/z/d/graphic/116401.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Recognizing factors that are clinically associated with or that cause a swallowing impairment can guide referral for appropriate assessment and management. (See
         <a class="local">
          'When to suspect a swallowing disorder'

         <strong>
          Assessment
         </strong>
         – A comprehensive swallowing assessment by the speech-language pathologist (SLP) aims to identify the underlying physiologic nature of the disorder and determine interventions that may alleviate dysphagia. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Assessment'

         <strong>
          Management
         </strong>
         – Management focuses on preventing functional decline, retaining safe and effective oral feeding, and maximizing quality of life and comfort.

         <strong>
          Aligning with goals of care
         </strong>
         – Swallowing interventions should be closely aligned with the goals of care and should support the patient's wishes. A decision to continue with oral nutrition must be accompanied by a clear understanding of the possible risks and consequences (eg, aspiration pneumonia or malnutrition). (See
         <a class="local">

          Swallowing strategies
         </strong>
         – Postural modifications and other swallowing exercises may be effective in some patients. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Swallowing interventions'

         <strong>
          Diet
         </strong>
         – Modifying the texture of solid foods and consistency of liquids is widely used in the management of patients with dysphagia and may improve the safety and/or ease of oral consumption. These modifications should be used judiciously and in accordance with patient preference. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Medication administration
         </strong>
         – Medication administration can present enormous challenges to patients with dysphagia. Finding alternative modes of presentation (liquids, crushed, orally disintegrating tablets, compounded) can be critical to providing the patient with comfort at the end of life  (

         <strong>
          Artificial nutrition and hydration
         </strong>
         – The decision to pursue non-oral artificial nutrition and hydration has significant ramifications for both the patient and caregivers. The patient-caregiver unit must be appropriately informed about the benefits and risks of nutritional options in order to make decisions that reflect consent and refusal. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Artificial nutrition and hydration'

         <strong>
          Secretion management
         </strong>
         – An overabundance of secretions or change in secretion viscosity and composition may result from impaired swallowing. Excessive drooling is common and can contribute to skin irritation, poor oral health, and dehydration. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Secretion management'

         <strong>
          Medical or surgical interventions
         </strong>
         – Medical and/or surgical management of aspects of swallowing dysfunction can be undertaken within the context of shared decision-making with the patient and caregiver team. While some interventions are noninvasive, others may require anesthesia or constant monitoring, and this may or may not conform to the patient/family goals and preferences. (See
