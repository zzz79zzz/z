Most, but not all, children with fecal incontinence have underlying constipation.</p><p>Constipation affects up to 30 percent of children and accounts for an estimated 3 to 5 percent of all visits to pediatricians [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. The peak prevalence is during the preschool years in most reports. Functional constipation is responsible for more than 95 percent of cases of constipation in healthy children one year and older and is particularly common among preschool-aged children [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Although it is common, it is important to evaluate affected children to identify the few that have organic causes of constipation. Moreover, children with functional constipation will benefit from prompt and thorough treatment interventions.</p><p>The evaluation of an infant or child with constipation will be reviewed here.

Functional constipation is defined by the presence of at least two of six criteria describing stool frequency, hardness, and size; fecal incontinence; or volitional stool retention  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57882" href="/z/d/graphic/57882.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).

The evaluation relies primarily on a focused history and physical examination; further testing is performed if the initial evaluation raises concern for an organic cause of constipation.

The history should be obtained from the parents or caretakers and also from the child, if this is appropriate for his or her age.

If accompanied by the passage of soft stools in an otherwise healthy infant, this symptom is known as "infant dyschezia." (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/99538.html" rel="external">"Functional constipation in infants, children, and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Infant dyschezia'</a>.)</p><p>Organic causes of constipation should be considered if the straining behavior is accompanied by hard stools or if warning signs are present. The most important organic causes of constipation in infants are Hirschsprung disease and cystic fibrosis. In particular, a history of delayed passage of meconium should raise concerns about the possibility of Hirschsprung disease since more than 90 percent of normal newborns but only 10 percent of infants with Hirschsprung disease pass meconium within the first 24 hours of life. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/99538.html" rel="external">"Functional constipation in infants, children, and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19"><span class="h3">Psychosocial and environmental factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When functional constipation is suspected, particular attention should be given to psychosocial or environmental factors that may have influenced the child's bowel activities. If feasible, the caregivers should prepare a five- to seven-day symptom and dietary history [<a href="#rid13">13</a>], taking care to record stool frequency and appearance and any pain involved.</p><p>The history should seek to determine the point at which the constipation was first noted and any potential relationship with an event or factors that may have triggered the constipation. These factors include a history of painful evacuation, difficulties with toilet training, stool withholding, psychosocial stressors, and changes in diet. For some individuals, introduction of or increase in cow's milk appears to be a dietary trigger [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Other dietary factors that may contribute to constipation include low fiber content (few fruits or vegetables) and low fluid intake, although these associations are weak.

This relationship between abnormal bowel and bladder function is referred to as the bowel bladder dysfunction, also known as dysfunctional elimination syndrome. Although bladder dysfunction is commonly associated with functional constipation, neurogenic disorders must also be excluded. Successful treatment of the constipation is an important component of treating the bladder dysfunction [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].

The symptoms must be present for one month in infants and toddlers and two months in older children. The diagnosis also requires exclusion of organic causes of the symptoms. (See <a class="local">'Provisional diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Organic causes</strong> – Organic causes of constipation are more likely in patients with alarm signs  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94989" href="/z/d/graphic/94989.html" rel="external">table 5</a>) or other elements of the history and physical examination that raise suspicion  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79830" href="/z/d/graphic/79830.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). Organic causes are responsible for less than 5 percent of children with constipation  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94998" href="/z/d/graphic/94998.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) but are more common among young infants  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef96472" href="/z/d/graphic/96472.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Alarm symptoms and signs'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Important diagnoses to consider in infants include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Hirschsprung disease</strong> – Signs and symptoms suggestive of Hirschsprung disease include delayed passage of meconium (after 48 hours of life), failure to thrive or delayed growth, vomiting, abdominal distension, a tight anal canal with an empty ampulla, or an explosive expulsion of stool after the digital examination (squirt sign). Hirschsprung disease should be particularly considered for infants presenting with constipation during the neonatal period. Other causes of constipation or delayed passage of meconium in the early neonatal period are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82181" href="/z/d/graphic/82181.html" rel="external">table 6</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5903.html" rel="external">"Congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung disease)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Cow's milk intolerance</strong> – Cow's milk may cause constipation in infants and young children. The diagnosis is suggested by onset of symptoms that coincide with an increase in cow's milk in the diet and is generally confirmed and treated by substitution of soy or hydrolyzed protein in the formula. (See <a class="local">'Psychosocial and environmental factors'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/99538.html" rel="external">"Functional constipation in infants, children, and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Cow's milk intolerance'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Further evaluation</strong> – Laboratory and radiographic testing should be selectively performed based upon the history and physical examination.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Laboratory tests</strong> – For the majority of children whose presentation is typical of functional constipation, laboratory testing is pursued only if the patient fails to respond to a well-conceived and carefully administered intervention program, including disimpaction, frequent and effective use of laxatives, and behavioral management. In contrast, laboratory testing should be performed early in patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of an organic cause of constipation. This may include screening tests for celiac disease (in any patient with abdominal pain or slow growth), lead poisoning, hypothyroidism, or urinary tract infection. (See <a class="local">'Laboratory tests'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Motility testing</strong> – Motility testing (radiopaque marker study, anorectal manometry, and/or colon manometry) is typically considered in patients who have no obvious organic cause of constipation and who fail to respond to vigorous treatment of functional constipation. (See <a class="local">'Motility testing for patients with functional constipation refractory to treatment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H681545566"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges George D Ferry, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Rubin GP.
