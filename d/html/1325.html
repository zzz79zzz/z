         Intracranial hemorrhage, which includes intracerebral, intraventricular, subarachnoid, subdural, and epidural bleeding, is a potentially devastating occurrence associated with anticoagulant therapy. Reversal of anticoagulation in patients with anticoagulant-associated intracranial hemorrhage is a medical emergency, as anticoagulation is associated with greater hematoma growth, neurologic deterioration, and increased risk of death and major disability compared with no anticoagulation.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic discusses the reversal of anticoagulation in patients with anticoagulant-associated intracranial hemorrhage.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other aspects of the management and prevention of intracranial hemorrhage are presented separately.

         The goal of the evaluation is to document as rapidly as possible, with brain imaging, whether the patient's symptoms are due to intracranial bleeding rather than another cause, such as poisoning (related to a suicide attempt or other toxic exposure), encephalopathy, or ischemia; to document that the patient is in fact anticoagulated; and to confirm which anticoagulant is responsible. This information determines whether a reversal agent is needed, and if so, the specific agent.
        </p>
        <p>
         We request urgent evaluation by neurology and/or neurosurgery (and stroke team where available) when a patient presents with a suspected intracranial hemorrhage.
        </p>
        <p>
         Laboratory testing for anticoagulation status and brain imaging should be obtained immediately, notifying the laboratory and the radiology department of the emergency nature of the testing and imaging. Patient history can be obtained while the patient is being examined and blood for laboratory testing is being drawn. Often, the neurologist or stroke team can meet the patient in the radiology department and see the images as they are being obtained or review them immediately after.

         <strong>
          Presenting symptoms
         </strong>
         – Patients with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage generally present with acute onset of neurologic impairment consistent with stroke, although some patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) may be neurologically intact and present with isolated sudden-onset, severe headache (ie, thunderclap headache).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Subdural hematoma in the setting of anticoagulation may present with acute neurologic deterioration or milder symptoms initially, depending on the size and acuity.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Clinical manifestations of epidural hematoma (EDH) are highly variable and include altered consciousness, headache, vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, aphasia, seizures, and hemiparesis. Some patients with acute EDH and transient loss of consciousness have a "lucid interval" with recovery of consciousness followed by deterioration due to hematoma enlargement.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Symptoms of intracranial hemorrhage may include headache, nausea, vomiting, or neurologic deficit(s). It is important to distinguish between symptomatic hemorrhage and incidentally discovered hemorrhage on neuroimaging; both are potentially clinically serious, but the urgency and aggressiveness needed to manage symptomatic bleeding may be greater than that for an incidentally discovered subdural bleed that may already be stabilized or resolving.

         – The indication for the anticoagulant should be assessed as this helps in confirming the specific agent, the dose, and the risk of thrombosis if anticoagulation is stopped or reversed. We ask what anticoagulant dose the patient is using and when the last dose was taken. The strength and timing of the last dose taken may impact whether reversal is necessary and, especially for

This includes questioning about how they are taking the anticoagulant to ascertain possible overdose or incorrect dosing. For patients on

         Patients with moderate-to-severe neurologic deficits due to acute stroke may be unable to provide a reliable history. In such cases, it is important to review the patient's medical record and ask family members, friends, and caregivers whether the patient is receiving an anticoagulant and if so, when it was last administered. In some cases, it may be reasonable to ask if there was a suspected suicide attempt. If no history is available, we base our assessment on the results of coagulation testing and imaging.

         As noted above, neuroimaging is performed in individuals taking an anticoagulant who develop symptoms consistent with intracranial bleeding, including headache, nausea, vomiting, or neurologic defects. The need for intervention may be more urgent in those with symptomatic bleeding than for those with incidentally discovered bleeding. (See
         <a class="local">

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Acute intracranial hemorrhage must be confirmed by neuroimaging, typically with urgent noncontrast computed tomography (CT), or, less frequently, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), before undertaking interventions to reverse anticoagulation. It is not possible to distinguish bleeding from ischemia by history and physical examination alone. This is especially true for patients with atrial fibrillation, who are at increased risk for ischemic stroke, but it applies to all individuals. As an example, neurologic symptoms following a motor vehicle accident may be due to traumatic intracranial hemorrhage or due to an ischemic stroke leading to loss of control of the vehicle.
        </p>
        <p>
         In selected cases in which the time delay in obtaining intracranial imaging could be life threatening, the clinicians may decide to treat empirically; this is a challenging decision that weighs the risks and benefits of empiric treatment versus delaying therapy to confirm the diagnosis. As an example, anticoagulant reversal may be reasonable for an individual with head trauma who has papilledema and for whom brain imaging is not available. However, papilledema has causes aside from ICH and by itself (without brain imaging) is not enough evidence for reversal.

Therefore, a prolonged aPTT indicates the need for reversal, but normal aPTT values cannot be used to establish the lack of dabigatran effect. The TT, dTT, and ECT are more sensitive to the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran than the aPTT. Therefore, we would not use a reversal agent if the TT, dTT, and/or ECT are normal.

         , the extent of INR prolongation at the time of warfarin-associated ICH correlates with initial hematoma size, progressive hematoma enlargement after admission, functional outcome, and mortality [

          1-6
         </a>

         <a href="#rid1">
          1,7-11

         While similar data have not been obtained for all the other anticoagulants, it is likely that the intensity of the anticoagulant effect correlates with the severity of intracerebral bleeding, and that any level of anticoagulation puts the patient at risk for adverse outcomes of intracranial bleeding compared with no anticoagulation.

         Urgent anticoagulant reversal is indicated for patients with acute intracerebral (ICH), intraventricular, subarachnoid, or subdural hemorrhage associated with active anticoagulation. These types of hemorrhage are assumed to be life threating regardless of the extent of hemorrhage visible on initial brain imaging, since ongoing bleeding and hemorrhage enlargement can cause neurologic deterioration, elevation in intracranial pressure, and poor functional outcome or death [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         An exception is that urgent reversal may not be necessary for a clinically stable patient with a small, chronic subdural hemorrhage and no evidence of elevated intracranial pressure; in such a case, the potential benefit of reversing anticoagulation (reduced risk of hematoma enlargement) must be weighed against the risk of thrombosis related to the underlying need for anticoagulation. As an example, anticoagulation with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">
          warfarin
         </a>
         dose adjusted to achieve a therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) may be continued in an individual with a mechanical heart valve and a small subdural hematoma with no signs of increased intracranial pressure, since the risk of valve thrombosis may be a greater concern than hematoma expansion. Another option in such an individual is to switch to heparin anticoagulation, which is easier to reverse quickly, while observing for clinical improvement. This subject is discussed in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/104830.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         As noted above, reversal is only appropriate after intracerebral bleeding has been documented on an imaging study. Empiric treatment for suspected intracranial hemorrhage in the absence of confirmation by one of these methods is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         advised unless the patient is in extremis and imaging is not available. This is because reversal agents are potentially prothrombotic, and their use may cause harms without benefit if they are given to an individual who did not actually have a hemorrhage [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         As noted above, some patients who are receiving an anticoagulant may not actually be anticoagulated, especially if they are on a short-acting agent and took their last dose several half-lives ago. The lack of anticoagulation was demonstrated in some of the trials evaluating reversal agents for the direct oral anticoagulants. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94788.html" rel="external">
          "Management of bleeding in patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants", section on 'Anticoagulant reversal'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The main goals of treatment are to rapidly reverse anticoagulation effects and to maintain reversal for a minimum of 72 hours, thereby limiting hemorrhage enlargement. This is important because hematoma growth, particularly within the first 24 hours after ICH, is an independent predictor of mortality and poor outcome. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1133.html" rel="external">
          "Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Predicting hemorrhage expansion'

        </p>
        <p>
         Reversal of anticoagulation, along with blood pressure control, is believed to improve outcomes in warfarin-associated ICH. In one observational study, reduced rates of hematoma enlargement were noted for patients who had reversal of INR &lt;1.3 within four hours of admission (20 versus 42 percent) [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. The combination of successful reversal of INR &lt;1.3 and blood pressure control &lt;160 mmHg within four hours was associated with lowered rates of hematoma enlargement (18 versus 44 percent) and in-hospital mortality (13 versus 21 percent).

The sensitivity of CT for detecting SAH decreases over the ensuing hours to days. The evaluation for SAH is discussed in detail separately. (See

         All anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy should be discontinued. This includes discontinuation of the anticoagulant the patient is taking, and avoidance of other anticoagulants (eg, "routine" orders for heparin or low molecular weight (LMW) heparin administration for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis).

         We target a systolic blood pressure below 140 mmHg for ICH and below 160 mmHg for subarachnoid hemorrhage. Lower blood pressure targets in the acute setting increase the risk of hypoperfusion and infarction. We generally administer antihypertensive agents for those with a systolic blood pressure above 150 mmHg. Specific antihypertensive agents and the frequency of monitoring are discussed separately.

         The reversal agent depends on which anticoagulant the patient is receiving. This should be confirmed from the history and in some cases, the results of coagulation testing. (See

          'Rapid clinical assessment'

        </p>
        <p>
         As noted above, reversal should be done as rapidly as possible but should only be done when intracerebral bleeding is documented (see
         <a class="local">
          'Neuroimaging'

         Our approach for specific anticoagulants (outlined in the following sections) is largely consistent with general guidelines for reversing anticoagulation in the setting of severe bleeding as well as guidelines specific to hemorrhagic stroke [

         We generally do not recommend the use of rFVIIa alone for treatment of warfarin-associated ICH because it does not replace factors II, IX, or X and may give a false sense of security by normalizing the INR without fully reversing

         effect. rFVIIa acts rapidly (eg, normalization of the INR within 10 minutes), but the half-life is only two to three hours, and repeated dosing or administration of another product would be required [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23,24
         </a>
         ]. Although the INR is normalized rapidly with rFVIIa, the bleeding risk may persist due to dysfunction of other vitamin K-dependent factors. Thus, the normal INR may give a false sense of security and deprive the patient of other, more effective treatments. Additionally, 4-factor PCC is likely to carry a lower risk of thrombosis than products containing activated factors (rFVIIa or activated PCC, which contains activated factor VII).

          4-factor PCC
         </strong>
         – We generally give 4-factor PCC (Kcentra or Balfaxar in the United States; Kcentra in Japan; Beriplex or Octaplex in Canada; Beriplex, Confidex, or Octaplex in many European countries) as an initial fixed dose of 1500 to 2000 international units at a rate of 100 units/minute  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89478" href="/z/d/graphic/89478.html" rel="external">
          table 7
         </a>
         ). Fixed-dose PCC may be easier logistically to stock and deliver in emergencies, but supplemental PCC doses may be required for those with warfarin-associated ICH who have a higher INR (&gt;3).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Alternatively, the initial dose may be calculated by body weight and INR. If weight-based or INR-based dosing is used, institutional protocols should be followed. An example is 25 units/kg for INR 2 to 4; 35 units/kg for INR 4 to 6; and 50 units/kg for INR &gt;6, with a maximum dose of 5000 units [

         In a randomized trial involving 199 patients with warfarin-associated extracranial bleeding, the rate of effective hemostasis in those assigned to an initial fixed-dose PCC (1000 units) was similar to those assigned a calculated dose that incorporated body weight and INR (87 versus 90 percent) [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. The median initial dose in the calculated dose group was 1750 units. An additional dose of PCC was given to four patients in the fixed-dose group compared with one in the weight-based group, but the door-to-needle time was shorter in the fixed-dose group (109 versus 142 minutes). The proportion of patients in each group reaching an INR ≤2.0 within 60 minutes was similar (91 versus 92 percent).

          3-factor PCC plus a supplement
         </strong>
         – If a 4-factor PCC is not available, a 3-factor PCC (Profilnine in the United States; Bebulin was discontinued in 2018) can be used. However, 3-factor PCC does not contain factor VII. Therefore, most experts recommend supplementing 3-factor PCC with rFVIIa at a dose of 20 mcg/kg or with plasma (eg, FFP, two units).

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         If rFVIIa is used to supplement 3-factor PCC, we prefer a lower dose (20 mcg/kg) rather than higher doses. This is based on data from a randomized trial in 841 patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH; not warfarin-associated) that compared two doses of rFVIIa (80 and 20 mcg/kg) with placebo; PCC was not administered [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. The primary outcome (severe disability or death) was similar among the three groups, despite less expansion of the hemorrhage in those receiving rFVIIa. Overall, thromboembolic events were similar in the three groups, but severe events (eg, cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction [MI]) were more common in those who received high-dose rFVIIa compared with placebo (8 versus 4 percent).

          Activated PCC
         </strong>
         – Activated PCC (aPCC) contains factors II, VII, IX, and X; factor VII is mostly present in the activated form (VIIa). The only available aPCC is factor eight inhibitor bypassing activity (FEIBA). FEIBA generally is not used for reversing

         anticoagulation, because the activated factor VII is potentially more prothrombotic compared with the factor VII in 4-factor PCC (discussed above) that is not in the activated state. However, retrospective data suggest that treatment with FEIBA does not increase the risk of thrombotic events compared with plasma products [

         If prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) is unavailable, a plasma product (eg, FFP, Thawed Plasma) can be used to provide clotting factors. However, plasma requires a much larger volume of administration, often delaying the time to normalization of the INR, during which time hemorrhage expansion can continue. This was illustrated in a series of 45 patients with ICH, in which the median time interval between admission to a neuro-intensive care unit and INR normalization with FFP was 30 hours (range: 14 to 50 hours) [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. Thus, plasma is not a very effective intervention for reducing the expansion of the hemorrhage [

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Plasma also carries risks of transfusion reactions. A reasonable approach is to give two units of plasma, recheck the INR, and give additional units if needed. The infusion rate for plasma depends on the patient's ability to tolerate the volume load.
        </p>
        <p>
         FFP and other plasma products such as Thawed Plasma are equally effective in reversing the effects of anticoagulation and are considered interchangeable. Thawed Plasma (FFP that has been stored by refrigeration at 1 to 6 degrees Celsius) has the advantage of being available for immediate use. Eight units (2 liters) of FFP or Thawed Plasma are often required to fully reverse anticoagulation in patients treated with

         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. The other trial, which randomly assigned 202 patients who presented with major bleeding associated with a vitamin K antagonist to receive 4-factor PCC or plasma, found that PCC was associated with a trend towards greater hemostatic efficacy (72 percent with PCC versus 65 percent with plasma) and a greater likelihood of INR correction within the first half hour after the infusion (62 versus 10 percent); serious adverse events were similar [

        </p>
        <p>
         A fixed dose of 50 mg or 25 mg may be given; some experts give 50 mg and others give 25 mg followed by an additional dose of 25 mg if needed (eg, based on a prolonged aPTT). The 50 mg dose would be more appropriate for an individual with a greater aPTT prolongation; however, this dose may be associated with a greater risk for relative hypotension. Alternatively, the dose can be calculated as 1 mg protamine per 100 units of heparin. The number of units of heparin is estimated based on the previous dose and the interval since it was administered, with an estimated half-life of heparin in the range of one to two hours (eg, if a dose of 5000 units was given one hour ago, the number of units would be 2500 and the dose of protamine would be 25 mg).
        </p>
        <p>
         Protamine must be given by slow intravenous infusion, as rapid infusion may cause hypotension, particularly at high doses (eg, 50 mg). The infusion rate should not exceed 20 mg/min and the total dose should not exceed 50 mg in any 10-minute period. Repeat doses may be given for a persistently prolonged aPTT. If heparin had been given by subcutaneous injection, repeated small doses of protamine may be required because of prolonged heparin absorption from subcutaneous sites.

         Protamine is derived from fish sperm and may elicit an allergic reaction, especially in previously exposed individuals. In the United States, the

         label contains a boxed warning that the drug can cause severe hypotension, cardiovascular collapse, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, catastrophic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and pulmonary hypertension. Risk factors include high dose or overdose, rapid administration, repeated doses, previous administration of protamine or protamine-containing insulin (eg, neutral protamine hagedorn [NPH] or protamine zinc insulin [PZI]), and certain beta-blockers. Allergy to fish, previous vasectomy, severe left ventricular dysfunction, and abnormal preoperative pulmonary hemodynamics also may be risk factors. Vasopressors and resuscitation equipment should be immediately available in case of a severe reaction to protamine.
        </p>

         In many cases, anticoagulation can be resumed after bleeding resolves, provided the patient remains stable and the risk-benefit calculation clearly favors reinitiating anticoagulation. However, the decision must be individualized. Considerations related to this decision and evidence to support the benefit of restarting anticoagulation are presented separately. (See

          General measures for all patients
         </strong>
         – General measures for anticoagulant-associated intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) include discontinuation of all antithrombotic agents, admission with intensive monitoring, and blood pressure control. Other interventions may be needed to treat severe thrombocytopenia, anemia, and metabolic abnormalities. (See
         <a class="local">
          'General measures for all anticoagulants'

          Indications for anticoagulant reversal
         </strong>
         – Reversal of the anticoagulant effect is indicated in virtually all cases of documented acute ICH and in patients requiring an urgent LP to exclude SAH or infection. A rare exception is an individual for whom the risk of thrombosis is clinically more serious than the risk of hematoma expansion (eg, individual with a mechanical heart valve and a small, stable subdural hematoma).

         <a class="local">
          'Indications for reversal and goals of treatment'
