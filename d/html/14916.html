         The knee is one of the largest and most complex joints in the body. It is lined by synovium and consists of two hinge-type joints between the femoral condyles and the medial and lateral tibial plateaus, and of a gliding-type joint between the patella and the trochlear groove of the anterior distal femur (

         Plain film radiography, CT, and MRI are the mainstays of diagnostic imaging for patients with intraarticular or juxtaarticular bony or soft tissue mass lesions [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Whole body bone scan with single-photon emission CT (SPECT) or SPECT/CT of the area of interest, F18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)-CT, and ultrasound may be useful in specific indications. The following is a brief discussion of the role of each of these modalities in assessing knee tumors and tumor-like disorders.

         Plain film is the initial modality of choice for detection and assessment of the general features of the tumor. Accuracy of plain film for detection of soft tissue tumors is limited. Plain film is the most valuable method to evaluate the margin between normal bone and a neoplasm that is characteristic of bone tumor (zone of transition). Radiographic features of the zone of transition are important in distinguishing between benign and malignant bone lesions. Plain film radiography also demonstrates the extent of cortical destruction, periosteal reaction, matrix calcifications, and pathological fractures. Certain radiographic patterns, combined with the age of the patient, can be very suggestive of specific tumors.

         CT is the best method for detection of juxtaarticular bone lesions not optimally seen by plain film. CT provides better assessment of cortical invasion, pathological fracture, periosteal reaction, and matrix mineralization and detection of cystic or fatty nature of tumor. CT is used for biopsy guidance, preoperative evaluation, and detection of recurrence. For primary bone tumors, intravenous contrast is not usually indicated. For soft tissue masses, use of CT with intravenous contrast is recommended when MRI is not available or is contraindicated; in these cases, contrast administration helps to delineate the mass, distinguishing it from adjacent soft tissue, and shows cystic and necrotic areas, vascularity, and the relationship to vascular structures.

         MRI is nonspecific for differentiation of most tumors. MRI is the modality of choice for local staging, for definition of medullary and extracortical spread, and for delineation of tumor in relation to critical neurovascular structures.
        </p>
        <p>
         The zone of transition, an important feature in plain film imaging, as discussed earlier (see
         <a class="local">
          'Plain film radiography'
         </a>
         above), is not valid on MRI. Gadolinium contrast administration may be useful to differentiate solid from cystic or necrotic tumor, to evaluate response to nonsurgical therapy, and to detect tumor recurrence.
        </p>
        <p>
         Administration of gadolinium-containing MRI contrast agents should be avoided in patients with severely impaired renal function (eg, estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;30 mL/min). If gadolinium-based imaging must be performed in a patient with moderately to severely impaired renal function, there may be a role for dialysis to reduce the risk of development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Approaches to prevention of NSF are discussed separately. (See

         TGCT is an idiopathic, benign disorder occurring primarily in young and middle-aged adults. The pathologic process can involve any joint, bursa, or tendon sheath. The disease is characterized by synovial hypertrophy with diffuse hemosiderin deposits within the joint. The knee is the most commonly involved joint in TGCT. TGCT typically involves one compartment of the knee, and the joint space is maintained until late in the disease.

         Synovial chondromatosis is a benign disorder of the synovial lining, characterized by the presence of loose cartilaginous bodies. Ossification of these cartilaginous bodies may occur in 70 to 95 percent of cases (osteochondromatosis) [

Ganglion cysts arising from the cruciate ligaments are filled with gelatinous fluid. They present as unilocular or multilocular cysts on MRI.

The most common benign soft tissue tumors around the knee in adults are lipoma and hemangioma. The most common malignant soft tissue tumor around the knee is sarcoma, with undifferentiated/unclassified soft tissue sarcoma (previously termed malignant fibrous histiocytoma or undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma), liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor accounting for 75 percent of all soft tissue sarcomas.

         Parosteal osteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumor seen in patients aged 20 to 45 years. It is a metaphyseal bone tumor, particularly common on the posterior surface of the distal femur and the proximal tibia. Parosteal osteosarcomas affect the bones about the knee in approximately 70 percent of cases. Clinically, parosteal osteosarcoma presents with insidious onset of pain, swelling, and palpable mass, often about the knee [

         Plain film radiography – Plain film radiography most commonly demonstrates a bone lesion on the posterior surface of the distal femoral metaphysis.

         Lipoma is the most common soft tissue tumor, occurring commonly after the age of 20 years. Lipoma presents as an asymptomatic, slow-growing, round, well-defined mass with a soft consistency, usually superficial in location. Lipoma may also be intramuscular in location, presenting as a large and less well-defined mass. Plain film radiography reveals a radiolucent, round soft tissue mass, which may demonstrate calcification. CT and MRI show a homogeneously fatty mass. MRI with intravenous contrast helps in differentiating a lipoma from a high-grade liposarcoma [

         Soft tissue hemangioma is one of the most common soft tissue tumors, seen most frequently in infancy and childhood but also encountered in adults, more commonly in women. It is usually intramuscular, although synovial hemangiomas also occur (see
         <a class="local">
          'Intraarticular tumors and tumor-like lesions'

         above). Soft tissue hemangioma is a deep intramuscular mass which has cystic, dilated blood-filled spaces. Clinically, it presents as a mass or pain due to muscle hypoxia. Plain film radiographs demonstrate an area of increased density suggestive of a mass, or they may be normal. The presence of phleboliths associated with a soft tissue mass is a specific finding seen in hemangiomas. MRI is useful for characterization of the extent of the hemangioma and demonstrates a specific appearance [

         About 40 percent of soft tissue sarcomas occur in the lower extremities, usually around the knee. Soft tissue sarcomas usually present as a painless mass, often large at the time of diagnosis, and they metastasize hematogenously, mainly to the lung. Plain film radiographs demonstrate a soft tissue mass and may be used to evaluate the bone involvement and calcifications within the tumor. MRI is the imaging modality of choice, showing the extent of the tumor and adjacent neurovascular involvement. MRI is valuable for preoperative planning and for postoperative follow-up [

         Synovial cysts are juxtaarticular fluid collections lined by synovial cells. A synovial cyst is a focal extension of joint fluid that may or may not communicate with the joint. They may be detected as incidental findings on MRI or associated with other pathology such as osteoarthritis, trauma, or inflammatory arthropathies. They may be asymptomatic or present with pain. The most common synovial cyst is a Baker's cyst, with an incidence of 38 percent on MRI [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4

         ]. Baker's cyst represents fluid distention of the gastrocnemius-semimembranosus bursa. On MRI, a Baker's cyst presents as a well-defined, unilocular or multilocular cystic mass located posteromedially, with fluid signal intensity. Complications of Baker's cyst include rupture, hemorrhage, or infection. Ultrasound is a valuable modality in evaluation of popliteal masses, by differentiating a purely cystic mass from a complex cyst or a solid mass. Ultrasound evaluation shows a well-demarcated fluid collection arising from the gastrocnemius–semimembranosus bursa. If the cyst ruptures, fluid is seen tracking deep to deep fascia and superficial to the medial head of the gastrocnemius. In the acute phase, diffuse subcutaneous edema may be identified [
