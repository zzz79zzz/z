Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) affects millions of women; approximately 200,000 inpatient surgical procedures for prolapse are performed annually in the United States [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Eleven to 19 percent of women will undergo surgery for POP or incontinence by age 80 to 85 years, and 30 percent of these women will require an additional POP or incontinence surgery [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. Anterior vaginal wall prolapse without concomitant apical prolapse is uncommon [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], and apical prolapse repair should be included in the majority of pelvic reconstructive surgery procedures. </p><p>Reconstructive procedures for prolapse of the vaginal apex are reviewed here. Evaluation of women with POP, conservative management, and choosing a primary surgical procedure are discussed separately. Obliterative procedures for POP (colpocleisis) are also discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8072.html" rel="external">"Pelvic organ prolapse in females: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8081.html" rel="external">"Vaginal pessaries: Indications, devices, and approach to selection"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14212.html" rel="external">"Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Choosing a primary surgical procedure"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15268.html" rel="external">"Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Obliterative procedures (including colpocleisis)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1631653"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The International Continence Society defines apical vaginal prolapse as any descent of the vaginal cuff scar or cervix, below a point which is 2 cm less than the total vaginal length about the plane of the hymen [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The clinical significance of apical descent that is not beyond the hymen is unclear, as half of asymptomatic women presenting for routine gynecologic care have prolapse to the hymen [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Similarly, studies suggest that prolapse becomes symptomatic when the leading edge protrudes beyond the vaginal opening [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. However, isolated anterior vaginal wall defects are uncommon. Therefore, if the anterior vaginal wall protrudes beyond the hymen, the apex likely has inadequate support, as well [<a href="#rid5">5,9</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14533665"><span class="h1">ANATOMY AND MECHANISMS OF INJURY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Apical prolapse refers to the downward displacement of the vaginal apex  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67287" href="/d/graphic/67287.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The vaginal apex is either the uterus and cervix or, in women who have undergone subtotal or total hysterectomy, the cervix or vaginal cuff. </p><p>Support of the vaginal apex is primarily derived from the integrity of the uterosacral and cardinal ligaments, the continuity of the endopelvic fascia, and a neuromuscularly intact levator ani muscle  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61643" href="/d/graphic/61643.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). The etiology of apical prolapse is likely related to connective tissue, neural, and/or muscular defects in these normal supports.</p><p>It is rare to find isolated apical prolapse or isolated prolapse of the anterior or posterior vaginal walls, since the defects in the connective tissue, neural pathways, and muscle are not confined to one site [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. </p><p>The anatomy of the female pelvic floor is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8072.html" rel="external">"Pelvic organ prolapse in females: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and management", section on 'Anatomy of pelvic support'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">RISK FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The risk factors for developing apical prolapse are generally the same as for developing anterior or posterior vaginal wall prolapse. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8072.html" rel="external">"Pelvic organ prolapse in females: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and management", section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prior hysterectomy</strong> – The most common risk factors associated with apical prolapse are vaginal parity (number of vaginal deliveries) and previous hysterectomy [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. The risk of prolapse after hysterectomy was illustrated in a case-control study in which 160,000 women who underwent hysterectomy were significantly more likely than age-matched controls to require subsequent pelvic floor repair (3.2 versus 2 percent) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Women who have prolapse at the time of hysterectomy have an even higher risk of subsequent surgery for POP. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prior vaginal delivery or POP surgery</strong> – A case-control study of women who underwent hysterectomy reported that the risk of subsequent POP repair was 5-fold in those who had a history of vaginal delivery, 8-fold in those who had prior surgery for POP or urinary incontinence, and almost 13-fold in those who had grade 2 or higher prolapse at the time of hysterectomy [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Surgeons should resuspend the vaginal apex when performing hysterectomy for nonprolapse indications to minimize this risk.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk factors for post-operative POP recurrence </strong>– A Dutch trial comparing sacrospinous hysteropexy to vaginal hysterectomy with uterosacral ligament suspension for individuals with ≥stage 2 prolapse reported five-year prolapse outcomes using a composite measure of prolapse beyond the hymen, bothersome bulge symptoms, repeated surgery, or pessary use for recurrent prolapse. The risk of failure was increased with smoking (odds ratio [OR] 2.88, 95% CI 1.12-7.40), more anterior compartment prolapse (preoperative POP-Q point Ba [OR 1.23 per 1 cm; 95% CI 1.01-1.50]), and higher body mass index (OR 1.10 per 1 kg/m<sup>2,</sup> 95% CI 1.02-1.19) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. These risks should be addressed when counseling patients regarding vaginal prolapse repair.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7963411"><span class="h1">CANDIDATES FOR APICAL PROLAPSE REPAIR</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Indications for apical prolapse repair are generally the same as for other POP repair procedures (ie, symptomatic prolapse in women who decline or fail conservative therapy and who can tolerate surgery). Prolapse is not typically symptomatic until the vagina protrudes through the hymen. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14212.html" rel="external">"Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Choosing a primary surgical procedure", section on 'Candidates for surgical treatment'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8072.html" rel="external">"Pelvic organ prolapse in females: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and management", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14538830"><span class="h1">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION AND PREPARATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In women planning surgical repair of apical prolapse, surgeons should assess each vaginal compartment (apical, anterior, and posterior) for the presence of support defects or prolapse. In addition, POP often coexists with urinary and/or anal incontinence. During the history and physical examination, the presence and severity of each of these disorders should be assessed, as this information may alter surgical decision making. </p><p>Aspects of preoperative evaluation and preparation that are specific to apical prolapse repair are discussed in this section. General principles of evaluation of women undergoing POP repair are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8080.html" rel="external">"Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Diagnostic evaluation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14539430"><span class="h2">Informed consent and patient goals</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Shared decision making is crucial when discussing surgical options for prolapse to align the patient's goals for treatment with surgical risks and outcomes. Surgeons should discuss with each woman the pelvic symptoms that are bothersome to her and their effects on her quality of life. This helps to set realistic goals for reconstructive surgery and assess postoperative improvement. Patient satisfaction after surgery for POP and urinary incontinence correlates highly with achievement of self-described preoperative surgical goals but poorly with objective outcome measures [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>]. </p><p>Informed consent for repair of apical prolapse should include a discussion of the risk of persistent or recurrent prolapse at the apex, anterior, or posterior vaginal walls, as well as the efficacy of the procedure in reducing or eliminating the patient's pelvic symptoms. Since some women develop stress urinary incontinence (SUI) following apical prolapse repair, surgeons should also discuss the risk of developing incontinence, as well as the risks and benefits of performing a prophylactic incontinence procedure versus deferring an incontinence procedure until symptoms develop. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation of urinary dysfunction'</a> below.)</p><p>Other important items to discuss with women planning apical POP surgery include potential postoperative changes in sexual function and mesh-related complications if mesh will be used for the repair. In our practice, we counsel all women undergoing pelvic surgery that there is a risk of postoperative dyspareunia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/115279.html" rel="external">"Transvaginal synthetic mesh: Complications and risk factors", section on 'Complications by procedure'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common clinical manifestation of prolapse of the vaginal apex is a bulge or protrusion from the vagina  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70607" href="/d/graphic/70607.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). Protrusion of the vagina may result in vaginal discharge and/or bleeding from ulceration. Other symptoms commonly reported by women with apical prolapse are voiding difficulty and constipation; some women need to reduce the prolapse using a finger in the vagina (ie, splint) to urinate or defecate. </p><p>Women with advanced anterior or posterior vaginal wall prolapse may have similar symptoms and pelvic examination is needed to ascertain the site(s) and stage of prolapse. Investigators demonstrated that restoration of the vaginal apex during prolapse examination fixes anterior vaginal wall defects 50 percent of the time and posterior vaginal wall defects 30 percent of the time [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A thorough speculum and bimanual pelvic examination are performed. We perform apical prolapse assessment initially with the woman standing and straining. Each vaginal compartment (apical, anterior, and posterior) should then be examined with the women supine. The apical prolapse can be visualized during speculum examination with the woman straining as the speculum is slowly withdrawn from the upper third of the vagina. In some women with advanced apical prolapse, protrusion of the apex is visible at or beyond the vaginal introitus before the speculum is inserted  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70607" href="/d/graphic/70607.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). </p><p>Since isolated apical prolapse is rare, careful assessment of the anterior and posterior wall is important [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. </p><p>The findings of the examination should be recorded using a quantitative and reproducible method for recording POP. The system currently recommended by the International Continence Society and the American Urogynecologic Society is the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantitation System (POP-Q)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74368" href="/d/graphic/74368.html" rel="external">figure 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57450" href="/d/graphic/57450.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8080.html" rel="external">"Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Diagnostic evaluation", section on 'Speculum and bimanual examination'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Evaluation of urinary dysfunction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Apical prolapse frequently coexists with urinary incontinence or urinary retention, and women planning apical prolapse repair should be evaluated for these conditions. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7962270"><span class="h3">Urinary incontinence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Women with symptoms of both POP and SUI are treated with a combined prolapse repair and continence procedure. Women with POP but no SUI symptoms are challenging because they can have stage II or greater apical prolapse and remain continent despite loss of anterior vaginal and bladder/urethral support but then become incontinent after POP repair. Studies have reported 13 to 65 percent of continent women develop symptoms of stress incontinence after surgical correction of the prolapse [<a href="#rid7">7,21-23</a>]. This likely occurs because the prolapse kinks and obstructs the urethra; this obstruction is alleviated when the prolapse is repaired. This is referred to as "occult" or "potential" stress incontinence. Women with stage I POP are unlikely to have urethral obstruction and resultant occult stress incontinence [<a href="#rid7">7,21-23</a>].</p><p>To detect occult incontinence, we perform a preoperative evaluation for occult stress incontinence during which the prolapse is reduced. Stress testing can be done via a basic office evaluation with full-bladder cough stress test or urodynamic testing. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/91017.html" rel="external">"Urogynecologic surgery: Perioperative care issues", section on 'Urodynamic studies'</a>.) </p><p>While we perform preoperative evaluation for occult SUI, we recognize that the ability of preoperative prolapse reduction testing to predict postoperative urinary incontinence is limited. In study of stress-continent women undergoing preoperative urodynamic testing prior to sacrocolpopexy, nearly 4 percent of women had urodynamic stress incontinence when the prolapse was not reduced, which increased to 27 percent of women with prolapse reduction [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. When all methods of prolapse reduction were combined, the positive and negative predictive values of preoperative prolapse reduction stress testing were 37 and 80 percent, respectively. While the positive predictive value of preoperative reduction stress tests is low, it appears to be helpful in surgical planning. In a multicenter trial of continent women undergoing vaginal prolapse repair who were randomly assigned to concomitant midurethral sling or sham incision, women with a positive cough stress test had more benefit from prophylactic sling than those without a positive stress test [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8068.html" rel="external">"Pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence in females: Surgical treatment", section on 'Occult SUI'</a>.)</p><p>For continent women with stage II or greater POP who undergo abdominal sacrocolpopexy or vaginal native tissue repairs, high-quality data indicate that bothersome stress incontinence is less likely to develop in women who undergo a concomitant procedure for SUI rather than an apical prolapse procedure alone. Concomitant SUI procedure at the time of prolapse repair is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8068.html" rel="external">"Pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence in females: Surgical treatment", section on 'Symptomatic POP without symptomatic SUI'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7962350"><span class="h3">Urinary retention</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Urinary retention is evaluated by measuring a postvoid residual urine volume (PVR) within 10 minutes after the patient has voided. In general, a PVR of less than 50 to 100 mL is considered adequate emptying, and a PVR greater than 200 mL is considered inadequate. An elevated preoperative PVR normalizes after surgical correction of prolapse in over 90 percent of women [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14306274"><span class="h2">Evaluation of defecatory dysfunction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Women with POP should be asked about symptoms of defecatory dysfunction (eg, constipation, the need to place pressure on, or "splint," the posterior vaginal wall to defecate, anal incontinence). Such symptoms should be evaluated prior to surgery, as appropriate. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8072.html" rel="external">"Pelvic organ prolapse in females: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and management", section on 'Defecatory symptoms'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2561.html" rel="external">"Fecal incontinence in adults: Etiology and evaluation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7962786"><span class="h1">SURGICAL PLANNING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When planning surgery for quality of life disorders, such as apical prolapse, factors beyond simple anatomic outcomes are discussed by each woman with her surgeon. Such factors include the woman's goals for surgery, concerns for symptom recurrence and reoperation, ability to tolerate surgery, preferences regarding recovery time and complication profile of each surgery, and concerns regarding sexual function  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef56020" href="/d/graphic/56020.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Key issues for discussion include the choice of surgical route (abdominal [open, laparoscopic, robotic] or vaginal) and the risks and benefits of that route, the need for repair of other pelvic defects, and the presence of urinary incontinence. In addition, women undergoing intraperitoneal surgery must further decide if they desire hysterectomy as part of the repair, elective or risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or prophylactic salpingectomy for ovarian cancer risk reduction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14212.html" rel="external">"Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Choosing a primary surgical procedure", section on 'Concomitant hysterectomy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/91886.html" rel="external">"Opportunistic salpingectomy for ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal carcinoma risk reduction", section on 'Candidates'</a>.)</p><p>Issues specific to planning repair of apical prolapse are discussed in this section.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14212.html" rel="external">"Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Choosing a primary surgical procedure", section on 'Candidates for surgical treatment'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21188326"><span class="h2">Abdominal versus vaginal approach</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1040406330"><span class="h3">Summary</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>To repair apical vaginal prolapse, the surgeon must decide between abdominal or vaginal surgical routes. Data suggest that abdominal surgery, typically with an abdominal sacrocolpopexy (ASC) or sacrospinous hysteropexy, provides better objective anatomic outcomes than native tissue vaginal apical support procedures for most women [<a href="#rid28">28-32</a>]. However, vaginal procedures are a reasonable alternative because of similar rates of postoperative prolapse symptoms, reoperation, and adverse events compared with ASC [<a href="#rid28">28-30,33,34</a>]. The uterus or fallopian tubes can be removed by either route. </p><p>While the majority of studies on ASC outcomes used an open technique, laparoscopic and robot-assisted approaches are now more commonly performed. Laparoscopic and robotic approaches appear to offer the improved vaginal support associated with open procedures and the shorter recovery of vaginal procedures [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. One trial of 112 women randomly assigned to laparoscopic or open ASC reported no difference between the procedures for recurrence of apical prolapse (none in either group), surgical complications, or mesh exposures at a mean of 41 months of follow-up, although there were significantly more anterior compartment recurrences in the laparoscopic group compared with the abdominal group (18 versus 2 percent) [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].

A major limitation of this study is that most sacrocolpopexies were done using an open technique, which is associated with more complications and longer recoveries than laparoscopic and robotic approaches. For comparison, a large retrospective cohort study of over 450 women undergoing laparoscopic or robotic sacrocolpopexy reported a gastrointestinal complication rate of only 2.6 percent [<a href="#rid44">44</a>].

It is controversial whether repair of apical prolapse is sufficient to support the anterior and posterior vaginal walls or if additional procedures are required to address anterior and/or posterior prolapse. If the vaginal muscularis is well suspended at the apex, many anterior and posterior defects will also resolve; conversely, correction of anterior or posterior prolapse does not repair apical descent. Anterior vaginal wall prolapse, in particular, is highly correlated with apical prolapse. The approach to concomitant repair of multiple sites of prolapse varies by surgical route and by site of prolapse. A detailed discussion of the concomitant repair of multiple sites of prolapse can be found separately.

In two studies totaling over 300 women that assessed opinions on uterine preservation versus hysterectomy at the time of POP repair, 36 to 60 percent of women indicated they would prefer uterine preservation in the scenario of equal surgical outcomes between the two approaches [<a href="#rid50">50,51</a>]. In the scenario of superior surgical results with hysterectomy, 21 percent of women indicated they would still decline a hysterectomy and elect uterine preservation instead. Women with a history of cervical pathology, abnormal uterine bleeding, or other risk factors for uterine malignancy are not typically candidates for uterine preservation. Uterine preservation necessitates ongoing surveillance for cervical and uterine pathology, which may be more technically challenging following prolapse repair.</p><p>While hysterectomy has traditionally been performed with POP repair, there are few data to support that practice. Comparison of study outcomes between hysteropexy and hysterectomy are confounded by anatomic variables (isolated apical prolapse or multiple compartment prolapse), hormonal status (premenopausal, postmenopausal on hormone therapy, and postmenopausal without hormone therapy), surgical approach (vaginal, open abdominal, laparoscopic, and robotic), and use of synthetic mesh or native tissue. In addition, the number of women who subsequently undergo hysterectomy after a uterus-sparing prolapse surgery is not known.</p><p>In general, despite the multiple surgeries and approaches that limit direct comparison of data, uterus-preserving surgery appears to have similar success rates and shorter surgical times compared with hysterectomy. Thus, the decision to preserve or remove the uterus is heavily based on the patient's preferences, risks for future cervical or uterine pathology, and the potential for subsequent uterine surgery, including hysterectomy. Supporting data include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Transvaginal mesh hysteropexy compared with vaginal hysterectomy and ULS</strong> – A multicenter trial comparing transvaginal mesh hysteropexy using Uphold LITE with vaginal hysterectomy with ULS in 183 women with symptomatic uterovaginal prolapse collected data at three and five years [<a href="#rid31">31,52</a>].

Not surprisingly, adverse events rates and operative times differed between the surgeries. Transvaginal mesh hysteropexy had a higher rate of mesh exposure (8 versus 0 percent) while hysterectomy had a higher rate of prolonged (&gt;12 weeks) granulation tissue (11 versus 1 percent) and permanent suture exposure (21 versus 3 percent), although none required operative intervention. Mean operative time for hysterectomy was 45 minutes longer. Patients undergoing hysterectomy also had higher rates of ureteral kinking that were managed intraoperatively (7 versus 0 percent).

Some retrospective studies have also found a significant decrease in blood loss (eg, 60 to 150 mL less) with laparoscopic procedures [<a href="#rid68">68,70</a>]. A large retrospective cohort study of 450 women undergoing laparoscopic and/or robotic sacrocolpopexy reported high anatomic success rates and few complications [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. A disadvantage of laparoscopic procedures is a longer operative duration (eg, one to two hours longer). In addition, robotic procedures are more costly than laparotomy or conventional laparoscopy [<a href="#rid73">73,74</a>]. A United Kingdom multicenter randomized equivalence trial compared open with laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy. At one year, there were no differences in anatomic or subjective pelvic floor outcomes; however, blood loss, postoperative hemoglobin values, and hospital stay were better in the laparoscopic arm [<a href="#rid75">75</a>]. Many surgeons initially adopted a higher sacral fixation point when performing laparoscopic and robotic procedures. Case reports of vertebral discitis [<a href="#rid76">76</a>] and cadaveric and magnetic resonance imaging studies suggest that to avoid disc complications, sutures should be placed inferior to the promontory to avoid the intravertebral disc [<a href="#rid77">77,78</a>].</p><p>Performing sacrocolpopexy requires suturing, which is more difficult to do with conventional than during robot-assisted laparoscopy.

Minimally invasive procedures have equivalent prolapse outcomes and adverse events to open procedures with decreased recovery times.</p><p>Regardless of route of access, the technique is to attach a permanent mesh to the posterior vagina to the level of the rectal reflection and to the anterior vagina for a distance of 4 cm, or just above the bladder trigone. It is acceptable to use a mesh fashioned into a Y configuration or to use two separate strips of mesh. Alternatively, the posterior mesh may extend to the perineal body, adding support to this area (sacral colpoperineopexy). Two rows of sutures are then used to widely attach the mesh to the vagina to distribute the tension; the sutures should approximate the mesh to the vaginal walls for a distance of several centimeters. Permanent sutures are typically used to attach the mesh to the vagina and sacrum. Secondary to concern about vaginal erosion of permanent sutures, some surgeons are starting to use delayed absorbable sutures. In the Colpopexy and Urinary Reduction Efforts (CARE) trial (a randomized trial that compared ASC with and without Burch colposuspension) of 322 women undergoing ASC with permanent sutures, only three participants had a vaginal erosion of the permanent suture in the first two years after surgery [<a href="#rid81">81</a>]. The suture was simply removed in all three patients; two healed without further problem, and the other was lost to follow-up. Given the lack of high-quality data supporting comparable anatomic and/or symptomatic outcomes with use of delayed absorbable sutures and the minimal risks associated with permanent suture, patients should be counseled appropriately if nonpermanent sutures are used.</p><p>Failure to attach the mesh anteriorly results in anterior vaginal wall recurrence rates of almost 30 percent [<a href="#rid82">82</a>]. The optimal approach for posterior vaginal wall attachment is unclear; however, simply attaching the mesh to the rectovaginal septum to maintain continuity with the perineal body results in high success rates [<a href="#rid83">83</a>].

Women who do not have sufficient vaginal length for SSLS may be candidates for sacrocolpopexy. </p><p>The sacrospinous ligament extends from the ischial spines to the lower portion of the sacrum and coccyx  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60078" href="/d/graphic/60078.html" rel="external">figure 6</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57811" href="/d/graphic/57811.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>). The coccygeus muscle follows the same path as the sacrospinous ligament; together they are referred to as the coccygeus muscle-sacrospinous ligament complex  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82007" href="/d/graphic/82007.html" rel="external">figure 8</a>). The ligament can be identified on pelvic examination by palpating the ischial spine and tracing posteriorly and medially to the sacrum [<a href="#rid112">112</a>]. Marking sutures are placed on the vaginal epithelium at the site where it will attach to the sacrospinous ligament. </p><p>Several techniques are commonly used when performing a SSLS. In one modification, the perirectal space is entered by opening the posterior vagina in the midline from the perineal body to the apex. The vaginal epithelium is then separated from the underlying muscularis. The dissection is continued to the level of the ischial spine. The rectovaginal space is opened by gently pushing the rectum medially then perforating the rectal pillar (areolar tissue that extends from the rectum to the arcus tendineus fascia pelvis and overlies the levator muscle)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51329" href="/d/graphic/51329.html" rel="external">figure 9</a>) [<a href="#rid113">113</a>].</p><p>Once the perirectal space is entered, the ischial spine can be palpated and the ligament found medially. A long right angle retractor (eg, Breisky-Navratil) is placed on the ischial spine to protect the pudendal neurovascular bundle and two others are used to retract the bladder superiorly and the rectum medially. </p><p>With the ligament clearly visible, two to three sutures are placed through the ligament approximately one and one-half fingerbreadths medial to the ischial spine. Several techniques and devices are available to assist placing the suture through the ligament (eg, Miya hook, Deschamps ligature carrier, laparoscopic or Capio suturing devices) [<a href="#rid108">108</a>].</p><p>After securing the sutures to the ligament complex, each of the sutures is placed through the muscularis on the undersurface of the posterior vaginal epithelium and tied by a pulley stitch, while the free end of the suture is held. Traction on the free end of the suture draws the vaginal apex directly onto the sacrospinous ligament and the suture is tied.</p><p>Another common modification of the SSLS is the "Michigan Modification" technique [<a href="#rid114">114,115</a>]. In the Michigan Modification, all four vaginal walls are directly approximated to the sacrospinous ligament (instead of just the posterior vaginal wall). The point on each vaginal wall that reaches the ligament is identified, and the intervening diamond of vaginal epithelium is excised. The sutures are placed through the sacrospinous ligament, as described above, then sewn through to both the anterior and posterior vagina and tied to the ligament. A long-lasting absorbable suture is used. The goal of this modification is to decrease the risk of an anterior vaginal wall recurrence; although it has not been evaluated in comparative studies with standard SSLS, case series report high long-term satisfaction rates after the procedure. A single-site study reported that 76 percent of women were "completely or very" satisfied at least five years after SSLS [<a href="#rid115">115</a>]. The largest randomized trial comparing ULS and SSLS used this technique.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8286306"><span class="h4">Avoiding nerve entrapment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are several techniques to decrease the risk of entrapment of the sciatic nerve or its branches when the sutures are placed. One approach is to perforate the sacrospinous ligament with the needle in a vertical rather than horizontal orientation, thereby attempting to place the suture parallel to the course of these nerves. Also, since these nerves did not travel in the lateral third segment of the sacrospinous ligament, placement of the fixation sutures within this region is another approach to decrease the risk of nerve injury. Regional anesthesia of prolonged duration should not be used postoperatively in women undergoing SSLS, since this may mask the symptoms of nerve entrapment.

Controlling hemorrhage is challenging because of the small space, lack of visualization, and close approximation of vessels and nerves. Techniques to control bleeding include pressure, topical hemostatic agents, direct repair, vaginal packing, and embolization. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3302.html" rel="external">"Management of hemorrhage in gynecologic surgery"</a>.)</p><p>Based on cadaveric study, vessels at risk for injury include the superior gluteal, inferior gluteal, internal pudendal, vertebral, middle sacral, lateral sacral, and circumflex femoral [<a href="#rid118">118</a>]. Among these vessels, the inferior gluteal artery and its coccygeal branch appear to be the arteries at greatest risk for injury [<a href="#rid118">118,119</a>]. Bleeding encountered during SSLS can typically be managed conservatively with surgical clips, pressure, and/or hemostatic agents. A laparoscopic clip applier can facilitate visualization in this deep space when a discrete vessel is identified. Alternatively, use of hemostatic agents and packing for 5 to 10 minutes will control most bleeding. Computed tomography angiography and vessel embolization can be performed when bleeding cannot be controlled with more conservative measures [<a href="#rid117">117,120-122</a>].

Therefore, as noted above, women with large anterior wall defects in addition to apical descent may benefit from an additional type of prolapse repair, which more directly addresses support of the anterior vagina.

If the sciatic nerve is entrapped in the suture, the classic triad of nerves entrapment will present (paresthesias, pain, temporary relief with injection of local anesthetic). The patient typically awakens with severe buttock pain radiating down the posterior leg. Delay in diagnosis and treatment can result in permanent neuropathy; therefore, as noted above, regional anesthesia of prolonged duration should not be used for this type of surgery. Upon diagnosis of nerve entrapment, the patient should be taken back to the operating room immediately to have the sutures removed. </p><p>The effect of SSLS on sexual function has not been well studied.

The peritoneal cavity is entered and the uterosacral ligaments identified. An Allis clamp can be used to tent the uterosacral ligament, making it easier to identify. The rectum is retracted medially.</p><p>Two or three permanent sutures are passed through the uterosacral ligament on each side. These are placed 1.5 centimeters medial and 1.5 centimeters posterior to the ischial spine. The sutures are numbered sequentially with labeled Kelly clamps, one through six, to facilitate vaginal placement. In serial fashion, one arm of each suture is passed through the anterior muscularis surrounding the vaginal apex and the other through the posterior endopelvic fascia. The sutures thereby cross the width of the vaginal apex. All sutures are then tied, re-approximating the anterior and posterior vaginal muscularis, closing any potential enterocele defect, and elevating the vaginal apex toward the sacrum.</p><p>Retrospective chart review of 248 procedures found that 1 percent with permanent sutures had loss of support beyond the hymen versus 6 percent in delayed absorbable group [<a href="#rid136">136</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8286370"><span class="h4">Avoiding or detecting ureteral injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The average distance from the lateral aspect of the suspension sutures to the medial border of the ureters was 14 mm in a cadaver study [<a href="#rid137">137</a>].

The rates of a successful outcome for each compartment were apical (98 percent), anterior (81 percent), and posterior (87 percent). Meta-analysis of subjective outcomes was not possible due to methodologic differences across studies; relief of prolapse symptoms was reported by 82 to 100 percent of patients (this outcome was only reported by five studies). Reoperation for symptomatic prolapse was reported in 9 percent of women (reported by four studies). A large multicenter trial reported success rates at five years to be less promising [<a href="#rid105">105</a>].

Cystoscopy should be done routinely at the completion of each case to prevent delayed recognition of ureteral injury. Ureteral kinking from the uterosacral suture is found during routine intraoperative cystoscopy in up to 11 percent of cases [<a href="#rid140">140,141</a>]. If both ureters do not efflux briskly, the most lateral suture (closest to the ureter) on that side should be removed. Typically, removing this suture is sufficient to restore brisk ureteral efflux without further sequelae, although ureteral injury requiring ureteroneocystostomy has been reported. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3288.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic cystourethroscopy (cystoscopy) for gynecologic conditions", section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p>The sacral nerves can be ligated if ULS sutures are placed lateral to the ligament fibers or too deep into the pelvic sidewall [<a href="#rid137">137,142,143</a>].

There are few data regarding this procedure. In a case-control study of 128 women, one- to two-year follow-up, subjective success rates were similar for iliococcygeus suspension and SSLS (91 versus 94 percent), but objective success occurred significantly more frequently in women who underwent SSLS (53 versus 67 percent) [<a href="#rid144">144</a>].

High complication rates were found with apical mesh procedures (up to 17.6 percent) with mesh exposure and dyspareunia most common. In contrast, authors of another systematic review of vaginal mesh procedures for POP concluded that there were insufficient data to determine efficacy of vaginal mesh procedures for apical POP [<a href="#rid147">147</a>]. This systematic review also found high complication rates associated with vaginal mesh placement, including graft exposure in up to 30 percent, urinary tract infections in up to 19 percent, and visceral injury in up to 3 percent. A randomized trial compared a total vaginal mesh procedure (Prolift; this device has now been removed from the market) with laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy [<a href="#rid148">148</a>]. At two-year follow-up, women in the sacrocolpopexy group had a significantly higher objective success rate (77 versus 43 percent) and a lower reoperation rate (5 versus 22 percent).

Common symptoms of apical prolapse are a vaginal bulge, difficulty voiding, or constipation. (See <a class="local">'Anatomy and mechanisms of injury'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Surgical indications</strong> – Surgical candidates for apical prolapse include symptomatic women who have failed or declined conservative management. Prolapse is typically a chronic problem, and women often prefer surgery to conservative therapy since successful surgery does not require ongoing maintenance to control symptoms. (See <a class="local">'Candidates for apical prolapse repair'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Abdominal sacrocolpopexy</strong> – Apical prolapse repair via sacrocolpopexy is more effective at restoring vaginal topography than traditional vaginal repairs, although subjective outcomes are similar after the two types of procedures. We suggest abdominal sacrocolpopexy (ASC) rather than transvaginal repair for most women undergoing apical prolapse repair (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'Abdominal versus vaginal approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Laparoscopy rather than open surgery</strong> – Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy is as effective as open sacrocolpopexy but results in decreased blood loss and shorter hospital stays. As a result, minimally invasive routes are preferred to open sacrocolpopexy in most patients. (See <a class="local">'Laparoscopic or robotic procedures'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Mesh selection</strong> – For women with apical prolapse undergoing ASC, we recommend ultra-lightweight synthetic polypropylene mesh over biografts (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). Synthetic mesh use in sacrocolpopexy reduces the risk of recurrent apical prolapse. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8077.html" rel="external">"Transvaginal synthetic mesh: Use in pelvic organ prolapse"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Transvaginal surgery</strong> – A vaginal surgical approach is a reasonable alternative to an abdominal approach for women who cannot tolerate abdominal surgery, have no risk factors for prolapse recurrence (risk factors include young age, obesity, stage III or IV POP, previous failed POP repair), are having concomitant vaginal surgery, or have risk factors for mesh-related complications (eg, concomitant hysterectomy, smoking, immunosuppression, obesity). (See <a class="local">'Abdominal versus vaginal approach'</a> above and <a class="local">'Choice of procedure'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Vaginal procedures</strong> – Transvaginal apical repair procedures include sacrospinous ligament suspension and uterosacral ligament suspension. The efficacy of these two procedures appears comparable, but each procedure is associated with different risks of complications. (See <a class="local">'Choice of procedure'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Concomitant continence surgery</strong> – For women undergoing repair of apical prolapse, a concomitant continence procedure is often performed to treat or prevent stress urinary incontinence. Midurethral slings are the preferred concomitant procedure if a vaginal route is used for prolapse repair; some surgeons also place a midurethral sling at the time of ASC. (See <a class="local">'Concomitant surgery for stress urinary incontinence'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For women undergoing Burch colposuspension, we suggest a laparoscopic rather than open approach (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_4" rel="external">Grade 2A</a>). Open colposuspension should be performed if the surgeon is not experience in the laparoscopic technique for this procedure.
