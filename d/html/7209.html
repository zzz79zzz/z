         Nephrocalcinosis is characterized by the deposition of calcium salts in the kidney parenchyma and tubules. Nephrocalcinosis may cause acute or chronic kidney injury or be incidentally detected radiographically in a patient with normal kidney function. Nephrocalcinosis is caused by multiple different conditions, and the kidney prognosis is determined by the underlying cause. Whereas most patients with nephrocalcinosis do not progress to kidney failure, certain underlying conditions, if not effectively treated, may be associated with progressive chronic kidney disease and sometimes kidney failure.

         This topic will review the pathogenesis, causes, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of nephrocalcinosis. Nephrocalcinosis in neonates is discussed separately. (See

         The term nephrocalcinosis is used to describe the deposition of calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate in the kidney [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. Some experts limit the definition of nephrocalcinosis to the deposition of calcium phosphate and refer to the deposition of calcium oxalate as oxalosis [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. For the purposes of this review, we retain the broader definition of nephrocalcinosis to include both calcium phosphate and calcium oxalate. The term oxalosis will refer exclusively to calcium oxalate deposition.
        </p>
        <p>
         The defining characteristic of nephrocalcinosis is calcium deposition in the kidney [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Very focal or localized calcium deposition that occurs with focal kidney injury is not included in this definition.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nephrocalcinosis is classified as follows [
         <a href="#rid2">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Nephrocalcinosis can involve the renal medulla or, much less often, the cortex. In the largest reported series of 375 patients with macroscopic nephrocalcinosis, 97 percent involved the medulla [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Cortical nephrocalcinosis accounted for less than 3 percent of cases and was usually due to severe underlying cortical disease, such as renal cortical necrosis (often associated with pregnancy) or chronic glomerulonephritis [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,6
         </a>
         ]. Other causes of cortical nephrocalcinosis include primary and secondary oxalosis (which can also cause medullary nephrocalcinosis) and kidney allograft rejection [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-9

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Nephrocalcinosis is caused by an increase in calcium, phosphate, and/or oxalate in the kidney tubular fluid [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,10
         </a>
         ]. The most common cause of nephrocalcinosis is increased urinary calcium excretion with or without hypercalcemia. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Risk factors and causes'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         These metabolic abnormalities are also closely associated with nephrolithiasis, and patients frequently present with both conditions. However, for reasons that are not clear, nephrocalcinosis is not always associated with nephrolithiasis, and nephrolithiasis often occurs in the absence of nephrocalcinosis. In addition, nephrocalcinosis often suggests a serious metabolic defect, whereas nephrolithiasis is commonly observed in otherwise healthy individuals [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7375.html" rel="external">
          "Kidney stones in adults: Epidemiology and risk factors"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         One study evaluated the incidence of nephrocalcinosis in 67 patients with nephrolithiasis (14 with hydroxyapatite, 19 with brushite, and 34 with idiopathic calcium oxalate stones) who did not have the three most common forms of nephrocalcinosis, namely primary hyperparathyroidism, medullary sponge kidney, and distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Nephrocalcinosis was more common among the calcium phosphate stone formers than among the calcium oxalate stone formers (71 and 58 versus 18 percent for hydroxyapatite, brushite, and idiopathic calcium oxalate stones, respectively). In addition, the extent of nephrocalcinosis based upon a scoring system was also more severe in the calcium phosphate stone formers compared with the calcium oxalate stone formers. The exact mechanism for the increase in nephrocalcinosis associated with calcium phosphate nephrolithiasis in the absence of primary hyperparathyroidism, medullary sponge kidney, and distal RTA remains to be determined.
        </p>
        <p>
         Calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate crystals form when the concentration of the reactants exceeds the saturation limit. In a careful histologic study of intraoperative kidney biopsy specimens from idiopathic calcium oxalate stone formers, calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) deposits (Randall's plaques [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]) were primarily noted in the inner medullary (papillary) interstitium in the basement membranes of the thin limbs of the loop of Henle [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,13
         </a>
         ], where tubular fluid is saturated even under normal circumstances [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         These calcium phosphate plaques can enlarge into the surrounding interstitial tissue or rupture into the tubule lumen serving as a nidus for luminal calcium oxalate stone formation [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. In vitro studies have shown that calcium phosphate can promote calcium oxalate crystallization. Randall's plaques are also seen in patients with calcium phosphate stones [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In the intraoperative biopsy study cited above, the histologic findings were different in patients who had undergone intestinal bypass (bariatric) surgery for obesity and subsequently developed calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Crystal deposition was not present in the papillary interstitium as in idiopathic calcium oxalate stone formers. However, crystals were attached to the apical surface of collecting tubule cells or completely filled the tubular lumen, appearing to obstruct a number of inner medullary collecting ducts.
        </p>
        <p>
         A later series from the same group described the endoscopic findings in the renal papillae in 23 stone formers undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. All kidneys had papillary plaque, which was found in over 90 percent of papillae. Eleven patients had attached stones, which appeared to occur on Randall's plaques.
        </p>
        <p>
         Calcium oxalate stones may be pure calcium oxalate or an admixture that also contains calcium phosphate. In general, homogeneous calcium oxalate crystals within the kidney parenchyma form only in the setting of markedly high urine oxalate, such as that which occurs in primary hyperoxaluria or ethylene glycol toxicity. Heterogeneous crystals form in the setting of milder degrees of hyperoxaluria [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,10

         ]. (See

         Nephrocalcinosis is associated with conditions that cause hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and the increased excretion of calcium, phosphate, and/or oxalate in the urine. Hypocitraturia also may contribute, particularly in patients with distal (type 1) renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Citrate inhibits crystal formation by forming a soluble complex with calcium [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,16
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7375.html" rel="external">
          "Kidney stones in adults: Epidemiology and risk factors", section on 'Low urine citrate'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Underlying conditions that have been associated with nephrocalcinosis may be categorized into those that cause the following:

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         A variety of definitions for "normal" are used for each of these urinary parameters. However, the values for these definitions are arbitrary and additional data suggest a more linear relation for each of these factors. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7375.html" rel="external">
          "Kidney stones in adults: Epidemiology and risk factors", section on 'High urine calcium'

        </p>
        <p>
         Such categories are useful in determining the specific diseases that underlie newly diagnosed nephrocalcinosis in the individual patient.

         The definition of high urine calcium is arbitrary, and the urinary calcium level above which one is considered to be at risk for nephrocalcinosis is not clear, because the relationship between urine calcium and risk of nephrocalcinosis is likely continuous, similar to the relationship between urine calcium and the risk of kidney stone formation.

        <p>
         Hyperabsorption of dietary calcium occurs in up to 50 percent of cases of sarcoidosis. The excess calcium is excreted in the urine, leading to high urine calcium in approximately 40 percent and, in 2 to 20 percent of cases, hypercalcemia. (See

         Distal (type 1) RTA is the most common cause of nephrocalcinosis (particularly in children) due to high urine calcium without hypercalcemia [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,25
         </a>
         ]. Distal RTA may be acquired and develop as part of an autoimmune disease, such as Sjogren's disease or systemic lupus erythematosus, or secondary to certain medications. Distal RTA may also be inherited. Distal RTA results in a systemic acidosis that requires increased buffering of acid by bone, with the subsequent release of bone calcium and phosphate. Metabolic acidosis is also associated with hypocitraturia, which can promote calcium salt precipitation in the tubules. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7375.html" rel="external">

        </p>

         Nephrocalcinosis is common in neonates of low birth weight, with a reported incidence that can exceed 60 percent in infants with a birth weight below 1500 g. The most common cause is the prolonged administration of a loop diuretic (most often

Support for this hypothesis comes from the observation that chronic hypokalemia in Gitelman syndrome, which involves a mutation in the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter in the distal tubule, is associated with hypocalciuria and the absence of nephrocalcinosis [

         High urine phosphate in the absence of hyperphosphatemia (ie, phosphate wasting) usually results from inherited tubulopathies although acquired forms may be observed in the setting of malignancy or kidney transplantation. (See

         Inherited tubular defects that cause high urine phosphate but not high urine calcium include X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets and autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets.

         High urine oxalate may also be secondary to the increased enteric absorption of oxalate [

          38

         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. The mechanism by which fat malabsorption increases oxalate absorption is via the binding of calcium by free fatty acids. This decreases the amount of calcium that is available to bind to oxalate and form insoluble calcium oxalate and results in increased oxalate absorption since free oxalate is more easily absorbed compared with calcium-bound oxalate [

         Nephrocalcinosis is, in most cases, an asymptomatic, chronic, and slowly progressive disease that is discovered as an incidental finding during radiographic imaging of the abdomen or chest. Such imaging may be obtained as part of the evaluation of nephrolithiasis, which often coexists with nephrocalcinosis.

         However, occasional patients present with clinical symptoms or signs that are related to nephrocalcinosis or to the causative process (eg, hypercalcemia). These include the following:

         Depending upon the underlying disease, serum calcium and/or phosphate may be increased, and a 24-hour urine collection may show increased excretion of calcium, phosphate, and/or oxalate. However, 24-hour urine collections are not part of the routine work-up of patients with unexplained chronic kidney disease; they are usually obtained if there is a history of nephrolithiasis or after imaging has established the diagnosis of nephrocalcinosis in an attempt to identify treatable predisposing factors.

         Occasionally, there may be laboratory findings that point to specific causes. The presence of a nonanion gap metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia can be seen in patients with nephrocalcinosis due to a distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA). An elevated serum parathyroid hormone level in the context of preserved kidney function and serum calcium above the median of the reference range indicates possible primary hyperparathyroidism as a cause. (See

         Ultrasonography of the kidneys – On ultrasonography, nephrocalcinosis may appear as bright, hyperechoic areas within the kidney parenchyma.

         Computed tomography of the abdomen – On computed tomography (CT), nephrocalcinosis typically appears as calcium deposits within the kidney. Early detection may be facilitated by determining the Hounsfield units within the kidneys.

         Nephrocalcinosis should be considered in patients who present with chronic kidney disease, a benign urinalysis, and little or no proteinuria, particularly those who are hypercalcemic or have a history of one of the above causes of nephrocalcinosis. In addition, nephrocalcinosis may also be suspected in a patient with recurrent calcium kidney stones. (See

         The diagnosis of nephrocalcinosis can only be made by imaging or, much less often, kidney biopsy. Most cases are diagnosed as an incidental finding during radiographic imaging of the abdomen or chest performed for another indication or for the evaluation of nephrolithiasis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Macroscopic nephrocalcinosis may be detected by multiple imaging techniques, including abdominal plain film, ultrasound, and computed tomographic (CT) imaging [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28,47-50
         </a>
         ]. If nephrocalcinosis is suspected in a patient, kidney ultrasound and abdominal CT are generally the preferred imaging tests to confirm the diagnosis. However, in the absence of a reason to suspect nephrocalcinosis (eg, hypercalcemia or a history of nephrolithiasis), kidney ultrasound is usually the initial imaging test that is performed in patients who present with chronic kidney disease, a bland urinalysis, and little or no proteinuria. Calcification is poorly visualized by magnetic resonance imaging [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Limited data suggest that ultrasound and CT are more sensitive than abdominal plain film for the detection of nephrocalcinosis, particularly in patients without severe disease. One study, for example, evaluated 62 patients seen at a stone clinic in which an imaging test suggested either nephrocalcinosis or nephrolithiasis (pelvicalyceal calcifications) [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. All patients underwent abdominal plain film, ultrasound, and CT. Nephrocalcinosis was considered present if at least two radiologists made the diagnosis on ultrasound and/or CT. The sensitivity was 85 to 90 percent with ultrasound, 81 to 86 percent with CT scan, and 63 to 66 percent with abdominal plain film [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The highest sensitivity and specificity (92 and 89 percent) were attained when two of the radiologic tests suggested the presence of nephrocalcinosis since there is not always concordance between ultrasound and CT. However, this study had no independent gold standard for the diagnosis. Similar findings were noted in a series of 15 long-term

         Once the diagnosis of nephrocalcinosis has been confirmed, the subsequent evaluation is directed at determining the underlying cause. This evaluation is important since the underlying condition may require treatment for reasons independent of its effect on kidney function (such as primary hyperparathyroidism or sarcoidosis) and because the underlying condition generally determines the kidney prognosis. Whereas some causes of nephrocalcinosis, such as primary hyperoxaluria, commonly result in kidney failure, others, such as medullary sponge kidney, rarely cause progressive kidney disease. (See

         The kidney prognosis of nephrocalcinosis is determined by the underlying cause. While most patients with nephrocalcinosis do not progress to kidney failure, certain underlying causes, if not effectively treated, are more likely to be associated with chronic kidney disease. These include primary hyperoxaluria, hypomagnesemic hypercalciuric nephrocalcinosis, Dent disease, and distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54

          Overview
         </strong>
         – Nephrocalcinosis is characterized by the generalized deposition of either calcium phosphate or calcium oxalate in the kidney medulla or, much less often, the cortex. Patients who develop nephrocalcinosis may have acute or chronic kidney injury or may have normal kidney function. (See

          Risk factors and causes

         – Nephrocalcinosis is associated with conditions that cause hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and the increased excretion of calcium, phosphate, and/or oxalate in the urine. Underlying conditions that have been associated with nephrocalcinosis may be categorized into those that cause:

          Clinical features
         </strong>
         – In most cases, nephrocalcinosis is an asymptomatic, chronic, and slowly progressive disease. However, occasional patients present with clinical symptoms or signs related to nephrocalcinosis or to the causative process, including renal colic, hematuria, polyuria and polydipsia, or acute kidney injury. The urinalysis may be benign or reveal sterile pyuria or hematuria. Proteinuria is usually &lt;500 mg/day except among patients with Dent disease who often present with significant proteinuria. Depending upon the underlying disease, serum calcium and/or phosphate may be increased, and a 24-hour urine collection may show increased excretion of calcium, phosphate, and/or oxalate. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical features'

          When to suspect
         </strong>
         – Nephrocalcinosis should be considered in patients who present with chronic kidney disease, a benign urinalysis, and little or no proteinuria, particularly those who are hypercalcemic or have a history of one of the causes of nephrocalcinosis. In addition, nephrocalcinosis may also be suspected in a patient with recurrent calcium kidney stones. (See

         <strong>
          Confirming the diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis of nephrocalcinosis can only be made by imaging or, much less often, kidney biopsy. Most cases are diagnosed as an incidental finding during radiographic imaging of the abdomen or chest performed for another indication or for the evaluation of nephrolithiasis. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Subsequent evaluation
         </strong>
         – Once the diagnosis of nephrocalcinosis has been confirmed, the subsequent evaluation is directed at determining the underlying cause (

          algorithm 1

         ). This evaluation is important since the underlying condition may require treatment for reasons independent of its effect on kidney function (such as primary hyperparathyroidism or sarcoidosis) and because the underlying condition generally determines the kidney prognosis. (See

          Treatment

         – Therapy is directed at the underlying cause of the nephrocalcinosis. No specific treatment has been shown to prevent progression of nephrocalcinosis.

         For patients with nephrocalcinosis who have hypocitraturia and urine pH less than 7, we suggest the administration of

          potassium citrate
