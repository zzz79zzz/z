         Opioids may be required for treating either acute or chronic pain. When clinicians prescribe opioids, both the clinician and the patient should understand the associated risks of undesired long term use, misuse, and/or opioid use disorder. This topic will discuss the incidence of and risk factors for long term opioid use and misuse after prescription of opioids for pain. Management of acute and chronic pain and the appropriate use of opioids are discussed separately.

          Long term opioid use
         </strong>
         – There is no accepted definition of new long term opioid use, and definitions used in the literature vary widely [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. Consequently, the reported incidence of long term opioid use after an initial opioid prescription varies widely as well. The lack of a standardized definition causes difficulty interpreting study results and lack of clarity on patient risks and risk factors. Definitions used in the literature vary from very liberal (eg, filling one opioid prescription within a specific time period after initial prescription), to more restrictive or stringent (eg, continuous or repeated opioid use over a specific time period after an initial prescription). Database studies commonly define persistent use as the number of opioid prescriptions at or during a specified period of time, which may not reflect actual consumption. The reasons for an opioid prescription refill (eg, pain or a nonprescribed reason, storage for later use, or diversion) are typically unknown.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         A commonly used definition for long term opioid use is greater than three months of uninterrupted and frequent use of opioids [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ], focused on the time period from 90 days to 1 year after the initial prescription [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Examples of studies of the variability of definitions include the following:

         In a population based database study of approximately 163,000 opioid naïve surgical patients in Canada, 66 percent of whom filled an opioid prescription in the week after surgery, 29 different definitions found in the literature were applied to estimate long term opioid use [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Estimates of persistent opioid use varied by over 100 fold (range 0.01 percent to 14.7 percent), depending on the definition used. Levels of agreement among definitions were greater among more stringent definitions of long term opioid use.
        </p>

         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         Another systematic review of studies of long term use after opioid prescription (34 studies) found 41 unique definitions for long term opioid use; 36 percent of studies required a cumulative duration of opioid use of three months [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         ].

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The definitions described above typically apply to patients who are opioid naïve at the time of initial prescription. In one population based study of surgical patients, persistent use in patients who were taking opioids preoperatively was defined as any increase in their average daily opioid prescribed in the 90 days prior to surgery, measured from 90 to 365 days postoperatively [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Similar to other database studies, the reasons for increased postoperative opioid prescriptions were unknown.

         Opioid misuse is defined as any use outside of the manner and intent for which it was prescribed. This includes overuse, use to get high, diversion (sharing or selling to others), having multiple prescribers or nonprescribed sources of the opioid. (See

          Opioid use disorder
         </strong>
         – Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a psychiatric disorder, with specific diagnostic criteria  (

         It is accepted that long term use of opioids should be avoided when possible for most patients. Though the majority of patients who receive an opioid prescription for acute pain do not go on to use opioids long term, the consequences for those who do can be significant, and even lethal. Long term opioid use results in opioid tolerance (requiring increasing doses for similar effect), dependence, sleep disturbances, endocrine abnormalities [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ], constipation, immunosuppression, hyperalgesia, neuropsychological deficits, and mood changes including depression [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. Long term use also predisposes to opioid misuse (including use of illicit opioids [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]) and opioid use disorder, which can lead to overdose and opioid-related death [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. These issues are discussed separately.

         Opioid dependence is a predictable response to chronic opioid use, but can also occur after acute exposure to opioids. A degree of opioid dependence occurs in some patients after even a single dose [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Minor opioid withdrawal symptoms can occur when opioids are discontinued after only several days of use; severity of withdrawal symptoms increases with higher doses and longer duration of opioid therapy [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Patients receiving long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain may report worsening pain as a result of opioid withdrawal. Thus, avoidance of withdrawal symptoms could be one reason for continued opioid use beyond the duration needed for pain.

         Data regarding new long term opioid use after an initial prescription come mostly from retrospective database studies, and are therefore subject to possible confounding and deficiencies in data collection. Reported rates vary depending on outcome definitions and the studied patient population, including the geographic location (eg, United States versus other countries). Globally, opioid analgesic consumption has decreased in North America but remains much higher in Canada and the United States compared to other countries worldwide. This geographic disparity should be considered when considering the rates of long-term opioid use after prescribing for acute pain indications [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. A number of studies have found that persistent opioid use occurs in approximately 6 percent of patients who receive an opioid, though results range from 0.37 percent to over 15 percent [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,14-22
         </a>
         ], and as high as 27 percent in high risk patients [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. The rate of long term use varies with patient risk factors and the characteristics of the initial opioid prescription, as discussed below. (See

         Many studies of long term opioid use have involved surgical patients, as surgery is among the most common indications for initiating opioids [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24,25
         </a>
         ]. Risk of persistent opioid use may be higher after some types of surgery. (See

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Large database studies of surgical patients have reported widely varying rates of long term opioid use (0.4 to 6.5 percent), depending on the patient population, the type of surgery performed, and the way in which long term use was defined. Small single center studies have reported rates of 10 to 14 percent for opioid use at 90 days after surgery [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26,27

         In a United States insurance database study including over 36,000 surgical patients ages 18 to 64 who filled an initial opioid prescription around the time of surgery, the rate of persistent opioid use was 5.9 percent in patients who underwent minor surgery, versus 6.5 percent of patients who underwent major surgery [

The definition of chronic opioid use was the same in nonsurgical patients, for whom a randomly assigned fictitious surgery date was used. While the authors used statistical adjustment (multivariable models) to adjust for potential confounders, it is possible that unobserved differences existed between the surgical and non-surgical cohorts, limiting accuracy of results.

         The risks of opioid misuse and opioid-related adverse events relate to both the initial prescription and the effects of long term opioid use. In addition, prescription of opioids carries the risk of diversion, which raises the possibility of misuse and overdose in individuals other than the prescription recipient. (See

         The risk of misuse, opioid use disorder, and overdose after an initial prescription for acute pain is likely low for patients without risk factors. Much of the existing literature consists of retrospective or database studies, and may or may not include prescreening and exclusion for patients with risk factors for substance misuse. Examples of studies on this issue include the following:

         Many guidelines and most states require that clinicians check the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program database prior to prescribing an opioid, to detect undisclosed prescriptions for controlled substances. (See

         Urine drug screening is not typically used prior to opioid prescription for acute pain, but is routine (and in some states mandated) prior to prescription for chronic pain. (See

         The majority of patients who are prescribed opioids for acute pain do not go on to chronic opioid use or opioid misuse. However, the consequences of long term opioid use, misuse and abuse are significant and potentially lethal. Opioids should be prescribed only when necessary, as an adjunct to other multimodal analgesic therapies (eg, nonopioid analgesics, regional anesthesia techniques as appropriate, nonpharmacologic therapies), and at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/108806.html" rel="external">

         Clinicians should screen patients for risk factors for long term opioid use. They should discuss with patients the risks of physiologic dependence, misuse, addiction, and overdose, side effects of opioids, the importance of additional or alternative treatments to reduce the required dose, and should also discuss the availability of

         Long term opioid use results in dependence, tolerance, and opioid side effects (eg, sleep disturbances, endocrine abnormalities, constipation, immunosuppression, hyperalgesia, neuropsychological deficits, and mood changes including depression). Long term opioid use also predisposes patients to opioid misuse and opioid use disorder. (See

         Definitions of long term opioid use varies widely; a commonly used definition is greater than three months of uninterrupted and frequent use of opioids in the period from 90 days to 1 year after initial prescription.

         A number of retrospective studies have found persistent opioid use in approximately 6 percent of patients who receive a prescription, though the reported range is from 0.37 to over 15 percent, and as high as 27 percent in high risk patients. These widely reported rates of persistent use vary with the study definition of persistent use. (See
