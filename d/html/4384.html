Specific bronchoscopic management modalities are discussed in detail separately.

It is not discussed in this topic, although some conditions that involve this region of the airway may also involve the proximal trachea (eg, laryngeal, esophageal, or nasopharyngeal cancer), such that CAO and UAO can coexist.

Although squamous cell lung cancer more commonly affects the major airways than adenocarcinoma, both forms of NSCLC can present with CAO [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. Airway obstruction occurs via direct compression by or extension from a parenchymal tumor into the airway lumen, or via direct or metastatic involvement of the airway by tumor. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4641.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of lung cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Primary tumors of the airway, other than lung cancer (eg, adenoid cystic carcinoma, carcinoid) and metastatic disease from distant tumors (eg, breast, colorectal, renal, thyroid) are less common causes of malignant CAO. Similarly, direct invasion or extrinsic compression from anatomically adjacent tumors including, laryngeal, nasopharyngeal, or esophageal tumors can occur, as can extrinsic obstruction from mediastinal tumors or adenopathy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nonmalignant — Common conditions associated with nonmalignant CAO are tracheal strictures due to endotracheal or tracheostomy tubes, foreign body aspiration, and tracheobronchomalacia. These and other nonmalignant etiologies are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/131093.html" rel="external">"Presentation and diagnostic evaluation of non-life-threatening and nonmalignant subglottic and tracheal stenosis in adults", section on 'Evaluating the etiology'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H711680126"><span class="h2">Pathogenesis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The mechanisms that underlie CAO vary with the etiology and include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intraluminal compromise due to intrinsic or extrinsic compression from benign or malignant tumors</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Endobronchial granulation tissue or calcium deposition from trauma, inflammation, or infection</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Airway wall thinning or collapse from cartilage disorders or tracheobronchomalacia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Airway wall edema from inflammation, infection, and bleeding</p><p></p><p>These pathogenetic processes can result in fixed or variable obstruction. As an example, CAO from most tumors is due to a mechanical obstruction to the flow of air (ie, fixed obstruction during inspiration and expiration). In contrast, tracheobronchomalacia results in dynamic airflow obstruction (usually obstruction during expiration)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76811" href="/d/graphic/76811.html" rel="external">figure 4B</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65386" href="/d/graphic/65386.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). These types of obstruction manifest differently on the flow volume loop recorded during pulmonary function testing, the details of which are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1465.html" rel="external">"Flow-volume loops", section on 'Abnormal inspiratory loop'</a>.)</p><p>Some cases of CAO are multifactorial. As an example, patients with CAO following lung transplant can have both strictures (from anastomotic ischemia, infection, necrosis, excess granulation tissue formation) and tracheobronchomalacia. As another example, patients with long-term artificial airways are at increased risk for subglottic or tracheal stenosis as well as tracheobronchomalacia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4406.html" rel="external">"Tracheomalacia in adults: Clinical features and diagnostic evaluation", section on 'Classification'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4656.html" rel="external">"Noninfectious complications following lung transplantation", section on 'Airway anastomotic complications'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1644.html" rel="external">"Complications of the endotracheal tube following initial placement: Prevention and management in adult intensive care unit patients", section on 'Laryngotracheal stenosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/131521.html" rel="external">"Tracheostomy: Postoperative care, maintenance, and complications in adults", section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H711679925"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Central airway obstruction (CAO) should be suspected in patients who are at risk of developing airflow obstruction (eg, lung cancer, prolonged endotracheal or tracheostomy tube placement). Presenting symptoms are nonspecific and can be subacute/chronic or acute. The clinical manifestations typically depend upon the degree of luminal obstruction, as well as the location and length of time that obstruction has been present. Common features include dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and wheeze. In contrast, the demonstration of acute inspiratory stridor and respiratory distress in an at-risk patient are worrisome signs of CAO that should prompt immediate diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic intervention. Whereas exertional dyspnea typically indicates a tracheal lumen &lt;8 mm, stridor develops when the tracheal lumen is &lt;5 mm and hence should be considered a life-threatening presentation. Patients who present subacutely are often incorrectly diagnosed as having asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or pneumonia, which contributes to delayed recognition and therapy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H793418729"><span class="h2">History and examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with CAO usually present over weeks to months (subacute/chronic) but may, in some cases, present acutely (within minutes to hours).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H793418473"><span class="h3">Sub-acute or chronic</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with minor obstruction are often asymptomatic since airflow limitation is mild.</p><p>Symptoms and signs develop when airflow impairment reaches a critical ventilatory threshold (ie, with exertion or increased ventilatory demands due to a postobstructive pneumonia). Common features include dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and wheeze. Dysphonia, dysphagia, odynophagia, tenderness of the throat, pain on coughing or speaking, and difficulty clearing secretions are less common but should raise the suspicion for tracheal stenosis. However, none of these symptoms are diagnostic of CAO since they can be due to the underlying disorder, even if CAO is absent.</p><p>Patients may also present with additional signs and symptoms of the underlying disorder. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with cancer may also present with constitutional symptoms (eg, weight loss), hoarseness or hemoptysis (laryngeal or lung cancer), dysphagia (esophageal cancer), and chest pain.

Clues that may suggest that these nonspecific symptoms are due to CAO include dyspnea that is constant and unresponsive to bronchodilators, or unilateral monophonic wheeze (if the lesion is distal to the carina), and symptoms and/or radiographic infiltrates that do not resolve within four to six weeks following a course of antibiotics. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1455.html" rel="external">"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Diagnosis and staging", section on 'Clinical Presentation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/521.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis and management of asthma in older adults", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6992.html" rel="external">"Nonresolving pneumonia"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H711679912"><span class="h3">Acute</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many patients with acute airway compromise have acute onset tachypnea, tachycardia, inspiratory stridor, or wheeze (eg, patients with acute foreign body aspiration). In patients with a mild degree of CAO, rapid deterioration may occur if swelling, bleeding, or secretions increase the degree of luminal impingement (eg, during a respiratory tract infection, trauma). Importantly, these findings together with impairment of oxygenation and/or ventilation indicate a severely compromised airway and should prompt immediate evaluation and implementation of life-saving therapies.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H793418750"><span class="h2">Imaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A number of imaging modalities are typically performed to facilitate the diagnosis of CAO and in some cases, estimate its magnitude (eg, tracheobronchomalacia). However, in general, none are sensitive or specific for the diagnosis of CAO or its underlying cause. Importantly, if life-threatening obstruction is suspected, stabilization of the airway with intubation followed by direct inspection (typically with bronchoscopy) should not be delayed to obtain imaging. Once the airway is stable, we typically perform the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chest radiography</strong> – Although rarely diagnostic, chest radiographs are typically performed since they may provide clues to the underlying etiology or show evidence of CAO-related complications. As an example, a radiograph may reveal tracheal deviation or mediastinal shift from a lung or esophageal mass, with the signs of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ie, a risk factor for tracheobronchomalacia), a tracheobronchial filling defect, or the signs of an obstructing intraluminal lesion (eg, postobstructive pneumonia, atelectasis, or lobar/total lung collapse).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chest computed tomography (CT) Chest</strong> – When CAO is suspected, a conventional transaxial CT of the chest should be performed. CT may show similar findings to those seen on chest radiography but with better resolution for parenchymal lesions as well as for intraluminal defects in the trachea and bronchi and assessment of abnormalities in the mediastinum and hilum [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Newer imaging protocols that include multiplanar and three-dimensional reconstructions (eg, "virtual bronchoscopy") may assist in both the initial assessment of the lesion and in objective grading of therapeutic success and follow-up  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64358" href="/d/graphic/64358.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). CT may also identify foreign bodies that are metallic or bony in nature or dynamic CT may reveal &gt;50 percent reduction in cross-sectional area on expiration suggestive of tracheobronchomalacia ("Golden S sign")  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef104100" href="/d/graphic/104100.html" rel="external">image 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6984.html" rel="external">"Radiology of the trachea"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is rarely useful unless vascular or soft tissue pathology is suspected (eg, vascular rings, vascular aneurysms, soft tissue sarcoma or neuroma of the thoracic outlet). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5757.html" rel="external">"Vascular rings and slings"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14259.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma", section on 'Imaging of the primary tumor'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H793418929"><span class="h2">Pulmonary function tests</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) should be performed in patients with suspected CAO who have subacute symptoms. Provided the patient does not have underlying lung disease, spirometry and lung volumes and diffusion may be relatively spared or mildly reduced but the flow volume loop (FVL) can be helpful.</p><p>Flow volume loops (FVLs) can show the characteristic signs of airway obstruction, even before a reduction in the spirometric volumes are noted  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73686 graphicRef76811 graphicRef76796 graphicRef80922 graphicRef74178" href="/d/graphic/73686.html" rel="external">figure 4A-E</a>). It should be noted, however, that there can be a significant loss in airway cross-sectional area before the textbook flattening of the inspiratory or expiratory loops are visualized. The FVL is insensitive as a diagnostic tool, but when abnormal can help distinguish between fixed obstruction, variable intrathoracic obstruction, and variable extrathoracic obstruction  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76811" href="/d/graphic/76811.html" rel="external">figure 4B</a>). However, individual etiologies cannot be determined. The FVL may also assist in assessing the degree of narrowing  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73686" href="/d/graphic/73686.html" rel="external">figure 4A</a>). For example, the FVL can provide clues as to the severity based on the degree of loop flattening. Some studies also suggest that the ratio of the area under the expiratory and inspiratory curve also correlate with the severity of laryngotracheal obstruction [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>PFTs may also show a disproportionate reduction in the peak expiratory flow (PEF) rate or maximum minute volume (MVV) compared with the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>). Reductions in basic peak expiratory flow rate measurement may also correlate with luminal dimension [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>PFTS may also be helpful in the detection of underlying lung disorders and in the preoperative or preprocedural evaluation of lung cancer should surgery or bronchoscopic ablative procedures be an option once a diagnosis is made. Determining the severity of underlying lung dysfunction may also assist in assessing prognosis if therapeutic options are limited.</p><p>Interpretation of FVLs and pulmonary function tests is discussed separately.

However, pneumonia may be due to underlying obstruction including tracheobronchomalacia such that follow up chest radiography six weeks after a course of appropriate antibiotics is appropriate to ensure resolution.

Support typically includes initial bag valve mask ventilation followed by endotracheal intubation. For those in whom intubation is not feasible or is unsuccessful, options include an emergency cricothyrotomy or tracheostomy, or rigid bronchoscopic intubation. Choosing among these options is dependent upon the degree and location of obstruction and available airway expertise.</p><p>Airway management of patients with CAO should be performed by skilled personnel with expertise in intubating difficult airways. If no dedicated airway team is available, patient transfer to a specialized center should be considered <strong>after</strong> the patient’s airway has been secured and their condition has been stabilized.

The advantages and disadvantages of each modality are listed in the tables  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64246" href="/d/graphic/64246.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef72854" href="/d/graphic/72854.html" rel="external">table 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef103917" href="/d/graphic/103917.html" rel="external">table 4</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1229386947"><span class="h4">Laser therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Laser therapy is a commonly used thermally-ablative non-contact technique. It is an immediate-acting therapy with excellent debulking capacity, best suited to treating patients with intraluminal tumors causing CAO, as well as those associated with bleeding.

It is an immediate-acting therapy that requires frequent cleaning of debris on the probe. Although it has a risk of airway fire, the risk of airway perforation is lower when compared with laser. It is not suitable for extraluminal lesions and its effects are short-lived such that it is usually combined with other therapies.

It is usually administered through a flexible bronchoscope. Because it lacks the depth of penetration of laser it is not as good at debulking intraluminal tumors but is associated with a reduced risk of airway penetration. Due to the superficial spread of heat associated with this procedure, it is better suited to treating superficial vascular lesions that bleed easily, flat polypoid lesions (eg, papillomas)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68710" href="/d/graphic/68710.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>), or lesions at and around bifurcations in airways, especially those in the upper lobe bronchi and apical segments of the lower lobes.

It may also be administered to patients who have already received maximal doses of EBRT. Its major advantage compared with immediate-acting locally ablative techniques (laser, cautery, APC) is that it is longer lasting and can be used for debulking intraluminal as well as extraluminal tumors. It is not used when immediate relief from life-threatening obstruction is required but may be combined with locally ablative techniques, especially when tumor external to the airway wall needs to be treated. The indications, complications, and efficacy of EBBT in treating central airway obstruction, are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4408.html" rel="external">"Endobronchial brachytherapy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1229386986"><span class="h4">Photodynamic therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Photodynamic therapy is a non-thermal modality that may be used for airways that are completely (or partially) obstructed due intraluminal tumors. It cannot be used for tumors causing extrinsic compression. It has a predictable penetration depth (typically 5 to 10 mm), thus, it can be useful for patients that are unresponsive or unsuitable for laser therapy. Because light therapy is administered bronchoscopically after the intravenous injection of a photosensitizing agent (typically 72 hours), it is not used when immediate relief from life-threatening obstruction is needed. It is usually administered via a flexible bronchoscope and often combined with other local bronchoscopic therapies. Its major disadvantage over the other local ablative therapies is that follow-up bronchoscopy is necessary to remove debris and secretions and that patients’ skin is photosensitized for at least six weeks after the procedure, and that it is significantly more expensive. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4382.html" rel="external">"Endobronchial photodynamic therapy in the management of airway disease in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1229387004"><span class="h4">Cryotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cryotherapy is typically performed through the flexible bronchoscope. Among the locally ablative techniques, its main advantage is that the risk of airway perforation is low since cartilaginous structures are cryoresistant due to their poor vascularity, and that it can be performed safely in complete mainstem obstruction. Likewise, it can be utilized in high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) environments. However, its effects on airway patency are not immediate, the hemostatic effect is also delayed which increases the risk for hemoptysis, and repeat bronchoscopy is needed for repeated freeze/thaw cycles and for clearance of debris and secretions [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>]. It cannot be used for treating extrinsic lesions and is frequently combined with other therapies. The indications, complications, and efficacy of cryosurgery are discussed in detail separately.

Although dilation is immediately effective, the results for cancerous stenosis are usually not sustained, especially for lesions causing external airway compression. In addition, mucosal disruption from dilation may in fact produce granulation tissue and accelerate recurrent stenosis, such that other techniques including laser, radiation, and/or stenting are often simultaneously used to maintain a patent airway [<a href="#rid29">29,30</a>].</p><p>The airway may be dilated with rigid or flexible bronchoscopy. During rigid bronchoscopy, the endoscope is advanced through the stenotic airway opening and the barrel is then pushed through the obstruction in a rotating motion ("coring")  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105318" href="/d/graphic/105318.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>). This procedure may be preferred when obstruction is severe since patients can be simultaneously intubated and treated with the rigid bronchoscope and bleeding is usually minimal  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53603 graphicRef68017" href="/d/graphic/53603.html" rel="external">picture 2A-B</a>). It is important, however, to know what lies distal to the obstruction in order to not injure the airway with the rigid bronchoscope. In less severe cases, sequential balloon dilation (flexible bronchoscopy) or sequential rigid dilators (rigid bronchoscopy) may be used (ie, dilators of increasing diameter are used in succession during the same session)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70533" href="/d/graphic/70533.html" rel="external">picture 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104099" href="/d/graphic/104099.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>) [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. The major advantage of sequential rigid versus balloon dilation is that there is generally is less mucosal trauma.

Microdebriders have also been used during rigid bronchoscopy to achieve the same effect; a hollow metal tube with a rapidly rotating blade (1000 to 3000 rpm) that is coupled to suction allows obstructing tissue to be dissected while simultaneously evacuating debris and blood [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Debridement is not commonly used for mild CAO that is non-life-threatening since alternative ablative therapies performed via flexible bronchoscopy are more readily available.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1229386303"><span class="h3">Airway stent</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Stenting is often performed following locally ablative or dilation therapies to prevent reocclusion after patency has been restored. Silicone stents require introduction with a rigid bronchoscope and are in general preferred in patients with cancer. Although covered self-expanding metal stents, which are positioned using flexible bronchoscopy, are associated with complications (eg, reepithelization, fracture, retained fragments during removal), they may be used as a life-saving therapy in a fragile patient with limited life-expectancy who might not otherwise tolerate surgery; however, tumor growth through an uncovered portion of the metal stent at the proximal or distal ends is a risk. Uncovered metal stents should not be used for this reason. Airway stents can be utilized for both intrinsic and extrinsic lesions and require an assurance that the distal airway is patent. Notably, tumors or granulation tissue frequently grow in to the stent such that restenosis is common. Another disadvantage of stents is that follow-up with multiple bronchoscopies is required for the detection of complications which are common. Further details regarding airway stents are provided separately.

However, for bronchial lesions, it usually involves a lobectomy, pneumonectomy, or a sleeve resection (eg, T2aN0M0; stage IB). Tracheal resection for isolated tracheal lesions is not commonly performed; most lesions are assessed as T4 (ie, stage IIIA)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805" href="/d/graphic/109805.html" rel="external">table 5</a>), such that only select patients undergo surgery when surgical cure is deemed feasible (eg, small lesions [2 to 3 cm] without nodal metastases [T4 N0M0]) and the surgery is technically difficult requiring expertise in airway surgery. The operative morbidity and mortality may be unacceptable in patients with limited cardiopulmonary reserve, such that patient selection is critical for success.

In addition, some patients may require repeat bronchoscopy for an alternate indication (eg, for stent surveillance or removal, secretion clearance, complication of therapy) which allows the clinician the opportunity to visually assess the response to therapy.

It has a wide range of etiologies, among which airway malignancy (usually non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC]), is the most common. Other causes are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef55320" href="/d/graphic/55320.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a class="local">'Etiology and pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical features</strong> – CAO should be suspected in patients who are at risk of developing airflow obstruction  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef55320" href="/d/graphic/55320.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Common clinical manifestations include dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and wheeze, none of which are sensitive or specific for the diagnosis of CAO. In contrast, acute inspiratory stridor and respiratory distress in an at-risk patient are worrisome signs of CAO that should prompt immediate diagnostic evaluation (usually with bronchoscopy) and therapeutic intervention. (See <a class="local">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic evaluation and initial management</strong> – When CAO is suspected, we prefer that patients be managed using a multidisciplinary approach in a center with expertise in airway management.

Once the airway is secured, a bronchoscopic evaluation of the trachea and bronchi should be performed promptly to diagnose and, in some cases, also treat the underlying disorder. Importantly, these life-saving maneuvers should not be delayed to obtain imaging.

Locally ablative bronchoscopic modalities are typically adjunctive, palliative, life-saving, or bridging therapies that are targeted at achieving patency, decreasing dyspnea and hemoptysis, improving quality of life, and/or reducing time to extubation.
