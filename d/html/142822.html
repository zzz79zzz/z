         Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO; also called stomatocytic elliptocytosis) is an autosomal dominant hereditary hemolytic anemia caused by a specific deletion in the gene for band 3 and characterized by mild hemolytic anemia that typically resolves in childhood. Band 3 encodes an integral membrane protein of red blood cells (RBCs) that also functions as an ion channel; the deletion interferes with channel function, causing RBCs to become dehydrated, stiff, and oval shaped.
        </p>

         This topic discusses the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of SAO.

         The
         <em>
          SLC4A1
         </em>
         gene encodes band 3 (also known as anion exchanger 1 [AE1], band 3 anion transport protein, and solute carrier family 4 member 1), an integral membrane protein that functions as a chloride-bicarbonate exchanger and provides structural cohesion between the red blood cell (RBC) membrane and the underlying spectrin-based cytoskeleton. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7091.html" rel="external">
          "Red blood cell membrane: Structure and dynamics", section on 'Band 3'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The connection between SAO and an abnormality of band 3 was discovered in 1990 [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. It was subsequently determined that individuals with SAO are heterozygous for a specific 27 base pair deletion in the
         <em>
          SLC4A1
         </em>
         gene, referred to as deletion 400-408 (Δ400-408). Homozygosity for the deletion was initially thought to be incompatible with life; however, some individuals with homozygosity for the deletion have been identified [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         This deletion removes nine amino acids corresponding to codons 400 to 408 of the band 3 protein that span the region between the cytoplasmic and membrane domain. Removal of these nine amino acids causes abnormal folding of band 3 at the junction of the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain with the transmembrane domain and inactivates its anion exchanger function [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. It also leads to a tighter attachment between band 3 and ankyrin, with reduced lateral mobility that likely underlies the marked rigidity (stiffness) of SAO RBCs [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. (See

          Oval shape

         – The distinct oval shape  (

         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Many SAO cells have one or two mouth-shaped regions, leading to descriptions of stomatocytosis. (See

         <strong>
          Alteration of intracellular cation content
         </strong>
         – The SAO deletion affects band 3 at the interface between the cytoplasmic N-terminal domain and the transport-active transmembrane domain [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. This genetic alteration completely negates the anion exchange function of band 3 and results in significant structural alterations. Surprisingly, the mutant protein is successfully expressed at the plasma membrane but is misfolded and cannot transport anions [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The precise mechanism of RBC dehydration remains unclear. RBCs from patients with SAO were shown to have abnormal intracellular sodium and potassium content that became more markedly abnormal after storage of blood at 0°C. Increased cation "leak" fluxes at 37°C and increased sodium-potassium (Na=K ATPase) pump activity have also been also reported. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7068.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Rigidity
         </strong>
         – In vitro studies have revealed that the abnormal SAO band 3 protein can interact with and modify the normal band 3 protein expressed in the same cell [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,8
         </a>
         ]. In normal RBCs, band 3 typically exists as dimers and tetramers within the RBC membrane. In contrast, SAO band 3 is thought to form higher-order oligomers that associate with the underlying RBC cytoskeleton more readily than the wild-type band 3. This phenomenon may account for the observed increase in membrane rigidity in these cells.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Cellular dehydration and membrane rigidity can cause hemolysis and hemolytic anemia; approximately one-half of neonates with SAO have transient neonatal hemolysis [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. These findings are usually absent after three years of age. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Typical presentation'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Intriguingly, the SAO band 3 deletion leads to a cytokinesis malfunction that results in dyserythropoiesis [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. The more plausible rationale for dyserythropoiesis is that the substantial production of misfolded band 3 proteins overburdens the RBC's internal trafficking system, alters membrane protein composition, allows oxidative damage to accumulate, and impairs reticulocyte maturation. It is possible that adults with SAO could experience hemolysis when presenting with other conditions that stress the bone marrow and RBC production.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is not known why hemolysis resolves and morphologic abnormalities persist.

         Individuals with SAO may have a distal renal tubular acidosis (distal RTA). It appears that these individuals are compound heterozygous for the SAO deletion and another variant in the
         <em>
          SLC4A1
         </em>
         gene; in a series of 32 patients with SAO from 27 families, the most common variant on the other allele was a G701D, deletion 850 (Δ850), or A858D [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21

         ]. Several of the individuals were teenagers, suggesting that the RTA does not resolve with age as the hemolysis does.
        </p>
        <p>
         When these 32 patients were initially assessed, the most striking characteristic was their inability to thrive, typically resulting in body weights falling below the third percentile [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. Rickets afflicted 74 percent of these individuals, frequently causing significant skeletal distortions. Medullary nephrocalcinosis was identified in 80 percent of the cases where it was investigated, although it may have been underreported due to challenges in detection. Patients had typical blood and urine chemistries associated with distal RTA, with hyperchloremic acidosis (bicarbonate, 12 mEq/L [reference range, 23 to 28 mEq/L]; chloride 115 mmol/L [reference range, 98 to 106 mmol/L]) and increased urinary pH (&gt;5.5, often &gt;6.5, despite systemic acidosis). Most were hypokalemic (average serum potassium, 2.8 mmol/L).

         SAO is an autosomal dominant trait. First-degree relatives (parents, full siblings, and children) have a 50 percent chance of carrying the SAO-specific

          SLC4A1

         <strong>
         </strong>
         Ektacytometry is an in vitro test in which a laser diffractometer is used to measure deformability of a population of RBCs exposed to an osmotic gradient, creating a graph with specific parameters that can be compared with a reference population of RBCs [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. Deformability is based on light scatter when the cells change from a discoid to an elliptical shape as they are subjected to a shear force.

         The graph shows a tracing with osmolality on the X-axis (from 0 to 500 milliosms) and RBC deformability on the Y-axis. As osmolality decreases, the RBCs gain intracellular water and eventually lyse; as it increases, the RBCs lose intracellular water, becoming dehydrated and less flexible. The tracing on the graph yields the following parameters:

          Genetic basis
         </strong>
         – Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) is an autosomal dominant hemolytic anemia caused by a specific 27 base pair deletion in the
         <em>
          SLC4A1
         </em>
         gene, which encodes band 3 of the red blood cell (RBC) cytoskeleton. Affected individuals are heterozygous for the deletion. This causes their RBCs to become rigid, dehydrated, and oval in shape. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pathophysiology'

          Epidemiology
         </strong>
         – SAO is rare overall but very common in regions of Papua New Guinea, with prevalence up to 30 percent of individuals. Other regions with higher prevalence are listed above. The high prevalence in these regions is likely due to significant protection against several malaria species and against cerebral malaria, with relatively minimal clinical complications. (See

          Presentation and clinical course
         </strong>
         – Neonates with SAO can have hemolysis or hemolytic anemia. Typically, this resolves by three years of age. Ovalocytic or stomatocytic RBCs persist on the blood smear throughout life and may lead to an incidental diagnosis in older children and adults. Some individuals have a distal renal tubular acidosis (distal RTA) that causes failure to thrive and persists through adulthood. (See

          Differential
         </strong>
         – The differential diagnosis of SAO includes other hereditary hemolytic anemias and other causes of oval-shaped RBCs, such as hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, and hereditary stomatocytosis. These other disorders can cause hemolysis, but hemolysis can persist throughout life; the pattern on ektacytometry is different; and genetic testing shows different genetic variants. (See

          Management
         </strong>
         – Individuals with SAO may require no interventions, although neonates and infants with hemolysis or hemolytic anemia may require intensive monitoring and interventions including the following (see

         Neonates may require treatment for hyperbilirubinemia and hemolytic anemia. Splenectomy is not used, as hemolysis resolves by three years of age and is absent in older children and adults. (See

         If a parent carries the SAO variant, their children have a 50 percent chance of inheriting the variant. The health care team involved in the delivery and care of the newborn should be aware of the diagnosis well before the due date, and birth in a hospital setting is advised, preferably one with a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or access to a high-risk pediatric team. A pediatrician should evaluate the newborn as soon as possible after birth. (See
