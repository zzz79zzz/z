The frequency of serious complications depends on the valve type, position, and other clinical risk factors. Complications include embolic events, valve obstruction (due to thrombosis or pannus), bleeding complications of antithrombotic therapy, infective endocarditis, paravalvular and transvalvular regurgitation, hemolytic anemia, and patient-prosthesis mismatch.</p><p>This topic will review the approach to antithrombotic therapy for patients with mechanical heart valves [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].

Thrombotic risk is higher with mechanical valves than with bioprosthetic valves [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Thromboembolic and anticoagulation-related problems are the most frequent complications of mechanical valves.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3544469020"><span class="h2">Thromboembolism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The term thromboembolism generally refers to clinical embolic events ascribed to thrombus. Thromboembolic risk varies with time after mechanical valve implantation (highest early on), valve position (higher for mitral than aortic valves), and valve type (highest for older generation valves, particularly ball-in-cage).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3407395058"><span class="h3">Early risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Following mechanical valve replacement, the risk of thromboembolism is highest during the first three to six months (particularly the first 30 days), even with therapeutic-dose anticoagulation. While the relative risk of thromboembolism is high during the first three to six months after valve replacement, the period of highest risk is relatively short, which limits the absolute risk of thromboembolism in the early postoperative period. In an observational study, risk factors for early thromboembolism included temporary cessation of anticoagulation for pacemaker implantation and diabetes mellitus [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mitral valve</strong> – The risk of thromboembolism during the first 30 days after mechanical mitral valve implantation is high, even with therapeutic anticoagulation, as illustrated by the following studies:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a prospective series of 149 patients who underwent mitral (or mitral plus aortic) mechanical valve replacement between December 2005 and May 2007 and were anticoagulated with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA; such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a>) with early bridging with intravenous (IV) <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8518" href="/d/drug information/8518.html" rel="external">unfractionated heparin</a> (UFH), thromboembolic events during the first 30 days occurred in 22 patients (14.8 percent) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Early heparin bridging'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In an earlier series of 112 patients who underwent mechanical mitral valve replacement between 1981 and 2004 and were anticoagulated with a VKA (with mean international normalized ratio [INR] of 3), the rate of thromboembolic events was 6 percent during the first 30 days [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. However, one-third of the patients had mitral ball-in-cage prostheses, which are associated with high rates of thromboembolism.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Aortic valve</strong> – The early risk of thromboembolism following mechanical aortic valve implantation is lower than that following mechanical mitral valve implantation. In a series of 151 patients who underwent mechanical aortic replacement between December 2005 and May 2007 and received VKA with early IV UFH bridging, thromboembolic events occurred in 1.3 percent within 30 days after valve replacement [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2938466444"><span class="h3">Long-term risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>With anticoagulation, the long-term risk of symptomatic systemic thromboembolic complications in patients with mechanical valves is similar to that with bioprosthetic valves, which generally do not require long-term anticoagulation [<a href="#rid5">5-9</a>]. Some series have reported a higher risk of thromboembolism with mechanical valves than with bioprosthetic valves, even when the individuals with mechanical valves were receiving anticoagulation [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Efficacy and safety'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mitral valve</strong> – Patients with mechanical mitral valve prostheses have nearly twice the long-term thromboembolic risk of those with mechanical aortic valve prostheses (eg, 1.3 versus 0.8 percent per year) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Rates of thromboembolism vary among types of mechanical valves. As an example, in a series of 112 patients with mechanical mitral valve replacement who were anticoagulated (mean INR of 3), the long-term rate of thromboembolism was much higher for ball-in-cage valves, which are no longer implanted (eg, 8.5 percent per year), compared with tilting disk or bileaflet valves (3.1 percent per year) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Aortic valve</strong> – In patients with mechanical aortic valves who are treated with a VKA, the long-term incidence of thromboembolic events (predominantly cerebrovascular) is approximately 0.5 to 1.0 percent per year [<a href="#rid1">1,11,12</a>]. In comparison, a review of mechanical valve studies (with predominantly mechanical aortic valves) estimated the risk of major embolism as 1.3 percent per year with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> therapy alone and 4 percent per year with no antithrombotic therapy [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Efficacy and safety'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1667739405"><span class="h2">Prosthetic valve thrombosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>PVT can be symptomatic or subclinical, although the term PVT is sometimes used to denote symptomatic PVT. Risk factors for PVT include a mechanical (versus bioprosthetic) valve, mitral and tricuspid (versus aortic) valve positions, and, for mechanical valves, subtherapeutic anticoagulation.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Symptomatic PVT</strong> occurs when thrombus on a valve causes symptomatic prosthetic valve dysfunction. PVT can cause prosthetic valve obstruction (stenosis) or, less commonly, prosthetic valve regurgitation. Symptomatic obstructive PVT is an infrequent complication of mechanical or bioprosthetic valves.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The reported incidence of symptomatic obstructive mechanical PVT ranges from 0.3 to 1.3 percent per year, with higher rates (6 percent) among patients treated with subtherapeutic anticoagulation [<a href="#rid13">13-17</a>]. In one report of mechanical PVT, 70 percent of patients with coagulation tests measured at the time of PVT indicated inadequate anticoagulation [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Though data are limited, mitral mechanical PVT is likely to be at least twice as frequent as aortic mechanical PVT (0.5 versus 0.1 percent annually) [<a href="#rid11">11,18</a>]. Tricuspid mechanical PVT has been estimated to be 20 times more frequent than left-sided mechanical PVT, although data are limited [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Subclinical PVT</strong> occurs when PVT does not cause symptomatic valve dysfunction. Subclinical PVT (obstructive or nonobstructive) is probably more common than symptomatic PVT, but is of uncertain clinical significance. Limited data are available on the incidence of subclinical mechanical PVT, since surveillance transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and four-dimensional computerized tomographic angiography (CTA) are generally not performed. In a study of 680 patients studied by TEE on day 9 after mechanical mitral valve replacement, abnormal findings consistent with valve thrombus were detected in 64 of 680 patients (9.4 percent) despite anticoagulation with IV heparin initiated six hours after valve implantation [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. At intermediate-term (mean 34 months) follow-up, one or more complications (including transient ischemic attack, stroke, valve obstruction requiring surgery, and death) were observed in 3 of 29 patients with a &lt;5 mm thrombus and in 11 of 35 patients with ≥5 mm thrombus. However, thrombus burden in mechanical valves is difficult to assess by any imaging modality due to prosthetic image artifact.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">APPROACH TO ANTITHROMBOTIC THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with mechanical valves require anticoagulant therapy.

Either intravenous (IV) <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8518" href="/d/drug information/8518.html" rel="external">unfractionated heparin</a> (UFH) or subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is used [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Postoperative anticoagulation requires careful management, as patients are susceptible to bleeding complications and to excessively high international normalized ratios (INRs) because of increased sensitivity to VKA therapy [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>].

In the early postoperative period, IV UFH can be readily administered because the patient is already hospitalized. However, initial underdosing may occur as the dose is titrated, and there may be increased bleeding compared with LMWH at therapeutic or supratherapeutic levels of UFH.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>LMWH</strong> – Subcutaneous LMWH is more convenient to use and may result in a more predictable degree of anticoagulation [<a href="#rid21">21-23</a>].

Intravenous UFH or subcutaneous LMWH should be discontinued once the INR has been in the therapeutic range for two consecutive days. The VKA should be started as soon as is prudent in consultation with the surgeon, since indirect evidence on pregnant patients with mechanical valves suggests that heparin therapy may be inferior to VKA therapy in preventing thrombotic complications.(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8126.html" rel="external">"Management of antithrombotic therapy for a prosthetic heart valve during pregnancy", section on 'Mechanical valve management during pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The following issues are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reversal of the anticoagulant effects of UFH and LMWH.

The rationale for early bridging is that it may reduce the substantial risk of thromboembolism immediately after valve replacement, and at least five days of VKA therapy is usually required to achieve a therapeutic INR.</p><p>A meta-analysis included 23 observational studies of a total of 9534 patients who underwent mechanical valve replacement with outcomes assessed during the hospitalization period or the first 30 days [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. A lower thromboembolic rate was observed in the group of patients receiving bridging therapy (VKA plus UFH or LMWH) than in patients receiving VKA with no bridging therapy (1.1 versus 2.1 percent). A higher rate of bleeding was observed with patients receiving VKA plus LMWH (5.5 percent) than in patients treated with VKA plus UFH (2.2 percent) or VKA alone (1.8 percent). The effect of anticoagulation monitoring was not assessed. An additional limitation is that most of the included studies had only one treatment arm, so the comparisons are largely between studies, not within studies.</p><p>A later meta-analysis included three studies with a total of 553 patients studied early after mechanical valve replacement and three studies with a total of 813 patients with mechanical valves studied after noncardiac surgery [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. All studies were observational, each study included two treatment groups (LMWH or UFH), and follow-up duration ranged from 30 days to six months. The risk of thromboembolism was lower in the pooled LMWH group than in the UFH group, but the confidence interval was wide (0.6 versus 1.9 percent; risk ratio [RR] 0.34, 95% CI 0.12-0.95). The risk of major bleeding was similar in the two groups (9.2 versus 10.1 percent; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.68-1.30).</p><p>The largest study to assess the safety and efficacy of LMWH was performed in 1063 patients followed for six weeks after undergoing mechanical heart valve replacement (79 percent aortic) [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. A single 40 mg dose of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9407" href="/d/drug information/9407.html" rel="external">enoxaparin</a> was administered on the first postoperative day, followed by a reduced, weight-adjusted dose of LMWH (approximately 0.8 mg per kg with a maximum dose of 80 mg) every 12 hours, started on the second postoperative day. A VKA was started on the first or second postoperative day. The rate of thromboembolism was 1 percent, and the rate of major bleeding was 4.1 percent.

After valve surgery, patients are at risk for thromboembolic complications as well as bleeding complications (eg, hemopericardium) and may have transiently increased sensitivity to warfarin [<a href="#rid20">20,21,27,28</a>]. Possible mechanisms for increased sensitivity include hypoalbuminemia and the use of antibiotics after surgery.
