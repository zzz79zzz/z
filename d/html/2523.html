The high mortality rate reflects the prevalence of advanced disease at presentation. In population-based series of Western populations, the five-year survival rate for patients with completely resected stage I gastric cancer is approximately 70 to 75 percent, and it drops to 35 percent or less for stage IIB disease and beyond  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111190" href="/z/d/graphic/111190.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69815" href="/z/d/graphic/69815.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2481.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of invasive gastric cancer", section on 'Prognosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2616.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology of gastric cancer"</a>.)</p><p>Efforts to improve treatment results beyond those obtained with surgery alone have included adjuvant (postoperative) and neoadjuvant (preoperative) strategies. The positive impact of such therapies on survival in patients with resected gastric cancer has become clearer over time, although there is no consensus as to the best approach.</p><p>This topic review will focus on adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies for noncardia gastric cancer. The epidemiology, staging, and surgical treatment of invasive gastric cancers, the management of early gastric cancer (an adenocarcinoma that is restricted to the mucosa or submucosa, irrespective of lymph node metastasis [T1, any N]), and multimodality approaches for treatment of invasive thoracic esophageal cancers and cancers arising in the esophagogastric junction and proximal stomach (cardia) are covered separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2616.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology of gastric cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2513.html" rel="external">"Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of gastric cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2481.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of invasive gastric cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16858.html" rel="external">"Early gastric cancer: Treatment, natural history, and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2478.html" rel="external">"Radiation therapy, chemoradiotherapy, neoadjuvant approaches, and postoperative adjuvant therapy for localized cancers of the esophagus"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16226.html" rel="external">"Multimodality approaches to potentially resectable esophagogastric junction and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2992126489"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF THE THERAPEUTIC APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with potentially resectable noncardia gastric cancer, randomized trials and meta-analyses indicate a significant survival benefit over surgery alone for a number of approaches, including adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (as was used in two United States intergroup trials: Intergroup [INT] 0116 and Cancer and Leukemia Group B [CALGB] 80101), perioperative (preoperative plus postoperative) chemotherapy (as was used in the Medical Research Council Adjuvant Gastric Infusional Chemotherapy [MAGIC], and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9381" href="/z/d/drug information/9381.html" rel="external">docetaxel</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10180" href="/z/d/drug information/10180.html" rel="external">oxaliplatin</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9548" href="/z/d/drug information/9548.html" rel="external">leucovorin</a> [LV], and short-term infusional <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/z/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a> [FU; FLOT] trials), and adjuvant chemotherapy alone (as is often used in East Asia). (See <a class="local">'Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Neoadjuvant/perioperative chemotherapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Adjuvant chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Few trials have directly compared these approaches, and the optimal way to integrate combined modality therapy has not been definitively established. A major problem, at least in the United States, is that patients with gastric cancer are commonly taken to the operating room prior to consultation with medical or radiation oncologists. Multidisciplinary preoperative evaluation is strongly encouraged.</p><p>Enrollment in available clinical trials is preferred. If protocol treatment is not available or is declined, the following represents our general approach:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For most patients with potentially resectable, histologically proven noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma with invasion beyond the submucosa (clinical stage T2N0 or higher  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111190" href="/z/d/graphic/111190.html" rel="external">table 1</a>)) on preoperative staging evaluation, we recommend combined modality therapy over surgery alone.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For most patients, we suggest neoadjuvant therapy over initial surgery followed by adjuvant therapy, especially for those with a high likelihood of developing distant metastases (ie, those with bulky T3/T4 tumors, visible perigastric nodes by preoperative imaging studies, or a linitis plastica appearance).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although there are no randomized trials demonstrating an overall survival benefit from neoadjuvant therapy versus initial surgery followed by any form of adjuvant therapy, we favor the neoadjuvant chemotherapy approach given the greater chance of delivering therapy in the preoperative setting and the fact that patients who are at high risk of developing distant metastases may be spared the morbidity of unnecessary gastrectomy if evidence of distant metastases emerges after chemotherapy. (See <a class="local">'Versus surgery plus adjuvant chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Upfront surgery followed by adjuvant therapy remains an accepted approach, especially for patients with clinically staged, nonbulky T2 or T3 tumors with no visible perigastric nodes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Until further data are available, we suggest not pursuing preoperative chemoradiotherapy for patients with noncardia gastric cancer.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The best chemotherapy regimen for neoadjuvant therapy is not established, and practice is variable. For most patients with a good performance status and without significant comorbidities who are able to tolerate intensive chemotherapy, we suggest the FLOT regimen rather than an epirubicin-containing regimen (such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8663" href="/z/d/drug information/8663.html" rel="external">epirubicin</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/z/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a>, and infusional FU [ECF], or epirubicin, cisplatin, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8839" href="/z/d/drug information/8839.html" rel="external">capecitabine</a> [ECX]), given the survival benefit for FLOT compared with ECF in the FLOT4-AIO trial. (See <a class="local">'FLOT'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For patients with a lower performance status or multiple comorbidities who are thought unlikely to tolerate FLOT, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10180" href="/z/d/drug information/10180.html" rel="external">oxaliplatin</a> plus infusional FU and LV (FOLFOX), <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8839" href="/z/d/drug information/8839.html" rel="external">capecitabine</a> plus oxaliplatin (CAPOX), and S-1 plus oxaliplatin (where available) are appropriate alternative regimens. (See <a class="local">'Lesser performance status'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients who have already undergone potentially curative gastric resection with no neoadjuvant therapy, we recommend adjuvant therapy rather than surgery alone for all patients with positive nodes (which would include pathologic T1N1 [stage IB] disease) and for those with pathologic T3-4N0 disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111190" href="/z/d/graphic/111190.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Options for adjuvant therapy include chemotherapy with or without chemoradiotherapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients who have not undergone an adequate lymphadenectomy (D2 lymph node dissection including perigastric [D1] nodes as well as those along the left gastric artery, common hepatic artery, celiac artery, splenic hilum, and splenic artery [D2 lymph nodes], with the goal of examining 16 or more lymph nodes), or who have node-positive or incompletely resected (ie, R1 or R2) disease, we suggest chemoradiotherapy plus chemotherapy rather than chemotherapy alone.

Six months of FOLFOX  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef50132" href="/z/d/graphic/50132.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) is an acceptable alternative. (See <a class="local">'CAPOX/FOLFOX'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">One year of S-1 therapy may be an alternative for patients in Eastern Asian countries where this agent is approved. For those with stage III  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111190" href="/z/d/graphic/111190.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) disease, the combination of S-1 plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9381" href="/z/d/drug information/9381.html" rel="external">docetaxel</a> may be more effective than S-1 alone, but the side effect profile is also worse. How one year of either S-1 monotherapy or S-1 plus docetaxel compares with CAPOX for six months is not clear. (See <a class="local">'S-1 with or without docetaxel'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For the subgroup of patients with pathologic T2N0 disease, observation is appropriate as long as they have undergone an adequate (D2) lymph node dissection with the goal of examining at least 16 nodes. However, we would suggest adjuvant treatment for pathologic T2N0 disease with an inadequate lymphadenectomy. For other high-risk cases (pathologic T2N0 with a high histologic grade or the presence of lymphovascular or perineural invasion), we encourage adjuvant therapy and individualize decision-making. (See <a class="local">'Pathologic T2N0 disease'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The optimal management of patients with locally advanced, initially unresectable, but nonmetastatic gastric cancer is uncertain, and there is no standard approach. The role of induction therapy is unclear. An initial attempt at downstaging with chemotherapy, chemoradiotherapy, or a combination, followed by careful restaging and surgical exploration in responders who have no evidence of metastatic disease, is a reasonable approach for a fit patient who initially had locally unresectable but nonmetastatic disease.

There are no randomized trials comparing neoadjuvant therapy with initial surgery followed by any form of adjuvant therapy. However, given the greater chance of delivering systemic therapy in the preoperative setting, we favor this approach. However, upfront surgery followed by adjuvant therapy remains an accepted approach, especially for patients with distal, clinically staged, nonbulky clinical T2 tumors and no visible perigastric nodes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3313275765"><span class="h2">Neoadjuvant/perioperative chemotherapy</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3496978772"><span class="h3">Rationale and outcomes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be administered as a means of "downstaging" a locally advanced tumor prior to an attempt at curative resection. This approach has been applied to patients thought to have resectable disease as well as to those with apparently unresectable but nonmetastatic disease. (See <a class="local">'Initially locally unresectable nonmetastatic disease'</a> below.)</p><p>Another benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is that patients who are at high risk of developing distant metastases (eg, those with bulky T3/T4 tumors, visible perigastric nodes by preoperative imaging studies [including endoscopic ultrasound], or a linitis plastica appearance) may be spared the morbidity of unnecessary gastrectomy if evidence of distant metastases emerges after chemotherapy. Laparoscopic evaluation prior to initiation of therapy should be considered in any patient with extensive or bulky lymphadenopathy, fat stranding, or abdominopelvic ascites.

In a preliminary report, presented at the 2021 annual American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting (median follow-up 25 months), chemoradiotherapy was associated with a higher rates of R0 resection (95 versus 82 percent), higher pathologic complete response rate (16 versus 5 percent), and more patients with pathologically node-negative disease (60 versus 45 percent), but this did not translate into better three-year survival (56 versus 57 percent, HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.74-1.42), the primary endpoint.

Whether outcomes can be improved in poor responders by switching to a different non-cross-resistant regimen or by administering chemoradiotherapy (if it was not administered preoperatively) is not established. It is reasonable to offer adjuvant chemoradiotherapy to individuals with extensive residual disease if they are sufficiently fit to tolerate it, and wish to pursue an aggressive approach. Management of these patients needs to be individualized.</p><p>Patients who have substantial residual disease at resection after neoadjuvant therapy (particularly nodal metastases [<a href="#rid25">25-27</a>]) have a relatively poor prognosis, and the best way to manage this situation is unclear. If two or three months of preoperative chemotherapy had minimal impact on the tumor, administering more courses of the same chemotherapy seems unlikely to be more effective following surgery [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. However, at least one analysis of two separate cohorts undergoing perioperative chemotherapy using several different oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy regimen for locally advanced gastric cancer concluded that those who received the adjuvant therapy component of the regimen after surgery had better survival than did those who did not (after propensity score matching for a variety of potentially confounding covariates, three year overall survival was 60.1 versus 49.3 percent) [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. The better survival was seen only in those with a lymph node ratio (LNR; number of positive nodes divided by the total number of nodes in the surgical specimen) ≥9 percent, and not in those with a lower LNR.
