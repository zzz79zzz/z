         Evaluation of the right ventricle (RV) is a key component of the clinical assessment of many cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders. There are many ways to evaluate the RV, most of which can be accomplished noninvasively and without radiation exposure.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will discuss the approach to evaluation of RV structure and function. The evaluation of left ventricular (LV) structure and function is discussed separately. (See

         Separate inflow and outflow tracts arranged in series such that the tricuspid atrioventricular (AV) valve (inlet) is not in direct fibrous continuity with the pulmonic semilunar valve (outlet). Unlike the other three cardiac valves, the pulmonic valve is not in continuity with any part of the fibrous cardiac skeleton, but rather, it arises directly from infundibular myocardium.

         In contrast to the LV cavity which is readily modeled as a symmetrical prolate hemispheroid, the RV cavity is divided into three asymmetrical segments which include the trabeculated inflow tract, the trabeculated apex, and the smooth outflow tract  (

         ). Several discrete muscular ridges or bands are present in the RV, for which inconsistent and often confusing nomenclature has been used [

         The crista supraventricularis (also called the ventriculo-infundibular fold) separates the RV inflow tract from the RV outflow tract and is continuous with the parietal band.

         The moderator (septomarginal) band, through which the right bundle branch passes, is a muscular band extending from the base of the anterior papillary muscle to the interventricular septum. Abnormal development or hypertrophy of these muscular bands can lead to the syndrome of double-chambered RV, characterized by muscular obstruction between the RV inlet and RV outlet [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2

         The RV outflow tract is also referred to as the infundibulum, the supracristal segment, and the conus (arteriosus).

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The anatomically distinct walls of the RV are the inferior (also known as diaphragmatic) wall, anterior wall, and infundibulum (conus arteriosus). An apex and lateral wall of the RV are often identified separately, but are actually parts of the anterior wall. The juncture of anterior and inferior walls forms an acute angle (the acute margin of the heart), in contrast to the rounded contour of the obtuse margin of the heart, which is formed by the lateral wall of the LV.
        </p>
        <p>
         Septal, anterior, and posterior leaflets comprise the tricuspid valve and are supported via chordae tendinae by anterior and posterior papillary muscles; some of the chordae attach directly to the interventricular septum, right ventricular free wall, or moderator band, unlike the mitral valve apparatus which is entirely supported by papillary muscles. The septal portion of the tricuspid annulus is supported by the right fibrous trigone, while the mural portion of the annulus abuts the RV free wall, lacking support from the fibrous cardiac skeleton and therefore prone to elongation under chronic pressure or volume overload, leading to annular dilation and valvular regurgitation  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef121364" href="/z/d/graphic/121364.html" rel="external">

         Acquired dysfunction of the RV is most often secondary to pressure and/or volume overload. RV dysfunction may also be caused by conditions directly affecting the right ventricular myocardium (eg, cardiomyopathy or ischemic heart disease).
        </p>
        <p>
         Under normal conditions, the requirement for stroke work (the product of stroke volume and mean pulmonary artery systolic pressure) by the RV is one-seventh to one-sixth that of the LV [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ], since mean pulmonary arterial systolic pressure is approximately one-sixth to one-seventh mean systemic arterial systolic pressure while stroke volume is identical. Accordingly, RV mass is normally one-sixth to one-seventh that of the LV [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Hence, when an RV not chronically preconditioned to generate increased stroke work is required to eject its entire stroke volume against a pathologically elevated afterload (as in acute pulmonary embolism or acute left heart failure [HF]), one or more of the following can occur: dilation, hypokinesis, leftward displacement of the interventricular septum, and tricuspid regurgitation; which results in elevated filling pressure into and reduced antegrade ejection out of both sides of the heart.
        </p>
        <p>
         In states of RV volume overload there is predominantly diastolic flattening of the interventricular septum  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef122472" href="/z/d/graphic/122472.html" rel="external">
          movie 1
         </a>
         ), accounting for the D-shaped short axis configuration of the LV during diastole. In states of RV pressure overload, flattening of the septum is constant throughout the cardiac cycle, accounting for the D-shape of the LV throughout the entire cardiac cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
         Volume overload causes RV dilation (eccentric hypertrophy). As is the case for mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation tends to beget more tricuspid regurgitation due to the effects of chronic volume overload, including chamber and annular dilatation, leaflet tethering, and loss of coaptation, which worsen the tricuspid regurgitation and create a positive feedback loop or vicious cycle. Dilation of the RV can also occur in a variety of other diseases that affect the myocardium of the RV, including RV infarct, RV dysplasia (including arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, Naxos disease, and Uhl's anomaly), and as a result of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, myocarditis, and myositis. Thickening of the RV free wall (concentric hypertrophy) is a consequence of pressure overload. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8119.html" rel="external">
          "Etiology, clinical features, and evaluation of tricuspid regurgitation"

        </p>
        <p>
         LV function can be adversely affected by RV pressure and/or volume overload by direct ventricular interaction  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef122472" href="/z/d/graphic/122472.html" rel="external">

         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ] between the conjoined pumping chambers (the reverse Bernheim effect, so-named because it is the reciprocal of what Bernheim originally hypothesized [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ] as a mechanism of right HF, secondary to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). This effect is mediated by the constraining effects of the pericardium, the shared interventricular septum, and the superficial layer of cardiac myofibers which encircle both ventricles parallel to the AV groove. Mitigation of the reverse Bernheim effect by pressure- or volume-unloading of the RV can therefore result in marked improvement of LV filling and ejection  (

         The most common cause of pressure overload is pulmonary hypertension (PH); other causes include RV outflow obstruction such as pulmonic stenosis (subvalvular or valvular), pulmonic atresia, and pulmonary artery stenosis (which may be caused by conditions such as Williams syndrome, rubella exposure during pregnancy, mediastinal radiation therapy, surgical banding, or sequelae of surgical shunts).

         Chronic PH induces concentric RV hypertrophy, similar to the occurrence of LV hypertrophy in patients with systemic hypertension. The shape of the RV, however is not well suited to sustain high pressure loads and is more prone to failure than the LV, even at significantly lower pressure loads.

         Left-sided HF is the most common cause of PH (known as PH due to left heart disease or PH-LHD). In patients with HF, RV size and RV ejection fraction (RVEF) have been shown to be independent prognostic factors of outcome, including among patients with reduced or preserved LV ejection fraction (LVEF).

         Patients with HF requiring mechanical circulatory support continue to be at risk of right heart dysfunction due to PH-LHD. The acute effects of LV assist device (LVAD) support are the transfer of the burden of stroke work generation from the LV to the LVAD, reduction of RV afterload, and an increase in RV preload. Thorough and accurate assessment of RV function is paramount prior to and after implantation of an LVAD, since overall circulatory function will be limited by whatever capacity to generate useful stroke work remains in the (usually dysfunctional) RV. RV failure (defined variously as a requirement for mechanical or pharmacologic support to augment RV output) occurs in 13 to 40 percent of continuous flow LVAD recipients [

        <p>
         Echocardiographic assessment of RV dysfunction in LVAD patients involves assessment of RV parameters and identification of abnormalities including RV dilation, RV hypokinesis, leftward displacement of the interventricular septum, and tricuspid regurgitation. These findings may be identified when the RV cannot "keep up" with the native LV or an LVAD-supported LV. RV and LV parameters are assessed during echocardiographic "ramp" studies performed to optimize LVAD pump speed to maintain balance between antegrade left- and right-sided output. (See

         The hallmarks of acute RV pressure overload caused by acute pulmonary embolism are chamber dilation, free wall hypokinesis, leftward displacement of the interventricular septum, and the development or worsening of tricuspid regurgitation. However, echocardiographic manifestations of these phenomena have limited specificity and sensitivity for the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism.

         In patients with chronic respiratory disorders who develop PH (group 3), there is pressure overload of the RV. Within this group, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is the most common underlying etiology; other causes include interstitial lung disease and sleep disordered breathing. (See

         For some patients in this group (eg, those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), the changes in the geometry of the thoracic cavity may pose additional difficulties for the assessment of RV size and function. Hyperinflation of the lungs in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease makes cardiac auscultation more difficult, as sounds are attenuated by the interfering lung, electrocardiographic (ECG) voltage decreases, echocardiographic windows may be suboptimal, and breath-holding capacity is reduced, although adequate cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging can generally be performed.

         For patients with a variety of congenital cardiac conditions (with or without surgical correction), the size and function of the RV are important prognostic markers and determine the timing of intervention. Congenital conditions associated with risk of progressive RV dilation and dysfunction include pulmonic regurgitation, pulmonic stenosis with prior intervention, repaired tetralogy of Fallot, PH-CHD, and lesions associated with severe tricuspid and severe pulmonary valve regurgitation. Patients with these conditions require periodic monitoring of RV size and function. Some examples are discussed here:

         In patients with atrial septal defect and/or anomalous pulmonary venous return, the right heart is presented with increased blood volume comprised of the systemic circulatory volume plus the additional shunt volume.

         In the clinical syndrome of RV myocardial infarction (MI), RV ischemia or infarction causes RV dysfunction, which is commonly but not always accompanied by at least focal LV dysfunction. The extent and severity of RV and LV dysfunction in this setting varies depending upon the amount of ischemia caused by the culprit lesion, as well as other conditions such as prior MI. Thus, clinical hemodynamic manifestations include no apparent hemodynamic compromise or hemodynamically significant LV and/or RV dysfunction.

        <p>
         In the minority of patients with isolated RV infarction, the clinical and echocardiographic picture may be similar to that with acute pulmonary embolism (with the dyad of dilated hypokinetic RV and small hyperdynamic LV). When this occurs, the most salient differentiating feature is the pulmonary artery pressure, which will usually be normal or reduced in isolated RV infarction, and elevated in pulmonary embolism. RV dysfunction and fibrosis following infarction are also well-visualized by CMR  (

         Although cardiomyopathies that predominantly affect the RV are less common than those affecting primarily the LV, they are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. The most important of these is arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy (ARVC), the diagnosis of which is based on a combination of findings on imaging (echocardiography/CMR), tissue characterization (endomyocardial biopsy), ECG (depolarization and repolarization abnormalities), ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitoring, and family history (including genetic analysis) [

Malabsorption due to intestinal edema may lead not only to diarrhea, but more importantly, can also lead to the development of diuretic (and other drug) refractoriness as a result of failure of the drug to enter the bloodstream when taken orally.

         Liver injury may be caused by hepatic congestion as well as low cardiac output. The most common liver biochemical abnormality in patients with HF is elevated serum bilirubin. Elevated serum aminotransferase levels and an abnormal prothrombin time are also common. Hypoalbuminemia is common in patients with HF but is likely caused by malnutrition and protein-losing gastroenteropathy due to intestinal lymphatic pressure. (See

         Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) should be performed as the initial test for evaluation of RV structure and function.

         For patients with nondiagnostic echocardiographic imaging (eg, RV size or function is uncertain) or complex congenital heart disease (eg, monitoring of patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot) or with a suspected diagnosis that requires further imaging (eg, arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy or sarcoidosis), cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the preferred approach. CMR can help identify anomalous venous connection to the superior or inferior vena cava when this is not adequately imaged by TEE.

         Conditions resulting in RV volume overload (eg, left-to-right shunts or tricuspid and pulmonary valve regurgitation) as well as certain RV cardiomyopathies result in an increased RV size. A physical exam may demonstrate the displaced RV impulse and ECG may suggest RV dilation. Although two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography is most frequently used, it provides a semi-quantitative measure of the RV dimension  (

         ). Volumetric assessment of the RV with three-dimensional (3D) TTE has shown promise in studies using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)-derived volumes as the gold standard [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13-15

         ], but its use in the day-to-day quantitation of the RV is fraught with technical limitations of acquisition and quantification [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. CMR and CT using the disk-summation approach (Simpson's rule) provide a more accurate quantitative assessment. Radionuclide ventriculography (RVG) has been used extensively in the past and may provide semi-quantitative assessment of the RV size. Similarly, though not commonly used for this indication, single photon emission CT (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) may also be able to provide a gross semi-quantitative assessment of RV dilation. Invasive catheterization with right ventriculography may be used to visualize RV size, but in modern practice is primarily used for patients with congenital heart disease that undergo invasive hemodynamic assessment, usually with another indication for the procedure.

         Conditions resulting in RV pressure overload (eg, pulmonic stenosis, pulmonary hypertension [PH]) can result in RV wall hypertrophy. A physical exam and an ECG may provide clues that RV hypertrophy may be present (RV heave, right axis deviation and voltage criteria for RV hypertrophy) but are more qualitative characteristics. Imaging methods (primarily CMR and CT, but also echocardiography and SPECT/PET) can readily visualize wall thickness. CMR (and CT) may also provide information regarding the structure of the RV wall (eg, scarring, fatty infiltration, etc) which may be helpful in certain conditions (eg, evaluation for arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy, sarcoidosis, etc). Invasive cardiac catheterization with right ventriculography may demonstrate thickened RV trabeculations and thus provide indirect evidence of RV hypertrophy, but is rarely used for this indication.

         Physical signs (including third and fourth heart sounds emanating from the RV, edema, and RV heave) are neither sensitive nor specific for assessing RV function [

          17
         </a>
         ]. Echocardiography remains the most commonly used test to estimate RVEF. Quantitation of RV free wall deformation by speckle-tracking (strain) echocardiography may be superior to the more commonly obtained echocardiographic measures of RV contractile function, including tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), because unlike TAPSE, strain measurements are not subject to errors introduced by the plane of M-mode imaging and cardiac translation [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. CMR is currently considered the most accurate and reproducible method to quantitate RV function. The accuracy of measurement of the RVEF is generally similar to that of the LVEF [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ], although the free wall trabeculations may interfere with accurate endocardial tracing and the difficulty in defining the plane of the tricuspid and pulmonic valves may increase variability and compromise accuracy and reproducibility of the measurement. RVG has been used extensively in the past for this indication, and is still considered highly accurate and reproducible, but its clinical use has substantially decreased for this indication as the other imaging methods have evolved. With cardiac CT, when radiation is delivered throughout the entire cardiac cycle the RVEF can be measured, but is generally avoided as it results in high radiation dosimetry. SPECT/PET with ECG-gating can also provide a semi-quantitative assessment of RV function and may be clinically useful in patients who undergo stress imaging for other indications.

         Invasive right heart/pulmonary artery catheterization is the standard reference for assessment of intracardiac pressures. The relations among pulmonary artery and left atrial (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure), right atrial pressure, and LV pressure can be useful in defining pathology in a variety of diseases with impaired hemodynamics. A complete discussion of the invasive hemodynamic assessment of the RV is presented separately. (See

         Assessment of the height of the jugular venous pulsation and the amplitude of the pulmonic component of the second heart sound are employed to estimate right atrial and pulmonary artery pressure, respectively, but surprisingly limited data are available to evaluate their diagnostic accuracy, and the data that do exist demonstrate low sensitivity and specificity of these (and other) physical findings for the detection of pathologically elevated right-sided pressures, which in part explains reliance on echocardiography and catheterization to assess right heart pressures [

         Echocardiography can measure pressure gradients across valves and only indirectly or by estimation assess absolute values of intracardiac pressures. Similarly, CMR (and less so CT) can provide indirect evidence of RV pressure overload.

         Echocardiography is the standard reference for visualization of all cardiac valves. Tricuspid and pulmonic valve regurgitation can be visually assessed by Doppler and 2D/3D color flow imaging. Another option, including quantitative assessment of the severity of regurgitation, can be obtained by CMR with a technique called phase-contrast, alone (for pulmonic regurgitation) or in combination with volumetric data (for tricuspid regurgitation) [

         The RV is less symmetric than the LV and is significantly more complex in its internal geometry. Its cavity can be roughly modeled as a stack of crescents with diminishing dimensions from base to apex. However there is significant interindividual variability, which is one of several reasons why its volume cannot be calculated by entering linear dimensions into simple mathematical equations the way that LV volume can be. Two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography remains the mainstay of noninvasive evaluation of the RV, but newer imaging modalities are assuming an increasing role  (

         The utility of 3D-derived RVEF as a predictor of adverse outcomes was highlighted by a meta-analysis of 10 studies including data on 1928 patients with a variety of cardiovascular disorders (including pulmonary hypertension) [

         ]. Endpoints ranging from all-cause mortality to various composite cardiovascular outcomes were assessed 3 to 44 months after echocardiography. One standard deviation reduction in RVEF was associated with adverse outcomes (hazard ratio 2.64, 95% CI 2.18-3.20). RVEF was more strongly associated with adverse outcomes than comparable change in other measures of RV systolic function (TAPSE, fractional area change, or free-wall longitudinal strain).

         The RV is located immediately behind the sternum (anterior wall) and above the diaphragm (inferior/diaphragmatic wall). The sternum limits the acoustic windows through which right heart structures can be imaged by TTE. This limitation does not apply to TEE, in which imaging of the RV does not require acoustic penetration of the chest wall, but transesophageal imaging of the RV has its own limitation in that the imaging transducer is far away from the target. However, imaging from the transgastric views often yields high quality images of the RV as well as of the tricuspid valve due to the proximity of these structures to the diaphragm abutting the gastric fundus [

         Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is the most accurate and reproducible imaging method to quantitatively assess RV (and LV) size and function. It also enables quantitation of shunts and valvular regurgitant flow, assessment of myocardial disease, identification of anomalous pulmonary venous connection (including attachment to superior or inferior vena cava), and evaluation of the pulmonary artery and aorta [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. CMR is recommended when echocardiographic imaging is nondiagnostic or insufficient for diagnosis and evaluation. Gadolinium-based contrast is not required for imaging ventricular chamber size and function and great vessels but is used for evaluation of myocardial contrast effects (including delayed enhancement for detection of infarction, scar, or inflammation), disease, and MR angiography  (

         Limitations of CMR imaging include difficulty defining the boundaries of the RV at the tricuspid and pulmonic valves throughout the cardiac cycle. Each fixed imaging plane depicts different levels of the RV wall as the RV moves during the cardiac cycle. Unless a slice tracking technique is used, this through-plane motion is a significant issue for RV short-axis imaging but can more easily be managed in the longitudinal (two-chamber) and four-chamber orientations. When RV volumes and ejection fraction are quantified using short-axis images, the through-plane motion must be accounted for.

         Cardiac CT refers to CT imaging of the heart with multidetector (eg, 64 and higher) CT systems using ECG techniques to synchronize the image acquisition with the cardiac cycle. Global RV systolic function can be qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated. Visual assessment of RV global wall motion can be graded qualitatively by viewing cine loops (of 2D slices or 3D reconstruction) of the cardiac cycle. Cardiac CT image acquisition is rapid relative to other techniques. Fast automated tools for analysis of segmental and global function have been shown to have high reproducibility and excellent correlation with echocardiography. The temporal resolution with cardiac CT is still inferior to other techniques, including TTE and CMR, which leads to CT overestimation of end systolic volumes, and, as a consequence, underestimation of RVEF. Cardiac CT exposes the patient to radiation associated with the acquisition of the scan, although lower radiation dose protocols have been proposed that limit radiation exposure to less than 5 mSv. Additionally, cardiac CT exposes the patient to intravenous administration of iodinated contrast.

         Radionuclide ventriculography (RVG) is performed using a radioactive tracer to label the patient's red blood cell pool and a gamma-ray camera to capture images of the blood circulating through the heart. RVG provides a detailed and accurate assessment of RVEF and LVEF, with the most common indication being the quantification of ventricular volumes and LVEF when this diagnostic information is unreliable or unavailable by other imaging modalities. RVG can also be used to quantify shunt fractions for patients with congenital heart disease and intracardiac shunts. As with CT, there is associated radiation exposure estimated to be approximately 6 to 7 mSv.

         Single photon emission CT-myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT-MPI) is commonly used for assessment of ischemic heart disease, and generally includes evaluation of LV volumes and LVEF. Precise information on the RV size and RVEF is not typically available using SPECT.

         Evaluation of the right ventricle (RV) is a key component of the clinical assessment of many cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders. Cardiac imaging to assess RV function should be undertaken in patients with clinical conditions associated with RV dysfunction, including patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) affecting the right heart, known or suspected pulmonary hypertension (PH), ischemic heart disease, or cardiomyopathy. (See
         <a class="local">

         Acquired dysfunction of the RV is most often secondary to pressure and/or volume overload. RV dysfunction may also be caused by conditions directly affecting the RV myocardium (eg, cardiomyopathy or ischemic heart disease). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pathophysiology'

         The most common cause of pressure overload is PH; other causes include RV outflow obstruction such as pulmonic stenosis (subvalvular or valvular), pulmonic atresia, and pulmonary artery stenosis (which may be caused by conditions such as Williams syndrome, rubella exposure during pregnancy, mediastinal radiation therapy, or surgical banding).

         Causes of RV volume overload include left-to-right shunts at the atrial level or above (eg, atrial septal defect, unroofed coronary sinus, anomalous pulmonary vein connection to the right atrium and/or the vena cava), tricuspid regurgitation, and pulmonic regurgitation. (See
