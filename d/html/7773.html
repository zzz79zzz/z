However, unlike low back pain, lost time from work related to neck pain is infrequent. Degenerative changes of the cervical spine represent the most common cause of acute and chronic neck pain in adults.</p><p>The evaluation of the adult patient with neck pain (including whiplash injury) without recent major trauma is addressed here. Acute traumatic neck injury, cervical radiculopathy, and cervical spondylotic myelopathy are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cervical spine injury (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/342.html" rel="external">"Cervical spinal column injuries in adults: Evaluation and initial management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/357.html" rel="external">"Spinal column injuries in adults: Types, classification, and mechanisms"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cervical radiculopathy (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5271.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5263.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prognosis of cervical radiculopathy"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4820.html" rel="external">"Cervical spondylotic myelopathy"</a>)</p><p></p><p>Treatment of neck pain is also discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7777.html" rel="external">"Management of nonradicular neck pain in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">ANATOMY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Understanding the cervical spine and regional spinal cord anatomy is important for the evaluation of the patient with neck pain.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anatomy of the cervical spine</strong> – The cervical spine is comprised of seven vertebrae  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69175" href="/z/d/graphic/69175.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The articulation between the occiput and the first cervical vertebra (the atlantooccipital joint) allows for approximately one-third of flexion and extension and one-half of lateral bending of the neck [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The articulation between the first and second cervical vertebrae (the atlantoaxial joint) allows for 50 percent of rotational range of motion. The articulations between the second and seventh cervical vertebrae allow for approximately two-thirds of flexion and extension, 50 percent of rotation, and 50 percent of lateral bending.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The most common locations that exhibit degenerative changes are between C4 and C7 [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The nerve roots passing through the intervertebral foraminal in these areas are C5, C6, and C7. Uncovertebral articulations (also known as joints of Luschka) are present in the C3 to C7 spinal segments, which are located on the posterolateral border of the intervertebral disc and in the anteromedial portion of the intervertebral foramen. These articulations are not true synovial joints but can hypertrophy in association with disc degeneration. This results in narrowing of the intervertebral foramen, which is a common cause of cervical radiculopathy [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The cervical and trapezius muscles have two major functions: to support and provide movement and alignment for the head and neck and to protect the spinal cord and spinal nerves when the spinal column is under mechanical stress.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The normal cervical spine has a shallow lordosis, which is maintained by the neck muscles. The lordosis can be decreased in patients with degenerative changes. Severe degenerative changes in the cervical spine can result in reversal of the lordosis. The lordosis may also become accentuated in compensation in patients with prominent thoracic kyphosis. Alterations in spinal alignment, however, have not clearly been demonstrated to cause cervical pain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Neuroanatomy</strong> – There are eight cervical spinal nerves, each arising from the spinal cord and consisting of a ventral and a dorsal root  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65024" href="/z/d/graphic/65024.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). The ventral root contains efferent fibers from alpha motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. The dorsal root carries primary sensory afferent fibers from cells in the dorsal root ganglion. Cervical radiculopathy may be caused by degenerative changes in the spine that affect the nerve root. The findings vary with the level of nerve root involvement  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74632" href="/z/d/graphic/74632.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). This dermatomal/myotomal mapping is what is typically seen, though it may not always map precisely in this manner. (See <a class="local">'Cervical radiculopathy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The dorsal and ventral spinal roots combine to form the spinal nerve. This spinal nerve then divides into two branches, a dorsal primary ramus and a ventral primary ramus. The dorsal ramus innervates the muscular, cutaneous, and articular components of the posterior neck. The ventral ramus innervates the prevertebral and paravertebral muscles and forms the brachial plexus, which supplies the upper limb.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Sensory cervical dermatomes are illustrated in the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53006" href="/z/d/graphic/53006.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A myotome is the group of muscles innervated by a spinal nerve. The diaphragm is innervated by C3 to C5 spinal nerves, and respiratory paralysis may result from spinal cord injuries above C5.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3721154740"><span class="h1">CAUSES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While the differential diagnosis of neck pain in adults is broad, most cases are caused by musculoskeletal conditions (eg, cervical strain, cervical spondylosis, cervical discogenic pain), with the remainder related to neurologic (eg, cervical radiculopathy) and non-spinal (eg, infection, malignancy, rheumatologic disease) disorders  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119357" href="/z/d/graphic/119357.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). It is not always possible to clearly identify the cause, in part because degenerative changes are common and nonspecific. Often, multiple cervical spine conditions occur together (eg, radiculopathy with disc degeneration) such that identifying a single etiology may be difficult.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1411505058"><span class="h2">Musculoskeletal conditions</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H982426727"><span class="h3">Cervical strain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cervical strain generally presents with pain and/or stiffness on neck movement. There is often a history of antecedent injury to the cervical paraspinal muscles, although it may result from the physical stresses of everyday life including poor posture and sleeping habits. In some cases, there may be no clear precipitating cause. Physical examination shows tenderness on palpation of the neck and trapezius muscles. Provocative maneuvers for cervical radiculopathy are negative. (See <a class="local">'Provocative maneuvers'</a> below.)</p><p>The diagnosis of cervical strain is made on the basis of clinical presentation. Imaging is unnecessary. Neck pain and stiffness may last for up to six weeks; alternative diagnoses should be considered in patients with longer-lasting or atypical symptoms.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3199178732"><span class="h3">Cervical spondylosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>"Spondylosis" is a nonspecific term used to describe effects generally ascribed to degenerative changes in the spine, usually with osteophyte production [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Degenerative changes are common findings on imaging in asymptomatic individuals [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. However, depending on where the spondylotic changes occur, there may be associated radiculopathy. (See <a class="local">'Radiculopathy/myelopathy'</a> below.)</p><p>Abnormalities seen on cervical spine imaging include osteophyte formation along the vertebral bodies and changes in the facet joints and lamina at multiple vertebral levels  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef119432" href="/z/d/graphic/119432.html" rel="external">image 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef119427" href="/z/d/graphic/119427.html" rel="external">image 2</a>). However, correlation between the degree of disease on imaging and the presence or severity of pain is poor. Given that multilevel degenerative joint disease is normally seen in asymptomatic individuals, reliable attribution of neck symptoms to cervical spondylosis is difficult [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1350994733"><span class="h3">Cervical discogenic pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cervical discogenic pain results from disc degeneration. It typically presents with pain and/or stiffness on neck movement, which is sometimes associated with pain in the upper extremities. Symptoms are often exacerbated when the neck is held in one position for prolonged periods, such as occurs with driving, reading, or working at a computer. Physical examination shows decreased range of motion associated with pain, and cervical radicular signs are usually absent. Provocative maneuvers for cervical radiculopathy are negative. (See <a class="local">'Provocative maneuvers'</a> below.)</p><p>Pain in this setting is largely mechanical, resulting from derangement in the disc architecture and inability to effectively distribute pressures between the disc, vertebral endplates, and facet joints. It can occur with or without local inflammation.</p><p>The diagnosis of cervical discogenic pain may be suspected on the basis of clinical presentation. Findings of degenerative changes of the discs on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are supportive; however, these findings are very common in asymptomatic individuals and it can be difficult to reliably attribute neck pain to discogenic changes [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>]. In a 12-year prospective study, changes on MRI indicating progressive disc degeneration were seen in 81 percent of asymptomatic subjects (mean age 39 years) at study onset [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Thus, the term "cervical discogenic pain" (or alternatively "cervical internal disc disruption syndrome") is used to describe patients who are symptomatic with disc-related neck pain, whereas the broader term "disc degeneration" refers to the common imaging findings that in many cases have little or no clinical significance [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2714768965"><span class="h3">Whiplash injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Whiplash injury is defined as neck injury resulting from an acceleration-deceleration mechanism that causes sudden extension and flexion of the neck [<a href="#rid11">11-13</a>]. These injuries are also commonly referred to as cervical strains or sprains. (See <a class="local">'Cervical strain'</a> above.)</p><p>The extension-flexion mechanism can injure intervertebral joints, discs, and ligaments; cervical muscles; and/or nerve roots. Injury to the zygapophyseal joint, commonly referred to as the facet joint, is likely the most common cause of whiplash-related upper neck pain and headaches [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>].</p><p>Whiplash injuries most commonly occur following rear-end or side impact motor vehicle collisions, but can occur from other mechanisms (eg, occupation requiring repeatedly positioning the neck in extension). Symptoms typically include neck pain and stiffness which may present immediately after the injury or may be delayed for several days. Other symptoms may include headache, shoulder or back pain, dizziness, paresthesias, fatigue, and sleep disturbances.</p><p>Whiplash injuries are classified according to the associated signs and symptoms [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grade 1 – Complaint of neck pain or stiffness only; no physical signs</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grade 2 – Complaint of neck pain or stiffness with associated musculoskeletal signs (eg, decreased range of motion, point tenderness)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grade 3 – Complaint of neck pain or stiffness with associated neurologic signs (eg, decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes, weakness, sensory deficits)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grade 4 – Complaint of neck pain or stiffness with associated fracture or dislocation</p><p></p><p>The term "whiplash injury" generally refers to grade 1 to 3 injuries; grade 4 injuries (associated with fracture or dislocation) are generally associated with more substantial trauma and are considered a distinct entity.</p><p>Whiplash injury is typically diagnosed clinically based on characteristic presentation and clinical findings. Most patients do not require imaging. In patients with recent trauma, clinical decision rules (eg, NEXUS low-risk criteria or Canadian C-spine rule) can be used to determine the need for cervical spine imaging. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/342.html" rel="external">"Cervical spinal column injuries in adults: Evaluation and initial management", section on 'Clinical decision rules'</a>.)</p><p>Whiplash injury is often associated with persistent low intensity pain [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. In a systematic review of 47 studies, approximately 50 percent of adults with whiplash injury reported neck pain at one year out from the injury [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Clinical predictors of pain at one year include pain severity at the time of injury and reduction in cervical range of motion [<a href="#rid18">18-20</a>]. Psychosocial factors may also play a role (eg, social supports, depression, somatization, catastrophizing) [<a href="#rid21">21-23</a>]. Other factors that may affect reported symptom duration include cultural differences in expectations of pain and the possibility of financial compensation [<a href="#rid19">19,24-26</a>]. A legislative change in Australia removing financial compensation for pain and suffering from whiplash injuries was associated with improvement in functional status and pain indices in patients with whiplash compared with historical controls [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p>The pathophysiology of this condition is unclear. Microvascular bleeding and local release of inflammatory mediators may explain the acute injury, but some patients remain symptomatic for months or even years. Soft tissue injury may be associated with the degree of impairment. A study using high-resolution MRI of the cervical spine in patients with a remote history of whiplash injury (mean six years) and symptoms that had persisted at least three months following injury demonstrated soft tissue damage, particularly of the alar ligaments, not seen in control subjects [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. In a study comparing whiplash patients with asymptomatic controls using color Doppler ultrasound, a high blood flow pattern was detected at the enthesis of the spinous processes and bilaterally juxtaposed to the facet joints [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H131150799"><span class="h3">Cervical facet osteoarthritis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cervical facet osteoarthritis generally presents with pain and/or stiffness on neck movement. Pain may arise spontaneously or may be brought on by a flexion-extension injury. In the latter setting, there is some overlap with whiplash injury. (See <a class="local">'Whiplash injury'</a> above.)</p><p>Symptoms can be somatically referred to the shoulders, periscapular region, occiput, or proximal limb. Physical examination shows decreased range of motion associated with neck spasm. Provocative maneuvers for cervical radiculopathy are negative. (See <a class="local">'Provocative maneuvers'</a> below.)</p><p>The diagnosis of cervical facet osteoarthritis is based on clinical findings and correlative imaging findings of osteoarthritic changes; however, facet joint changes are relatively common and don’t correlate well with presence or severity of pain. The diagnosis may be more definitively established by demonstrating relief of symptoms with a local anesthetic injection to the facet joint innervation [<a href="#rid29">29,30</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4144986585"><span class="h3">Myofascial pain syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is a regional pain disorder associated trigger points, taut bands, and pressure sensitivity. MPS is a relatively common source of chronic pain in the general population. The pain of MPS is of a deep aching quality, occasionally accompanied by a sensation of burning or stinging. Myofascial trigger points are the characteristic finding on physical examination  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66839 graphicRef79295" href="/z/d/graphic/66839.html" rel="external">figure 4A-B</a>). The pain often occurs in one anatomic region, such as the right side of the neck and shoulder. This distinguishes MPS from fibromyalgia, which is typically associated with widespread pain, though there is considerable overlap between the two diagnoses.</p><p>MPS is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7757.html" rel="external">"Overview of soft tissue musculoskeletal disorders", section on 'Myofascial pain syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2440562774"><span class="h3">Diffuse skeletal hyperostosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Diffuse skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is a syndrome of inappropriate bone deposition in the insertions of the ligaments and tendons. Large osteophytes connect adjacent vertebral bodies in a somewhat asymmetric fashion  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75500" href="/z/d/graphic/75500.html" rel="external">image 3</a>). Patients with DISH may have neck, thoracic spine, low back, and/or extremity pain. Spinal morning stiffness is common. Some affected patients may complain of dysphagia due to prominent anterior vertebral hyperostosis. The diagnosis is based on specific radiographic criteria  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60298" href="/z/d/graphic/60298.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p>The clinical features and diagnosis of DISH are discussed in detail separately.

Degenerative changes of the spine (eg, cervical foraminal stenosis, cervical herniated disc) are responsible for 70 to 90 percent of cases. Other less common causes include herpes zoster, Lyme radiculopathy, and diabetic polyradiculopathy.</p><p>Cervical radiculopathy generally presents with pain, sensory abnormalities, and/or weakness in an upper extremity. Physical examination may show altered sensation in a dermatomal pattern  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53006" href="/z/d/graphic/53006.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>), decreased reflexes, and/or localized muscle weakness in a myotomal distribution. Provocative maneuvers are often positive (see <a class="local">'Provocative maneuvers'</a> below). The diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy is suspected on the basis of clinical presentation. MRI with evidence of cervical nerve root compression is supportive; however, imaging is usually not necessary unless there is progressive neurologic impairment.

Patients may present with a variety of neurologic complaints including lower extremity weakness, gait or coordination difficulties, and bladder or bowel dysfunction. Physical examination may show upper motor neuron signs in the arms and/or legs. Lhermitte's sign (electric shock-like sensation in the neck, radiating down the spine or into the arms, produced by forward flexion of the neck) may be present.

The lateral view demonstrates vertebral alignment; the normal cervical lordotic curve can be replaced by a straightened or even a reversed curve in moderate to severe cases of cervical strain. The lateral view is also used to screen for the degree of osteoarthritis at facet and paravertebral joints, disk space narrowing from osteoarthritis, or other bony pathology (eg, compression fracture).</p><p>Views other than the AP and lateral are generally not necessary in patients with suspected degenerative disease of the spine.

The most common cause of acute and chronic neck pain in adults is degenerative changes of the cervical spine, which can present with or without neurologic dysfunction. The most common locations that exhibit degenerative changes are between C4 and C7, affecting the C5, 6, and 7 nerve roots. However, degenerative changes do not correlate well with presence or severity of pain.
