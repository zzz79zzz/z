The average lifespan of patients diagnosed with these disorders is reduced.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3383341295"><span class="h2">Parkinson disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>PD is one of the more common progressive neurodegenerative diseases. The prevalence of PD increases with age. The cardinal features of PD are tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. Postural instability generally occurs late in the course of the disease. Other motor features of PD include craniofacial (eg, masked facial expression, hypophonia), visual (eg, hypometric saccades, eyelid-opening apraxia), musculoskeletal (eg, micrographia, stooped posture), and gait (eg, shuffling, short-stepped gait, freezing) abnormalities  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81338" href="/z/d/graphic/81338.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). In addition to motor involvement, PD is a complex disorder with diverse clinical features that include neuropsychiatric and nonmotor manifestations  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71879" href="/z/d/graphic/71879.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4903.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of Parkinson disease"</a>.)</p><p>The nonmotor manifestations of PD include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cognitive dysfunction and dementia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Psychosis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mood disorders including depression, anxiety, and apathy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sleep disturbances</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Excessive daytime somnolence</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fatigue</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Autonomic dysfunction, including orthostasis, constipation, dysphagia, diaphoresis, urinary difficulties, and sexual dysfunction</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Olfactory dysfunction</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pain and sensory disturbances</p><p></p><p>Treatment options for these nonmotor features of PD are limited, and palliative care may play an important role in their management [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1344510126"><span class="h2">Atypical parkinsonian disorders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although PD is the most frequent cause of parkinsonism, atypical parkinsonian conditions (DLB, PSP, MSA, and CBD) account for 10 to 15 percent of patients with parkinsonism [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Distinguishing PD from these parkinsonian syndromes can be difficult, particularly in the early stages of disease. These conditions have overlapping features, but they usually can be differentiated based upon responsiveness to levodopa therapy and the appearance of signature features (eg, disordered eye movements with PSP, severe autonomic insufficiency with MSA, predominant early dementia with DLB, and unilateral apraxia in CBD). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4904.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Parkinson disease"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)</strong> – DLB is the second most common cause of neurodegenerative dementia after Alzheimer disease and is characterized clinically by visual hallucinations, fluctuating cognition, and parkinsonism, which occurs in the majority but not in everyone. Other associated symptoms include repeated falls, syncope, autonomic dysfunction, neuroleptic sensitivity, delusions, hallucinations in nonvisual modalities, sleep disorders (particularly rapid eye movement [REM] sleep behavior disorder), and depression. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5088.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)</strong> – PSP is an uncommon parkinsonian syndrome that can mimic PD in its early phase. PSP has several distinct clinical phenotypes. With the most common "classic" phenotype of PSP, known as the Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome, the typical initial feature is a disturbance of gait resulting in falls. Supranuclear vertical ophthalmoparesis or ophthalmoplegia is the hallmark of PSP. Dysarthria, dysphagia, rigidity, frontal cognitive abnormalities, and sleep disturbances are additional common clinical features of the Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome. The phenotype known as PSP-parkinsonism, which may be confused with idiopathic PD, is characterized by asymmetric onset of limb symptoms, tremor, and a moderate initial therapeutic response to levodopa. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14136.html" rel="external">"Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP): Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Multiple system atrophy (MSA)</strong> – MSA is the collective term that has replaced the outdated entities known as olivopontocerebellar atrophy, striatonigral degeneration, and Shy-Drager syndrome. MSA commonly presents with parkinsonism, but patients also have varying degrees of dysautonomia, cerebellar involvement, and pyramidal signs. Two main subtypes are described: MSA-P, in which the initial symptoms are of parkinsonism, and MSA-C, in which cerebellar ataxia is prominent. Autonomic dysfunction may be seen in both subtypes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The prominence of these manifestations along with symmetry of onset and poor response to levodopa suggests this diagnosis rather than PD. However, early in the course, some cases of MSA may resemble typical PD, including responsiveness to levodopa along with the presence of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia, only to evolve into the more typical profile of MSA later. Cognitive function in MSA tends to be relatively well preserved compared with PD and other parkinsonian syndromes, probably reflecting a lesser degree of cortical involvement. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4890.html" rel="external">"Multiple system atrophy: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) </strong>–<strong> </strong>CBD is a rare but usually distinctive form of parkinsonism. The classic description of CBD is that of a progressive asymmetric, often unilateral (at onset) movement disorder with symptoms initially affecting one limb, including various combinations of akinesia and extreme rigidity, dystonia, focal myoclonus, ideomotor apraxia, and alien limb phenomenon. Cognitive impairment is a common manifestation of CBD and may be a presenting feature, while the typical parkinsonian motor features may be absent in the early phase only to emerge later as the disease progresses. Important cognitive features of CBD include executive dysfunction, aphasia, apraxia, behavioral change, and visuospatial dysfunction, with relatively preserved episodic memory. The distinctive clinical phenotype and the lack of clear response to an adequate trial of levodopa are typical for CBD and help to distinguish it from PD. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14135.html" rel="external">"Corticobasal degeneration"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>After a disease duration of 10 or more years, the majority of patients will have developed many nonmotor symptoms (including cognitive decline, dementia and psychosis, autonomic failure, sleep-wake cycle dysregulation, as well as depression, pain, and sensory symptoms) for which there are very limited treatment options, and palliative care may play an important role [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H982115944"><span class="h1">ROLE OF PALLIATIVE CARE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Palliative care is an interdisciplinary medical specialty that focuses on preventing and relieving suffering and on supporting the best possible quality of life for patients and their families facing serious illness. Important aspects include the management of medical symptoms and psychosocial problems, advance care planning (ACP), and spiritual comfort [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>].</p><p>Interdisciplinary palliative care optimally involves a movement disorders specialist, a palliative care clinician or nurse, a social worker, a spiritual advisor, and services including physical and occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, and nutrition [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. As the care of the patient becomes more complex with disease progression, it is helpful to have a clear leader. An interdisciplinary team should define, if possible, a key contact, although a group contact may be more practical to ensure advice and support is always available [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. An integrated care model with a patient-centered perspective may be helpful in ensuring that there is a coordinated approach to care close to home, empowerment of the patient, case management, and specialist input as needed [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>The person with PD or a parkinsonian disorder will often depend on the support of family or professional caregivers. In turn, caregivers will need support to avoid burnout and to facilitate the needs of the patient.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1356693246"><span class="h2">Initiating palliative care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although PD and related parkinsonian conditions are chronic diseases with a relatively slow course, the principles of palliative care are appropriate throughout the disease progression. Optimally, patients with PD and associated diseases should receive palliative care according to their particular needs, whether physical, psychosocial, or spiritual. An expert consensus review suggests that palliative care should be integrated early in the disease trajectory [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Moreover, palliative care may be involved in an episodic way throughout the disease progression, with increased involvement at times of symptom or psychosocial need and reduced input at other times, but with continued monitoring to determine the need for community and medical services [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. This individualized approach may be the most appropriate way of maximizing care and quality of life for patients and families.</p><p>Palliative care needs may be present from the time of diagnosis, as the diagnosis of PD and related disorders has an immediate emotional impact and also heralds changes in quality of life, social role, financial standing, and caregiver burden that result from a chronic neurodegenerative condition [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Thus, although the four-stage paradigm of PD (see <a class="local">'Monitoring progression'</a> below) considers a fourth "palliative phase," it is important that palliative approaches are integrated earlier in the disease course to maximize benefit and patient autonomy in decision-making. (See <a class="local">'Advance care planning'</a> below.)</p><p>Evidence to support the feasibility and benefits of palliative care includes a randomized trial involving 210 patients with PD and related disorders and 175 caregivers, who were assessed to have moderate to high palliative care needs [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Compared with standard care, patients assigned to integrated outpatient palliative care administered by a neurologist, social worker, chaplain, and nurse, with guidance and selective involvement of a palliative medicine specialist, had improved quality-of-life scores and global symptom burden, greater completion of advance directives, and lower caregiver burden by 12 months. These benefits appeared to be greater for people with greater palliative care needs. Retention in the intervention was high, with more than 80 percent of patients completing all planned visits.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2834173182"><span class="h2">Advance care planning</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Advance care planning (ACP) is an ongoing process in which patients, their families, and their health care providers reflect on the patient's goals, values, and beliefs; discuss how they should inform current and future medical care; and, ultimately, use this information to accurately document the patients' future health care choices. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/86248.html" rel="external">"Advance care planning and advance directives"</a>.)</p><p>ACP should not be seen as a one-time event. Rather, care plans should be revisited over time to ensure they still reflect the wishes of the person with PD. This may be particularly important when ACP is initiated early, as anticipating the wishes of the future self may be especially challenging in PD [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>Patients with PD and other parkinsonian disorders may face increasing problems with communication due to impaired speech, bradykinesia, apathy, and cognitive change. ACP allows the patient to express views on the goals of care, future treatments, intensive care unit interventions, resuscitation status, the place of care, the place of death (eg, home, hospice, or hospital), their will, and funeral plans while the person is able to do so (ie, as they can communicate clearly and have full capacity) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. These wishes can be incorporated into an advance directive to guide health care decision-making when capacity is lost. They may also wish to appoint a surrogate decision maker, who would be able to make decisions on their behalf if they are no longer able to do so. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/86248.html" rel="external">"Advance care planning and advance directives"</a>.)</p><p>Patients with PD and their caregivers have varied perspectives, preferences, and barriers that influence engagement with ACP [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. As part of the process, clinicians should inform patients about the best estimate of their prognosis (considering that there is a large element of individual variability in the natural history) and treatment options, and help them formulate treatment decisions while incorporating patient preferences and values. Some patients with progressive neurologic disease are reluctant to discuss the future and their wishes [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. However, in a survey sent to 585 patients with PD there were 267 responses, and 94 percent of responders wanted to discuss prognosis and treatment information early and include their family in such discussions [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Approximately one-half wanted early discussion of ACP, while over 25 percent wanted early discussions about end-of-life care planning. Within a separate qualitative study, patients with PD and their partners expressed a desire for a comprehensive tool for future planning and suggested a "roadmap" approach as a guide to decision-making, with opportunities to discuss planning and prognosis when certain life changes occur [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Thus, discussion about the future and planning for deterioration and end of life is often acceptable to patients and families.</p><p>Early discussions of hospice as a care option that also include an acknowledgment of the serious and life-limiting nature of the patient's underlying disease can increase the likelihood of future hospice enrollment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2200.html" rel="external">"Hospice: Philosophy of care and appropriate utilization in the United States", section on 'Discussing hospice with patients and families/loved ones'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1117798131"><span class="h2">Monitoring progression</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Planning the care of patients with PD requires regular monitoring of the symptoms and disability, and several clinical rating scales may be employed to assess disease progression. As an example, the Hoehn and Yahr (HY) staging scale is a simple, commonly utilized method of capturing the symptom progression in PD [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. The original HY scale divides the typical pattern of PD progression into five stages:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage 1 – Only unilateral involvement, usually with minimal or no functional disability</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage 2 – Bilateral or midline involvement without impairment of balance</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage 3 – Bilateral disease: mild to moderate disability with impaired postural reflexes; physically independent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage 4 – Severely disabling disease; still able to walk or stand unassisted</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stage 5 – Confinement to bed or wheelchair unless aided</p><p></p><p>Progression through higher HY stages correlates with motor impairment and worsening quality of life [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].

Dyskinesia consists of various types of abnormal involuntary movements, which are due to the effects of levodopa. A number of strategies may be useful for patients with PD who develop motor fluctuations and dyskinesia. In general, these include adjusting the levodopa regimen and adding adjunct medication such as dopamine agonists, COMT inhibitors, or MAO B inhibitors. Adjusting dietary protein is appropriate for those in whom a careful history reveals that protein interference is a problem.

The hospice philosophy aims to help patients achieve comfort and quality of life and death with dignity. The care and treatment provided are based on the patient's and family's goals and values. The hospice model in the United States is one of interdisciplinary, comprehensive team care that addresses the physical, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects of the end-of-life experience. Hospice care can be provided in hospitals, nursing homes, hospice inpatient facilities, and the home. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2200.html" rel="external">"Hospice: Philosophy of care and appropriate utilization in the United States", section on 'The hospice model of care'</a>.)</p><p>Services provided by hospice include symptom control, nursing care and support at home, psychosocial and spiritual care, respite care, and bereavement care. A key component is symptom control in advanced illness. Patients at the end of life often experience a variety of symptoms, which may include pain, worsening parkinsonism, dyspnea, nausea, anorexia, fatigue, and mood disorders. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/86250.html" rel="external">"Care of patients with advanced dementia"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4284749577"><span class="h2">Pain management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Opioid analgesics are the mainstay of treatment for patients with moderate to severe pain in patients at the end of life. Nonopioid analgesics such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> (paracetamol) and the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be used for mild or moderate pain and can provide analgesia that is additive to that produced by opioids.</p><p>It is important to consider discomfort from undertreated motor symptoms, particularly when dopaminergic therapies have been altered in the terminal phase of illness. Terminal stiffness is not commonly reported, but reduced mobility in bed may increase pressure area discomfort, while the "off" state can be associated with nonmotor discomfort. For the small percentage of patients with advanced illness at the end of life who have refractory pain, palliative sedation is an option.

Levodopa and dopamine agonists should be tapered gradually over several weeks or more, when possible. Sudden withdrawal of levodopa or dopamine agonists is not advised because of the rare precipitation of the parkinsonism-hyperpyrexia syndrome, which presents with hyperthermia and rigidity like the neuroleptic malignant syndrome. In addition, abruptly stopping a dopamine agonist has been associated with the dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome, with symptoms that include anxiety, panic attacks, depression, sweating, nausea, pain, fatigue, dizziness, and drug craving.

However, if a treatable cause of dyspnea is found (eg, bronchospasm, pulmonary emboli, upper airway obstruction, pleural effusion), specific treatment of that process may be appropriate depending upon the invasiveness of the therapy and the patient's values and preferences. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14238.html" rel="external">"Assessment and management of dyspnea in palliative care", section on 'Symptom assessment'</a>.)</p><p>For patients who can tolerate them, nonpharmacologic interventions that may be of benefit for dyspnea include pulmonary rehabilitation (exercise training, breathing strategies such as pursed-lip breathing), ergonomics, and accommodation strategies, such as relaxation, modification of activity level, and use of a fan to blow air on the face. Chest wall and intrapulmonary percussive vibration and mechanical insufflation-exsufflation devices can be helpful for patients who have difficulty mobilizing secretions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14238.html" rel="external">"Assessment and management of dyspnea in palliative care", section on 'General measures for all patients'</a>.)</p><p>Oxygen can be used for short-term relief in patients who are hypoxemic at rest or with minimal exertion. However, oxygen has not been shown to relieve dyspnea in nonhypoxemic patients. The use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) in dyspneic patients at the end of life remains controversial because it generally requires initiation in hospital and may be life prolonging without necessarily improving quality of life. NPPV may be a reasonable choice for patients who otherwise require sedating doses of opioids to control dyspnea but wish to be as awake as possible, and for dying patients who wish to forestall death briefly for a specific goal. Before such treatment is initiated, the goals, timeframe for reevaluation, criteria for continuation, and plan for eventual withdrawal of NPPV should be discussed. For patients receiving palliative care who have distressing dyspnea, systemic opioids are the first-line agents. For patients with dyspnea that is refractory to opiates or accompanied by anxiety, benzodiazepines may be a useful adjunctive therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14238.html" rel="external">"Assessment and management of dyspnea in palliative care", section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p>For patients at the end of life with severe dyspnea that cannot be relieved with standard measures, the use of palliative sedation proportionate to relief of distress, including doses titrated to achieve unconsciousness if necessary, is an accepted strategy. Palliative sedation refers to use of nonopioid drugs, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9826" href="/z/d/drug information/9826.html" rel="external">propofol</a>, to control refractory symptoms (eg, pain, dyspnea, agitated delirium). The indications for palliative sedation and its implementation are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2199.html" rel="external">"Overview of managing common non-pain symptoms in palliative care", section on 'Palliative sedation'</a>.)</p><p>Any patient in the final stage of life may have problems clearing secretions and develop the "death rattle." These gurgling and crackling sounds that result from increased secretions can be distressing to the family. Increased airway secretions may interfere with a patient's ability to sleep, worsen dyspnea, precipitate uncomfortable coughing spells, and predispose to infections. In addition to reassuring the patient's family, proper positioning and encouraging the family to cleanse the mouth with sponge sticks can be helpful. Discontinuing nonessential intravenous fluids or enteral feedings combined with positioning the patient on his or her side helps move the secretions out of the airway. However, in some patients discontinuing fluids or enteral feeding may not be acceptable to the family/caregiver, or these maneuvers may not be helpful.

Many families and caregivers fear their loved one will starve or suffer dehydration towards the end of life. However, the restriction of food and fluids as swallowing becomes more difficult rarely leads to significant symptoms apart from a dry mouth. Good mouth care and sips of fluids can alleviate this problem. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/86293.html" rel="external">"Palliative care: Overview of mouth care at the end of life"</a>.)</p><p>Some nutrition and fluid may be continued if a patient has a gastrostomy, although the needs of the patient may be reduced. The use of infusions of fluid, either intravenously or subcutaneously, is debated, but there is little evidence that the continuation of clinically assisted hydration would prolong life or extend the dying process, or whether stopping hydration will hasten death [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. However, the presence of an infusion can be unpleasant for a patient and may lead to problems such as fluid overload, increased chest secretions, and bladder/vomiting issues. Intravenous hydration and enteral feeding should be stopped if there is evidence that it is not beneficial or is deleterious to the patient. The management of these potential problems is intricately related to a patient's advance directive regarding what measures, if any, should be implemented should these circumstances materialize.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H201753423"><span class="h2">Place of death</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most people express the wish to die in familiar surroundings, such as at home or at the nursing home where they live [<a href="#rid49">49</a>].

Specific measures that may provide caregiver relief include providing day care programs for patients that allow the caregivers to socialize and meet their own needs, engaging multiple family members to assist in patient care, offering respite care, and ensuring that patients sleep well. (See <a class="local">'Caregiver burden'</a> above and <a class="local">'Caregiver support'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Final stages of disease</strong> – Disease progression in PD is variable, with few good predictors. Atypical parkinsonian disorders generally progress more rapidly than PD, but as with PD, the lifespan of individual patients is difficult to predict. However, certain events may correlate with the final stages of disease and trigger a hospice referral, including (see <a class="local">'Final stages of disease'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Swallowing problems</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Recurring infection</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Marked decline in functional status</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>First episode of aspiration pneumonia</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Cognitive difficulties</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Weight loss</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Significant complex symptoms</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hospice care</strong> – Hospice provides medical care and support services to a patient with a terminal illness where the focus is on symptom control and quality of life rather than prolonging life. Patients at the end of life often experience a variety of symptoms, which may include pain, worsening parkinsonism, dyspnea, nausea, anorexia, fatigue, and mood disorders.
