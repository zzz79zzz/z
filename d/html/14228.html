         Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has the potential to cure malignant (eg, leukemias, lymphomas) and nonmalignant disorders (eg, hemoglobinopathies). However, cure of the underlying disease by HCT is not necessarily associated with full restoration of health. Transplantation may be associated with life-long morbidity and survivors require monitoring for relapse of the underlying disease, management of transplantation-associated complications, and general medical care and health maintenance.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will discuss the long-term care of the adult survivor of autologous or allogeneic HCT, focusing on issues that require attention from approximately one year after transplantation.

         Long-term care of the transplant survivor can be provided in a variety of clinical settings. Regardless of the setting, we suggest use of a survivorship care plan (SCP) as an effective method to define responsibilities, facilitate communication, coordinate care, and enhance patient self-management, adherence to treatment recommendations, and shared decision making. Cancer SCPs are described in more detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/17020.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Care setting and team
         </strong>
         – Care is generally provided by the transplant team for at least 6 to 12 months after HCT. Although institutional practices vary, many transplant centers "discharge" patients after a year of transplantation to the care of the referring hematologist/oncologist, primary care clinician, or other community provider. In some settings, care is provided through a multispecialty clinic with expertise in the needs of the long-term survivor of HCT.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Responsibilities for follow-up must be clearly defined and effective communication is important to ensure that findings are reported to both the transplant team and other medical providers [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Adverse events should be reported to the transplant center, as this may inform long-term follow-up plans. Optimal management of transplant complications may require access to various medical specialties (eg, cardiology, pulmonary, endocrinology, nephrology), oral medicine (eg, dentist, otolaryngology), eye care (eg, ophthalmology), nutrition, physical medicine, cognitive and psychological services, and others.

         <strong>
          Survivorship care plan
         </strong>
         – A comprehensive SCP should be developed by the transplant team and shared with the patient, referring hematology/oncology specialist, primary care provider, and other caregivers. The SCP should be individualized according to age, gender, and comorbid medical conditions and it should include a summary of prior treatments and details of the transplant (eg, type of donor, graft, conditioning regimen, transplant course, early complications, GVHD, and use of corticosteroids). It should detail a schedule and protocol for follow-up care; emphasize prevention, education, and self-care; and define ongoing responsibilities of the caregivers and the patient [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. Further discussion of SCPs for patients with cancer is provided separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/17020.html" rel="external">
          "Assuring quality of care for cancer survivors: The survivorship care plan"

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Use of a transplant SCP has been associated with improved patient-reported outcomes and may aid coordination of care, shared decision making, self-management, and adherence to treatment recommendations. In a multicenter trial, 458 adults who were relapse-free one to five years after transplantation were randomly assigned to receive an individualized SCP versus usual care [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Six months after receiving the SCP, compared to usual care, use of an SCP was associated with lower treatment-related distress and improved mental health quality of life.

          Health maintenance

         – Health maintenance in the transplant survivor includes age- and gender-appropriate health screening for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, cancers, and mental health; surveillance for second cancers; encouragement of healthy behaviors; and management of psychosocial distress. Screening should recognize that transplant survivors are at higher risk for some of these conditions because of the transplant process (eg, increased risk for osteoporosis in young survivors with a history of chronic steroid use).

         The schedule and protocol for follow-up should be individualized and will vary according to the type of transplantation, prior treatments, age, gender, and medical comorbidities. Good medical judgment should be applied and plans may require modification based on the care setting and available resources. Development of a survivorship care plan (SCP) to coordinate care and facilitate shared decision making, adherence to treatment recommendations, and patient engagement and self-management is discussed above. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Coordination of care'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         There is no consensus regarding an optimal schedule and protocol for follow-up. No randomized or controlled trials have directly addressed the schedule and protocol for follow-up, and most suggestions are based on expert opinion and retrospective studies.
        </p>
        <p>
         Among the factors that we consider in developing a follow-up care plan are:

         Management of cGVHD, including treatment with immunosuppressive agents, is generally directed by the HCT team. With ongoing cGVHD, or for patients who continue on long-term immunosuppressant use, long-term follow-up care and cGVHD are often linked and provided at the transplant center. (See

          Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)
         </strong>
         can cure malignant and nonmalignant disorders, but cure of the underlying disease is not necessarily associated with full restoration of health. HCT may be associated with life-long morbidity and survivors require monitoring for relapse of the underlying disease, management of potential transplantation-associated complications, and general medical care.

          Goals of care
         </strong>
         – The goals of care for the HCT survivor are to monitor, prevent, and manage transplant-associated complications; monitor for recurrence of the underlying disease; and integrate survivorship care with age-appropriate health maintenance. (See

          Survivorship care plan
         </strong>
         – Long-term care of the transplant survivor may be provided in a variety of clinical settings. A comprehensive survivorship care plan (SCP) should be developed by the HCT team and shared with the patient, referring hematology/oncology specialist, primary care provider, and other caregivers to clearly define responsibilities and communicate regularly regarding care.
