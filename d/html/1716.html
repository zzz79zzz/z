This approach can minimize the risk of drug-drug interactions, while at the same time prevent both discontinuation and depressive symptoms that may occur from abrupt drug withdrawal. In a cross-taper, the dose of the current antidepressant is gradually reduced to zero, while simultaneously the new antidepressant is started and titrated up to the therapeutic range. Cross-tapering typically occurs over one or two weeks, but for patients who have previously demonstrated sensitivity to side effects or discontinuation symptoms, cross-tapering is extended over three to four weeks. In tapering and discontinuing the current medication, clinicians can reduce the dose by the same number of milligrams (amount) each time the dose is decreased, or by the same percent (eg, 50 percent) each time. In titrating up the new medication, one generally increases the dose by the same amount each time the dose is increased. Cross-tapering is consistent with multiple treatment guidelines [<a href="#rid3">3-7</a>].</p><p>However, cross-tapering is contraindicated if patients are switched to or from a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). (See <a class="local">'Switching to or from MAOIs'</a> below.)</p><p>In certain situations, another alternative to cross-tapering is directly (immediately) switching from one antidepressant to another. In a direct switch, the current antidepressant is abruptly stopped and the new drug is started the next day at the equivalent dose  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115754" href="/d/graphic/115754.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53818" href="/d/graphic/53818.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) (see <a class="local">'Dose equivalents'</a> below). It may be appropriate to directly switch between antidepressants that share pharmacodynamic profiles, including antidepressants within the same drug class, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or antidepressants in similar classes, such as SSRIs and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Direct switches may also be reasonable if the antidepressant to be discontinued has been used for a relatively short period of time (eg, less than one or two weeks).</p><p>Switching antidepressants may also involve abruptly discontinuing the current antidepressant if it causes a severe adverse reaction. We generally wait a few days (eg, two to three) before starting the new antidepressant.</p><p>When switching antidepressants, discontinuation symptoms that occur as a result of stopping the current drug may be mistaken as adverse side effects of the new drug that is started. Discontinuation symptoms are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/105323.html" rel="external">"Discontinuing antidepressant medications in adults", section on 'Discontinuation syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H207718"><span class="h2">Specific switches</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Each section below describes switches between antidepressant classes and aspects that may vary from the standard approach of cross-tapering. The specific antidepressants that constitute each drug class are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53818" href="/d/graphic/53818.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), and general information about cross-tapering is discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See <a class="local">'Standard approach and alternatives'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h3">Between SSRIs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Directly (immediately) switching to a new SSRI at the equivalent dose of the current SSRI is typically well-tolerated  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115754" href="/d/graphic/115754.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53818" href="/d/graphic/53818.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Nevertheless, starting the new SSRI at a lower dose is a reasonable alternative because patients occasionally have idiosyncratic side effects to particular SSRIs. Switching between SSRIs is generally the simplest antidepressant switch because SSRIs overlap in their mechanism of action, and the new SSRI usually prevents discontinuation symptoms that may otherwise occur when the current SSRI is stopped. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/105323.html" rel="external">"Discontinuing antidepressant medications in adults", section on 'Discontinuation syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>In particular, we suggest an immediate switch from <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8465" href="/d/drug information/8465.html" rel="external">fluoxetine</a> to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8874" href="/d/drug information/8874.html" rel="external">citalopram</a> rather than a cross-taper, and that the citalopram dose should be limited to a maximum of 20 mg/day until fluoxetine is completely cleared [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Fluoxetine persists in the system for up to five weeks due to its long half-life. This approach is suggested because fluoxetine moderately inhibits the hepatic enzyme CYP2C19, which metabolizes citalopram; CYP2C19 inhibition can thus increase citalopram concentrations and possibly increase the risk for toxicities such as QT prolongation. </p><p>Additional information about administering SSRIs is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14675.html" rel="external">"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">SSRI to SNRI</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Switching directly (immediately) from most SSRIs to the equivalent dose of an SNRI  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115754" href="/d/graphic/115754.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53818" href="/d/graphic/53818.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) is typically well-tolerated because SSRIs and SNRIs both enhance serotonergic neurotransmission [<a href="#rid9">9,11,12</a>]. However, if patients switch from a high dose of an SSRI, cross-tapering is preferable [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. We generally taper the SSRI by the same amount for each dose decrease; at the same time, we titrate up the SNRI by the same amount for each dose increase. As an example, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9886" href="/d/drug information/9886.html" rel="external">sertraline</a> 200 mg/day is decreased by 50 mg/day, every two to seven days; concurrently, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10042" href="/d/drug information/10042.html" rel="external">venlafaxine</a> extended release is started at 37.5 mg/day and after four to seven days is titrated up to 75 mg/day. Thereafter, the dose of venlafaxine extended release is increased every two to four weeks by increments of 75 mg per day, depending upon response and tolerability. In clinically urgent situations such as inpatient treatment, dose increases can occur as quickly as every two to four days if tolerated. The usual target dose is 75 to 225 mg/day; however, doses up to 375 mg/can be used.</p><p>Additional information about cross-tapering drugs and administering <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10042" href="/d/drug information/10042.html" rel="external">venlafaxine</a> is discussed separately.

Fluoxetine and paroxetine strongly inhibit the hepatic enzyme CYP2D6, which metabolizes duloxetine and venlafaxine; inhibition of the enzyme thus increases the SNRI serum concentrations. In addition, inhibition of CYP2D6 may affect the efficacy of venlafaxine, which is a prodrug that is converted to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8944" href="/d/drug information/8944.html" rel="external">desvenlafaxine</a> by 2D6.</p><p>Inhibition of CYP2D6 is present to some degree until the SSRI is completely cleared; most SSRIs are cleared in approximately five days, but <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8465" href="/d/drug information/8465.html" rel="external">fluoxetine</a> persists in the system for up to five weeks due to its long half-life.

For patients who remain unresponsive after two to four weeks, the dose is increased to 450 mg daily. In clinically urgent situations such as inpatient treatment, each dose increase can occur after three days. The maximum single dose in the United States is 450 mg and in Europe is 300 mg per day.</p><p>Additional information about cross-tapering drugs and administering <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9171" href="/d/drug information/9171.html" rel="external">bupropion</a> is discussed separately.

Tricyclics should be started at low doses when cross-tapering them with an SSRI, particularly with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8465" href="/d/drug information/8465.html" rel="external">fluoxetine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8474" href="/d/drug information/8474.html" rel="external">fluvoxamine</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9743" href="/d/drug information/9743.html" rel="external">paroxetine</a> [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Fluoxetine and paroxetine strongly inhibit the hepatic enzyme CYP2D6, and fluvoxamine potently inhibits CYP1A2. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of many tricyclics and inhibition increases tricyclic serum concentrations (several-fold higher in some cases), which can result in toxicity. Tricyclic serum levels can be checked during cross-tapering for added safety, but this is not standard practice.</p><p>Inhibition of CYP2D6 is present to some degree until the SSRI is completely cleared; most SSRIs are cleared in approximately five days, but <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8465" href="/d/drug information/8465.html" rel="external">fluoxetine</a> persists in the system for up to five weeks due to its long half-life.
