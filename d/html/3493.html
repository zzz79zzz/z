         Cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), such as cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), are increasingly used in patients with heart failure (HF) and at risk for HF. The impact of CIEDs on the incidence and progression of HF is complex and depends upon both the nature of the device (eg, ICD and/or single chamber, dual chamber, or biventricular pacemaker), and device programming.
        </p>
        <p>
         The role and effects of cardiac implantable electronic devices in patients with HF will be reviewed here. Indications for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), ICD, permanent pacemakers, and the various modes of cardiac pacing are discussed separately. (See

         In patients with HF (or at risk for HF due to systolic dysfunction), pacing that may worsen HF is avoided while CIEDs likely to provide clinical benefit are prescribed. While right ventricular (RV) pacing can exacerbate or precipitate HF in patients with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, evidence-based device therapy (including cardiac resynchronization therapy [CRT] and ICDs) improves clinical outcomes in selected patients with HF and/or LV systolic dysfunction. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical effects of pacing'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Our approach is in general agreement with the 2022 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Failure Society of America (ACC/AHA/HFSA) guidelines on the management of HF [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         Indications for CRT with biventricular pacing for patients in sinus rhythm or with atrial fibrillation are presented separately. These devices are appropriate for selected HF patients with systolic dysfunction and ventricular dyssynchrony. (See

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         CRT is performed with a pacemaker that simultaneously paces the right and left ventricles (biventricular pacemaker). CRT can improve cardiac function, symptoms, and survival in selected patients with HF with LV systolic dysfunction (particularly those with LV ejection fraction [LVEF] ≤35 percent, very wide QRS, and left bundle branch block). In addition, CRT can improve outcomes in selected patients with LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF ≤35 percent) who require a pacemaker with anticipated requirement for significant (&gt;40 percent) ventricular pacing (thus avoiding the detrimental effects of isolated RV pacing).

If high-grade AV block develops, the device will switch modes to dual-chamber pacing. These devices are appropriate for patients with first- or second-degree AV block, for whom they can substantially reduce the frequency of ventricular pacing. (See

         Standard RV pacing causes the RV to contract before the LV (interventricular dyssynchrony). In addition, RV pacing simulates the effect of left bundle branch block, causing the septum to contract before the lateral wall (intraventricular dyssynchrony). Ventricular dyssynchrony can reduce cardiac efficiency. Additionally, asynchronous ventricular pacing can impede cardiac pump function by inducing asynchrony in atrial and ventricular contraction.

         Although it had been proposed that dual-chamber (right atrial and RV) pacing might be beneficial in patients with HF, a randomized trial (DAVID) and observational studies found that DDD (dual-chamber paced and sensed) pacing can exacerbate HF, likely due to the detrimental effect of RV pacing.
        </p>
        <p>
         The hypothesis that dual-chamber pacing might improve cardiac function in patients with HF was based upon the following observations [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Pacing permits more aggressive beta blocker therapy for HF, which may be limited by symptomatic bradycardia. Dual-chamber pacing allows optimization of the AV interval, thereby improving coordination between atria and ventricles, optimizing valve closure, and minimizing mitral regurgitation. In addition, atrial pacing has been reported to reduce the frequency of atrial fibrillation in some studies (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1044.html" rel="external">
          "The role of pacemakers in the prevention of atrial fibrillation"
         </a>
         ). A potential benefit of dual-chamber pacing was suggested in an initial uncontrolled study of 17 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy who had medically refractory HF and severe symptoms [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. These findings provided the rationale for the DAVID trial, which did not confirm any benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
         The DAVID trial studied dual-chamber (right atrial and RV) pacing in patients with HF with LV systolic dysfunction [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. The trial found that rate-responsive dual-chamber (DDDR) pacing increased HF admissions and mortality compared to ventricular demand pacing (VVI), likely due to the RV component of dual chamber pacing  (

         <a href="#rid8">
          8

         ]. The patients were randomly assigned to VVI pacing with a lower rate limit of 40 beats per minute (VVI-40) or to DDDR pacing with a lower rate limit of 70 beats per minute (DDDR-70). The frequency of RV pacing was substantially higher in the DDDR-70 compared to the VVI-40 group (60 versus 1 percent) due to a relatively short programmed AV interval (typically 180 ms) in the DDDR group. Thus, the trial effectively compared DDDR pacing with sinus rhythm.

         effect of DDDR-70 pacing. Survival free of the primary composite end point of death or hospitalization for HF was significantly lower in the DDDR-70 group (73 versus 84 percent in the VVI-40 group). There were nominally higher rates of both components of the primary end point in the DDDR-70 group: mortality (10.1 versus 6.4 percent) and HF hospitalization (22.6 versus 13.3 percent), but these differences were not statistically significant.

         In a post-hoc analysis, the detrimental effects of DDDR-70 pacing were more pronounced in patients with a baseline QRS ≥110 ms [

          10
         </a>
         ]. Patients with QRS prolongation were more likely than those with a normal QRS to have other markers of poor outcome (eg, worse systolic function and a history of HF). Thus, it is not clear if baseline conduction abnormalities themselves or associated cardiac abnormalities predisposed patients to the adverse consequences of RV pacing.

Regardless of pacing mode, patients with a higher cumulative proportion of ventricular pacing had significantly higher rates of subsequent HF hospitalization and atrial fibrillation.

The primary combined end point of time to HF hospitalization or death was similar in the two treatment groups, with overall incidence of 11.1, 16.9, and 24.6 percent at one, two, and three years, respectively. The incidence of atrial fibrillation, syncope, appropriate or inappropriate shocks, and quality-of-life measures were also similar.

         The INTRINSIC RV trial found that dual-chamber rate-responsive pacing with the AV Search Hysteresis algorithm to minimize ventricular pacing (DDDR AVSH at 60 to 130 beats per minute) produced similar outcomes as back-up ventricular (VVI at 40 beats per minute) pacing.

         ICDs are recommended for the primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in selected patients with ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. By reducing the incidence of arrhythmic death, ICDs may result in more patients surviving to advanced stages of heart failure (HF). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91077.html" rel="external">

         ICDs can influence the incidence and progression of HF by two mechanisms:

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Contemporary transvenous ICDs also function as cardiac pacemakers. As an example, the DAVID trial, discussed above, involved dual-chamber ICDs. Thus, the detrimental impact of RV pacing also applies to ICDs. Because many patients with an ICD do not have a standard indication for pacing, efforts to minimize ventricular pacing are particularly important in these patients. The programming and device selection options discussed above are also available in ICDs. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Role of pacing in heart failure'
         </a>

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         By aborting arrhythmic deaths, ICDs prolong survival in patients with substantial cardiac disease. Such patients may later progress to more advanced HF.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         This phenomenon was illustrated in a post-hoc analysis from the MADIT II trial [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. In this trial, 1218 patients with a prior myocardial infarction and an LVEF ≤30 percent were randomly assigned to ICD implantation or conventional medical therapy. The patients assigned to ICD therapy had significantly lower risks of death. At a mean follow-up of 20 months, patients assigned to ICD therapy were significantly more likely to be hospitalized for HF than those assigned to conventional therapy (23 versus 17 percent). Among patients assigned to ICD therapy, the incidence of HF was significantly greater after appropriate ICD therapy compared to before such therapy (23 versus 16 events per 100 person years). Both the incidence of initial HF admissions and the intensity of recurrent admissions increased after appropriate ICD therapies. In contrast, there was no difference in the incidence of HF after inappropriate device therapies.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         These data suggest that appropriate ICD therapies are more common in patients who have or will soon experience worsening HF. Thus, life-prolonging ICD therapies may transform SCD risk to subsequent HF risk, although short-term mortality is improved.

In patients with HF (or at risk for HF due to systolic dysfunction), right ventricular (RV) pacing can exacerbate or precipitate HF. In contrast, evidence-based device therapy (cardiac resynchronization therapy [CRT], conduction system pacing, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator [ICD] use) improves clinical outcomes in selected patients with HF and/or systolic dysfunction.

         Conduction system (His bundle or left bundle branch) pacing is another pacing option that can be used for resynchronization or to minimize the effects of isolated RV pacing. (See

         For patients who are not candidates for CRT (by biventricular pacing or conduction system pacing), RV pacing may be minimized using managed ventricular pacing or programming of standard devices. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pacing modes to limit RV pacing'
