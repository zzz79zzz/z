The purpose of diagnostic testing is to confirm that PH exists and identify the underlying cause so that appropriate treatment can be administered.</p><p>The clinical features, diagnostic evaluation, and diagnostic criteria for PH are reviewed here. Epidemiology, pathogenesis, treatment, and prognosis are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8247.html" rel="external">"The epidemiology and pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (Group 1)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8250.html" rel="external">"Treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (group 1) in adults: Pulmonary hypertension-specific therapy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/121912.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prognosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults (group 1)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1658649207"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGIES AND TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When evaluating patients with suspected PH, good working knowledge of the etiologies and classification is important. Patients with PH are classified into five groups based upon etiology and mechanism  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66348" href="/d/graphic/66348.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Patients in group 1 are considered to have pulmonary <strong>arterial</strong> (PA) hypertension (PAH), which has several causes (eg, inheritable causes, drugs, connective tissue disease), whereas patients in group 2 (due to left-sided heart disease), group 3 (due to chronic lung disorders and hypoxemia), group 4 (due to PA obstructions), and group 5 (due to unidentified mechanisms) are considered to have PH. When all five groups are discussed collectively, the term PH is used.</p><p>PH can also be classified as pre- or postcapillary PH. Precapillary PH is due to a primary elevation of pressure in the PA system alone (eg, PAH), while postcapillary PH is due to elevations of pressure in the pulmonary venous and pulmonary capillary systems (pulmonary venous hypertension; eg, group 2). In practice, some patients have mixed pre- and postcapillary features  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef105764" href="/d/graphic/105764.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17914458"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Symptoms and signs of PH are nonspecific [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Patients typically present with exertional dyspnea and fatigue that progresses over time until severe PH with overt right ventricular (RV) failure develops.</p><p>Patients with an underlying cause of PH may also have the signs and symptoms of the causative disorder (eg, connective tissue disease, heart failure, chronic lung disease [CLD]).</p><p>The diagnosis is often delayed because the presenting features of PH are frequently attributed incorrectly to age, deconditioning, or a coexisting or alternate medical condition. As a result, PH is often not suspected until symptoms become severe or serious. It has been estimated that more than 20 percent of patients have symptoms of PH for longer than two years before it is recognized [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. This is particularly prevalent among patients younger than 36 years and in those with coexisting medical conditions.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13634280"><span class="h2">Symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Common symptoms include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Dyspnea and fatigue</strong> – The most common initial symptoms of PH are exertional dyspnea, lethargy, and fatigue and are due to an inadequate increase in cardiac output during exercise [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Symptoms of RV failure</strong> – Symptoms of RV failure develop as PH progresses and include the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Exertional chest pain</strong> – Exertional chest pain (ie, angina) is usually due to subendocardial hypoperfusion caused by increased RV wall stress and myocardial oxygen demand. However, it is occasionally caused by compression of the left main coronary artery by an enlarged pulmonary artery (PA), particularly in patients with a PA trunk at least 40 mm in diameter [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Exertional syncope</strong> – Exertional syncope is an unusual symptom that is due to insufficient increase in cardiac output during activity or reflex bradycardia from mechanoreceptor activation in the RV.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Weight gain from edema</strong> – Peripheral edema is due to RV failure, increased right-sided filling cardiac pressures, and extracellular volume expansion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Anorexia and/or abdominal pain and swelling</strong> – Anorexia and/or abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant is due to passive hepatic congestion. The patient may also complain of increase in abdominal girth from ascites.</p><p></p><p>Uncommon symptoms include cough, hemoptysis, and hoarseness. The hoarseness is caused by compression of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve by a dilated main PA (Ortner syndrome) resulting in unilateral vocal cord paralysis. Palpitations from arrhythmias (eg, atrial fibrillation or flutter) are a rare presenting feature of PH.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13634274"><span class="h2">Examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with PH may develop the following physical signs:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial findings</strong> – The initial physical finding of PH is usually increased intensity of the pulmonic component of the second heart sound, which may become palpable as PH progresses. The second heart sound is narrowly split or single (ie, normal) in patients with <strong>preserved</strong> RV function. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1079.html" rel="external">"Auscultation of heart sounds"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1078.html" rel="external">"Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1081.html" rel="external">"Examination of the precordial pulsation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Signs of RV failure</strong> – As PH progresses the following signs of RV failure may be evident [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Jugular venous pressure (JVP) abnormalities – The JVP is typically elevated. Initially, a prominent "a" wave is seen, while a prominent "v" wave indicates significant tricuspid regurgitation and often severe RV failure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1076.html" rel="external">"Examination of the jugular venous pulse"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Right-sided auscultatory findings that are augmented with inspiration may be heard including:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>A right-sided third or fourth heart sound (ie, a gallop) in association with a left parasternal heave or a downward subxiphoid thrust.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Wide splitting of the second heart sound.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>A holosystolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation and, in more severe disease, a diastolic pulmonic regurgitation murmur.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hepatomegaly, a pulsatile or tender liver, peripheral edema, ascites, and pleural effusion (ie, signs of severe decompensated RV failure) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Splenomegaly is rare but may be seen in PAH due to schistosomiasis or portopulmonary hypertension.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1936163687"><span class="h2">Imaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While the chest radiograph may be normal in a few patients, it classically shows enlargement of the central pulmonary arteries with attenuation of the peripheral vessels, resulting in oligemic lung fields  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef118507" href="/d/graphic/118507.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). RV enlargement (diminished retrosternal space), right atrial dilatation (prominent right heart border), and pleural effusions may also be seen as PH progresses. Evidence of underlying CLD or heart failure may also be present.</p><p>Chest computed tomography (CT) may have findings similar to those seen on chest radiography (ie, signs of PH and/or underlying etiology) but are typically appreciated in greater detail on CT. The main PA/ascending aorta diameter ratio ≥1 is also suggestive of PH on CT [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Unless PH is due to venous thromboembolism, ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) imaging is usually normal or has reduced peripheral perfusion.</p><p>Among patients with inheritable pulmonary arterial hypertension, additional CT features have been described including neovascularity and perivascular halos [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>Imaging can help narrow the differential among the causes of PH [<a href="#rid13">13</a>], which is discussed separately. (See <a class="local">'Assess for chronic lung disease and hypoxia (group 3 PH)'</a> below and <a class="local">'Assess for pulmonary artery obstruction (group 4)'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1363399084"><span class="h2">Electrocardiography</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The electrocardiogram (ECG) may be normal in patients with PH who do not have RV strain. Signs of RV hypertrophy or strain include right-axis deviation, an R wave/S wave ratio greater than one in lead V1, incomplete or complete right bundle branch block, or increased P wave amplitude in lead II (P pulmonale) due to right atrial enlargement  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63181" href="/d/graphic/63181.html" rel="external">figure 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef118507" href="/d/graphic/118507.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Most ECG signs are specific but not sensitive for the detection of RV disease. ECG changes do not correlate with disease severity or prognosis [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4039912583"><span class="h2">Laboratories</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>PH in itself is not associated with specific diagnostic laboratory abnormalities, although the brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) values may be elevated due to RV wall stretch. Elevated BNP, however, can also be found in left ventricular failure and in chronic renal insufficiency.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3825142211"><span class="h1">INITIAL DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Since PH presents initially as exertional dyspnea, the differential diagnosis is wide. In many cases, clinical history and examination; pulmonary function tests; chest imaging including chest radiography, chest CT, and ventilation-perfusion scanning; and echocardiography can together help distinguish the likely etiology of dyspnea and/or confirm the clinical suspicion for PH. For example, a young patient with a history of allergies who has intermittent dyspnea following allergy exposure and no other supportive findings of PH is unlikely to have PH, while an older adult with a known risk factor (eg, connective tissue disease) and supportive signs of PH is more likely to have PH. The evaluation and differential diagnosis of dyspnea are described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1436.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with dyspnea"</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, in patients who present with symptoms and signs of right ventricular failure (eg, peripheral edema, exertional chest pain, exertional syncope, and right upper quadrant pain), the differential diagnosis becomes considerably narrower:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Left-sided heart failure – Left ventricular systolic and diastolic heart failure are well-known causes of peripheral edema, right upper quadrant pain due to hepatic congestion, and syncope due to arrhythmias or insufficient cardiac output. Exertional chest pain may also occur. Left-sided heart failure and PH can be distinguished via echocardiography and/or right and left heart catheterization (LHC). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3510.html" rel="external">"Heart failure: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis in adults"</a> and <a class="local">'Sufficient left heart disease (group 2 PH)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Coronary artery disease – Myocardial ischemia is the most common cause of exertional chest pain, and it can also cause ischemia-induced arrhythmias with exertional syncope. Coronary artery disease is identified by stress testing and/or LHC. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1534.html" rel="external">"Stress testing for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary heart disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Liver disease – Acute and chronic liver diseases cause peripheral edema, and the former can also cause right upper quadrant pain. Liver disease can be detected by liver function testing and right upper quadrant ultrasound. Liver biopsy is the gold standard, but it is seldom necessary. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1253.html" rel="external">"Cirrhosis in adults: Etiologies, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Budd-Chiari syndrome – Budd-Chiari syndrome refers to thrombosis of the hepatic veins and/or the intrahepatic or suprahepatic inferior vena cava. It causes peripheral edema due to venous outflow obstruction and right upper quadrant pain due to hepatic congestion. Budd-Chiari syndrome can be identified by Doppler ultrasonography, CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or venography. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3562.html" rel="external">"Budd-Chiari syndrome: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">INITIAL DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION (NONINVASIVE TESTING)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Diagnostic testing is indicated whenever PH is suspected. The purpose of the diagnostic testing is to confirm that PH exists, determine its severity, and identify its cause  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66348" href="/d/graphic/66348.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3081305324"><span class="h2">Suspecting pulmonary hypertension</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>PH should be suspected in patients with progressive dyspnea or unexplained dyspnea, fatigue, or syncope (see <a class="local">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above). Most patients present as an outpatient with subacute or chronic symptoms, while others who are at known risk of PH come to the attention of a clinician due to screening evaluations (see <a class="local">'Screening for pulmonary hypertension'</a> below); a few patients present acutely as inpatients.</p><p>In all cases, a detailed history evaluating the nature of their dyspnea should be performed (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1436.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with dyspnea"</a>). Patients should be questioned specifically about illicit drug use, ingestion of diet pills or toxins known to increase the risk of PH (eg, appetite suppressants, rapeseed oil, benfluorex, cocaine, some tyrosine kinase inhibitors), cigarette smoking, their occupation or hobbies, a family history of PH or early death, and a history of congenital heart disease. A history of symptoms consistent with or a known diagnosis of connective tissue diseases (CTDs), risks factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or liver disease, and a history of travel to regions endemic for schistosomiasis should also be sought. A detailed past medical history should be obtained to determine the presence or absence of chronic lung or heart disease, previous thromboembolism, sleep-disordered breathing, thyroid disorders, chronic renal failure, or metabolic disorders. The ECG should be examined closely for signs of right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy or strain and imaging reexamined for subtle signs of interstitial or chronic lung disease (CLD), developmental abnormalities, and PH.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2231337117"><span class="h2">Echocardiography</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once PH is suspected, the initial test of choice is transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), which then determines the sequence of subsequent testing. Importantly, patients with evidence of severe PH and/or patients with significant symptoms should be referred to a PH center for rapid evaluation. TTE evaluates the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The probability of PH using the tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV). TRV can also be used to estimate the pulmonary artery (PA) systolic pressure (ePASP). (See <a class="local">'Tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The assessment of RV size, wall thickness, and function  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80275" href="/d/graphic/80275.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Right ventricle overload and other signs of pulmonary hypertension'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The potential contribution of left-sided heart disease to PH (if PH is identified on TTE). (See <a class="local">'Sufficient left heart disease (group 2 PH)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>In general, experts use a combination of the TRV and ePASP together with echocardiographic findings suggestive of RV hypertrophy/strain when evaluating the probability of PH  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77640" href="/d/graphic/77640.html" rel="external">figure 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120360" href="/d/graphic/120360.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. PH is suggested echocardiographically when the TRV is ≥2.8 m.s<sup>-1</sup>; the ePASP exceeds 35 mmHg in younger adults or 40 mmHg in older adults; and/or when RV size, wall thickness, and function are abnormal, understanding that PH may still be present even in the absence of these findings. Although estimation of the ePASP is practical and still used by many experts, ePASP may poorly correlate with values obtained by right heart catheterization (RHC) [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>], which may, in part, be due to variability in the measurement of right atrial pressure (RAP), which is necessary for calculating ePASP (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83974.html" rel="external">"Echocardiographic assessment of the right heart", section on 'RA pressure'</a>). Thus, we and others support guidelines issued by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and endorsed by the 6<sup>th</sup> World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension (WSPH) [<a href="#rid1">1,19</a>] that propose use of the peak TRV together with echocardiographic findings of PH rather than ePASP to report the echocardiographic probability of PH. Regardless of whether the TRV or ePASP is used, these values should always be interpreted together with clinical suspicion and signs of RV dysfunction to facilitate the decision about proceeding with additional testing for PH.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2954503738"><span class="h3">Tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Tricuspid regurgitation is commonly encountered in patients with PH  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef80498" href="/d/graphic/80498.html" rel="external">movie 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef68814" href="/d/graphic/68814.html" rel="external">movie 2</a>) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].

For example, a clinical diagnosis is commonly made in patients with PH that is explained by significant left heart disease (LHD) or by chronic lung disease (CLD). In contrast, other patients require a hemodynamic diagnosis using right heart catheterization (RHC; eg, patients with suspected idiopathic pulmonary arterial [PA] hypertension [PAH]). Hemodynamically, a mean PA pressure (mPAP; supine and at rest) of &gt;20 mmHg [<a href="#rid40">40</a>] is now considered diagnostic of PH based upon data measuring mPAP in healthy individuals, which confirmed that an mPAP of 8 to 20 mmHg at rest is normal [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].

Similarly, patients in group 3 (PH due to CLD and/or hypoxia), patients in group 4 (eg, PH due to chronic thromboembolism [CTEPH]), and many patients in group 5 also have precapillary disease.

Another systematic review reported that the PA wedge pressure (PAWP) reaches 20 mmHg in adults &gt;40 years old and suggested that a threshold of at least 25 mmHg was an appropriate cutoff for "normal" PAWP during exercise [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]; these results need to be validated further before they can be used for the diagnosis of exercise-induced PH. Standardization of exercise protocols to provoke exercise-induced PH remains problematic, and the overall natural history and significance of the condition are unclear.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2328702428"><span class="h1">SCREENING FOR PULMONARY HYPERTENSION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Select high-risk groups are evaluated for PH using echocardiography.

As PH progresses, the signs and symptoms of right ventricular (RV) failure develop (eg, exertional chest pain or syncope, loud P2, elevated jugular venous pressure, right-sided murmurs, edema, right upper quadrant pain, ascites, and pleural effusion)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef118507" href="/d/graphic/118507.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The diagnosis is often delayed because the symptoms are frequently attributed incorrectly to age, deconditioning, or a coexisting or alternate medical condition. (See <a class="local">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong> – The differential diagnosis of early PH is wide because there are many causes of exertional dyspnea. However, once PH progresses to RV hypertrophy and failure, the differential diagnosis narrows and includes left-sided heart failure, coronary artery disease, liver disease, and Budd-Chiari syndrome. (See <a class="local">'Initial differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic evaluation</strong> – Once PH is suspected, the initial test of choice is transthoracic echocardiography  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120360" href="/d/graphic/120360.html" rel="external">table 3</a>), which then determines the sequence of subsequent testing. Importantly, patients with evidence of severe PH and/or patients with significant symptoms should be referred to a PH center for rapid evaluation. (See <a class="local">'Initial diagnostic evaluation (noninvasive testing)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Low suspicion for PH</strong> – When there is a low probability of PH on echocardiography and the clinical suspicion for PH is also low, evaluation should be directed toward alternative diagnoses. If the clinical suspicion for PH remains high despite the echocardiographic findings, the threshold for right heart catheterization (RHC) should be lower, especially when group 1 pulmonary arterial (PA) hypertension (PAH) is suspected. (See <a class="local">'Low probability of pulmonary hypertension on echocardiography'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Intermediate or high suspicion for PH with significant left heart disease (LHD) on echocardiography</strong> – When there is an intermediate or high suspicion for PH and enough LHD on the echocardiogram to explain the degree of estimated PH, RHC is not typically required. Assessing what constitutes LHD that is sufficient to explain PH is challenging, and many experts use a combination of clinical and echocardiographic features (in particular, left atrial [LA] dilation) as well as other noninvasive tests to make this assessment. (See <a class="local">'Sufficient left heart disease (group 2 PH)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>No or insufficient LHD on echocardiography</strong> – When there is no or insufficient LHD on echocardiography to explain PH, additional investigations targeted at other suspected etiologies are necessary (ie, group 1, 3, 4, and 5 PH). The sequence and extent of investigations vary among experts.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Common tests performed include pulmonary function testing, chest high-resolution CT, six-minute walk testing, ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scanning, and laboratory tests (eg, autoimmune serologies, HIV serology, and liver and thyroid function tests). Depending upon clinical suspicion or test results, additional tests that may be appropriate include overnight oximetry, testing for sleep-disordered breathing, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, stool and urine parasite testing, and coagulation profile tests. (See <a class="local">'Insufficient left heart disease'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Patients with significant lung dysfunction – For patients whose pulmonary dysfunction is severe enough to explain the degree of PH on echocardiography, RHC is not typically indicated. RHC is usually reserved for those in whom the severity of PH on echocardiography is not explained by the severity of their underlying chronic lung disease (CLD) or for those in whom an alternate or contributing etiology is suspected (eg, precapillary disease or LHD). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8262.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease and/or hypoxemia (group 3 pulmonary hypertension): Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnostic evaluation in adults", section on 'Patient selection for right heart catheterization'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Patients with suspected thromboembolic disease – For patients with PH on echocardiography who have clear evidence of chronic thromboembolic disease on V/Q scan (ie, chronic thromboembolic PH [CTEPH]), diagnostic RHC is not necessary, and the patient is referred to a CTEPH center where extensive evaluation that includes RHC with pulmonary angiography can be performed. For patients in whom PA obstruction is suspected, evaluation of the etiology is necessary (eg, further imaging), and while not always indicated, in some cases, RHC may be useful. (See <a class="local">'Assess for pulmonary artery obstruction (group 4)'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8254.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension", section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Others – For patients with PH on echocardiography who have insufficient LHD, CLD and/or hypoxia, or PA obstructions, RHC is typically performed, mostly to evaluate for PAH. (See <a class="local">'Assess for other etiologies (group 1 and 5)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>When to perform RHC</strong> – RHC is generally performed with the goal of confirming the diagnosis of PH, assessing the contribution of LHD, and estimating the severity of PH. Less frequently, RHC is indicated in those with congenital heart disease to assess complex hemodynamics for the selection of appropriate PH therapy. (See <a class="local">'Right heart catheterization'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – In many patients, the diagnosis of PH is made clinically using a constellation of clinical findings and noninvasive testing (eg, patients with mild PH that is explained by significant LHD or CLD). In contrast, other patients require a hemodynamic diagnosis using RHC (eg, patients with suspected idiopathic PAH). Hemodynamically, a mean PA pressure (mPAP; supine and at rest) &gt;20 mmHg is considered diagnostic of PH. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Classification</strong> – Clinical studies and additional information provided by RHC are necessary to then classify the patient into an appropriate PH category (groups 1 through 5)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66348" href="/d/graphic/66348.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Postdiagnostic testing and classification'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Group 1 – The diagnosis of PAH requires RHC that demonstrates mPAP &gt;20 mmHg at rest, pulmonary vascular resistance ≥2 Wood units, and a mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) &lt;15 mmHg. In addition, all other causes of PH should be absent (or mild). Once PAH is diagnosed, additional testing to investigate all of the etiologies associated with PAH should be performed (eg, connective tissue disease screen, HIV serology, liver function tests, genetic testing). (See <a class="local">'Group 1: Pulmonary arterial hypertension'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Group 2 – LHD-PH may be diagnosed clinically when there is sufficient LHD on echocardiography (with or without other confirmatory testing) to explain PH. Hemodynamically, an mPAP ≥20 mmHg, a PCWP ≥15 mmHg, and a normal or reduced cardiac output are consistent with LHD-PH. The presence of LA enlargement on echocardiography and an elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure on left heart catheterization are also useful confirmatory tests. All other causes of PH should also be reasonably ruled out. (See <a class="local">'Group 2: PH due to left heart disease'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/112486.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease (group 2 pulmonary hypertension) in adults", section on 'Diagnosis and evaluation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Group 3 – The diagnosis of PH due to CLD and/or hypoxemia is made by the demonstration of PH on RHC or echocardiogram and evidence of moderate to severe lung dysfunction and/or hypoxemia in the absence of other classes of PH. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8262.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease and/or hypoxemia (group 3 pulmonary hypertension): Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnostic evaluation in adults", section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a class="local">'Group 3: PH due to chronic lung disease and/or hypoxemia'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Group 4 – Group 4 PH can be diagnosed by echocardiography or RHC and supported by pulmonary imaging demonstrating the presence of thromboembolic or other occlusion of the proximal or distal pulmonary vasculature in the absence of other causes of PH. (See <a class="local">'Group 4: PH due to pulmonary artery obstructions'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8254.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Group 5 – Patients with unclear etiologies or mechanism have group 5 PH. Most patients are diagnosed hemodynamically and have supportive testing for underlying disorders that fall in this category.
