This topic will review the benefits, indications, and regimens for rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis.</p><p>Management of rabies exposures, including post-exposure prophylaxis, is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8303.html" rel="external">"Rabies immune globulin and vaccine", section on 'Post-exposure prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H951287263"><span class="h1">BENEFITS, HARMS, AND BARRIERS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Benefits</strong> – Rabies is almost uniformly fatal once illness develops but disease can be prevented through vaccination. Pre-exposure prophylaxis is thought to be effective at preventing rabies; this is particularly important for individuals who are at risk for unrecognized exposures and thus would not seek post-exposure prophylaxis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Pre-exposure prophylaxis does not eliminate the need for prophylaxis after a rabies exposure, but it eliminates the need for rabies immunoglobulin and decreases the recommended number of vaccine doses following an exposure [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Pre-exposure prophylaxis can be especially important in resource-limited settings where vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin may be unavailable and significant delays in administration can occur.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">There are no human studies evaluating the effectiveness of rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis in individuals with known or suspected exposure to rabies. Effectiveness is inferred based on two lines of evidence:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Vaccine studies show that rabies vaccines elicit neutralizing antibody responses at levels expected to protect against infection [<a href="#rid3">3-7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Regional data suggest lower rabies rates when pre-exposure prophylaxis is regularly administered. For example, in 2011, pre-exposure prophylaxis was administered in nearly 300 localities (13, 986 people) in the Amazon Region [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. In these areas, the number of rabies deaths dropped from 13 in 2010 and 20 in 2011 to zero child deaths and only two adult deaths (both had refused vaccination) in 2012.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Harms</strong> – Side effects of rabies vaccination (including rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis) are typically limited to localized transient pain at the site of injection. Modern rabies vaccines have been safely administered to persons of all ages, including pregnant people and immunocompromised persons. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8303.html" rel="external">"Rabies immune globulin and vaccine", section on 'Adverse reactions from rabies vaccine'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Barriers</strong> – Significant barriers to adherence to pre-exposure prophylaxis recommendation for at-risk individuals have limited its use. Identified barriers include high out-of-pocket costs, uncertainty about who qualifies for prophylaxis, unavailability in high-risk areas, follow-up vaccines and titers, and inability of high-risk travelers to complete the full course prior to departure [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In 2022, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued new recommendations for pre-exposure prophylaxis intended to address barriers while still maintaining maximal effectiveness of rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H490454861"><span class="h1">DETERMINING WHICH PATIENTS QUALIFY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In general, rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis is indicated for individuals who have elevated risk of exposure to rabies, and patients are stratified based on their level of risk to determine whether they qualify.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4126400051"><span class="h2">Identifying risk factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A thorough history is necessary to identify patients' risk factors for rabies exposure. Primary risk factors usually involve an occupational risk (eg, veterinarian, worker in a rabies laboratory), a recreational risk (eg, spelunking), or travel to a rabies enzootic area where post-exposure prophylaxis may not be readily available. While obtaining histories, providers should delve into details of patients' activities, the likelihood that patients would notice an exposure should one occur, and the length of time during which patients' risk will persist. Patients should specifically be asked whether they anticipate the risk for exposure to persist (either continuously or intermittently) for more than three years. (See <a class="local">'Risk-stratification and indications'</a> below.)</p><p>Exposures that are unrecognized are the riskiest exposures because they are not noticed by the exposed person and, consequently, post-exposure prophylaxis is never sought. For example, although this has not been reported in the United States, a person performing a necropsy on a rabid animal or a field-study of bats could theoretically receive a small scratch to the skin without noticing the injury and subsequently develop rabies.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1183255197"><span class="h2">Risk-stratification and indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once risk factors for exposure to rabies have been identified, patients should be stratified into one of five levels of risk created by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The categories are based on an individual's risk of being exposed, likelihood of noticing the exposure, and duration of time at risk [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Identifying risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients whose risk category falls into Levels 1 through 4 qualify for a primary vaccine series, and those in Levels 1 through 3 also qualify for post-vaccination boosters and/or titers (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61388" href="/d/graphic/61388.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Regimen details are described below. (See <a class="local">'Vaccination schedule (regimens)'</a> below.)</p><p>The CDC's five risk categories for adults and children are as follows, and details are provided in the table (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61388" href="/d/graphic/61388.html" rel="external">table 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Level 1</strong> – Elevated risk for unrecognized or recognized high-risk exposures (eg, persons who work with live rabies virus in a laboratory or vaccine production facility)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Level 2</strong> – Elevated risk for recognized exposures but exposures could be unrecognized (eg, persons who perform animal necroscopies or have frequent contact with or high-density exposures to bats, including spelunkers who enter high-density bat caves)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Level 3</strong> – Elevated risk for exposures that are nearly always recognized, and the duration at risk extends beyond three years after the primary vaccine series (eg, veterinarians or other individuals whose occupation or recreational activities regularly involve contact with potentially rabid animals, including spelunkers who do not enter high-density bat caves; frequent or long-term travelers whose activities increase risk of exposure to animals in areas where rabies [especially canine] is enzootic and post-exposure prophylaxis is not readily available)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Level 4</strong> – Elevated risk for recognized exposures within three years of the primary vaccine series (eg, same as Level 3 but duration at risk lasts less than three years)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Level 5</strong> – Low risk of exposure (eg, typical person living in the United States)</p><p></p><p>Travelers to rabies enzootic regions of the world (including most of Asia and Africa) usually fall into Levels 3 or 4, depending on whether travel plans extend three or more years beyond the start of their vaccine series (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61388" href="/d/graphic/61388.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8322.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rabies", section on 'Geographic distribution'</a>). Specific country-level recommendations for pre-travel rabies vaccination is available on the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwwwnc.cdc.gov%2Ftravel%2Fdestinations%2Flist&amp;token=GD2t7CoYRGdYUJPL1R54LDVYIBdeEa8T1ShZ3kq9xWgdNByK0GeH%2FDeJh53%2FF%2Fu9%2BTM9VZTze8IlW79l1tnlcQ%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=139471" target="_blank">CDC Travelers' Health website</a>. If pre-exposure prophylaxis is administered to travelers, every effort should be made to complete the series prior to travel. Additionally, all travelers to rabies enzootic regions should receive specific pre-travel counseling about avoidance and management of exposures during travel. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8328.html" rel="external">"Indications for post-exposure rabies prophylaxis", section on 'Pretravel counseling'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8303.html" rel="external">"Rabies immune globulin and vaccine", section on 'Wound care'</a>.)</p><p>Children should be closely supervised when traveling, since they are more likely to inadvertently provoke animals and be injured; they are also less likely to report exposures [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. If a child is going to be in a canine-rabies enzootic area for an extended period or where access to post-exposure prophylaxis is limited, the child may benefit from pre-exposure prophylaxis even if planned activities do not specifically increase the risk of exposure [<a href="#rid11">11-13</a>].

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8303.html" rel="external">"Rabies immune globulin and vaccine", section on 'Rabies vaccines'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4256214556"><span class="h1">VACCINATION SCHEDULE (REGIMENS)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All patients receive a primary vaccination series, and some receive follow-up serology or boosters (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61388" href="/d/graphic/61388.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74185" href="/d/graphic/74185.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3147694570"><span class="h2">Regimens for primary vaccination series</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Suggested regimens for pre-exposure prophylaxis vary depending on the jurisdiction where the vaccines will be provided. Healthcare providers in the United States should follow recommendations from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Outside of the United States, others may follow the World Health Organization (WHO) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>] or local guidelines.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations</strong> – The primary series for pre-exposure prophylaxis recommended in the United States is two doses of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9850" href="/d/drug information/9850.html" rel="external">rabies vaccine</a> administered intramuscularly (IM): the first dose is on day 0 and the second dose is on day 7 [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In select cases, follow-up titers and/or boosters are recommended. The dosing schedule is described in the tables (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61388" href="/d/graphic/61388.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74185" href="/d/graphic/74185.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The two-dose recommendation was officially endorsed by the CDC in 2022 based on recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Rabies Work Group [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Prior to 2022, CDC recommended a three-dose series for pre-exposure prophylaxis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A systematic review demonstrated that two-dose and three-dose vaccine series result in comparable levels of neutralizing antibodies within 14 to 28 days of completion of the series [<a href="#rid2">2,4</a>]. After a two-dose series, anamnestic responses (rises in titers from undetectable to adequate levels after an exposure) last for at least three years [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. These findings do not vary between the two types of cell-culture vaccine preparations used in the United States [<a href="#rid5">5,14</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations</strong> – The World Health Organization (WHO) also recommends the use of a two-dose pre-exposure prophylaxis series administered on day 0 and day 7 [<a href="#rid1">1,15</a>]. Per WHO recommendations, one IM dose can be administered on each day (refer to the vaccine label for specific dosing recommendations) or two intradermal doses can be administered on each day (ie, two 0.1 mL doses intradermally in separate anatomic sites on day 0 and on day 7).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Intradermal two-dose regimens for pre-exposure prophylaxis have been shown to be immunogenic [<a href="#rid3">3,6</a>]. As an example, in a study of 500 healthy volunteers, a regimen of two doses administered intradermally twice over the course of one week (on days 0 and 7) appeared to be as immunogenic as three individual doses administered intradermally over the course of one month (on days 0, 7, and 28) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3914336193"><span class="h2">Post-vaccination titers and boosters</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For certain patients, the CDC recommends post-vaccination serologic testing to determine whether a booster should be given [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. When serology reveals a titer &lt;0.5 international units [IU]/mL, a booster is typically recommended (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61388" href="/d/graphic/61388.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74185" href="/d/graphic/74185.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Groups who qualify for post-vaccination serology and boosters are detailed below. (See <a class="local">'Ongoing risk of exposure'</a> below and <a class="local">'Immunocompromised patients'</a> below and <a class="local">'Concomitant chloroquine administration'</a> below.)</p><p>Serologic testing should be performed using the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT), and a titer ≥0.5 IU/mL is felt to represent adequate response to vaccination [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. In 2022, the CDC endorsed this cut-off which matches the WHO cut-off. The CDC's new cut-off is a more cautious value than the previous one, although no infections occurred among vaccinated individuals using the prior lower cut-off. Commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests for rabies antibody do not specifically detect neutralizing antibodies and should not be used.</p><p>Serologic testing is recommended for patients with ongoing risk of exposure, an immunocompromising condition, or treatment with concomitant <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9247" href="/d/drug information/9247.html" rel="external">chloroquine</a>.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2550560676"><span class="h3">Ongoing risk of exposure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Because the immunogenicity of a two-dose series has not been thoroughly evaluated beyond three years, patients who are expected to be exposed for longer than three years typically receive follow-up titers or a booster, the frequency of which depends on their level of risk. (See <a class="local">'Risk-stratification and indications'</a> above.)</p><p>Specifically, individuals who have ongoing risk of exposure (ie, Levels 1 and 2) are recommended to have periodic serologic testing after completion of the primary vaccine series. If the titer is low (&lt;0.5 IU/mL), a booster is recommended. Patients who have a Level 3 risk should have either a one-time serologic test or an appropriately timed booster. Following a booster, confirmatory serologic testing is not recommended.</p><p>Specific timing and intervals for serologic testing are outlined in the tables (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61388" href="/d/graphic/61388.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74185" href="/d/graphic/74185.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3033440237"><span class="h3">Immunocompromised patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If pre-exposure prophylaxis is provided to an immunocompromised individual, follow-up titers are recommended and should be performed no sooner than one week (preferably two to four weeks) after completing the primary vaccine series and after every booster (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61388" href="/d/graphic/61388.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). If a follow-up titer is low (&lt;0.5 IU/mL), a booster should be given and another follow-up titer should be performed. If titers remain inadequate after two sequential boosters, consultation with local or <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Frabies%2Fresources%2Fcontacts.html&amp;token=R4Uiw8%2FbmPVaqNHRDqpXLP34avy7K48jfK0PvxCnCh3r9Biz1uu56%2BYn0IY7HtcwZl6JErfqwi8KMF%2FrvK5VwQ%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=139471" target="_blank">state public health authorities</a> is suggested and patients should be advised to avoid high-risk activity until immunogenicity can be confirmed (elsewhere, local experts or public health authorities can be consulted).</p><p>Immunocompromised patients, including those on disease-modifying agents for autoimmune diseases, should ideally avoid activities that put them at risk for exposure to rabies.
