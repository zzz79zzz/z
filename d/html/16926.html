          1,2

         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3

         Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) of lung allografts is believed to be mediated by donor specific antibodies (DSA) against human leukocyte antigens (HLA) and other donor antigens. These antibodies may have been present in the recipient prior to transplant, although most appear to develop after transplantation.

         Hyperacute rejection is a fulminant form of rejection occurring within minutes or hours of reperfusion of the allograft and is caused by preformed DSA [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Hyperacute rejection has become a rare form of rejection because screening for HLA antibodies has become more sensitive and more specific, thereby preventing HLA incompatible transplantation.

         Acute AMR is thought to be a consequence of DSA that were present at a low titer prior to or developed after transplantation; DSA can cause clinical disease in the transplanted lung in the weeks to months following implantation. However, the development of DSA is not necessarily specific for AMR, as DSA are also associated with the development of acute cellular rejection and an increased risk of bronchiolitis obliterans [

         Acute cellular rejection is the predominant type of acute lung transplant rejection and is mediated by T lymphocyte recognition of foreign major histocompatibility complexes (MHC), also known as HLA [

         Hyperacute rejection has become rare in lung transplantation due to the use of virtual crossmatches prior to transplantation [

         The exact frequency of acute antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is more difficult to ascertain, as exact diagnostic criteria have not been agreed upon. In a single center series, acute antibody-mediated rejection was detected in 21 (4 percent) of 501 lung transplant recipients [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. The median time of onset was 258 days (mean 364 +/- 402 days) after transplantation. Patients developing AMR tended to be slightly younger than those without; age 42 (+/- 16.2) years compared with 51.4 (+/- 14.1) years. Otherwise, recipients with or without AMR did not differ in their sex, pretransplant diagnosis, type of transplant (single, bilateral, or heart-lung), or cytomegalovirus seropositivity [

         Hyperacute rejection is a fulminant form of rejection occurring within minutes to hours of reperfusion of the allograft and is caused by preformed donor-specific antibodies (DSA). The DSA have most commonly been directed at donor human leukocyte antigens (HLA) but may be directed at donor ABO blood group or endothelial antigens.

         The pathologic findings described in hyperacute rejection include acute lung injury with neutrophilic infiltration and platelet and fibrin thrombi in alveolar septae with concomitant fibrinoid necrosis and hemorrhage (

         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3,12-14
         </a>
         ]. The predilection of neutrophilic infiltration and fibrinoid necrosis of vessels in the alveolar septa illustrates that alveolar capillaries are the primary targets of antibody-mediated injury in hyperacute rejection. It is thought that antibody binding to its specific HLA on endothelial cells activates complement, which ultimately results in endothelial cell lysis. Endothelial cell damage results in exposure of the basement membrane and activation of the coagulation cascade leading to thrombosis and infarction. In addition, complement activation leads to the chemotaxis of neutrophils and macrophages, which propagate the acute lung injury.
        </p>
        <p>
         Complement component deposition (C4d) in the capillary endothelium demonstrates direct immunopathological evidence for the action of antibodies. However, complement deposition is not necessarily specific for AMR. In some reports, deposition of C3d and C4d is present in lung biopsies from patients with infection and primary graft dysfunction without evidence of HLA antibodies, suggesting that this may be a nonspecific finding [

         Hyperacute rejection is characterized by the rapid onset of profound hypoxemia, edema fluid emanating from the airways, and the appearance of diffuse opacities on radiographic imaging in the transplanted lung(s), all occurring in the first 24 hours following lung implantation [

         For lung recipients presenting with declining oxygenation and diffuse radiographic opacities in the allograft within the first 24 hours after transplantation, the evaluation includes assessment for AMR, fluid overload, aspiration, primary graft dysfunction (PGD), and vascular anastomotic complications.

         Laboratory testing in suspected hyperacute rejection is focused on immunologic tests for HLA antibodies but should also include testing for other processes in the differential diagnosis (eg, complete blood count and differential, blood cultures, brain natriuretic peptide [BNP], troponin).
        </p>
        <p>
         Current and historical HLA antibody screening tests and the specificity of any pre-formed HLA antibodies should be reviewed. In addition, the results of the direct crossmatch performed at the time of transplantation are reviewed to determine whether the recipient is sensitized to the specific donor antigens and ultimately whether the transplant is HLA-compatible or not. In general, donor and recipient HLA-compatibility is determined by the results of both recipient HLA antibody screening and the direct donor-recipient crossmatch.

          Virtual crossmatch prior to transplantation
         </strong>
         – Potential lung transplant recipients are screened for pre-existing HLA antibodies to identify HLA antigens that will need to be avoided in any potential donors for that recipient [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,10
         </a>
         ]. The older complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) assay has largely been replaced by highly sensitive, solid-phase assays that test the potential recipient's serum against beads coated with single or multiple purified HLA antigens. Using this approach, the presence and specificity of any HLA antibodies in the potential recipient's serum can be determined. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for any HLA antibody that is detected provides a measure of the antibody's avidity to its respective HLA molecule. The results of the HLA antibody assessment are entered into the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database at the time of listing for transplantation. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3987.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Any HLA antibodies above an arbitrary MFI threshold, which varies among centers, are used in a "virtual crossmatch" with the HLA typing of any potential donors to avoid HLA incompatibility and hyperacute rejection. The "virtual crossmatch" is the primary reason that hyperacute rejection has become rare.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Despite a negative "virtual crossmatch," occasional patients have DSA that are below the level of detection of the assay or against antigens not contained in the assay (eg, non-HLA antigens), but still place them at risk for hyperacute rejection [

         – At most centers, a direct crossmatch is performed at the time of transplantation using fresh recipient serum and donor lymphocytes from peripheral blood or lymph node-derived cells. Again, a variety of methods may be used, including CDC and flow cytometry. In a flow cytometry crossmatch, recipient serum is incubated with donor lymphocytes (T and B cells). After incubation, antibodies bound to the donor cells are tagged with immunofluorescent anti-immunoglobulin-G antibodies, and flow cytometry is used to assess the number of tagged cells [

In patients with hyperacute lung transplant rejection, the chest radiograph typically shows diffuse reticular and ground glass opacities in the transplanted lung(s) [

         A bedside nuclear perfusion scan can be a helpful imaging study to evaluate for vascular anastomotic complications, although the findings are sometimes non-specific. Computed tomography (CT) angiography is a more sensitive and specific imaging study to detect vascular anastomotic complications, but it requires transporting a critically ill patient to the radiology department and administration of intravenous contrast, which may increase the risk of kidney injury.

         As hyperacute rejection has been an uncommon complication after lung transplantation, data to support a specific treatment regimen are lacking. Nonetheless, for patients with suspected hyperacute rejection, the overall goals of treatment are to deplete circulating antibodies and antibody-producing cells and to block antibody binding to the endothelium. Due to the severity of respiratory impairment, several immunosuppressive therapies (eg, therapeutic plasma exchange [TPE], intravenous

         Specific morphologic features of acute AMR have been difficult to identify, although capillaritis is sometimes seen [

          11,26-28
         </a>
         ]. The pathology in many reported cases has been nonspecific, demonstrating features of acute lung injury including intra-alveolar fibrin deposition and diffuse alveolar damage or acute and organizing pneumonitis [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,27,29
         </a>
         ]. The nonspecific features contrast with acute cellular rejection where the diagnosis rests firmly on the pathology. (See

        <p>
         While capillaritis is sometimes seen as a feature of acute AMR, it is not a specific finding. In a study of capillaritis in lung allograft biopsies, none of the seven patients with pure capillaritis had donor specific antibodies (DSA) [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. This raises the possibilities that non-HLA anti-donor antibodies can cause capillaritis or that capillaritis is not specific for AMR. Confounding matters further is the unknown inter-reader reliability of capillaritis in lung allograft biopsies. In addition, a non-specific pathology of acute lung injury or diffuse alveolar damage is often seen [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,29
         </a>
         ]. Ultimately, the histopathologic findings in acute AMR are usually non-specific and the diagnosis requires a multidisciplinary evaluation including testing for DSA.
        </p>
        <p>
         The mechanism for cell injury (capillaritis) in AMR is thought to be antibody recognition via DSA, followed by complement-mediated cytotoxicity, which is supported by the finding of C4d deposition as a prominent feature in antibody-mediated rejection in kidney allografts. However, the relationship between DSA and acute AMR is complex, as DSA can be seen in patients with acute cellular rejection and chronic lung transplant rejection with bronchiolitis obliterans, as well as acute AMR [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30-33
         </a>
         ]. In a study of lung biopsies obtained for allograft dysfunction, the histopathologic findings of 23 patients who had concurrent DSA were compared with 26 patients who did not have DSA [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. The predominant finding among those with DSA was high-grade acute cellular rejection; 17 of 23 patients had acute cellular rejection (2 with grade A2, 14 with grade A3, and 1 with grade A4) [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. The remaining five patients with DSA had acute and organizing lung injury without capillaritis. Of note, capillaritis was noted only in a minority of cases and was associated with other features of cellular rejection.
        </p>
        <p>
         Deposition of immunoglobulins and complement products (particularly C4d) in the alveolar septum has been reported in patients with HLA antibodies and may be a manifestation of AMR [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27

          24

         C4d deposition is neither sensitive nor specific for acute AMR. Among 17 patients who had acute cellular rejection and DSA, 13 had C4d deposition, but this was focal and inconspicuous [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, C4d deposition was noted in 6 of the 26 patients who had cellular rejection but no DSA, and the pattern of deposition was similar to those with DSA. In addition, C4d deposition has been an inconsistent finding in some case series of AMR after lung transplantation. In one series of 10 patients with AMR, two of five had C4d deposition in the capillary endothelium [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. In a separate series of nine patients with AMR, only two of eight had C4d deposition [

          36
         </a>
         ]. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         In a study that compared 28 patients who had acute AMR with C4d deposition and 45 patients who did not have C4d deposition, similar histologic features were noted, but the C4d-positive group was more likely to have capillaritis [

         ]. Where testing was available, all patients who had C4d-positive AMR had complement-fixing DSA, whereas 6 of 18 patients with C4d-negative AMR did not have complement-fixing DSA. While the sample size is small, this suggests that acute AMR can occur via complement-independent pathways. Additionally, the similarity of clinical outcomes between those with C4d-positive AMR and with C4d-negative AMR suggests that C4d-deposition may not be a necessary criterion for the diagnosis of AMR [

          11,18

         <a href="#rid18">
          18

         ]. However, some patients present years after transplantation [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,29
         </a>
         ]. Presenting symptoms and signs included dyspnea (100 percent), cough, fever, hemoptysis (25 percent), hypoxemia, and respiratory failure (18 percent). In a separate case series, 14 of 21 required mechanical ventilation [

         It is possible that AMR may be clinically occult as most cases of acute cellular rejection are clinically silent. However, there have been no reported cases of circulating DSA and a characteristic pathology of AMR in the absence of clinical signs or symptoms. So, it is unclear if clinically silent AMR exists and what its clinicopathological features would be.

         Development of DSA may be a risk factor for acute AMR. In a series of 441 lung transplant recipients, 139 (32 percent) developed detectable antibodies to HLA; of these, 54 (39 percent) developed antibodies specific to donor HLA, which was associated with poorer survival [

         When lung transplant recipients develop respiratory symptoms weeks to months after transplantation, the evaluation requires a combination of tests to determine the cause of allograft dysfunction, such as infection, airway anastomotic complications, acute cellular rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans, cardiac dysfunction, and AMR. This evaluation typically includes laboratory assessment for DSA, spirometry, imaging, and flexible bronchoscopy.

         ]. Indeed, some recipients develop HLA antibodies that are not donor specific, and in one study, 11 of 22 patients with non-DSA HLA antibodies developed AMR compared to 0 of 22 patients without HLA antibodies [

         Complement activation is considered the central event in the pathogenesis of AMR, although not all antibodies fix complement. The C1q assay identifies HLA antibodies that bind the first component of complement and can be used to predict AMR and late graft failure [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36,41
         </a>
         ]. In a majority of cases, DSA bind and activate complement; however in a minority of patients, DSA do not bind complement and there is no C4d-deposition, suggesting that AMR may occur via complement-independent pathways [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,37
         </a>
         ]. (See

        <p>
         Recent advances indicate that donor-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) detected in peripheral blood is a highly sensitive marker of allograft injury, and the amount of circulating cfDNA correlates well with the severity of allograft injury and the likelihood of AMR [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42,43
         </a>
         ]. In addition, elevated levels of cfDNA are detectable months before the diagnosis of AMR making this an appealing screening assay for AMR [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42,44
         </a>
         ]. However, elevated levels of cfDNA are nonspecific and may be seen in the setting of acute cellular rejection and infection [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44,45
         </a>
         ]. Threshold levels may be improved by adjustment for differences in transplanted lung mass (eg, single versus bilateral lung transplants). One study that compared cfDNA levels in single lung recipients with bilateral recipients identified a threshold for detecting acute rejection of 0.54 percent in single lung recipients and 1.1 percent in bilateral recipients [
         <a href="#rid46">

         Additional tests typically include a complete blood count with differential looking for evidence of infection, blood and sputum cultures, cytomegalovirus (CMV) blood polymerase chain reaction (PCR), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and possibly troponin. Blood levels of the medications in the patient's immunosuppressive regimen (eg, calcineurin inhibitors) are obtained, as appropriate. Data are limited regarding the utility of the galactomannan antigenemia assay, the beta-D-glucan assay, or PCR for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in lung transplant recipients.

         In addition to routine screening spirometry, diagnostic spirometry is typically performed in lung transplant recipients to assess new onset respiratory symptoms. Based on limited data, patients with acute AMR often have a reduced forced vital capacity (FVC) and/or forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV

         Virtually all lung transplant recipients presenting with new onset respiratory symptoms or deterioration in gas exchange undergo conventional chest radiography. Diffuse pulmonary opacities are typical findings of AMR on chest radiography [
         <a href="#rid11">

High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is usually performed in addition to assess for complications such as recurrent primary disease, airway anastomotic problems, infection, and development of malignancy, as radiographic evidence of rejection is nonspecific.

         For patients presenting with unexplained respiratory symptoms in the weeks to months following lung transplantation, most centers perform flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsy in order to establish a specific diagnosis, unless the patient is too unstable. At the time of bronchoscopy, the airway is surveyed, with particular attention to the bronchial anastomotic site. Bronchoalveolar lavage is performed in an area of radiographic abnormality to obtain samples for microbiologic stains, immunofluorescence, polymerase chain reaction, and culture to assess for bacterial, fungal, or viral pneumonia (

         Transbronchial biopsies (typically 10) are obtained from a lower lobe or an area of radiographic disease. The optimal number of transbronchial biopsies is not known, but most centers try to achieve five specimens adequate for histopathologic interpretation. Immunohistochemistry for C4d deposition is performed using an immunofluorescence (IF) or immunoperoxidase (IP) assay [

          25

         Acute AMR can be a fulminant and sometimes fatal form of lung transplant rejection, and survivors have an increased risk of developing chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). In a series of 21 lung transplant recipients with AMR, the diagnosis was made at a median of 258 days following lung transplantation [

         ]. Six patients (29 percent) died during the index hospitalization, while 13 of 14 recipients who survived to discharge developed CLAD in the ensuing months without regard to whether they cleared DSA. The median survival after the diagnosis was 593 days. Of the 14 patients who required mechanical ventilation, eight (57 percent) were able to discontinue ventilator support and be discharged home.

         Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) of lung transplant allografts is mediated by antibodies directed against donor human leukocyte antigens (HLA) and other donor epitopes. The more common type of acute rejection in lung transplantation, acute cellular rejection, is mediated by T lymphocyte recognition of foreign HLA epitopes. (See

         Hyperacute rejection is a recognized syndrome of AMR that occurs in the first minutes to hours after reperfusion of the lung allograft and is caused by pre-existing donor specific antibodies (DSA). Hyperacute rejection is rare, as "virtual crossmatch" of previously identified HLA antibodies with potential donor HLA epitopes prior to transplantation avoids HLA incompatibility. (See

         Hyperacute rejection is associated with profound hypoxemia, diffuse noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and alveolar hemorrhage. The histopathologic findings attributed to hyperacute AMR include small vessel neutrophilic vasculitis or "capillaritis," intra-alveolar hemorrhage, and diffuse alveolar damage. (See

         The diagnosis of hyperacute rejection is based upon the timing of acute allograft dysfunction in a recipient with pre-transplant DSA (recognizing HLA or non-HLA epitopes) and a positive direct cross-match between the recipient's serum and donor cells indicating immunologic incompatibility. Other processes in the differential diagnosis, such as primary graft dysfunction, pulmonary edema from volume overload or myocardial dysfunction, bacterial pneumonia, aspiration, pulmonary thromboembolism, and anastomotic problems must be excluded.

         A small number of lung transplant recipients develop acute AMR in the weeks to months following transplantation. Acute AMR is associated with nonspecific symptoms, such as dyspnea, cough, fever, and hemoptysis, that can progress rapidly to respiratory failure. (See

         The evaluation of potential acute AMR requires a combination of tests to look for evidence of AMR and to exclude alternate diagnoses, such as infection, airway anastomotic problems, acute cellular rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans, cardiac dysfunction, and fluid overload. Testing usually includes laboratory studies for DSA, appropriate blood and sputum tests for infection, assessment of fluid status and cardiac function, chest imaging to clarify location and extent of abnormalities, spirometry, and flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy.
