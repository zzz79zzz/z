Discrepancies sufficient to prompt evaluation (excluding uncomplicated cases of cryptorchidism and hypospadias) occur in approximately 1 in 4500 live births [<a href="#rid3">3-6</a>].</p><p>The birth of an infant with atypical genital appearance presents a unique set of challenging management issues. This is because psychosexual development is influenced by multiple factors, including the genes involved in sexual development, prenatal androgen exposure, societal and cultural factors, and family dynamics. In the past, decisions about sex of rearing were usually based on potential for reproduction and traditional sexual function and were often accompanied by complex genital surgery that can be difficult to reverse [<a href="#rid7">7-9</a>]. Long-term outcome data are now available to help predict gender identity for many infants with specific DSD diagnoses and provide insight into appropriate early management decisions [<a href="#rid2">2,10-17</a>]. Nonetheless, there is ongoing controversy about some aspects of management. The uncertainties about adult gender identity, optimal timing of surgery, and surgical outcomes including timing of surgery should be included in informed decision-making by the parents and patient (when age appropriate). Each child and family will have unique characteristics, so all decisions must be made on a case-by-case basis. Management at centers of excellence is associated with improved medical, surgical, and psychosexual outcomes.</p><p>The management of infants with clinically significant DSD will be discussed here. The evaluation of these infants and specific causes of DSD are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5803.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the infant with atypical genital appearance (difference of sex development)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/118045.html" rel="external">"Causes of differences of sex development"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25706124"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1392462056"><span class="h2">Difference/disorder of sex development</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnostic category "disorders of sex development (DSD)" was proposed in a 2006 consensus conference, replacing potentially pejorative terms including "pseudohermaphrodite," "hermaphrodite," and "intersex" [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Since then, many groups have modified the term to "difference of sex development" in response to concerns that "disorder" is unnecessarily negative [<a href="#rid6">6,18</a>].</p><p>Concerns have been raised that DSD is an overly broad term that, with current nomenclature, is used to encompass conditions in which no issues with genital appearance or gender identity are expected (eg, complete androgen insensitivity syndrome [CAIS], Turner syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, trisomy X); and also that a broad umbrella term like DSD lacks sufficient specificity to be helpful diagnostically and is therefore unnecessary. Many support and advocacy groups do not accept the DSD designation and feel that it should be abandoned by the medical community. We agree with the concept that each patient should be identified by a specific diagnosis and not the inexact umbrella DSD categorization.</p><p>Until a consensus is reached on this issue, we will use the term DSD but will employ it only in relation to those patients in whom there is altered physical sex differentiation (conditions previously captured by the term "intersex") and a diagnosis has not been established. Many of these individuals present as newborns with an atypical genital appearance, previously termed "ambiguous genitalia." We will not use the term to refer to conditions in which genital/gender discordance is not expected, such as Klinefelter syndrome, Turner syndrome, undescended testes, or isolated forms of hypospadias.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1183327638"><span class="h2">Glossary of other terms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The vocabulary used to describe features of DSD can be confusing and is sometimes inconsistently applied. A glossary of terms is provided  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118023" href="/d/graphic/118023.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2017575660"><span class="h1">TYPES OF DSD WITH ATYPICAL GENITAL APPEARANCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Management depends on the type of DSD and degree of genital atypia. The initial management of the patient, including surveillance for adrenal crisis and family coping, occurs concurrently with the diagnostic process, which is described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5803.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the infant with atypical genital appearance (difference of sex development)"</a>.)</p><p>For the purposes of management, it is helpful to categorize these disorders into five major groups  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57610" href="/d/graphic/57610.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), listed here in decreasing order of frequency:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>46,XX DSD</strong> – The most common form of DSD that presents with atypical genital appearance and a 46,XX karyotype in the newborn period is classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. This is a relatively homogenous group of patients, most of whom present in the newborn period with prenatal virilization and without palpable gonads. Extremely rarely, 46,XX individuals with CAH present with normal external male genitalia but without palpable gonads. Mandatory newborn screening in the United States allows for early detection of almost all cases of classic CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, usually within the first week of life. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/118045.html" rel="external">"Causes of differences of sex development", section on 'Classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Much less common 46,XX DSD include other forms of CAH and disorders caused by gonadal overproduction of androgens (eg, <em>NR5A1</em> gene mutation)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56975" href="/d/graphic/56975.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/118045.html" rel="external">"Causes of differences of sex development", section on 'Causes of XX differences of sex development'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>45,X/46,XY mosaicism</strong> – The second most common category of DSD with atypical genital appearance is 45,X/46,XY mosaicism.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The phenotype of this condition is highly variable, ranging from phenotypically normal males (approximately 90 percent of patients, often undiagnosed), to males with atypical genital appearance/severe hypospadias, to those with female genitalia and Turner syndrome-like features. The specific presentation appears to be related to the degree of mosaicism in the gonad and its consequent hormonal function. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7391.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Turner syndrome"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Those with atypical genital appearance typically have hypospadias (often severe), a descended (but infertile) testis usually on the right side, and a streak gonad with retained remnants on the contralateral side  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60214" href="/d/graphic/60214.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef106091" href="/d/graphic/106091.html" rel="external">image 1</a>); this phenotype is often described as "mixed gonadal dysgenesis" in the literature. It is unclear why the testicular tissue is usually found on the right side. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/118045.html" rel="external">"Causes of differences of sex development", section on 'Sex chromosome differences of sex development'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>46,XY DSD</strong> – Several types of 46,XY DSD that are rare but reasonably well described are:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Disorders of androgen synthesis (eg, 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase [17-beta-HSD] deficiency and 5-alpha-reductase deficiency).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Androgen insensitivity syndrome is caused by androgen receptor or associated transcription factor gene mutations. Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) can be associated with atypical genital appearance, ranging from microphallus to severe hypospadias and undescended testes. (See <a class="local">'Partial androgen insensitivity syndrome'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/118045.html" rel="external">"Causes of differences of sex development", section on 'Androgen insensitivity'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">PAIS should not be confused with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), which is characterized by a 46,XY karyotype, typical female external genitalia, absent müllerian structures, and high likelihood of a female gender identity [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7458.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis and clinical features of disorders of androgen action"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Global defects in testicular function caused by mutations in genes involved in gonadal development (eg, <em>NR5A1</em> [<em>SF1</em>], <em>SRY</em>, or <em>WT1</em>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Other 46,XY DSD include additional disorders of androgen synthesis (eg, Leydig cell hypoplasia) and uncommon forms of CAH  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81145" href="/d/graphic/81145.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/118045.html" rel="external">"Causes of differences of sex development", section on 'Causes of XY differences of sex development'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>46,XY DSD with severe genital anomalies</strong> that are not associated with presently identified gene or chromosome abnormalities.

This can be either an ovary or testis on opposite sides or, more commonly, an ovotestis that is a gonad with both ovarian and testicular tissue intermixed. Most of these individuals have a 46,XX karyotype. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/118045.html" rel="external">"Causes of differences of sex development", section on 'Gonadal overproduction of androgens'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/118045.html" rel="external">"Causes of differences of sex development", section on 'XY gonadal dysgenesis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Management for some of these disorders is outlined below. (See <a class="local">'Overview of decisions about sex of rearing'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">INITIAL STABILIZATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial stabilization of infants with DSD presenting with atypical genital appearance requires attention to both medical and psychosocial issues, with the goal of making an accurate diagnosis to guide management and predict clinical and gender outcomes.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The most important medical concern is the possibility of life-threatening adrenal crisis in infants with salt-wasting congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Neonatal screening for CAH identifies most but not all affected infants before they develop an adrenal crisis. (See <a class="local">'Risk of adrenal crisis'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The main psychosocial concern during this period is the anxiety experienced by most parents whose child is born with an atypical genital appearance. Uncertainty about the sex of rearing can complicate or delay the traditional announcement of whether the child is a boy or girl to family members, friends, and community. This period of uncertainty is inevitable because of the time required to make an accurate diagnosis and develop a thoughtful treatment plan in collaboration with the child's parents. Supporting the family through this time period with information and reassurance is critical for the well-being of the family. (See <a class="local">'Is it a boy or a girl? Family coping'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Risk of adrenal crisis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CAH due to 21-hydroxylase (<em>CYP21A2</em>) deficiency (<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fomim.org%2Fentry%2F201910&amp;token=87jLzclRwWxNoI%2BQq5Gg7x3y5AzXWotmrR%2FdOTMMTzgPV4MmPMa6vnh9HqFHL6M1&amp;TOPIC_ID=5807" target="_blank">MIM #201910</a>) is the most common cause of 46,XX DSD (virilization), and the more severe mutations carry a significant risk for a salt-wasting adrenal crisis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107536" href="/d/graphic/107536.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). An adrenal crisis also may occur in some other types of CAH, including 11-beta hydroxylase deficiency. If salt-wasting CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is undiagnosed and not treated, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension, and hypovolemic shock can occur, typically between 10 to 20 days of life. Other rare forms of salt-wasting CAH may manifest even earlier in both XX and XY infants.</p><p>Therefore, any infant with atypical genital appearance (and infants with a positive neonatal screen for CAH) should be presumed to have CAH and monitored for salt loss and adrenal crisis until the diagnosis is confirmed or excluded. Blood samples should be urgently obtained for steroid hormone precursors (most importantly, 17-hydroxyprogesterone) to evaluate for CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Serum and urine electrolytes and plasma glucose should be monitored closely until CAH is definitively diagnosed or excluded.</p><p>Laboratory findings suggesting a salt-wasting crisis include hyperkalemia with or without hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, and hypoglycemia [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. A rapid overview guiding the recognition and treatment of adrenal crisis is shown in the accompanying table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61357" href="/d/graphic/61357.html" rel="external">table 6</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5800.html" rel="external">"Treatment of classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency in infants and children", section on 'Management in neonates'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Is it a boy or a girl? Family coping</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An appropriate management plan can be developed only with the full participation of the parents after a careful and complete evaluation by an experienced team of endocrinologists, geneticists, and surgeons, aided by individuals capable of providing sophisticated psychosocial support [<a href="#rid6">6,21,22</a>]. The period of uncertainty before a specific diagnosis can be established is a particularly challenging time for parents. In the rarer forms of DSD presenting with atypical genital appearance, this can be an extended process because of the multiple diagnostic steps required and the complexity and time required for genomic testing and because less information is available about these diagnoses to reliably predict outcomes. Even with optimal education and support, parents and family may experience significant stress and difficulty in adjusting to the diagnosis before they are capable of making thoughtful and informed decisions about management.</p><p>In these discussions, the emphasis should be on helping the parents understand that the atypical genital appearance, although uncommon, is biologically understandable in almost all children [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. The genitalia can be described to the parents as "not being fully formed" or being "overly developed." It may be helpful to summarize the embryology of genital development, including the presence of indeterminate external genitalia in the early stages of fetal development, followed by subsequent maturation toward male- or female-typical genitalia. This discussion should be tailored to the educational background and emotional state of the family, and special needs caused by the family's cultural or religious background should be identified and addressed.</p><p>We generally suggest to the families that they consider postponing birth announcements describing the sex of the infant until more information is known about the cause of the atypical genital appearance because some DSD are associated with fairly predictable gender identity, while others have less predictable gender identity outcomes (see <a class="local">'Overview of decisions about sex of rearing'</a> below). Similarly, the birth certificate in most of the United States now has a gender-neutral option that can be adjusted over time, when a diagnosis has been determined and/or gender identity has clearly evolved. If the diagnosis is clear (eg, minimal virilization in an XX infant with 21-hydroxylase deficiency), then a family can comfortably announce the sex. When the diagnosis will be delayed several days or months until diagnostic testing is complete, or delayed indefinitely when a diagnosis remains elusive, the family will require counseling and support to be able to postpone the birth announcement about the baby's sex [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Gender-neutral names may be a useful family option in this scenario.</p><p>Many families, even those with strong health literacy, feel guilty that they are in some way responsible for the genital malformation. This must be discussed openly; the discussion will differ depending upon the nature of the disorder. If the child is known to have a gene variant, the variant and its manifestations must be described so that the family can learn about and cope with the disorder as it is understood, with full disclosure regarding the degree of uncertainty in outcome associated with the specific diagnosis.</p><p>Families of children with atypical genital appearance often wish to discuss issues of long-term reproductive function and sexuality early in the evaluation. These issues should be frankly discussed.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Further evaluation</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Specific DSD diagnosis</strong> – After initial stabilization, infants with DSD should be thoroughly evaluated to establish an accurate diagnosis, including a molecular genetic diagnosis whenever possible, because this information is an important guide to management. The types of DSD and steps in the evaluation are discussed in detail separately. The infant should also be evaluated for other non-genital abnormalities that might suggest a syndromic form of DSD. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5803.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the infant with atypical genital appearance (difference of sex development)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Care setting</strong> – Because of the complexity of DSD diagnoses and the infrequency with which they are seen, affected infants should be evaluated and managed at centers with experienced interdisciplinary DSD teams, if possible [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. If it is not possible to transfer the infant to a DSD center for evaluation, consultation should be sought with a DSD team to help organize and facilitate management. In response to the consensus conference on the management of DSD in 2006 [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], several groups published useful information on the development of collaborative management teams in Western Europe and in North America [<a href="#rid24">24-27</a>].

All of these factors must be assessed in every patient, regardless of the type of DSD. Unfortunately, even the best outcome data available suffer from problems with sampling bias and often small sample size. Large-scale, long-term follow-up, which will be available through several large national and international consortia, will undoubtedly improve the reliability of such outcome data even for relatively rare disorders.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Concept of evolving gender identity</strong> – Children with or without DSD will define their own gender identities over time. In some cases, the child's gender role behavior and gender identity may not be fixed until early adulthood or even later. Gender identity in individuals with or without DSD may be male, female, or neither (nonbinary) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Because of these uncertainties, a watch-and-wait approach may be particularly beneficial for most children with DSD. Long-term outcomes should be judged by psychosexual and psychosocial well-being and an ability to positively contribute to society, rather than by conformity to social gender norms [<a href="#rid33">33,34</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Predictors of gender identity</strong> – The child's probable gender identity depends in part on the type of DSD and may reflect the degree of prenatal androgen exposure [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For some DSD, including the most common type (46,XX congenital adrenal hyperplasia [CAH] due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency with mild or moderate virilization), gender identity is mostly predictable  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57610" href="/d/graphic/57610.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). For these children, decisions about sex of rearing are fairly straightforward. Nonetheless, the family should be counseled that, in rare cases, there can be uncertainty about the child's long-term gender identity.

In such cases, management decisions remain challenging for providers and family. Adult gender identity may be variable and difficult to predict. When counseling the families of these children, we discuss the concept of an evolving gender identity, which recognizes that future gender identity is not entirely predictable at birth and can evolve as the child grows. We explain that "we just do not know yet" and encourage parents or caregivers to assume a supportive role regarding their child's gender identity, with flexibility to permit the child to manifest changes in gender identity with maturation. This approach remains untested prospectively in the management of children with DSD.</p><p></p><p>We recognize that the family will bear the major burden of rearing a child with atypical genital appearance.

For infants with this diagnosis, the expectation of female gender identity can be communicated to the family and decisions about sex of rearing are relatively straightforward. The female gender role is also consistent with the individual's internal anatomy, and fertility may be possible. This perspective is consistent with an international consensus statement [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. However, clinicians and family members should also recognize that gender dysphoria is experienced by 5 to 10 percent of 46,XX CAH patients and that some of these individuals may later develop a male or nonbinary gender identity [<a href="#rid28">28-30,37,38</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Severe virilization</strong> – Individuals with 46,XX CAH and severe virilization (Prader V genitalia) are rare, representing &lt;3 percent of all patients with CAH.

Surgery to restore female anatomy includes:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Separation of the urinary tract and vagina</strong> – Detachment of the vagina from the confluence of the common urogenital sinus allows the common urogenital channel to function as the urethra.

In a meta-analysis of 29 observational studies, approximately one half of patients who engaged in penetrative sexual activity reported discomfort and one-third had vaginal stenosis requiring either dilatation or repeated surgeries [<a href="#rid38">38</a>].

Newer techniques (ventral nerve-sparing approach) are designed to preserve sensation and sexual function, but no long-term data are available on the functional capacity of the clitoris after surgery, including in patients who received the newer nerve-sparing procedures [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. If clitoral surgery is performed at any age, a major focus should be on preserving the innervation and erectile tissue to optimize sexual function, rather than focusing on cosmetic appearance [<a href="#rid45">45</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1997687364"><span class="h3">Timing and extent of surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Decisions about timing of surgery require shared decision-making with the family, as reflected in an international consensus statement [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].

No randomized studies have evaluated either the best age or the best methods for restoring functional female anatomy with a separate urethra and vaginal opening. However, proponents of early surgery argue that functional outcomes are good when performed by highly experienced surgeons using modern techniques that focus on preserving neurologic innervation of the vagina and clitoris [<a href="#rid41">41,46-50</a>]. They argue that the relatively poor outcomes described in some reports reflect surgery performed more than two decades ago, using older techniques. In addition, early restoration of typical female anatomy helps to avoid potential complications of a confluent vagina and urethra, such as the risk for urinary tract infections (rare) and obstruction of menstrual flow at puberty. A possible advantage for infants with severe virilization is that performing early complete reconstruction allows the surgeon to use the excess common urogenital sinus tissue to reconstruct the anterior vaginal wall [<a href="#rid51">51</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">For individuals with a high urogenital confluence, the surgery is more complex and outcomes of early surgery are less certain.

Reasons for avoiding clitoral surgery during early childhood are possible loss of clitoral sensitivity, uncertainty about the child's gender identity and preferences, and possible varying preferences regarding clitoral size.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Advantages of avoiding early surgical intervention</strong> – A contrasting perspective supported by numerous patient advocacy groups is to avoid all reconstructive surgery during infancy and childhood, ie, not to perform repair of the common urogenital sinus and vaginoplasty or clitoroplasty [<a href="#rid55">55</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The rationale for this noninterventional approach is:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Uncertain gender identity</strong> – Decisions about early urogenital surgery may not be consistent with the child's ultimate gender identity, sexual orientation or desire for penetrative sexual activity, fertility desires, and personal preferences. In a large meta-analysis, approximately 10 percent of individuals with CAH do not identify as females as adults and approximately 25 percent of those with female gender identity experienced sexual attraction to women, which might influence their preferences and decisions about their genital appearance and function as they reach adolescence and adulthood [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. The incidence of gender-fluid or nonbinary gender identities in this population is unknown because most studies have not collected those data.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">For individuals who are <strong>not</strong> diagnosed and treated for CAH in infancy (eg, those living in low-resource countries), female gender identity is even less common. This may be due to exposure to high concentrations of androgens in utero and during childhood, the effect of male sex of rearing in this setting, and, possibly, the higher social position of males in some societies [<a href="#rid56">56</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Surgical complications</strong> – Feminizing surgery can have lifelong complications, including vaginal stenosis and loss of clitoral sensitivity.

(See <a class="local">'Surgical procedures'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Clitoral surgery may not be necessary</strong> – An enlarged clitoris observed in the newborn may decrease in prominence over time with glucocorticoid treatment.

Moreover, the opinions of the clinician(s) and parent/caregiver(s) about the cosmetic appearance of the newborn clitoris may depend on their own gender and cultural assumptions [<a href="#rid57">57</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Limited evidence on outcomes</strong> – The effects of early versus late genital surgery on psychosocial or psychosexual development or quality of life are unknown [<a href="#rid37">37,58,59</a>].

Whether a shift away from early reconstructive surgery will lead to an improved quality of life for most children with differences in genital appearance is not yet known and will require careful follow-up.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3409719498"><span class="h2">46,XX congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Prader V</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A few children (approximately &lt;3 percent) with 46,XX CAH have severe virilization, with a complete penile urethra (Prader V genitalia). Historically, in such cases, the child was often identified as male at birth and the DSD was not recognized until late childhood. However, with the implementation of newborn screening, most cases in resource-abundant settings are identified soon after birth. Management of these children presents a complex and difficult problem because of uncertainties about gender identity and surgical challenges:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gender identity</strong> – For children diagnosed with this DSD early in life, uncertainty of the child's gender identity and the fertility implications must be openly and completely discussed with the family [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Gender identity is particularly uncertain for those individuals who are diagnosed later in life, when a male sex of rearing is already established.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Many practitioners advise a female sex of rearing when the diagnosis is made in the neonatal period. This perspective is extrapolated from the experience with patients with CAH and milder virilization, who have a reasonable likelihood of female gender identity and the potential for normal ovarian function and fertility in adulthood. However, it is suspected but not proven that gender dysphoria may be more common among those with severe virilization; adequately sized studies are lacking [<a href="#rid30">30,53,60</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Gender identity expectations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A male sex of rearing is also reasonable for these severely virilized children, especially if the diagnosis is made after the neonatal period. Reports describe successful outcomes in patients raised as males, especially those who are diagnosed after infancy [<a href="#rid53">53,60-63</a>]. However, in one report, approximately 10 percent of those who were reared as males experienced severe gender dysphoria [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Uncommonly, these individuals may later self-identify as female and choose to have feminizing surgery [<a href="#rid64">64</a>]. Lifelong medical treatment with glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids would still be required, and supplemental <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12827" href="/d/drug information/12827.html" rel="external">testosterone</a> may be required to support male secondary sexual characteristics. Height outcomes for male patients may be less than mid-parental height, similar to that reported in other individuals with CAH.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Surgical considerations</strong> – Surgical feminization is especially challenging in patients with extreme virilization. These patients typically have a high insertion of the vagina close to the bladder neck  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef106092" href="/d/graphic/106092.html" rel="external">image 2</a>). When surgery is deemed necessary, the separation of the high common urogenital channel should only be attempted by an experienced surgeon. Robotic and laparoscopic abdominal approaches to the high urogenital sinus have avoided the need for a temporary diverting colostomy and/or the anterior sagittal transrectal approach (ASTRA) procedure. These surgeries are complex and require a combined perineal abdominal approach [<a href="#rid46">46,65-67</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">When these severely virilized patients are raised as males, they may undergo "hypospadias repair" in infancy. If the child accepts the male gender identity, he will ultimately require a hysterectomy and removal of the internal gonads (ovaries). The gonadectomy should be done before puberty to prevent gender-incongruent body development (menstruation and breast development). Alternatively, treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog can be initiated before puberty and the surgery deferred until later in adolescence or early adulthood, when the patient can affirm their gender identity and participate in the decisions about further surgery. It is important that the family and/or patient understand that this type of surgery is irreversible and precludes female fertility. It is not necessary to remove the vagina, although its presence may increase the risk for urinary tract infection, similar to the risk seen in patients with an enlarged prostatic utricle.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3674286708"><span class="h1">APPROACH TO OTHER DIFFERENCES/DISORDERS OF SEX DEVELOPMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Key characteristics and information about projected gender identity for several other common DSD are outlined in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57610" href="/d/graphic/57610.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H50281219"><span class="h2">Mixed gonadal dysgenesis (45,X/46,XY mosaicism)</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gender identity</strong> – Most individuals with mixed gonadal dysgenesis (45,X/46,XY mosaicism) will have a male gender identity.

Infertility is likely, and the adult phallus size can be inadequate if it is poorly responsive to androgen [<a href="#rid68">68,69</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Surgical considerations</strong> – Hypospadias surgery is performed at 6 to 15 months of age [<a href="#rid70">70</a>].

The scrotal gonad (testis), which is typically on the right, requires careful follow-up because it is dysplastic and has an increased tumor risk [<a href="#rid71">71</a>]. A biopsy of the scrotal testis is recommended after puberty to rule out the presence of carcinoma in situ, a premalignant condition [<a href="#rid68">68</a>]. The streak gonad is typically removed because of tumor risk and lack of function [<a href="#rid72">72</a>]. The müllerian remnant (hemiuterus) is typically removed at the same time as the streak gonad  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef106091" href="/d/graphic/106091.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Gonads'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In the rare patient with minimal virilization, it is prudent to defer feminizing surgery until a female gender identity is confirmed. Suboptimal outcomes have been reported in the past with early feminizing surgery in these patients. The vagina/müllerian cavity is typically more narrow and rigid than in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). As a result, the outcome of vaginal surgery may be less than ideal in this form of DSD and typically requires postsurgical dilation and/or revision. When feminizing surgery is performed, discordant testes and/or streak gonads should be removed because of the risk of malignancy.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3667879323"><span class="h2">46,XY 17-beta-HSD and 5-alpha-reductase deficiencies</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gender identity</strong> – Individuals with 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17-beta-HSD) type 3 (<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fomim.org%2Fentry%2F605573&amp;token=87jLzclRwWxNoI%2BQq5Gg7zfRaw5FJ1rCGDZrQ4tkzs%2B0PWpBtwULTXwTwn%2FBrlig&amp;TOPIC_ID=5807" target="_blank">MIM 605573</a>) or 5-alpha-reductase type 2 (<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fomim.org%2Fentry%2F607306&amp;token=87jLzclRwWxNoI%2BQq5Gg72s1Dyk0fUaJ6Appm3aWyLzvglS9vPp2brLxuISEqvIZ&amp;TOPIC_ID=5807" target="_blank">MIM 607306</a>) deficiencies usually develop male gender identity [<a href="#rid37">37,73</a>].
