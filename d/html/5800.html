         More than 95 percent of cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) are caused by autosomal recessive deficiency of 21-hydroxylase, due to mutations of the
         <em>
          CYP21A2
         </em>
         gene. Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase interferes with conversion of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) to 11-deoxycortisol and conversion of progesterone to deoxycorticosterone, resulting in diminished or absent production of cortisol and aldosterone and overproduction of adrenal androgens (

         ). Clinical manifestations depend on the severity of the deficiency and adequacy of treatment but most commonly include risk for adrenal crisis, virilization including atypical genitalia (in 46,XX infants), abnormal growth during childhood, early puberty, adult short stature, menstrual dysfunction, and infertility [

         </span>
         The goals for treatment of classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency are to prevent adrenal crisis and optimize growth, sexual maturation, and reproductive function. This is accomplished by replacing glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid in sufficient doses to reduce the associated excessive corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion and hyperandrogenemia. Mineralocorticoid replacement is especially important in patients with the salt-losing form of the disorder to maintain normal serum electrolyte concentrations and extracellular fluid volume but also may be beneficial for patients with classic non-salt-losing (simple virilizing) CAH. These goals can be difficult to achieve without overtreatment and its attendant risk of growth retardation and other clinical manifestations of Cushing syndrome [

          3

         Newborn infants with CAH may be identified through targeted prenatal diagnosis in affected families or by neonatal screening programs. Others may present with atypical genitalia in affected females or with adrenal crisis, which typically presents at approximately 10 to 20 days of life. Because of the risk of adrenal crisis, every newborn with atypical genitalia or a suspected diagnosis of CAH should be urgently evaluated by a pediatric endocrinologist.

         Newborn screening for classic CAH is routinely performed in all 50 of the United States and at least 40 other countries [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. A positive newborn screening test for CAH must be confirmed by a second serum/plasma sample. The urgent medical issue is identification of infants with the salt-losing form before they develop an adrenal crisis. Symptoms of salt losing, including vomiting, poor feeding with failure to thrive, lethargy, hypovolemia, dehydration, hyponatremia with reciprocal hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, and cardiovascular collapse, can occur within the first few weeks of life if CAH is not treated [
         <a href="#rid4">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         As soon as CAH is suspected on the basis of a positive newborn screen, a sample of blood should be obtained for confirmatory steroid hormone measurements (most importantly, 17-hydroxyprogesterone [17-OHP]) and serum electrolytes should be measured. The 17-OHP should be measured in a major national laboratory that offers the assay with rapid turnaround time. To distinguish 21-hydroxylase deficiency from other rarer causes of CAH, serum concentrations of 11-deoxycortisol, 17-hydroxypregnenolone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and cortisol should also be measured, and these can be consolidated as multitest panels in major commercial laboratories.

         below) to prevent the potentially life-threatening manifestations of an adrenal crisis. If the clinician chooses not to initiate treatment while awaiting the results of confirmatory steroid hormone measurements, serum electrolytes should be measured every 24 to 48 hours to monitor for adrenal insufficiency. These patients should be managed by a pediatric endocrinologist.

         A few infants with CAH will be identified by prenatal diagnosis if they are born to a family with a history of CAH in a parent or sibling. For these infants, treatment should be initiated after birth and after a confirmatory blood sample is obtained, as described below. (See

         Infants with atypical genitalia require urgent medical attention. The initial evaluation should include history, physical examination, rapid and reliable measurement of 17-OHP and serum electrolytes, karyotype or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for sex chromosome material (

         Infants with genital atypia and nonpalpable gonads should be presumed to have 46,XX CAH and empirically treated for CAH until the diagnosis is confirmed or excluded.

         An appropriate therapeutic plan can be developed only with the full participation of the parents/caregivers and after a careful and complete evaluation by an experienced interdisciplinary team of endocrinologists, surgeons, and mental health professionals with expertise in managing the psychosocial aspects of disorders of sex development. The team should provide sensitive and expert psychosocial support to the parents and family who may need some time to adjust to the diagnosis before they are capable of making decisions regarding surgical management. The family should be informed about surgical options including avoiding or delaying surgery. Surgery should be performed by a surgeon with special expertise in treating this population. Family support and management of the infant are discussed in detail separately. (See

         Follow-up laboratory tests (serum 17-OHP, androstenedione, plasma renin activity, and electrolytes) should be performed no more than 10 to 14 days after starting treatment. The results should be used to guide adjustment of the doses of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. Sufficient glucocorticoid doses are needed to ensure suppression of adrenal androgens, but excessive dosing can impair growth. Sufficient mineralocorticoid doses are needed to maintain normal fluids and electrolytes, but excessive dosing can induce hypertension or hypokalemia and possibly contribute to growth impairment.

         The doses of these medications are further adjusted based on serial blood sampling and blood pressure monitoring at least monthly during the first three months of life, every three months during infancy, and every three to six months thereafter during childhood. Sodium chloride supplements are typically needed in the first year but can usually be discontinued as the child starts to eat table food.

          'Growth'

Although only the salt-losing form is associated with clinically apparent mineralocorticoid deficiency, aldosterone secretion has been shown to be impaired in the simple virilizing form [

         is used for mineralocorticoid replacement, given in a dose sufficient to restore normal serum sodium and potassium concentrations and to maintain plasma renin activity within the normal range. The usual pediatric dose of fludrocortisone is 100 mcg (0.1 mg) per day (range 50 to 200 mcg per day [0.05 to 0.20 mg per day]) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2

         Signs of excessive dosing include suppressed plasma renin activity, hypertension, hypokalemia, and, possibly, impaired growth [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. Paradoxically, underdosing also can lead to poor growth with failure to thrive. This may be in part because inadequate mineralocorticoid replacement increases the glucocorticoid replacement requirement, which, in turn, impairs growth [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22,23
         </a>
         ]. In addition, inadequate mineralocorticoid replacement may lead to increased adrenal androgen production. This is because patients may be chronically volume depleted, which is clinically inapparent but results in persistent overproduction of renin and angiotensin II. Angiotensin II stimulates vasopressin and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), leading to higher adrenal androgen synthesis [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24,25
         </a>
         ]. For all of these reasons, mineralocorticoid therapy appears to benefit patients with either the classic salt-losing form or the classic non-salt-losing (simple virilizing) form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

         Newborn infants often require higher doses of

          fludrocortisone
         </a>
         (0.1 mg twice daily). For most infants, the dose should be reduced around 6 to 12 months of age because sensitivity to mineralocorticoid increases as the kidneys mature in the first year of life, which may cause hypertension if the dose is not reduced. This needs to be closely monitored. In a study of 33 patients with classic CAH diagnosed by newborn screening, over one-half developed hypertension in the first 18 months of life [

         Sodium chloride supplementation is also required for infants at 1 to 2 g/day (approximately 17 to 34 mEq/day or 4 mEq/kg/day) distributed in several feedings [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Salt tablets/solution can be discontinued as the child begins to eat table food and the taste for salty food increases (around 8 to 12 months of age). Older children may need additional salt intake during hot weather or with intense exercise due to excess salt loss in these settings. Increased salt intake during the summer months when outside activities are planned or during the days of sports activities usually suffices. However, children involved in competitive sports sometimes benefit from taking a 1 g salt tablet prior to events.

         In general, increased growth rate and advanced bone age suggest excessive androgen exposure, whereas reduced growth rate and delayed bone age suggest excessive glucocorticoid dosing.

         <sup>

          30
         </a>

If central precocious puberty is suspected, measurement of serum luteinizing hormone (LH) using a sensitive immunochemiluminescence assay is useful. (See

         Parents should be offered counseling as soon as the diagnosis of CAH is established. If the infant presents with atypical genitalia, immediate and ongoing counseling by an expert team is particularly important. Details about counseling and management of patients with atypical genital appearance, including decisions about genital surgery, are discussed in a separate topic review. (See

         Children should be informed of their condition by both their clinicians and parents; the information should be provided in a manner that is appropriate to the age and developmental status of the child and should be repeated at regular intervals beginning at a young age. Adolescents should receive reassurance and independent counseling if warranted [

         The outcome of therapy for 21-hydroxylase deficiency can be measured by evaluating growth and development, gonadal function and fertility, bone density, and quality of life. In addition, children with 21-hydroxylase deficiency are at risk for obesity, possibly in part due to therapy.

         The adult height achieved in treated patients is usually less than that in reference groups. A meta-analysis of studies of patients treated for CAH reported a mean adult height score of -1.4 standard deviations (SD) or 10 cm below the population mean [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. The mean weighted adult height SD score was closer to normal for patients who began treatment during infancy compared with those who began treatment after one year of age (adult height -1.1 SD versus -1.6 SD). A subsequent meta-analysis reported a mean adult height of -1.03 SD and found that mineralocorticoid users had a better height outcome compared with nonusers [

         Impaired growth in children with CAH involves both hypercortisolism and hyperandrogenism, as shown in retrospective studies in which adult height of patients with CAH was independent of the degree of control of adrenal androgen concentrations [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35-37
         </a>
         ]. Several studies have suggested that treatment during the first two years of life and during puberty are the most important factors influencing height outcome [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30,37-39
         </a>
         ]. Adequate mineralocorticoid doses are also needed to optimize growth [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The best established approach to optimizing linear growth is judicious glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid dosing and close monitoring; heights approximating target height have been reported in patients treated with thrice-daily doses of medication and monitoring every three months [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,40,41

         ]. Experimental therapies to improve linear growth in patients with CAH include sex steroid blockade, growth hormone, and/or gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa). These treatments can be considered for patients with CAH and growth failure (predicted adult height -2.25 SD) in the setting of a controlled research trial [

         Patients with CAH are at risk for early onset of central puberty (also known as gonadotropin-dependent precocious puberty). In general, puberty is considered precocious if the onset of secondary sexual characteristics is before the age of eight years in girls and nine years in boys. Central precocious puberty is most likely to develop when the diagnosis of CAH is delayed or when adrenal androgen secretion is poorly controlled; such patients may benefit from treatment with a GnRH analog [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ]. In boys with CAH, the onset of central puberty has been closely linked to a bone age between 12 years and 12 years 6 months [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ], but no clear association has been identified in girls. If central precocious puberty is suspected, measurement of serum luteinizing hormone (LH) using a sensitive immunochemiluminescence assay is useful. (See

         Menstrual dysfunction is common among women with CAH. One study reported that, despite earlier onset of puberty in females with CAH, the mean age of menarche is comparable with the general population; however, patients with poor adrenal control have delayed onset of menarche [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44

          3,45

         Ectopic adrenal tissue located in the testes (testicular adrenal rest) is commonly found in males with CAH and can interfere with testicular function, causing infertility. The prevalence of testicular adrenal rest in boys with classic CAH ages 2 to 18 years ranges from 18 to 24 percent [

         <a href="#rid53">
          53

         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>

Children with classic CAH had more fat mass than controls, whereas children with nonclassic CAH had more lean mass but higher insulin levels, suggesting that glucocorticoid therapy plays a role in the development of obesity in CAH. In the largest review of 89 children from Germany with 21-hydroxylase deficiency (ages between 0.2 and 17.9 years), 17 percent of patients were obese, as defined by a body mass index (BMI) that was &gt;2 SD from the mean BMI for age [

There was no difference in incidence of obesity based on sex or clinical form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency (simple-virilizing and salt-losing forms). All patients received glucocorticoid therapy, and there was a positive correlation between dose of medication prescribed and BMI. The BMI of normally growing children with CAH has been found to increase throughout childhood more than the expected age-related increase [

         Prenatal therapy with glucocorticoids is an experimental approach aimed at reducing the virilization of an affected 46,XX fetus. This intervention does not change the need for lifelong hormonal therapy. This intervention could be considered when a fetus is known to be at risk because of an affected sibling or when both parents are known to be heterozygous for one of the severe mutations of the
         <em>
          CYP21A2
         </em>
         gene. However, because adverse effects of prenatal therapy (on the fetus and mother) have been described and long-term risks are unknown, several groups have concluded that prenatal therapy should be regarded as experimental and undertaken only by a highly experienced team in a research setting and after a detailed discussion with the pregnant couple about potential benefits and adverse effects, using treatment protocols approved by an institutional review board, while awaiting follow-up data [

         <strong>
          Rationale
         </strong>
         – The rationale for prenatal therapy is that exogenous glucocorticoids can suppress production of fetal corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion, thereby reducing hyperandrogenemia and preventing or reducing virilization of the external genitalia of affected females. This is accomplished by maternal administration of
         <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13214" href="/z/d/drug information/13214.html" rel="external">
          dexamethasone
         </a>
         , which is not degraded by the placenta and crosses into the fetal circulation. Because virilization of affected female fetuses begins as early as four to nine weeks gestation, therapy is only effective if it can be initiated in very early pregnancy. Unfortunately, because molecular diagnosis of CAH by chorionic villous sampling is not possible until 8 to 10 weeks of gestation, therapy must be initiated before the diagnosis can be confirmed. Since the risk of having an affected female fetus is only one in eight when both parents are known carriers, seven in eight fetuses will receive treatment who in retrospect are not affected females.

         is started as soon as the pregnancy is recognized and continued to term if subsequent testing demonstrates that the fetus is 46,XX and has CAH [
         <a href="#rid67">
          67,68
         </a>

Testing can be done at 10 weeks gestation, and turnaround time is several days. If this type of test is performed promptly at 10 weeks gestation, the karyotype results will be available before it can be determined by either chorionic villous sampling or amniocentesis and

          Growth hormone therapy
         </strong>
         – Because short stature commonly occurs in spite of good adrenal hormonal control during childhood and puberty, exogenous growth hormone therapy has been given to improve linear growth and adult height in patients with CAH. In some cases, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) therapy has been added to block excess androgen activity that promotes premature epiphyseal fusion. This is illustrated by the following studies [

         Bilateral adrenalectomy should be considered only in selected patients with CAH who have failed medical therapy, such as intractable hyperandrogenism or iatrogenic Cushing syndrome [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,93
         </a>
         ]. In children, hyperandrogenism causes virilization and accelerated linear growth; in females, it can also cause hirsutism, acne, and male-pattern balding, as well as infertility. The benefit of surgical adrenalectomy is that it lowers circulating adrenal androgen and progesterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) levels, thereby allowing lower doses of glucocorticoids. However, it also heightens the dependency on glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy and may increase the risk of adrenal crisis, especially for patients who do not adhere to therapy.

         Reported long-term (average five years) follow-up of 18 patients with CAH who underwent bilateral adrenalectomy revealed improved signs and symptoms of hyperandrogenism and less obesity after surgery [

          Goals of therapy
         </strong>
         – Most cases of classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) are caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Affected individuals require glucocorticoid replacement to normalize growth, sexual maturation, and, later, reproductive function. Mineralocorticoid replacement is given to maintain normal serum electrolyte concentrations, extracellular fluid volume, and plasma renin activity and to allow for lower glucocorticoid dosing. (See
         <a class="local">

          Initial management in neonates

         – Initial management depends on the reason that CAH is suspected (see

          Positive newborn screen

         – For newborn infants with a positive newborn screen suggesting CAH, a sample of blood should be obtained for confirmatory steroid hormone measurements (most importantly, urgent measurement of serum electrolytes and 17-OHP).
         <strong>
          After
         </strong>
         the confirmatory blood sample is obtained, treatment doses of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid as well as sodium chloride supplementation should be initiated in

          Atypical genital appearance
         </strong>
         – Newborn infants with atypical genital appearance require urgent medical attention to evaluate for CAH, which is the most common cause of virilization in 46,XX infants and can be complicated by adrenal crisis. The evaluation includes steroid hormone measurements (most importantly, 17-OHP), a karyotype, and a pelvic ultrasound to evaluate for müllerian structures. Evaluation for other rarer types of CAH may be indicated. (See

          Adrenal crisis
         </strong>
         – Some newborns with classic CAH present with adrenal crisis, which is characterized by hypotension or shock, and electrolyte abnormalities (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and hypoglycemia), typically during the second week of life (

         <strong>
          after
         </strong>
         a blood sample is obtained for serum steroid hormone measurements (most importantly, 17-OHP) to confirm the diagnosis of CAH. (See

          Mineralocorticoids
         </strong>
         – Mineralocorticoid replacement can often be tapered after four to six months of age but should be continued at lower doses thereafter to optimize growth velocity. Caution should be used to avoid excessive dosing, especially in the first 18 months of life, to avoid inducing hypertension as the neonatal kidney matures and becomes more sensitive to mineralocorticoids. Dosing should be guided by measurement of plasma renin activity and blood pressure. (See

         <strong>
          Monitoring response
         </strong>
         – Response to therapy is monitored by measuring serum 17-OHP, androstenedione, and plasma renin activity or direct renin, as well as growth velocity (measured by serial measurements of height), blood pressure, and the rate of skeletal maturation. Laboratory and clinical monitoring should be performed every month in the neonate and infant and every three to six months thereafter. Bone age should be measured every 6 to 12 months after two years of age until skeletal maturity. (See
         <a class="local">

          Prevention of adrenal crisis
         </strong>
         – Infants and children with classic CAH are at risk for developing an adrenal crisis, which is characterized by hypotension or shock, and electrolyte abnormalities (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and hypoglycemia) (

          table 1
         </a>
         ). To avoid an adrenal crisis, patients with CAH should be treated with stress doses of glucocorticoids when they become ill with fever or gastroenteritis, undergo surgery with general anesthesia, or have significant trauma. Fasting should be avoided, especially in the young child. (See
