          PROPERTIES OF TISSUE ADHESIVES
         </span>
         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Tissue adhesives were approved for minor wound repair in the United States in 1998, although they have been widely used in Europe and Canada for much longer [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. Although tissue adhesives other than the cyanoacrylates are available, this discussion will primarily be limited to cyanoacrylate polymers, since they are most commonly used for minor laceration repair. Commercially available tissue adhesives primarily contain n-butyl-2 cyanoacrylate (eg, Histoacryl Blue, PeriAcryl) or 2-octyl cyanoacrylate (eg, Dermabond, SurgiSeal).
        </p>
        <p>
         Cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives are liquid monomers that undergo an exothermic reaction on exposure to moisture (eg, on the skin surface), changing to polymers that form a strong tissue bond [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. When applied to a laceration, the polymer binds the wound edges together to permit normal healing of the underlying tissue.
        </p>
        <p>
         The chemical composition, especially the length of the side chain, largely determines key properties of the tissue adhesive. Shorter side chains (eg, methyl-2, ethyl-2, or n-butyl-2 cyanoacrylate) form tighter and stronger polymer bonds rapidly (within 15 seconds) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. However, these bonds are more brittle, resulting in a higher likelihood of wound dehiscence than long-chain adhesives.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tissue adhesives with longer side chains (eg, 2-octyl cyanoacrylate) form weaker bonds more slowly (approximately 30 seconds) but are less brittle and have a lower risk of wound dehiscence than short-chain adhesives [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, the addition of plasticizers also permits the longer chain compounds to form a flexible, more adherent bond [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Once applied, maximum bonding strength is achieved within 2.5 minutes of application. The tissue adhesives form a barrier to moisture and microbes over the wound, with adhesives with longer side chains taking longer to set [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. The bonded adhesives spontaneously slough off within 5 to 10 days.
        </p>
        <p>
         Compared with wounds closed with either absorbable or nonabsorbable sutures, the tensile strength of wounds closed by tissue adhesives is less at the time of initial application but equalizes by one week after repair [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3,5,6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Cyanoacrylates degrade into the toxic byproducts cyanoacetate and formaldehyde; these byproducts theoretically can cause an inflammatory response in the surrounding tissues that may compromise wound healing [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. However, the rate of degradation in currently used cyanoacrylates (eg, n-butyl-2 cyanoacrylate or 2-octyl cyanoacrylate) is slow enough that the compound has sloughed off before any significant accumulation of toxic byproducts can occur.
        </p>
        <p>
         Results of an in vitro study suggest that tissue adhesives may have inherent bactericidal activity against gram-positive organisms [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].

         The table describes key aspects of wounds that affect the selection of a wound closure method (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90472" href="/z/d/graphic/90472.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         We suggest that patients with short (&lt;5 cm) traumatic skin lacerations that are clean, have good wound approximation, and are under low wound tension undergo repair with tissue adhesives rather than sutures (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50913" href="/z/d/graphic/50913.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         and
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57566" href="/z/d/graphic/57566.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). Wounds that meet all of these criteria are typically located on the face, especially the forehead. If n-butyl-2 cyanoacrylate (eg, Histoacryl Blue, PeriAcryl) is used, then the length of the laceration should be &lt;4 cm to avoid wound dehiscence. The application of tissue adhesives is described below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Techniques'

         below.)
        </p>

         Based upon clinical experience and evidence from case series or reports, tissue adhesives may also provide closure for other types of wounds, including:

        <p>
         Based upon a meta-analysis of 13 small trials of children and adults with traumatic lacerations that were linear and under low tension, tissue adhesives were significantly less painful, quicker to apply (on average, five minutes faster), and produced similar cosmetic outcomes at 12 months compared with wounds repaired with sutures [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Tissue adhesives were associated with a small but significantly increased risk of wound dehiscence (risk difference 2 percent, number needed to harm: 40), although the clinical importance of this finding is unclear and the total number of wound dehiscences was low. Most traumatic lacerations undergoing repair in these studies were &lt;5 cm in length and were located on the face (eg, forehead).

         Caution should be used when applying tissue adhesives to wounds in patients with diabetes mellitus, chronic vascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, decubitus ulcers, prolonged steroid use, bleeding diathesis, or any other condition that may delay wound healing [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3,19
         </a>
         ]. However, tissue adhesives may be better than other options for wound closure in patients with poor wound healing, at least for small lacerations, because no foreign material is placed into the wound [

         Given the low pain of the procedure, we suggest that children undergoing minor wound repair with tissue adhesives receive a topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine-epinephrine-tetracaine [LET]) on an as-needed basis rather than injection of a local anesthetic. Many children do well without any analgesia, although topical anesthesia further decreases pain. For example, in a blinded trial of over 200 children undergoing wound closure with tissue adhesives, patients who received LET for anesthesia reported significantly less pain and were more likely to report a pain-free procedure than children who received placebo (52 versus 28 percent, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. However, the level of pain reported in both groups was low. Thus, if timing is an important factor, topical anesthesia may be omitted, especially in older patients.

         Wounds closed with tissue adhesives warrant thorough irrigation and cleansing [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,8

         A wall of antibiotic ointment or damp gauze may be placed around the laceration to prevent excess glue leakage around the wound. (See

         For deep lacerations, particularly to the torso and extremities, subcutaneous sutures should be placed prior to application of tissue adhesive [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,8

         The choice of adhesive does not have an important impact on wound outcomes as long as the clinician is aware of the differences between adhesives and uses appropriate technique. Both commonly used tissue adhesives (n-butyl-2 cyanoacrylate and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate) have similar efficacy for the closure of low-tension, traumatic lacerations &lt;4 cm in length [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. Repair with 2-octyl cyanoacrylate (eg, Dermabond, SurgiSeal) is associated with an increased sensation of warmth, especially if the high-viscosity formulation is used [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. N-butyl-2 cyanoacrylate (eg, Histoacryl Blue, PeriAcryl) complexes more quickly than 2-octyl cyanoacrylate but forms more brittle bonds, which increases the likelihood of wound dehiscence, although the risk of dehiscence is low for both agents. (See

         Wounds repaired by tissue adhesives do not require external bandages; the adhesive itself acts as a water-resistant bandage. Antibiotic ointment should not be used because it can break down the adhesive prematurely. The patient should receive tetanus prophylaxis as needed (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61087" href="/z/d/graphic/61087.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients may shower while the adhesive is on the skin but should not soak or scrub the area for 7 to 10 days. Wet skin should be gently patted dry. Children should not take baths if bathing would result in submersion of the affected area.
        </p>
        <p>
         The adhesive will peel off when the epithelial layer sloughs off, usually by 5 to 10 days [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3,5,27
         </a>
         ]. Antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly can be applied to the wound if the adhesive does not come off on its own.
        </p>
        <p>
         No follow-up visit is required unless there are signs of infection or nonhealing.

         Most complications of tissue adhesives relate to leakage onto unwanted areas, although improper wound preparation or use of adhesives on wounds at risk for infection can lead to cellulitis or abscess.

         Squeezing the vial too forcefully can result in adhesive draining away from the wound. This should be wiped off before it hardens. If the glue has set, it can be removed from adjacent skin by application of petroleum jelly or antibiotic ointment. Some authors recommend applying a protective periphery or "wall" of antibiotic ointment around the wound to prevent runoff and adhesion to adjacent structures. Gauze can also be used in the vicinity of the tissue adhesive to prevent adhesive runoff, but it should be moistened to decrease the probability of adherence to the skin [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. Moistened gauze should be squeezed well, however, because it should not wet the skin where the adhesive is applied.

         Care should be taken to prevent leakage of the adhesive onto the glove or the forceps because they can become glued to the patient [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,25
         </a>
         ]. Alternating the hands or briefly removing the forceps from the skin before the adhesive hardens helps to prevent this problem. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Techniques'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         If the wound is held together with fingers during repair, use of vinyl gloves helps reduce this complication because adhesion to vinyl gloves is substantially weaker than to rubber latex gloves [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. If adhesion occurs, mild tension is usually enough to separate the bond. If that fails, the glove can be removed and cut so that only a small piece of the glove remains attached to the patient.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tissue adhesives also stick less well to metal than to plastic forceps. If the instrument becomes attached to the patient, application of antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly and gentle traction typically suffices for removal.

         The eyes should be well protected during repair of adjacent lacerations. If adhesive gets into the eye or under the eyelid, or glues the eyelashes together, generous amounts of ophthalmic antibiotic ointment should be placed within the eye and on the eyelid to break down the adhesive [

          25,28,29
         </a>
         ]. Gentle manual traction typically permits reopening of eyelids that have been glued shut. If manual traction is unsuccessful, an ophthalmologist should be consulted. Once the eyelids are reopened, the patient should be assessed for corneal abrasion. (See

         – The currently used tissue adhesives include n-butyl-2 cyanoacrylate (eg, Histoacryl Blue, PeriAcryl) and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate (eg, Dermabond, SurgiSeal). Butyl cyanoacrylates set more quickly than octyl cyanoacrylates. (See

         <strong>
          Indications
         </strong>
         – In a patient with a short (&lt;5 cm) traumatic skin laceration that is clean, has good wound approximation, and is under low wound tension, we suggest repairing with tissue adhesives rather than sutures (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_4" rel="external">
          Grade 2A
         </a>
         ). Wounds that meet all of these criteria are typically located on the face, especially the forehead (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90472" href="/z/d/graphic/90472.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). If n-butyl-2 cyanoacrylate (eg, Histoacryl Blue, PeriAcryl) is used, then the length of the laceration should be &lt;4 cm to avoid wound dehiscence. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Indications'

          Pediatric pain control
         </strong>
         – In a child undergoing minor wound repair with tissue adhesives, we suggest a topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine-epinephrine-tetracaine [LET]) on an as-needed basis rather than injection of a local anesthetic (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Many children do well without any local anesthetic, although topical anesthesia further decreases pain. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Wound preparation
         </strong>
         – Wounds closed with tissue adhesives warrant thorough wound irrigation and cleansing. Because adhesives create an impermeable barrier over the wound, inadequate cleansing is associated with local infection and abscess formation. A wall of antibiotic ointment or damp gauze may be placed around the laceration to prevent excess glue leakage around the wound. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Wound preparation'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Patient positioning
         </strong>

         <strong>
          Aftercare
         </strong>
         – No external bandages are necessary over a wound closed by tissue adhesives. The adhesive itself acts as a water-resistant bandage. Antibiotic ointment should not be used as it can break down the adhesive prematurely. The adhesive will peel off when the epithelial layer sloughs off, usually by 5 to 10 days. Antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly can be applied to the wound if the adhesive does not come off on its own. No follow-up visit is required unless there are signs of infection or nonhealing. (See
         <a class="local">

          Complications
         </strong>
