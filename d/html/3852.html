         The global prevalence of hypertension is high, and among nonpregnant adults in the United States, treatment of hypertension is the most common reason for office visits and for the use of chronic prescription medications [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. In addition, roughly one-half of hypertensive individuals do not have adequate blood pressure control. The prevalence and control of hypertension are discussed in other topics. (See

         Isolated systolic hypertension is defined as a blood pressure ≥130 mmHg systolic and &lt;80 mmHg diastolic, and isolated diastolic hypertension is defined as a blood pressure &lt;130 mmHg systolic and ≥80 mmHg diastolic.

        <p>
         In general, definitions for hypertension are based upon the relationship between blood pressure and the incidence of cardiovascular events in large populations, derived from numerous observational studies and randomized trials, in which blood pressure was measured in various types of office settings with variable equipment and technique [

         When evaluating an individual patient, making the diagnosis of hypertension is complex and requires integration of repeated blood pressure measurements, using appropriate technique, both in and out of the office.

         The diagnosis of hypertension requires integration of home or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), whereas routine measurements made in the clinical setting should be used primarily for detection purposes. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Making the diagnosis of hypertension'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>

         The use of ABPM and home blood pressure monitoring in adults is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

        <p>
         The following diagnostic criteria were suggested by the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines; meeting one or more of these criteria using ABPM qualifies as confirmation of hypertension  (

         We find the daytime (awake) average of ≥130 mmHg systolic or ≥80 mmHg diastolic to be the most useful of these definitions.

        <p>
         Home readings correlate more closely with the results of daytime ambulatory measurements than with blood pressures that are typically obtained in the clinician's office (ie, using a manual cuff and stethoscope or using an oscillometric device with the care provider present in the room). We believe that hypertension can be confirmed by repeated home blood pressure readings that average ≥130/≥80 mmHg.

         Proper technique and interpretation of the blood pressure is essential in the diagnosis and management of hypertension. A number of steps should ideally be followed to achieve maximum accuracy  (

         <a href="#rid5">

        <p>
         Rather than an auscultatory device (one that requires a stethoscope), we recommend using an oscillometric blood pressure device designed specifically for the office setting. Automated devices can take multiple consecutive readings in the office with the patient sitting and resting alone (ie, unattended measurement) or with an observer present. Either unattended or attended automated office blood pressure (AOBP) measurement predict the results of awake ABPM better than traditional office blood pressure measurement and may reduce the white coat effect [

         Given the importance of obtaining accurate and reproducible blood pressure readings, we suggest that all providers work towards having access to ABPM, automated office blood pressure monitoring (AOBPM), or both.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, if AOBP measurement is not available, office measurements should be performed with the patient positioned properly and allowed to rest comfortably for at least five minutes, and measurements should be repeated at least twice  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115862" href="/z/d/graphic/115862.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). The average of these readings should also be provided to the patient.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to obtaining multiple blood pressure measurements, blood pressure should be measured in both arms, at least at the initial visit. In older individuals or those with potential orthostatic symptoms, postural measurements should also be taken:

         Systolic blood pressure readings in the left and right arms should be roughly equivalent. A discrepancy of more than 15 mmHg may indicate subclavian stenosis and, hence, peripheral arterial disease. If there is a significant difference in blood pressure between the two arms, the higher of the two should be used for measurement at subsequent visits. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3879.html" rel="external">

         Postural hypotension, defined as a 20 mmHg or greater fall in systolic pressure upon rising from supine to an unassisted upright position, should be pursued in patients over age 65 years, those experiencing dizziness or weakness upon standing, or those with diabetes or Parkinson disease.

         Twenty-four-hour ABPM is the preferred method for confirming the diagnosis of hypertension and white coat hypertension but has limited availability in routine clinical practice. High-quality data suggest that ABPM predicts target-organ damage and cardiovascular events better than office blood pressure readings. ABPM records the blood pressure at preset intervals (usually every 15 to 20 minutes during the day and every 30 to 60 minutes during sleep). ABPM can identify or confirm white coat and masked hypertension and can also be used to confirm normal blood pressure readings obtained by self-monitoring at home  (

         <a href="#rid13">

         ]. It is also the only method of blood pressure measurement that can reliably obtain nocturnal readings. (See

         Appropriate training and equipment are paramount to obtaining accurate home blood pressure readings. Patients should be instructed to use a validated, automated oscillometric device that measures blood pressure in the brachial artery (upper arm) and to perform measurements in a quiet room after five minutes of rest in the seated position with the back and arm supported and legs uncrossed. At least 12 to 14 measurements should be obtained, with both morning and evening measurements taken, over a period of one week every month  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115864" href="/z/d/graphic/115864.html" rel="external">
          table 6
         </a>
         ). Many patients require the use of a large cuff, usually sold separately. The mean of all available readings should be used for clinical decision-making.
        </p>
        <p>
         Moderate-quality data suggest that blood pressure taken at home or work by the patient correlates more closely with the results of 24-hour or daytime ambulatory monitoring, with AOBPM, and with target-organ damage than usual blood pressure taken in the office [

         Home readings should be used to complement office readings to determine whether a patient's blood pressure is under control. If there is a discrepancy between office and home blood pressures (ie, white coat or masked hypertension), ABPM should be obtained, if possible, to confirm the accuracy of home blood pressure measurements. If ABPM is not available, AOBPM can be used. (See

         Maintenance of arterial blood pressure is necessary for organ perfusion. In general, the arterial blood pressure is determined by the following equation:
        </p>
        <div class="formulaContainer">
         <div class="formula">
          <p>
           Blood pressure (BP)  =  Cardiac output (CO)  x  Systemic vascular resistance (SVR)
          </p>
         </div>
        </div>
        <p>
         Blood pressure reacts to changes in the environment to maintain organ perfusion over a wide variety of conditions. The primary factors determining the blood pressure are the sympathetic nervous system, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and the plasma volume (largely mediated by the kidneys).
        </p>
        <p>
         The pathogenesis of primary hypertension (formerly called "essential" hypertension) is poorly understood but is most likely the result of numerous genetic and environmental factors that have multiple compounding effects on cardiovascular and kidney structure and function. Some of these factors are discussed in the ensuing section.

         Quantitatively, hypertension is the most prevalent modifiable risk factor for premature cardiovascular disease, being more common than cigarette smoking, dyslipidemia, or diabetes, which are the other major risk factors [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. Hypertension often coexists with these other risk factors as well as with overweight/obesity, an unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity. The presence of more than one risk factor increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular events [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The likelihood of having a cardiovascular event increases as blood pressure increases. In a meta-analysis of over one million adults, risk began to rise in all age groups with blood pressures &gt;115 mmHg systolic or &gt;75 mmHg diastolic  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75106 graphicRef66793" href="/z/d/graphic/75106.html" rel="external">
          figure 2A-B

         ) [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. For every 20 mmHg higher systolic and 10 mmHg higher diastolic blood pressure, the risk of death from heart disease or strokes doubles.
        </p>
        <p>
         The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines for the management of hypertension summarized the available meta-analyses of observational data by comparing the cardiovascular risk of different blood pressure strata with a reference group that had a blood pressure &lt;120 mmHg systolic and &lt;80 mmHg diastolic [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. A blood pressure of 120 to 129 mmHg systolic and 80 to 84 mmHg diastolic was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.1 to 1.5 for cardiovascular events, and blood pressure of 130 to 139 mmHg systolic and 85 to 89 mmHg diastolic was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.5 to 2.0. This relationship was consistent across sex and race/ethnic subgroups but was somewhat attenuated among older adults.
        </p>
        <p>
         The prognostic significance of systolic and diastolic blood pressure as a cardiovascular risk factor appears to be age dependent. The systolic pressure and the pulse pressure are greater predictors of risk in patients over the age of 50 to 60 years [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. Under age 50 years, diastolic blood pressure is a better predictor of mortality than systolic readings [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. When the systolic blood pressure is &lt;130 mmHg, isolated diastolic hypertension does not predict an increased cardiovascular risk, regardless of age [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. Systolic hypertension and pulse pressure in older individuals are discussed in detail separately. (See

         Different clinical trials have used different definitions of hypertension and different methodology for measuring blood pressure. In addition, the relationship between blood pressure and cardiovascular risk is graded and continuous, without an obvious inflection point. Thus, we believe that the data supporting any particular threshold for the definition of hypertension are relatively
         <strong>

        <p>
         In an individual patient, we feel that making the diagnosis of hypertension requires the integration of multiple blood pressure readings, the use of appropriate technique, and also the use of measurements made outside of the usual office setting.

         </strong>
         who have an elevated office blood pressure, the diagnosis of hypertension should be confirmed using out-of-office blood pressure measurement whenever possible. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is considered the "gold standard" in determining out-of-office blood pressure. However, many payers require evidence of normal out-of-office readings (suspected white coat hypertension) for reimbursement of ABPM. As such, we suggest home blood pressure measurement as the initial strategy to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension in most patients [

         Hypertension is diagnosed if the mean home blood pressure, when measured with appropriate technique and with a device that has been validated in the office, is ≥130 mmHg systolic or ≥80 mmHg diastolic.

         ABPM is an alternative to home blood pressure monitoring in settings where ABPM is readily available, particularly if adequate home blood pressures cannot be obtained, if there is doubt about the validity of home readings or if there is a large discrepancy between office and home readings. When using ABPM, hypertension is diagnosed if the mean daytime blood pressure is ≥130 mmHg systolic or ≥80 mmHg diastolic.

         Occasionally, out-of-office confirmation of hypertension is not possible because of issues with availability of equipment, insurance, and cost. In these situations, a diagnosis of hypertension can be confirmed by serial (at least three) office-based blood pressure measurements spaced over a period of weeks to months with a mean of ≥130 mmHg systolic or ≥80 mmHg diastolic. While use of appropriate technique is important in all patients, it is particularly essential in those in whom the diagnosis of hypertension is based solely upon office readings  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115862" href="/z/d/graphic/115862.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). In settings where out-of-office blood pressure measurement is not readily available, we suggest using automated office blood pressure monitoring (AOBPM).

         Patients found to have an office blood pressure of ≥130 mmHg systolic or ≥80 mmHg diastolic but an out-of-office blood pressure (either mean daytime or mean home) of &lt;130 mmHg systolic and &lt;80 mmHg diastolic have
         <strong>

         hypertension rather than true hypertension [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. In patients with home readings suggestive of white coat hypertension, we recommend confirmation with ABPM  (

          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Patients with white coat hypertension should undergo reevaluation with out-of-office blood pressure monitoring at least yearly since these patients can develop hypertension over time.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients who have office readings of 120 to 129 mmHg systolic or 75 to 79 mmHg diastolic and established cardiovascular disease, known kidney disease, or elevated cardiovascular risk should also undergo out-of-office blood pressure measurement [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4

         ]. Patients with office blood pressure &lt;130 mmHg systolic and &lt;80 mmHg diastolic but an out-of-office blood pressure (either mean daytime or mean home) ≥130 mmHg systolic or ≥80 mmHg diastolic have
         <strong>
          masked
         </strong>
         hypertension. Although there are no randomized clinical trials, based upon risk, we believe that patients with masked hypertension should be treated the same as other patients with the diagnosis of hypertension.

         DASH diet – The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern is high in vegetables, fruits, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, poultry, fish, and nuts and low in sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages, and red meats. The DASH dietary pattern is consequently rich in potassium, magnesium, calcium, protein, and fiber but low in saturated fat, total fat, and cholesterol. A trial in which all food was supplied to normotensive or mildly hypertensive adults found that the DASH dietary pattern reduced blood pressure by 6/4 mmHg compared with a typical American-style diet that contained the same amount of sodium and the same number of calories. Combining the DASH dietary pattern with modest sodium restriction produced an additive antihypertensive effect. These trials and a review of diet in the treatment of hypertension are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         Exercise – Aerobic, dynamic resistance and isometric resistance exercise can decrease systolic and diastolic pressure by, on average, 4 to 6 mmHg and 3 mmHg, respectively, independent of weight loss. Most studies demonstrating a reduction in blood pressure have employed at least three to four sessions per week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise lasting approximately 40 minutes for a period of 12 weeks.

         In large-scale randomized trials, pharmacologic antihypertensive therapy, as compared with placebo, produces a nearly 50 percent relative risk reduction in the incidence of heart failure, a 30 to 40 percent relative risk reduction in stroke, and a 20 to 25 percent relative risk reduction in myocardial infarction [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]. These relative risk reductions correspond to the following absolute benefits: antihypertensive therapy for four to five years in patients whose blood pressure is 140 to 159 mmHg systolic or 90 to 99 mmHg diastolic prevents a coronary event in 0.7 percent of patients and a cerebrovascular event in 1.3 percent of patients for a total absolute benefit of approximately 2 percent  (

          59
         </a>
         ]. Thus, 100 patients must be treated for four to five years to prevent an adverse cardiovascular event in two patients. It is presumed that these statistics underestimate the true benefit of treating hypertension since these data were derived from trials of relatively short duration (five to seven years); this may be insufficient to determine the efficacy of antihypertensive therapy on longer-term diseases such as atherosclerosis and heart failure.

         Equal if not greater relative risk reductions have been demonstrated with antihypertensive treatment of older hypertensive patients (over age 65 years), most of whom have isolated systolic hypertension. Because advanced age is associated with higher overall cardiovascular risk, even modest and relatively short-term reductions in blood pressure may provide absolute benefits that are greater than that observed in younger patients [

         Randomized trials that demonstrated benefit from treating hypertension with antihypertensive drug therapy used a wide variety of inclusion criteria and variable techniques for measuring blood pressure. As a result, the decision to initiate antihypertensive therapy in individual patients, particularly those not well-represented in clinical trials, is sometimes uncertain.

         The decision to initiate drug therapy should be individualized and involve shared decision-making between patient and provider.

For these specific patient populations, we suggest an individualized approach with shared decision-making and would consider withholding antihypertensive therapy among those with recurrent falls, dementia, multiple comorbidities, orthostatic hypotension, residence in a nursing home, or limited life expectancy.

         Multiple guidelines and meta-analyses conclude that the degree of blood pressure reduction, not the choice of antihypertensive medication, is the major determinant of reduction in cardiovascular risk in patients with hypertension [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58,61-63
         </a>
         ]. Recommendations for the use of specific classes of antihypertensive medications are based upon clinical trial evidence of decreased cardiovascular risk, blood pressure-lowering efficacy, safety, and tolerability. Most patients with hypertension will require more than one blood pressure medication to reach goal blood pressure. Having multiple available classes of blood pressure medication permits clinicians to individualize therapy based upon individual patient characteristics and preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some patients have a "compelling" indication for a specific drug or drugs that is unrelated to primary hypertension  (

         Single-agent therapy will not adequately control blood pressure in most patients whose baseline systolic blood pressure is 15 mmHg or more above their goal. Combination therapy with drugs from different classes has a substantially greater blood pressure-lowering effect than doubling the dose of a single agent, often with a reduction in side effects seen with a higher dose of monotherapy [

When more than one agent is needed to control the blood pressure, we recommend therapy with a long-acting ACE inhibitor or ARB in concert with a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. Combination of an ACE inhibitor or ARB with a thiazide diuretic can also be used but may be less beneficial when

         If the above drug classes cannot be used due to intolerance or contraindication, a beta blocker, alpha blocker, or direct arterial vasodilators present other options. Generally, concomitant use of beta blockers and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should be avoided. Patients not controlled on a combination of three antihypertensive medications that are taken at reasonable doses and that include a diuretic are considered to have drug-resistant hypertension (once nonadherence and white coat effect have been eliminated as possibilities).

         The ultimate goal of antihypertensive therapy is a reduction in cardiovascular events. The higher the absolute cardiovascular risk, the more likely it is that a patient will benefit from a more aggressive blood pressure goal. However, although cardiovascular events generally decrease with more intensive lowering of blood pressure, the risk of adverse effects, cost, and patient inconvenience increase as more medication is added.

         The authors suggest a goal blood pressure of &lt;130 mmHg systolic and &lt;80 mmHg diastolic using out-of-office measurements (or, if out-of-office blood pressure is not available, then an average of appropriately measured office readings) in most patients who qualify for antihypertensive pharmacologic therapy. Identifying patients for initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy is presented above. (See

         However, there is some disagreement among UpToDate authors and editors.

         Severe hypertension (usually a diastolic blood pressure above 120 mmHg) in asymptomatic patients who are not experiencing acute end-organ damage is referred to as hypertensive urgency [

          4

         Elevated blood pressure is common in hospitalized patients. High-quality data examining blood pressure treatment targets in hospitalized patients are lacking. In large observational studies of patients admitted for noncardiovascular causes, intensive blood pressure lowering, defined as intravenous antihypertensive therapy or addition of an oral agent that the patient was not previously taking, was associated with a greater risk of acute myocardial infarction and acute kidney injury [
         <a href="#rid72">
          72,73
         </a>
         ]. Thus, for most patients hospitalized for noncardiovascular causes, we do not initiate or intensify antihypertensive therapy when elevated blood pressure is asymptomatic. Conversely, antihypertensive intensification may be necessary in some asymptomatic hospitalized patients with persistently elevated blood pressure to prevent complications during certain planned procedures, such as surgery.
        </p>
        <p>
         In contrast, patients hospitalized for cardiovascular causes (eg, myocardial infarction, stroke) frequently need intensification of antihypertensive therapy. Patients with acute hypertensive end-organ damage (ie, hypertensive emergency) also require blood pressure lowering in the hospital. These issues are discussed in individual topic reviews. (See

         The majority of patients with hypertension will require lifelong antihypertensive drug therapy to control their blood pressure. However, patients on a stable antihypertensive medication regimen with blood pressure at goal for at least one year may be candidates for antihypertensive tapering. Reduction and cessation are more likely to be successful in younger patients, those with lower pretreatment blood pressure, and those who initiate and adhere to lifestyle modifications [

         Proper technique and interpretation of the blood pressure is essential in the diagnosis and management of hypertension (see

         A number of steps should ideally be followed to achieve maximum accuracy of office measurement  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115862" href="/z/d/graphic/115862.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Rather than an auscultatory device (one that requires a stethoscope), we recommend using an oscillometric blood pressure device designed specifically for the office setting. Automated office blood pressure (AOBP) devices can take multiple consecutive readings in the office with the patient sitting and resting alone (ie, unattended measurement) or with an attendant present. Either unattended or attended AOBP better predicts the results of awake (daytime) ABPM than traditional office blood pressure measurement and may reduce the white coat effect. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Office-based blood pressure measurement'
         </a>

         ABPM is the preferred method for confirming the diagnosis of hypertension. High-quality data suggest that ABPM predicts target organ damage and cardiovascular events better than office blood pressure readings. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring'

         To measure blood pressure at home, patients should be instructed to use a validated, automated oscillometric device that measures blood pressure in the brachial artery (upper arm) and to perform measurements in a quiet room after five minutes of rest in the seated position with the back and arm supported and legs uncrossed. At least 12 to 14 measurements should be obtained, with both morning and evening measurements taken, over a period of one week each month. (See

         In an individual patient, we feel that making the diagnosis of hypertension requires the integration of multiple blood pressure readings, the use of appropriate technique, and also the use of measurements made outside of the usual office setting  (

          all other patients

         who have an elevated office blood pressure, the diagnosis of hypertension should be confirmed using out-of-office blood pressure measurement whenever possible. ABPM is considered the "gold standard" in determining out-of-office blood pressure. However, many payers require evidence of normal out-of-office readings (suspected white coat hypertension) for reimbursement of ABPM. As such, we suggest home blood pressure measurement as the initial strategy to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension in most patients:

         <span class="glyph">

         Hypertension is diagnosed if the mean home blood pressure, when measured with appropriate technique and with a device that has been validated in the office, is ≥130 mmHg systolic or ≥80 mmHg diastolic.
        </p>
        <p>

         ABPM is an alternative to home blood pressure monitoring in settings where ABPM is readily available, particularly if adequate home blood pressures cannot be obtained, if there is doubt about the validity of home readings, or if there is a large discrepancy between office and home readings. When using ABPM, hypertension is diagnosed if the mean daytime blood pressure is ≥130 mmHg systolic or ≥80 mmHg diastolic.

         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         Occasionally, out-of-office confirmation of hypertension is not possible because of issues with availability of equipment, insurance, and cost. In these situations, a diagnosis of hypertension can be confirmed by serial (at least three) office-based blood pressure measurements spaced over a period of weeks to months with a mean of ≥130 mmHg systolic ≥80 mmHg diastolic. While use of appropriate technique is important in all patients, it is particularly essential in those in whom the diagnosis of hypertension is based solely upon office readings  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115862" href="/z/d/graphic/115862.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         However, in patients who have stage 1 hypertension (130 to 139 mmHg systolic or 80 to 89 mmHg diastolic), we would consider withholding antihypertensive therapy among those 75 years or older or those who do not have established cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease if, in addition, they have recurrent falls, dementia, multiple comorbidities, orthostatic hypotension, residence in a nursing home, or limited life expectancy. (See

         Some patients have a "compelling" indication for a specific drug or drugs that are unrelated to primary hypertension  (

         Our suggestions for goal blood pressure are as follows and depend upon the patient's baseline risk of having a cardiovascular event (see

         We suggest a goal blood pressure of &lt;130 mmHg systolic and &lt;80 mmHg diastolic using out-of-office measurements (or, if out-of-office blood pressure is not available, then an average of appropriately measured office readings) in most patients who qualify for antihypertensive pharmacologic therapy.

         However, there is some disagreement among UpToDate authors and editors. Some believe that, among selected hypertensive patients who qualify for antihypertensive therapy but who are at low absolute cardiovascular risk, a less aggressive goal blood pressure of &lt;135 mmHg systolic and &lt;85 mmHg diastolic (using out-of-office measurement) or &lt;140 mmHg systolic and &lt;90 mmHg diastolic (using an average of appropriately measured office readings) is appropriate.

         In older adults with severe frailty, dementia, and/or a limited life expectancy, or in patients who are nonambulatory or institutionalized (eg, reside in a skilled nursing facility), we individualize goals and share decision-making with the patient, relatives, and caretakers, rather than targeting one of the blood pressure goals mentioned above.
