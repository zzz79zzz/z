Symptoms and signs remain indefinitely if the brain becomes irreversibly damaged and infarction occurs. Unfortunately, the presence of neurologic symptoms does not accurately reflect the presence or absence of infarction, and the tempo of the symptoms is not diagnostic for the cause of the ischemia [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. This is a critical issue because treatment depends upon accurately identifying the cause of symptoms, and the nature, location, and severity of causative cardiac, hematologic, and cerebrovascular abnormalities.</p><p>The differential diagnosis of transient ischemic attack and stroke will be reviewed here. The evaluation of stroke and transient cerebral ischemia are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1083.html" rel="external">"Overview of the evaluation of stroke"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1123.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of transient ischemic attack and minor ischemic stroke"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1479495623"><span class="h1">PERSISTENT NEUROLOGIC DEFICITS WITH ABRUPT ONSET</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ischemic strokes are characterized by the abrupt or at least very acute onset of focal neurologic symptoms and signs that leave persistent neurologic deficits. Other disorders that have acute onset and cause persistent focal signs should be considered in the differential diagnosis.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intracerebral hemorrhages usually develop during minutes and cause gradually increasing focal signs. Patients with large hemorrhages often develop headache, vomiting, and reduced consciousness; these findings are typically absent in patients with small hemorrhages.

In addition, some tumors which are outside the brain (eg, meningiomas) reach a critical mass and can cause abrupt displacement of brain tissue with the sudden onset of symptoms.

Most often however, MS attacks develop over 5 to 21 days, a longer period than strokes. MS is most common in the third to fifth decades of life, while the frequency of stroke peaks later. A history of prior attacks is very important in making the diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1689.html" rel="external">"Manifestations of multiple sclerosis in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Demyelination can occur around veins after various viral infections which result in the abrupt onset of multifocal signs that develop over days. This disorder is often called acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Other viral infections, particularly cytomegalovirus, can cause focal brain lesions associated with focal neurologic signs.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined as a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, without acute infarction. In keeping with this definition of TIA, ischemic stroke is defined as an infarction of central nervous system tissue. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1088.html" rel="external">"Definition, etiology, and clinical manifestations of transient ischemic attack", section on 'Definition of TIA'</a>.)</p><p>The term "transient ischemic attack" was first introduced in the early 1950s based upon the recognition that a transient focal loss of neurologic function often preceded strokes [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. In the years after this initial description in patients with carotid artery disease, various groups and committees arbitrarily defined TIAs as lasting less than 24 hours [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. However, this classic definition of TIA was inadequate for several reasons. Most notably, there is risk of permanent tissue injury (ie, infarction) even when focal transient neurologic symptoms last less than one hour.</p><p>Subsequent data showed that ischemic attacks that last longer than one hour are most often associated with brain infarction [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. Most TIAs last less than one hour [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Thus, the benign connotation of TIA has been replaced by an understanding that even relatively brief ischemia can cause permanent brain injury. When strokes develop after a TIA, they almost always have the same cause as the TIA. Strokes occur most often within days or weeks after the TIA.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Symptoms of TIA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Transient ischemic attacks are caused by decreased blood flow to a local portion of the brain. Decreased perfusion can be due to blockage of blood flow to a brain region from an in-situ occlusion of a supply artery, or from embolism to that artery. Symptoms are <strong>focal</strong>, suggesting that they relate to dysfunction of a localized area of the brain. Symptoms are also <strong>transient</strong> when the arterial blockage passes (eg, following dissolution or distal passage of an embolus) or when collateral circulation is able to restore adequate perfusion to the region of ischemia. The symptoms and signs may fluctuate depending upon the adequacy of perfusion, which is in turn related to systemic factors (eg, blood volume, cardiac output, blood pressure, blood viscosity) and local factors (eg, propagation and embolization of clot, development of collateral circulation).</p><p>The symptoms of TIAs depend upon the underlying vascular cause  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71676" href="/d/graphic/71676.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. When ischemia is caused by penetrating artery disease, for example, the symptoms are usually stereotyped (eg, numbness of the face, arm, and leg on one side of the body, or hemiparesis). In contrast, attacks due to large artery occlusive disease have different symptoms in different attacks:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When the carotid artery is narrowed or occluded, patients may have monocular blindness on the side of the occlusive lesion, weakness of the contralateral hand, or aphasia [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Occlusive lesions of the internal carotid artery in the neck or head, or of its major intracranial branches, the middle and anterior cerebral arteries, cause loss of cerebral hemisphere functions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Occlusive lesions of the vertebral arteries in the head and neck and of the basilar artery cause brainstem and cerebellar symptoms and deficits.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Occlusive disease of the posterior cerebral arteries (PCAs) causes visual and somatosensory symptoms due to loss of function in the lateral thalamus and occipital lobe regions supplied by the PCAs.</p><p></p><p>Thus, some TIAs, such as those causing transient monocular blindness, diplopia, and aphasia, are very specific for one vascular territory, while others, such as limb weakness or numbness, are compatible with a number of different territories.</p><p>The occurrence of a TIA is not helpful in predicting the presence of brain damage, the cause and mechanism of the ischemia, or the prognosis [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Transient brain ischemia can be caused by a variety of different conditions (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1088.html" rel="external">"Definition, etiology, and clinical manifestations of transient ischemic attack"</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Brain embolism arising from the heart, aorta, or proximal arterial vessels.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Occlusive lesions of either large extracranial or intracranial arteries. These large artery lesions are associated with intermittent hypoperfusion of the symptomatic regions of the brain, or with embolization of fibrin-platelet (white thrombi) or erythrocyte-fibrin (red thrombi) clots into the distal brain circulation. Emboli often break up or pass through the vasculature, explaining the transiency of the neurologic symptoms.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Occlusive lesions (either lipohyalinosis or atheromatous branch disease) of small microscopic-sized intracranial arteries and arterioles.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypercoagulability and diseases that cause thrombosis of small vessels (eg, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">TRANSIENT NEUROLOGIC EVENTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The differential diagnosis of TIAs includes all other causes of transient "spells." The Australians often use the nonspecific word "turns" for such transient episodes of neurologic dysfunction.</p><p>In addition to TIAs, the most important and frequent causes of discrete self-limited attacks include  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111740" href="/d/graphic/111740.html" rel="external">table 2</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Seizure</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Migraine aura</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Syncope</p><p></p><p>Some disorders mentioned above cause focal abnormalities of brain function, while others cause dysfunction that is either widespread or difficult to localize to any one anatomic region  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62326" href="/d/graphic/62326.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Certain disorders may also cause both focal and nonfocal attacks. Seizures, for example, can begin and remain focal or can be generalized. Similarly, patients with hypoglycemia usually have global deficits in alertness and cognition, but on occasion can have focal symptoms such as hemiplegia [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>The term "transient neurological attack" (TNA) has been proposed to describe sudden neurologic symptoms that completely resolve within 24 hours, with no clear evidence to support a diagnosis of migraine, epilepsy, Ménière disease, hyperventilation, cardiac syncope, hypoglycemia, or orthostatic hypotension [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The symptoms of TNAs can be focal, nonfocal, or mixed. In this classification, focal TNAs represent TIAs, while TNAs with nonfocal or mixed symptoms are heterogeneous in terms of etiology. Like TIAs, both nonfocal and mixed TNAs appear to be associated with an increased risk of stroke [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. In addition, some patients diagnosed with TNAs by experienced stroke neurologists have evidence of acute ischemic brain lesions on diffusion-weighted MRI [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. This finding suggests that clinical features alone do not always distinguish TIA from TNA.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Seizure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An epileptic seizure refers to a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormally excessive neuronal activity of the brain. Seizures, especially repeated focal seizures, can be followed by postictal paralysis or loss of other functions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2219.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of the first seizure in adults", section on 'Postictal period'</a>.)</p><p>Nonepileptic seizures are characterized by sudden changes in behavior that resemble epileptic seizures but are not associated with the typical neurophysiological changes that characterize epileptic seizures. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2227.html" rel="external">"Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>The symptoms of seizures and nonepileptic paroxysmal events are diverse. These are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2219.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of the first seizure in adults", section on 'Initial evaluation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2230.html" rel="external">"Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders in adolescents and adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Migraine aura</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Migraine aura is the complex of neurologic symptoms that often accompanies migraine headache. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3348.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults", section on 'Migraine aura'</a>.)</p><p>An aura presents as a progressive neurologic deficit or disturbance with subsequent complete recovery. Auras are thought to be caused by cortical spreading depression occurring in regions of the cortex that correspond to the clinical manifestations of the aura. Patients often have a history of migraine or migraine with auras that dates back years, sometimes beginning in childhood and adolescence. This contrasts with TIAs, which seldom recur over more than a few months.</p><p>Auras typically occur before the onset of migraine headache, and the headache usually begins simultaneously with or just after the end of the aura phase. However, headache onset can rarely occur an hour or more after the end of the aura phase. Although atypical, an aura can develop during or after the onset of headache, and many patients have migraine aura with only a minimal or no headache.</p><p>Most migraine auras resolve in 20 to 30 minutes and seldom last more than one hour. Typical auras may involve one or more of visual disturbances, sensory symptoms, motor weakness, or speech disturbances. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Visual disturbances are the most common type of aura. Visual auras usually begin with seeing a small formed object or objects. The objects vary; stars, circles, squares, zig-zags, pointed lines, fire-flies, lightning bolts, heat waves, pinwheels, rods, beads are a few of the names given by patients. At times, the forms are linear and have angles and straight edges. The resemblance of the edges and lines to forts led to frequent use of the term "fortifications" and fortification spectra to describe this visual experience. Often the forms are bright and may be colored, especially red, green, blue, extra white, or purple. Migraineurs usually describe some type of motion, both in place and across the visual field. In-place motion is often described as flickering, shimmering, rotating, oscillating, or like a kaleidoscope. A key feature of the visual symptoms is buildup of the visual forms. The forms often become brighter, larger, and more objects may appear with time. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Characteristically, the forms often move slowly across the visual field leaving a void or darkness (ie, a scotoma) in their wake. Often, as the forms move, the scotoma enlarges. In some patients, the predominant symptom is loss of vision without illusory forms. This can take the form of a black spot, but, more often, the visual loss is that of a hemianopia. Altitudinal or quadrantic visual field defects occur occasionally but are not common. The visual field loss is usually binocular and very similar in the two eyes. It may begin abruptly or progress over a few minutes. Total obscuration of vision with dimness or blackness also occurs. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In most patients, the visual symptoms are the only aura symptom. In some patients, the visual symptoms are followed by paresthesias or other sensory phenomena. Less often, the attacks begin or consist solely of somatosensory symptoms. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Somatosensory symptoms are the second most common type of migraine aura. Tingling, prickling, pins-and-needles, and numbness are the most common descriptions used to describe sensory phenomena. They may begin anywhere but probably favor the face and hand (cheiro-oral). A march, spread, or buildup of the somatosensory symptoms is characteristic. At times, the paresthesia spread from one finger to the next, gradually spreading up the hand to the wrist, then to the arm, and then to the shoulder. Most often the initial symptoms are "positive," that is, paresthesia and other spontaneous abnormal sensations rather than a loss of feeling. When the paresthesia move up a limb, they often leave a numbness and loss of feeling in their wake. The parallel between the visual and somatosensory symptoms is clear. A spread or march of positive phenomena (eg, scintillations, sparkles, paresthesias) followed in the wake of the slow spread by negative phenomena (eg, loss of vision, scotomas, and numbness). Like the visual scintillations, the march of paresthesias is relatively slow, much slower than in a seizure, in which the sensory march usually takes seconds. Some patients only note numbness and have no paresthetic symptoms.</p><p></p><p>When visual symptoms precede sensory symptoms, the visual symptoms usually, but not always, clear before the sensory symptoms begin. The march of symptoms includes not only gradual spread within each modality, such as vision and sensation, but also a gradual changeover from one modality to another. </p><p>Late-life migraine accompaniments are symptoms related to the onset of migraine aura without headache in patients who are 50 years of age or older. The most common symptoms are visual auras, followed by sensory auras (paresthesia), speech disturbances, and motor auras (weakness or paralysis). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3348.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults", section on 'Late-life migraine accompaniments'</a>.)</p><p>The relationship between migraine and ischemic stroke is discussed in detail separately.

Syncope is caused by an interruption of energy sources to the brain, usually because of a sudden reduction of cerebral perfusion.</p><p>Common types of syncope include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Neurocardiogenic (vasovagal) syncope</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Situational syncope (during or immediately after urination, defecation, cough, or swallowing)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Orthostatic syncope (associated with orthostatic hypotension)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Syncope related to cardiac ischemia or cardiac arrhythmia</p><p></p><p>These are reviewed in detail elsewhere.

The amnesia resolves within 24 hours. Most patients are middle aged or older adults. Episodes are usually not recurrent, but some patients have infrequent attacks that recur over several years.</p><p>The etiology of TGA is uncertain.

Seizures occasionally cause paralytic attacks but, on close observation, there are usually features of the history and physical examination that suggest the presence of a seizure disorder such as minor twitching of a finger or toe or a tingling sensation in the affected limb [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h2">Progression and course</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The progression and course of the symptoms are also helpful in the differential diagnosis. Migraine aura often progresses slowly within one modality. As an example, scintillations or bright objects tend to move slowly across the visual field. Paresthesia may gradually progress from one finger, to all the digits, to the wrist, forearm, shoulder, trunk, and then the face and leg. This progression normally occurs over minutes. After the positive symptoms move, they are often followed by loss of function. The moving train of visual scintillations may end in a scotoma or visual field defect. Similarly, as paresthesia travel centripetally, they may leave the initial areas of skin numb and devoid of feeling.</p><p>Migrainous aura typically progresses from one modality to another; after the visual symptoms clear, paresthesia begins. When paresthesia clear, aphasia or other cortical function abnormalities may develop [<a href="#rid15">15-17</a>].</p><p>In contrast to migraine:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Seizures usually consist of positive phenomena in one modality which progress very quickly over seconds.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>TIA symptoms are negative; when more than one modality or function is involved, all are affected at about the same time.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Loss of consciousness is very common in seizures and syncope, which usually produce relatively stereotyped attacks; in comparison, loss of consciousness is rare in TIAs, and symptoms can be stereotyped or different in various TIAs.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h2">Duration and tempo</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The duration and tempo of attacks also are useful in predicting the cause:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Migrainous auras characteristically last 20 to 30 minutes, although they may persist for hours</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>TIAs are usually fleeting, usually lasting less than one hour</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Seizures last on average about 30 seconds to 3 minutes; some seizures, including absence attacks, atonic seizures and myoclonic jerks, are shorter in duration</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Syncope is very brief (seconds) unless the patient is artificially propped up or otherwise cannot obtain a supine position</p><p></p><p>Seizures occur sporadically over the years but sometimes appear in flurries.

As examples, vasovagal syncope commonly occurs when patients see blood, have or are about to have phlebotomy or other medical procedures, see an electric saw poised to remove a plaster cast on their arm or leg, stand up for a long time in church, or when a dental drill is aimed directly at their open mouth by a dentist. Hypovolemia also frequently precipitates syncope.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h2">Associated symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Non-neurologic associated symptoms can be characteristic of certain disorders. Headache is common after migraine aura and following a seizure. Headache can also occur during a TIA, but rarely at the same time or directly after neurologic symptoms.</p><p>A bitten tongue, incontinence, and muscle aches are frequently associated with seizure. Vomiting is common after migraine and occasionally follows syncope, but is rare after or during TIA and rare in relation to seizure. In the latter circumstance, vomiting may develop after the patient has lost consciousness; patients do not recall vomiting unless they see the vomitus when they awaken.

In otherwise healthy women who are pregnant, transient focal neurologic symptoms are often related to migraine with aura, and usually have a benign outcome [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p>Syncope has little predilection for age, but is more common in women.
