Transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) remains a first-line therapy for many complications associated with SCD and can be life-saving.</p><p>Blood transfusion carries risks, many of which are greater in individuals with SCD than in the general population. The approach to transfusion must balance these benefits and risks, both in decisions regarding when to transfuse and in the practical aspects of how transfusions are administered.</p><p>Here we discuss our approach to transfusion in children and adults with SCD. Complications of transfusion unique to this population, including high rates of alloimmunization and iron overload, are discussed separately.

In either Hb SS or compound heterozygotes, the majority (more than 50 percent) of hemoglobin (Hb) is sickle Hb (Hb S). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7113.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of sickle cell disorders", section on 'Terminology'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Transfusion</strong> – Simple transfusion refers to transfusion of RBCs without removal of the patient's blood. Exchange transfusion involves transfusion of RBCs together with removal of the patient's blood. Exchange transfusion can be performed manually or via an automated apheresis using an extracorporeal continuous flow device (also called apheresis, cytapheresis, or hemapheresis).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13340695"><span class="h1">RATIONALE FOR TRANSFUSION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Blood transfusion therapy in SCD can serve two roles, either for therapy (typically for life-threatening, SCD-related complications) or for prophylaxis, to decrease the incidence of specific SCD-related complications. In both cases, blood transfusion does more than simply raise the hemoglobin (Hb) level for oxygen delivery; transfusion also lowers the percentage of sickle Hb (Hb S) and increases Hb oxygen saturation, both of which decrease the propensity for vaso-occlusion. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7135.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology of sickle cell disease"</a>.)</p><p>At least four mechanisms contribute to the benefit of blood transfusion therapy in treating vaso-occlusive events and decreasing the incidence of SCD-related complications [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dilution of Hb S-containing red blood cells (RBCs) via the addition of Hb A-containing cells from the blood of normal donors</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Suppression of erythropoietin release caused by the rise in Hgb, thereby reducing the production of new Hb S-containing cells</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decrease in percentage of Hb S-containing cells due to the longer circulating lifespan of Hb A-containing cells</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increase in Hgb oxygen saturation levels by approximately 1 to 6 percent, which increases oxygen delivery to the tissues [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]</p><p></p><p>These mechanisms, together with findings from trials in various clinical settings, inform our recommendations regarding when to transfuse individuals with SCD. (See <a class="local">'Indications for transfusion'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H698978"><span class="h2">Reducing Hb S percentage</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prophylactic RBC transfusions, typically with a goal of reducing the maximum Hb S level to below 30 percent in individuals with homozygous sickle mutation (Hb SS), have been shown to reduce the incidence of vaso-occlusive pain and acute chest syndrome (ACS) events. In contrast, simple blood transfusion given at the time of an uncomplicated vaso-occlusive pain episode (eg, to raise the Hgb level to 10 g/dL) has not been demonstrated to hasten recovery, despite the chronic baseline anemia seen in SCD.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H698984"><span class="h2">Increasing oxygenation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the preoperative setting, simple blood transfusion with a goal Hb of approximately 10 g/dL is associated with a decreased incidence of postoperative vaso-occlusive events. In either a simple or exchange transfusion, the Hb S level is not required to be assessed, only because the goal is to successfully raise the hemoglobin to approximately 10 g/dL, or if already above 10 g/dL, to provide some normal hemoglobin. Simple blood transfusion to increase the hemoglobin level has not been demonstrated to hasten recovery in the setting of uncomplicated vaso-occlusive events.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9587051"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS FOR TRANSFUSION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9587127"><span class="h2">Overview of indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We use red cell transfusion in clinical scenarios where there is strong or compelling evidence of the benefit of reduced morbidity (eg, stroke prevention, reduction of acute chest syndrome [ACS]).</p><p>The largest <strong>misuse</strong> of blood transfusion therapy is simple transfusion in an adult or child with SCD admitted to the hospital for an uncomplicated vaso-occlusive pain episode without symptomatic anemia. In such a situation, there is no evidence that simple transfusion therapy will abate the pain episode, and there is a finite risk of transfusion-related complications, including the increased risk for alloimmunization [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>].</p><p>For more complex cases, in which pain occurs in the setting of severe or symptomatic anemia, transfusion may be appropriate. In such cases, blood transfusion should not be used as a substitute for acute and chronic pain management, and pain management should not be delayed while awaiting blood transfusion or an evaluation for the cause of anemia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7114.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease", section on 'Pain management'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7144.html" rel="external">"Acute vaso-occlusive pain management in sickle cell disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6254.html" rel="external">"Pain in children: Approach to pain assessment and overview of management principles"</a>.)</p><p>Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion therapy for individuals with SCD can be categorized as therapeutic or prophylactic. Accepted indications for transfusion therapy in individuals with SCD include the following [<a href="#rid7">7-10</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acute therapeutic</strong> – Transfusions are used acutely for the treatment of hemodynamic compromise, ACS, acute cerebral infarct, transient ischemic attack, multiple organ failure, or acute single organ failure. Examples include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Acute stroke. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5926.html" rel="external">"Acute stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) in children and adults with sickle cell disease", section on 'TIA and ischemic stroke management'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>ACS. (See <a class="local">'Acute chest syndrome treatment and prevention'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16353.html" rel="external">"Acute chest syndrome (ACS) in sickle cell disease (adults and children)", section on 'Transfusion'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Acute multi-organ failure. (See <a class="local">'Multiorgan failure'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Acute symptomatic anemia (eg, onset of heart failure, dyspnea, hypotension, marked fatigue). (See <a class="local">'Symptomatic or severe anemia'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A drop in baseline reticulocyte count (relative reticulocytopenia) with symptoms of acute hemodynamic compromise (increased pulse, decreased oxygen saturation, change in mental status, poor perfusion, orthostatic blood pressure changes). This indicates decreased red cell production, most commonly associated with parvovirus B19 infection, but it can occur with any infection. (See <a class="local">'Symptomatic or severe anemia'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hepatic or splenic sequestration, in which a large number of red cells become trapped in the spleen or liver resulting in a precipitous decline in hemoglobin level. (See <a class="local">'Symptomatic or severe anemia'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prophylaxis</strong> – Prophylactic transfusion is used to reduce perioperative complications in patients with SCD undergoing surgery and to reduce the incidence of a range of vaso-occlusive complications of SCD. (See <a class="local">'Prophylactic preoperative transfusion'</a> below and <a class="local">'Prophylactic (regularly scheduled) transfusion'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>The potential benefit of transfusion therapy must be weighed against potential risks, including transfusion reactions, blood-borne viral infection, iron overload, and alloimmunization. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/128123.html" rel="external">"Transfusion in sickle cell disease: Management of complications including iron overload", section on 'Alloimmunization and hemolysis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9587206"><span class="h2">Symptomatic or severe anemia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>SCD is characterized by chronic, compensated hemolytic anemia. Typically, symptoms of acute anemia develop when this compensation is impaired (eg, from bone marrow aplasia) or when the demand for RBCs increases (from splenic sequestration, bleeding, or accelerated hemolysis). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7119.html" rel="external">"Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease", section on 'Anemia'</a>.)</p><p>As discussed separately, the possibility of a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) should also be evaluated; in some individuals with SCD who have a DHTR, the direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test may be only weakly positive or negative. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/128123.html" rel="external">"Transfusion in sickle cell disease: Management of complications including iron overload", section on 'Alloimmunization and hemolysis'</a>.)</p><p>Given that symptomatic anemia will always be superimposed on chronic anemia, the baseline hemoglobin (Hb) level and reticulocyte count are critical information in determining whether the symptoms are caused by a drop in the Hgb level and thus whether transfusion is needed. When evaluating reductions in Hb levels below an individual's baseline, it is also important to distinguish between normal, day-to-day variability of biologic anemia and a clinically significant change.</p><p>We typically suggest simple transfusion for children and adults if the Hgb level is at least 2 g/dL below the patient's baseline and there are new signs or symptoms of anemia, or if there is a progressive trend for a decreasing Hb over several days without a compensatory increase in reticulocyte count. Symptoms may include tachycardia, postural hypotension, dizziness, mental status change, dyspnea, or congestive heart failure [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>Children with SCD who have severe anemia (hemoglobin &lt;5.5 g/dL) are at significant risk for brain ischemia on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Although high-quality data are lacking for absolute thresholds, based on our clinical experience, we transfuse all children with Hgb &lt;6 g/dL, unless there are major extenuating circumstances. (See <a class="local">'Simple versus exchange transfusion'</a> below.) </p><p>For adults, the threshold to transfuse is more complicated and should be based on the chronicity of the severe anemia, the underlying co-morbidities, and clinical symptoms. For adults with acute symptoms, we would typically transfuse if the hemoglobin is at least 2 g/dL below their baseline, with acute clinical symptoms, signs of hemodynamic compromise, or increased respiratory effort or oxygen requirement to keep the oxygen saturation above 92 percent.</p><p>Additional information regarding Hb thresholds used for simple transfusion in children and adults with severe anemia (without SCD) is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5910.html" rel="external">"Red blood cell transfusion in infants and children: Indications", section on 'General principles'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7948.html" rel="external">"Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for RBC transfusion in adults", section on 'Overview of our approach'</a>.)</p><p>We transfuse one or two units of RBCs for adults and a volume based on weight for children. (See <a class="local">'Blood transfusion volumes'</a> below.)</p><p>Many individuals with SCD receiving blood transfusion therapy for acute management of their disease may also be receiving <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8543" href="/d/drug information/8543.html" rel="external">hydroxyurea</a>. In this situation, no adjustment needs to be made other than to determine whether the requirement for blood transfusion therapy is secondary to reticulocytopenia associated with hydroxyurea therapy.</p><p>The following common causes of acute anemia in individuals with SCD can be distinguished based on clinical assessment at the bedside. Simple transfusion is likely to be appropriate therapy, and with the exception of delayed transfusion reactions or hyperhemolysis, transfusion should not be withheld while the cause of the anemia is being determined.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Red cell aplasia</strong> – Parvovirus B19 infection is common in individuals with SCD and can lead to bone marrow aplasia characterized by worsening anemia without a compensatory increase in reticulocyte count. Parvovirus infection may be associated with a number of comorbidities, including and not limited to vaso-occlusive pain or ACS, splenic sequestration, asymptomatic thrombocytopenia, acute strokes, silent cerebral infarcts (silent strokes), and acute kidney disease [<a href="#rid13">13-17</a>]. Although the bone marrow aplasia is transient, the Hb can become dangerously low, and transfusion is required until the infection is cleared (typically a few days to weeks).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Individuals with decreases in both the Hb and reticulocyte count should be considered to have a parvovirus infection until proven otherwise. Once a diagnosis of parvovirus has been confirmed, repeat infection does not occur. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8272.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of parvovirus B19 infection"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8330.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prevention of parvovirus B19 infection"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Splenic or hepatic sequestration </strong>– An acute sequestration episode can occur when a large portion of the patient's blood volume pools in an organ such as the spleen, liver, or lung, acutely lowering the Hb level and potentially causing hypovolemic shock. The diagnosis and management of this complication is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7114.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease", section on 'Splenic and hepatic sequestration'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3589.html" rel="external">"Hepatic manifestations of sickle cell disease", section on 'Acute hepatic sequestration'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acute bleeding</strong> – Acute bleeding is often associated with surgery. An acute drop in Hb in an individual with SCD should prompt an evaluation for bleeding as it would in any individual without SCD. Postoperatively, acute bleeding with concomitant increases in respiratory rate and pulse must be differentiated from acute postoperative or SCD-related pain, as the former requires acute surgical management and the latter requires better pain management. In general, a rapid rise in the pulse is more likely to be associated with blood loss than SCD-related pain, and bleeding should be excluded in the setting of rapid increase in pulse, especially postoperatively.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If an individual with SCD is severely anemic and hypovolemic, RBC transfusion can be used if performed promptly (eg, within minutes); however, volume replacement should not be delayed while awaiting transfusion.

Alloimmunization occurs rapidly after the initiation of transfusions without Rh and K matching (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/128123.html" rel="external">"Transfusion in sickle cell disease: Management of complications including iron overload", section on 'Alloimmunization and hemolysis'</a>). Therefore, Rh (C, E, or C/e, E/e) and K matching should be provided to all patients with SCD who require a transfusion [<a href="#rid8">8,9,38,39</a>]. </p><p>Individuals with SCD in the United States are more likely to have Hispanic ethnicity or African ancestry, and the vast majority of donors have White European ancestry and may have different RBC antigens patterns. The RBC antigen mismatch between donor and recipients increases the likelihood of alloimmunization because the frequency of RBC antigens is heavily influenced by race. </p><p>Occasionally, for individuals with SCD, transfusion services also match RBC units for additional antigens, such as Duffy (Fy<sup>a</sup>/Fy<sup>b</sup>), Kidd (Jk<sup>a</sup>/Jk<sup>b</sup>), and S. In practice, matching for Rh (C, E, or C/e, E/e) and K increases the likelihood that the unit will also be compatible for Duffy and Kidd because these antigens are highly related to the patient's race.

Hypotension is not a contraindication to exchange transfusion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For regularly scheduled transfusions used in the prevention of stroke, ACS, and recurrent painful episodes. </p><p></p><p>For young children requiring chronic transfusion therapy, we prefer simple transfusion combined with iron chelation to avoid the need for central venous catheter (CVC) placement. Once they reach the age of 10 years or the weight of 30 kg, we discuss whether to place a CVC or use peripheral venous access for red cell exchange. (See <a class="local">'Venous access devices'</a> above.)</p><p>Modified exchange transfusion requires a dedicated team with experience and ability to perform ongoing surveillance for adverse events.</p><p>In general, automated apheresis is preferred over manual exchange because it can be done faster and causes fewer volume shifts [<a href="#rid9">9,84</a>]. It is typically programmed by the desired post-procedure hematocrit and Hb S level. (See <a class="local">'Blood transfusion volumes'</a> below.)</p><p>A study that compared automated versus manual methods in 39 children receiving chronic transfusion for stroke prevention (1353 total transfusion sessions) found both methods were effective and well tolerated, with a median reduction in the percentage of Hb S by approximately 20 percent with both methods [<a href="#rid85">85</a>]. Importantly, manual exchange should be performed by a dedicated team with experience in the procedure and using quality controls and adverse event monitoring.</p><p>In clinical situations where the exchange may be considered as part of standard care (ACS, multi-organ failure, or strokes) without availability of apheresis or local expertise to perform a manual exchange, the patient should be transferred to a facility to perform apheresis or manual exchange, as these decisions are often time sensitive. In cases where red cell exchange is delayed, a simple transfusion should be provided if the patient's Hb is &lt;9 g/dL while waiting for red cell exchange. (See <a class="local">'Uses of simple blood transfusion'</a> above.)</p><p>With acute organ deterioration, such as respiratory failure, stroke, or multi-organ failure, we suggest lowering the Hb S to approximately 15 percent and raising the total Hb to the range of 10 to 12 g/dL. Although strong evidence-based data confirming that a Hb S of 15 percent is better than 30 percent are lacking, the rationale for this approach is twofold. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In critically ill patients, this approach is thought to minimize sickling complications. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hb S is unlikely to increase above a threshold of 30 percent within four weeks. </p><p></p><p>Thus, this Hb S target decreases the likelihood of requiring another exchange blood transfusion for at least three weeks to keep the Hb S level &lt;30 percent.</p><p>A major benefit of red cell exchange over simple transfusion is prevention or minimization of excess iron stores. Red cell exchange decreases the degree of excess iron accumulation when compared with simple blood transfusion therapy and may delay, or in few cases eliminate, the need for chelation therapy [<a href="#rid86">86-88</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/128123.html" rel="external">"Transfusion in sickle cell disease: Management of complications including iron overload", section on 'Excessive iron stores'</a>.)</p><p>For most patients who maintain a hematocrit of at least 27 percent, we can achieve a net zero red cell balance with automated apheresis, reducing the accumulation of excess iron. Regular manual modified exchange transfusion therapy has been shown to decrease net iron balance compared with regular simple blood transfusion therapy but with less benefit in net iron balance than RBC apheresis [<a href="#rid89">89</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/128123.html" rel="external">"Transfusion in sickle cell disease: Management of complications including iron overload", section on 'Excessive iron stores'</a>.)</p><p>In the preoperative setting, randomized trials have found simple transfusion to be equivalent to exchange transfusion in preventing perioperative complications.

(See <a class="local">'Rationale for transfusion'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indications</strong> – Transfusions are indicated to treat severe uncompensated anemia and severe vaso-occlusive phenomena including multiorgan failure, acute stroke, and ACS; and preoperatively in most patients. The largest <strong>misuse</strong> of transfusion is for an adult with SCD with uncomplicated vaso-occlusive pain without symptomatic anemia, for which there is no evidence of benefit. Simple transfusion can increase oxygen carrying capacity in patients with severe anemia. Exchange transfusion provides greater benefit in critically ill patients and those with vaso-occlusion, by lowering Hb S without increasing blood viscosity; automated apheresis is generally preferred over manual exchange. Over time, chronic simple transfusion increases the risk of iron overload  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef134782" href="/d/graphic/134782.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).
