The best known is the effect of increasing body mass. Although GH stimulates generalized growth, it is not evenly distributed among the protein, lipid, and carbohydrate compartments. GH increases total body protein content, decreases total body fat content, and increases fat deposition in the liver. Physiologic concentrations of GH also have beneficial effects on the plasma lipid profile (ie, decreases serum low-density lipoprotein and increases high-density lipoprotein), although either GH deficiency or excess may be associated with dyslipidemia and the plasma lipid profile may fluctuate acutely during replacement therapy with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13354" href="/z/d/drug information/13354.html" rel="external">recombinant human growth hormone</a> (rhGH) [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. The effects on fat are due to stimulation of lipolysis and reciprocal antagonism of the lipogenic action of insulin in peripheral fat stores.</p><p>GH also increases bone mass by stimulating skeletal insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) synthesis and causing proliferation of prechondrocytes, hypertrophy of osteoblasts, bone remodeling, and net mineralization [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. GH stimulates cartilage growth. This is most evident as a widening of the epiphyseal plate and is associated with an increase in amino acid incorporation into cartilage and bone [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. GH also stimulates the uptake of sulfate by cartilage in vivo but not in vitro. However, in vitro sulfate uptake is stimulated by serum from normal or hypophysectomized animals treated with GH. This "sulfation factor" proved to be IGF-1 [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3801.html" rel="external">"Physiology of insulin-like growth factor 1"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS OF GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>GH deficiency is a clinical diagnosis based on auxologic features (ie, a comparison of a child's growth pattern to established norms) and confirmed by biochemical testing. Once the decision has been made to evaluate a short child for GH deficiency, several different tests can be performed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5842.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency in children"</a>.)</p><p>If GH deficiency is congenital and complete, the diagnosis is relatively easy to confirm. Affected children present with early severe growth failure; delayed bone age (if the diagnosis is significantly delayed); central distribution of body fat; and very low serum concentrations of GH, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), the major binding protein of circulating IGF-1 [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Infants with GH deficiency are prone to hypoglycemia, prolonged jaundice, microphallus (in males), and giant-cell hepatitis. If hypoglycemia is noted, treatment with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13354" href="/z/d/drug information/13354.html" rel="external">recombinant human growth hormone</a> (rhGH) should be initiated expeditiously to protect against further episodes.</p><p>For children with milder manifestations of GH deficiency, it may be more difficult to establish the diagnosis. Nonetheless, once the diagnosis is confirmed, such children can and should be treated with rhGH until linear growth ceases.

The growth response is greater when rhGH is initiated at younger versus older age. Therefore, treatment should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed and continued until linear growth ceases.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4249741641"><span class="h2">Formulations of growth hormone</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several brands of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) are approved for treatment of GH deficiency in children, and others are being tested:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Once-daily formulations</strong> – Most children with GH deficiency are treated with aqueous biosynthetic <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13354" href="/z/d/drug information/13354.html" rel="external">recombinant human growth hormone</a>, which is administered by subcutaneous injection (usually daily). Several brands of rhGH have been available for subcutaneous administration for many years, and most information about rhGH treatment comes from these preparations. They are equally biopotent and have the same natural sequence structure as endogenous human GH. Most are available in multiple-dose pen devices that facilitate administration.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Long-acting formulations</strong> – There are two varieties of long-acting rhGH formulations: sustained-release preparations of rhGH, and analogues of rhGH with additional peptides or fatty acids or bound to larger molecules [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="132542" href="/z/d/drug information/132542.html" rel="external">Lonapegsomatropin</a> (once-weekly) is a sustained-release preparation of rhGH approved in the United States is for children with GH deficiency one year of age and older and weighing at least 11.5 kg [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. It is a prodrug of somatropin that provides sustained release of active, unmodified somatropin [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. In a 52-week randomized trial, lonapegsomatropin injected subcutaneously once weekly achieved a similar annualized height velocity (11.2±0.2 cm/year) compared with equivalent doses of aqueous rhGH administered by daily subcutaneous injection of rhGH (10.3±0.3 cm/year) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Estimated average insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) concentrations were slightly higher for lonapegsomatropin compared with daily rhGH but remained within the normal range, although IGF-1 values in individual participants occasionally exceeded +2 standard deviations (SD) at some point in the trial (7.6 percent of measurements for lonapegsomatropin and 3.6 percent of measurements for daily rhGH).

A single amino acid substitution and a long fatty acid moiety permit a noncovalent association with circulating albumin, thereby extending the half-life of the molecule in the circulation. In a 52-week randomized phase 3 trial in 200 children, height velocity was similar in participants treated with somapacitan (0.16 mg/kg/week) compared with once-daily aqueous rhGH (0.24 mg/kg/week), with similar safety signals and tolerability [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].

It contains the amino acid sequence of hGH and three copies of the C-terminal peptide (CTP) of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to form a fusion protein. The inclusion of CTP in proteins leads to increased half-life. In a 12-month phase 3 trial, height velocity was similar in participants treated with once-weekly somatrogon (0.66 mg/kg/week) compared with once-daily aqueous rhGH (0.24 mg/kg/week), with similar safety signals and tolerability [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. The estimated average IGF-1 concentration was within the normal range for both groups (approximately +0.6 SD for somatrogon and -0.7 SD for daily rhGH); in the somatrogon group, 1.9 percent of samples corresponded to a mean IGF-1 concentration &gt;+2 SD.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2885124607"><span class="h2">Initial dosing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The usual dosing of rhGH for childhood GH deficiency depends on the formulation:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For standard <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13354" href="/z/d/drug information/13354.html" rel="external">recombinant human growth hormone</a> (somatropin), the starting dose is between 0.16 and 0.24 mg/kg/week, divided into once-daily injections. For most patients, our practice is to start at the upper end of this range (0.24 mg/kg/week, ie, approximately 35 micrograms/kg/day). For patients with severe GH deficiency, we use a lower starting dose of approximately 20 micrograms/kg/day because these individuals have excellent growth responses in this dose range.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For this formulation, daily therapy is more effective than three-times weekly at the same total dose [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]. Some experts suggest administering rhGH in the evening, based on the rationale that this more closely mimics the predominance of GH secretion during sleep.

As clinical experience with long-acting GH preparations increases, we anticipate that an increasing proportion of children will be treated with these formulations.</p><p>Most endocrinologists adjust the rhGH dose based on growth response, serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels, and body weight, as discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Dose adjustment based on IGF-1 response'</a> below.)</p><p>In the United States, one manufacturer obtained approval for rhGH dosing up to 0.70 mg/kg/week during puberty, but guidelines recommend against the routine use of this approach because the safety and efficacy are not established [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Dosing during puberty'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H562846"><span class="h2">Dose adjustment based on IGF-1 response</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Serum levels of IGF-1 should be measured approximately five weeks after beginning rhGH treatment or making a dose adjustment (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113216" href="/z/d/graphic/113216.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). The rhGH dose should be lowered if serum IGF-1 levels rise above the normal range, as recommended in guidelines from the Pediatric Endocrine Society (PES) [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. This helps to avoid very high IGF-1 levels, which may be associated with some of the drug's toxicity. (See <a class="local">'Adverse effects of growth hormone therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>The discussion below refers to an average IGF-1 level. If rhGH is given daily, random sampling is sufficient. If a long-acting rhGH formulation is used, interpretation of an IGF-1 level is more complex and depends on the formulation and timing of the sample compared with the last dose [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="132542" href="/z/d/drug information/132542.html" rel="external">lonapegsomatropin</a>, IGF-1 samples at 4.5 days after the last dose provide a good estimate of the average weekly IGF-1 concentration and could be used to guide dose adjustments, while samples taken on other days require mathematical adjustments to predict average IGF-1 concentrations [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="142477" href="/z/d/drug information/142477.html" rel="external">somapacitan</a>, IGF-1 samples collected either two or four days after the last dose provide an estimate of the mean IGF-1 [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="140665" href="/z/d/drug information/140665.html" rel="external">somatrogon</a>, IGF-1 samples collected at approximately 96 hours (four days) after the last dose represent the mean IGF-1 [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p></p><p>In our practice, we also use serum IGF-1 levels for further adjustments to the rhGH dose. This "fine-tuning" approach is not endorsed by the PES guidelines, because data on adult height outcomes are not available [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. However, we choose to use this approach because published intermediate outcomes suggest that IGF-1-based dosing may increase height velocity and is sometimes dose-sparing, presumably because it addresses the variable sensitivity to rhGH therapy among patients [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>]. However, the most important efficacy outcomes are short-term height velocity and longer-term overall growth, irrespective of the IGF-1 level. Trials of some longer-acting rhGH molecules report height velocity outcomes that appear to be similar to, if not slightly greater than, those seen with daily rhGH preparations [<a href="#rid14">14,17,18,24,25</a>]. Induced IGF-1 levels in these studies are similar to or, in some cases, higher than those seen with daily dosing.</p><p>Various protocols are used for IGF-1-based dose adjustment. In our practice, we measure IGF-1 approximately four weeks after beginning rhGH therapy or changing the dose. We target an IGF-1 level in the upper one-half of the normal range (ie, 0 to +2 SD, based on bone age). If the IGF-1 level is below this target range, we increase the dose of rhGH (eg, by 10 to 20 percent) because the treatment is unlikely to be efficacious if IGF-1 levels are very low. If the IGF-1 level is above this target range (ie, &gt;+2 SD), we reduce the rhGH dose (eg, by 10 to 20 percent) because there are some concerns about the safety of high IGF-1 levels. (See <a class="local">'Adverse effects of growth hormone therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>If rhGH is increased to &gt;0.3 mg/week but IGF-1 levels remain low (&lt;-1 SD), the first step is to evaluate for adherence to therapy and proper injection technique and for underlying medical problems that might limit growth.

By the end of the pubertal growth spurt, children treated with high-dose rhGH were approximately 3.6 cm taller than those treated with standard-dose rhGH. The high dose of rhGH was, in some cases, associated with marked elevations in serum IGF-1 levels and/or symptoms consistent with GH excess (ankle swelling or hip pain). Hence, great care must be employed when using such high doses of rhGH. Of note, these findings may not be relevant to children whose dose of rhGH is periodically readjusted during rhGH therapy based on serum IGF-1 levels, as we suggest above.</p><p>Thus, the modest gains in height achieved by giving higher doses of rhGH during puberty must be balanced against the concerns for adverse effects, which are not well studied, as well as the substantial cost of the additional rhGH.

Treatment can often be resumed at a lower dose without return of symptoms, with slower escalation back up to standard doses. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis also occurs soon after rhGH therapy is initiated, and routine monitoring is recommended for suggestive symptoms such as hip and/or knee pain and changes in gait.

The best information comes from the Safety and Appropriateness of rhGH treatments in Europe (SAGhE) study, which followed almost 24,000 patients, approximately one-half of whom had isolated growth failure [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. In long-term follow-up, the patients with isolated growth failure had no overall increase in cancer risk (standardized incidence ratio 1.0, 95% CI 0.6-1.4) or cancer mortality compared with the general population. The certainty about this conclusion is somewhat limited because of the rarity of cancer in this cohort (23 cases among 11,062 treated subjects), limited length of follow-up (mean 14.8 years per patient), and lack of untreated control groups with the same causes for growth failure. A lack of association with cancer was also found in prior studies with shorter length of follow-up [<a href="#rid52">52-56</a>], including some that focused primarily on leukemia [<a href="#rid57">57-59</a>]. In a subsequent report on the same cohort, cancer-related mortality was not increased for those with isolated GH deficiency or idiopathic short stature (standardized mortality ratio [SMR] 0.9, 95% CI 0.4-1.8; mean follow-up 16.3 years) or SGA subjects (SMR 0.6, 95% CI 0.1-2.4; mean follow-up 17.2 years) [<a href="#rid60">60</a>].

This excess cancer-related mortality was not associated with daily or cumulative rhGH dose. Since childhood cancer patients are known to be at increased risk for secondary cancers, due to the underlying cancer itself and/or cancer-directed therapy (especially radiation), the increased incidence of secondary cancers was probably not related to the rhGH treatment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Further information about secondary cancers is provided by a report from a cohort of 2582 survivors of childhood solid-organ cancers, of whom 374 (14 percent) developed secondary cancers, including 40 who had received rhGH therapy [<a href="#rid61">61</a>]. In multivariate analysis that adjusted for the type of primary cancer and cranial radiation dose, rhGH therapy was not associated with an increased risk of developing a second tumor (relative risk 1.3, 95% CI 0.9-2.0). There was a nonsignificant increase in the risk of meningioma, which has also been suggested by other studies [<a href="#rid62">62-64</a>]. If this is a true association, it could be due to cranial irradiation and/or undetermined meningioma-predisposing conditions and not to rhGH treatment itself.

This cohort included subjects with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies, several syndromes with known mortality risks (Turner, Noonan, and Prader-Willi syndromes and neurofibromatosis type 1), and severe congenital malformations.

However, these treatments are not generally recommended for this population, because the efficacy and safety have not been established, as outlined below:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>GnRH agonist</strong> – We do not generally recommend adjunctive treatment with a GnRH agonist with rhGH therapy, because of limited evidence for benefit and some safety concerns. For male and female adolescents with GH deficiency who start treatment in early to mid-puberty, a few studies suggest that the addition of a GnRH agonist to rhGH treatment may result in a taller near-adult height [<a href="#rid68">68-70</a>]. However, the use of this approach in children with GH deficiency remains controversial: Although GnRH agonists can theoretically increase adult height by delaying epiphyseal closure, thereby allowing more time for growth during puberty, long-term treatment (&gt;3 years) is likely required to accomplish this goal. Furthermore, it has not been established that GnRH agonist treatment yields greater increases in height compared with rhGH treatment alone if rhGH treatment is initiated prior to puberty. In addition, the clinician must consider multiple issues when considering addition of GnRH agonist therapy, including risks of potential reduced bone mineralization, psychological effects of halting puberty, and cost-benefit analysis [<a href="#rid71">71,72</a>].

Longer-acting rhGH formulations designed for once-weekly dosing, including <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="132542" href="/z/d/drug information/132542.html" rel="external">lonapegsomatropin</a> and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="142477" href="/z/d/drug information/142477.html" rel="external">somapacitan</a>, are now available. (See <a class="local">'Formulations of growth hormone'</a> above and <a class="local">'Growth hormone treatment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Monitoring and dose adjustment</strong> – We suggest measuring IGF-1 approximately five weeks after beginning daily rhGH treatment or making a dose adjustment, and lowering the rhGH dose if the level is above the normal range (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). If a long-acting rhGH preparation is used (<a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="132542" href="/z/d/drug information/132542.html" rel="external">lonapegsomatropin</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="142477" href="/z/d/drug information/142477.html" rel="external">somapacitan</a>, or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="140665" href="/z/d/drug information/140665.html" rel="external">somatrogon</a>), interpretation of the IGF-1 result depends on the timing of the sample compared with the preceding dose. It is also a reasonable practice to use IGF-1 results to "fine-tune" rhGH doses (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113216" href="/z/d/graphic/113216.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). This is based upon limited evidence suggesting that IGF-1-based dosing may increase short-term height velocity and is sometimes dose-sparing, although adult height outcomes using this approach are lacking. (See <a class="local">'Dose adjustment based on IGF-1 response'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Height velocity is monitored at three- to six-month intervals (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113216" href="/z/d/graphic/113216.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>); the goal for treatment is to attain the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile for height velocity for age during catch-up growth. We also monitor IGF-1 levels every 6 to 12 months. (See <a class="local">'Ongoing monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Outcomes</strong> – The growth response to rhGH is highly variable. Predictors of a greater height response to rhGH treatment include younger age and greater deviation of actual height from target height (genetic potential) at the start of therapy. In addition, a more frequent dosing schedule (for aqueous formulations of rhGH) and higher dose of rhGH tend to correlate with increased height, but this relationship is not linear. (See <a class="local">'Growth'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Duration of therapy</strong> – We recommend continuing rhGH therapy at least until linear growth is nearly complete (eg, height velocity less than 2.0 to 2.5 cm/year) (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). Patients should then be retested for GH deficiency to determine if treatment should be continued into adulthood. The majority of individuals diagnosed with isolated GH deficiency in childhood have normal GH secretion during adulthood, presumably because of the stimulatory effects of gonadal steroid hormones on GH secretion. By contrast, children with genetic and organic forms of GH deficiency, multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies, and/or structural abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary region rarely become GH-sufficient. (See <a class="local">'Duration of therapy'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16539.html" rel="external">"Growth hormone treatment during the transition period"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Adjunctive therapy</strong> – For children who are not likely to achieve an adequate height response to rhGH because their growth plates are nearing closure, adjunctive therapy to delay epiphyseal maturation may be considered, but the efficacy and safety of these approaches are not well established. (See <a class="local">'Adjunctive growth-promoting agents'</a> above.)</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Decker R, Nygren A, Kriström B, et al.
