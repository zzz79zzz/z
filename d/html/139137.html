I first wrote this perspective almost five years after I was diagnosed. If you find the content uncomfortable or overwhelming as you start to read it, please consider reading individual sections as you feel comfortable, in coordination with discussions with your care and/or social services team(s).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2807188725"><span class="h2">Initial signs and symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>My first symptoms of concern were in December 2016 on a cross-country skiing vacation when I was 57 years old. We had skied in Quebec during many year-end holidays and I knew the trails well. However, on this trip, I had trouble maintaining balance on the last downhill run each day. I fell once or twice each day on this trail and sometimes had to take my skis off to get back on my feet. I shrugged off the falls as end-of-day fatigue.</p><p>In the following winter months, I had several inexplicable falls while walking our dog when I lost my balance and landed on my back. I considered these falls strange, but not concerning enough to seek medical attention. The following spring, I fell several times carrying a kayak across a beach. At the time, I thought this could have been due to the uneven surface of the loose sand.</p><p>Although I initially thought the falls were an infrequent nuisance, I also began to notice other balance problems. My walking had become a bit slower, and I noted that I had to be more deliberate to safely maintain balance walking up outdoor steps when carrying a load of firewood.</p><p>Though I did not make the connection until after my diagnosis, for at least four years prior to being diagnosed with ALS, my wife complained about twitching when I held her in bed at night. I was unaware of these symptoms until they were raised by the diagnosing neurologist. I had also reported cramping in my feet and calves to my primary care physician (PCP) two years before I reported balance issues.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3578229864"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H37101210"><span class="h2">Seeking medical care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>I ignored the falls for almost six months. Approaching my annual physical in June 2017, I decided to discuss them with my primary care physician (PCP), along with accumulated stress from the previous 12 months (my father-in-law and father had died three months apart in 2016; I had been through three different very high stress work situations; and I had been traveling extensively for work).</p><p>I did not want to spend 14.5 minutes of a 15-minute managed-care appointment trying to describe all of these issues, so I wrote my PCP a page-long email the night before summarizing the stress, intermittent falls, and balance symptoms. The email concluded: "Overall, I feel like I'm coming into this year's appointment feeling much less limber than any time in the past (putting on socks is harder than it used to be), and in some ways not as strong as I used to be (eg, I have to work to put a full suitcase in the [airplane] overhead storage bin, but I can still lift a 40-pound box of firewood easily)."</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2525044819"><span class="h2">Initial evaluation and testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>At my physical, my PCP focused on the neurologic symptoms I had described in my preceding email. He examined me thoroughly and noted some areas of weakness in my arms and legs. Because of my balance issues, I was not surprised that my left leg appeared a little weak; however, I was caught off guard that my left arm seemed weak. My PCP immediately ordered testing. The first test was a lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); 48 hours later the result was negative. Next, he ordered a nerve conduction study and electromyography (EMG). The earliest appointment was six weeks later. At the appointment, the neurologist quietly went about her work and after 45 minutes she asked if I could stay longer because she wanted to test some additional muscles.</p><p>The next morning, I received an email from my PCP asking me to meet at his office two days later. My wife, sensing something serious, joined me for the appointment. My PCP explained that the EMG showed "active and chronic denervation with fasciculations in all four limbs," but was inconclusive as to the cause. Through this appointment, my PCP remained calm and never speculated about a possible diagnosis or hinted that the EMG result might indicate a serious problem. He recommended that we follow up with an MRI of the cervical spine and a muscle biopsy. In addition, he advised that I make appointments to see two neuromuscular neurologists.</p><p>Throughout this time, I followed my PCP's instructions without asking any questions. I had a good relationship with my PCP and trusted him to do his job. I naïvely assumed there must be some minor issue that could be resolved with a pill, some physical therapy, or minor surgery. By disposition, I am someone who tries hard not to worry about things that are beyond my control. Additionally, I was busy with my job, family, and a new waterfront cottage in Maine. I never Googled "active and chronic denervation with fasciculations in all four limbs." I remained completely unaware as to the severity of my situation and to this day remain grateful that two months of complete ignorance allowed me to enjoy most of that summer.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H99774618"><span class="h2">Receiving the diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>I met with the first neurologist two months to the day after first discussing symptoms with my PCP during my annual physical. After a 15-minute exam, he asked me to put on my clothes and left the room. A few minutes later, after a gentle knock on the door, he re-entered, sat down on a little round chair, and wheeled himself up close. He looked me straight in the eye and asked, "Do you have any idea what's going on?" I replied, "None at all." He drew breath and said, "This is going to be a hard conversation. I think you have ALS."</p><p>We were shocked. My wife and I asked question after question, and the neurologist patiently answered, although much of the next hour and a half remains a blur. I remember fragmented facts from the conversation: "80 percent die in two to five years," "No known cause or cure," "Don't lose any weight," and "Be careful what you read on the internet." We were devastated and emotionally wrung dry when we finally staggered out of the hospital.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1907793689"><span class="h2">The immediate aftermath</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>I was stunned. Three of my four grandparents had lived well past 90, my father had died at 94 the previous year, and my mother was very active at the age of 89. I had always assumed I would live at least as long.</p><p>My first thoughts were: It will really "suck" if I don't see my younger son graduate college (he was a freshman); it will really "suck" if I can't watch my grandchildren grow up; and it will really "suck" that I won't get to spend 30+ years enjoying the vacation cottage we had purchased only months earlier. More practically, I immediately realized that we would have to move because there was no way our home could reasonably be made accessible, and my wife and I would have to sell the software business we had spent 25 years building.</p><p>We drove around for 30 minutes trying to find a quiet place to sit and talk. We didn't know where to start; neither of us even had the energy to cry nor were we prepared yet to tell anyone.</p><p>A week later, I saw another neurologist for a second opinion. This time the question was, "Have you met with any other neurologist?" I replied that I had and named the neurologist. His body language immediately shifted. He realized he would not be the bearer of bad news, only the person to confirm it.</p><p>My PCP did a remarkable job guiding the diagnostic process and managing me as a patient. Yet, as I began to process the future impacts to both me and my immediate family, I realized that having a PCP who also knew my family well would be an important part of the journey. My father's PCP had guided several members of our family through my father's end-of-life care, and my wife already knew him well. Although his practice had been closed for years, I called him and asked if there was any way he could squeeze me into his practice. He replied without hesitation, "I’d be honored to have you in my practice." Those words were some of the kindest I heard in the first weeks after my diagnosis, and I remain grateful to this day.</p><p>Meeting with my new PCP a few weeks later, he asked if I had told anyone. I had not. Not my mother, my sister, or my sons. He advised I meet with a psychologist to discuss how I would disclose my diagnosis to family, friends, and colleagues. It was some of the best advice I received in the aftermath of my diagnosis. My only visible symptom was a slight limp, so there was no urgent need to share the diagnosis. The relatively fast diagnosis bought us the time we needed to consider next steps. I met with a psychologist a half-dozen times, and three months after I was diagnosed, I was able to have calm and meaningful one-on-one conversations with immediate family and a few close friends.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3535602118"><span class="h2">Thoughts on the diagnostic process</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Only two years after I was diagnosed did I come to understand how fortunate I was with the diagnostic process. I was diagnosed in exactly two months; the average time to diagnose an ALS patient is 11 months. My initial PCP quickly focused on a neurologic issue based on the description in my email. When the lumbar MRI was negative, he immediately arranged for an EMG. The speed with which he ordered the EMG saved months of diagnostic time. He was never alarmist about the process and did not offer speculative diagnoses. Although it was difficult to first hear the term "ALS" when being diagnosed, I am grateful I didn’t have to suffer with the knowledge that it was suspected throughout the two-month diagnostic process.</p><p>With incredible good fortune, both neurologists I saw were ALS specialists at ALS multidisciplinary centers. The first neurologist patiently gave us the time we needed that day, and he did not limit us to a 15-minute appointment when we clearly needed more. The appointment at the second hospital lasted four hours; we met with the neurologist, a physical therapist, and a research access nurse who talked with us about opportunities to participate in clinical trials.</p><p>Having these two appointments one week apart was a blessing. By the end of the first appointment, we were too drained to absorb any more information. By the next week, we had the mental and emotional space to speak with the additional members of the multidisciplinary care team and start to develop an action and care plan.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2982716582"><span class="h2">Genetic testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Approximately 10 percent of ALS cases have a genetic component. When I was diagnosed, I chose not to do genetic testing because we had no family history of ALS, and I did not want to live in fear that if I carried an ALS-connected gene, my son could be impacted. However, two years after diagnosis, I was offered genetic testing as part of a clinical trial. I was tested for approximately 30 ALS-related genes, and the results were negative.</p><p>If there is any family history of ALS, I would certainly advise genetic testing. Treatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="141342" href="/d/drug information/141342.html" rel="external">tofersen</a> may be given to patients with familial ALS due to an <em>SOD1</em> pathologic genetic variant. Some experimental treatments for patients with specific genetic markers associated with ALS are under development and may be available in clinical trials. Even if there is no family history, the issue of genetic testing is one that should still be discussed with the patient. If cost is a consideration, there are options with a confirmed ALS diagnosis to receive free genetic testing as part of contributing to research databases. (See <a class="local">'Resources and advice'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1797487439"><span class="h1">TREATMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many ALS patients I know have been told at their diagnosis, "There's nothing we can do, so go home and put your affairs in order." <strong>This is so wrong!</strong> While there are no cures for ALS, and approved medications to slow progression have limited effectiveness, ALS patients can build and follow treatment plans that can provide a higher quality of life. And that starts simply with focusing on "life" rather than "ALS."</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1778291611"><span class="h2">Multidisciplinary care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>I receive my care at an ALS multidisciplinary clinic where I have access to more than a dozen specialized clinicians, and I work regularly with a subgroup of appropriate specialists who guide my care and regularly reevaluate my needs.</p><p>I see my neurologist and any appropriate specialists typically every three months, adjusted as-needed based on interim physical changes. I have also been able to remain in communication with my care team by email. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, I have scheduled telehealth visits with appropriate specialists outside of the regular three-month clinic visit schedule. (See <a class="local">'The impact of COVID-19'</a> below.)</p><p>The multidisciplinary clinic has additional specialists that I meet with infrequently or have not needed. For example, my speaking is mostly unaffected, and so I have only infrequently met with a speech language pathologist. I first met with a respiratory therapist more than five years after diagnosis. I can still chew and swallow without problem, allowing me to maintain a stable weight. Should I have problems eating, or decide to get a feeding tube, there are gastroenterologist, dietitian, and nursing resources who can be called upon to help.</p><p>The ALS multidisciplinary clinic covers virtually all of my medical needs. However, ALS needs are far greater than medical. ALS patients need help with social services, specialized equipment, and other supports. Fortunately, in my area, there are two organizations that I work with for help and advice on topics such as how to navigate medical insurance, how to navigate Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), connecting with other ALS patients, and obtaining adaptive equipment loans. (See <a class="local">'Adaptive equipment'</a> below and <a class="local">'Resources and advice'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2328469524"><span class="h2">Medications for ALS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The neurologist who diagnosed me told me about two treatments available at that time that had been shown to have a modest impact on slowing ALS progression. I started taking <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9865" href="/d/drug information/9865.html" rel="external">riluzole</a> two months after diagnosis. I chose not to take <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="113074" href="/d/drug information/113074.html" rel="external">edaravone</a> because it was only available at that time as a multiday intravenous infusion that would not mesh with my still-active lifestyle, and it was not clear from the neurologist's description if it would bring significant additional benefit.</p><p>In addition to considering medications approved for use in ALS, I was interested in other available options. Understanding that many patients will try<strong> anything</strong>, my clinical team also guided me toward some other promising treatments that have been or are being evaluated in clinical trials. After reviewing potential options, I began taking three off-label medications: Theracurmin (turmeric), methylcobalamin, and a combination of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (an over-the-counter supplement) and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9934" href="/d/drug information/9934.html" rel="external">sodium phenylbutyrate</a>. Following approval in November 2022, I switched from tauroursodeoxycholic acid and sodium phenylbutyrate to prescription sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol (brand name: Relyvrio).</p><p>However, there are many other therapies for ALS that may be found on the internet or elsewhere of dubious benefit. My clinical team and some reliable online resources are available to help patients navigate this information and misinformation. (See <a class="local">'Resources and advice'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3302475804"><span class="h3">Prior authorization</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>With the 2022 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="113074" href="/d/drug information/113074.html" rel="external">edaravone</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9934" href="/d/drug information/9934.html" rel="external">sodium phenylbutyrate</a> and taurursodiol (brand name: Relyvrio), three medications became available for the treatment of ALS. The two recently approved medications are easy-to-administer yet expensive (each has a list price of &gt;USD $150,000/year), and prior insurance authorizations remain a challenge.</p><p>In August 2022, my neurologist recommended I start oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="113074" href="/d/drug information/113074.html" rel="external">edaravone</a>. His prescription for it was denied by my employer's insurance; two subsequent appeals were denied; my additional request for external review was also denied, so I will be unable to access this treatment. My insurance company's and the external reviewer's explanation for denial is that I do not qualify for oral edaravone because I do not meet the clinical trial inclusion criteria even though the FDA approved oral edaravone for <strong>all</strong> ALS patients, and the UpToDate recommendation is "We suggest edaravone for all patients with ALS." By contrast, I received prior authorization for Relyvrio six weeks after the first request.</p><p>Many of my fellow ALS advocates have faced similar challenges obtaining access to one or both of these medications, and frustration runs high among patients and their families who see medications approved only to be denied access or receive access after unnecessary delays. Alas, persistence and patience may be required for ALS patients to receive prior authorization for FDA-approved medications. Patients and caregivers may need to make repeated calls to insurance companies, and clinical teams should be prepared to invest the time preparing paperwork for patients.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1999312591"><span class="h3">Clinical trials</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>One week after diagnosis, a research access nurse met with us to learn if I would be interested in clinical trials. I decided to enroll in a phase three trial for an intrathecal stem-cell treatment. I will freely admit that pursuing clinical trials was, initially, all about me. I saw them as the best way to try to extend my life. However, during a routine 45-minute mid-trial checkup during the 11-month trial, my research neurologist sensed I was having a bad day. She put aside the paperwork and spent 25 minutes listening. As I walked out of the hospital, I realized I had just received a therapy session from an empathetic physician. I was blown away. How did she have time in her busy day to simply listen? That was the day I realized I was working with truly exceptional people who cared deeply about patients with ALS. By the time the clinical trial ended, my perspective had completely shifted. I realized that participating in the science of ALS was personally gratifying, and I came to view it as my responsibility as a patient to stay involved with research as well as a privilege to work with such an empathetic and supportive team. Subsequently, I have volunteered for a half-dozen observational and biologic sample studies, including two voluntary spinal taps, simply to stay involved.</p><p>By June 2020, I no longer qualified for available clinical trials. However, I was offered a spot in an Expanded Access Program (EAP) to receive an experimental infusion every two weeks. In April 2023, I am continuing with my 35<sup>th</sup> month in this EAP.</p><p>Finding answers for ALS requires many people, including willing patients who will take the time to be involved. If my participation in research can help researchers to find answers, even one day sooner, so that one patient and that patient's family do not have to endure what my family and I are going through, it is worth every hour that I spend with my research team.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4047001552"><span class="h2">Physical and occupational therapies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When I was diagnosed, I asked the neurologist how much I could or should exercise. He responded directly and simply, "If it hurts the next day, you've done too much." That answer was a good starting point, but I felt I needed more guidance. I started physical and occupational therapy and have continued both with regular treatments and periodic re-evaluations of my treatment plan as my symptoms have progressed and needs have changed.</p><p>Immediately after diagnosis, I was prescribed regular physical therapy appointments to help maintain strength and flexibility. I worked with the physical therapist every three weeks and built a 45-minute stretching routine that I did every single morning for 14 months until I could no longer get up off the floor by myself. My physical therapist then recommended a switch to swimming and stretching in a pool five days each week. When my mobility worsened and I began struggling to safely get in and out of the pool and shower afterwards, I asked my physical therapist to make a video showing how a caregiver could stretch me daily at home. I have continued to have a caregiver stretch me five days per week. In addition, I have started doing therapy in a heated pool at a specialized rehabilitation center. The water temperature is set at 92°F so I don't feel cold, despite my body having trouble with temperature regulation. I wear a life jacket and a physical therapist is right next to me in the water to help me. Being in the water is a tremendous relief; for 45 minutes during each visit, my muscles do not fight gravity.</p><p>I have also worked with an occupational therapist to find strategies to support my gradually weakening hands and wrists. One remarkably effective early accommodation was a special swiveling support clamped to my desk to support my left wrist that allowed me to keep typing with both hands for an additional two years. As my symptoms progressed in 2021 and 2022, an occupational therapist worked with me every one to two weeks. She stretched my right hand to help maintain critical functionality that allows me to use a computer mouse and drive my wheelchair with a joystick. Since I first wrote this topic, I have lost a lot of right arm and hand strength, so I have switched to a gyroscopic head mouse, and I've had head controls installed on my wheelchair. I can no longer feed myself so my wife or a caregiver (or sometimes a friend) feeds me all meals. My circulation in my feet and hands has deteriorated over the past two years and a physical or occupational therapist does lymphatic drainage weekly to temporarily alleviate chronic swelling. In addition, an occupational therapist has come to our home several times as I have progressed to evaluate my bedroom, bathroom, and home office environments. Each time she suggested a number of improvements to maintain function and independence.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1104918048"><span class="h2">Respiratory therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>I have met with a specialist as needed as my respiratory capacity has declined. I began using an active breathing device three years after diagnosis to help me maintain lung and diaphragm strength. Later, I added a "cough assist" machine to my daily routine.</p><p>I began using a positive pressure therapy using a bilevel positive pressure (BiPAP) machine because of some challenges with nighttime breathing. Using the BiPAP allows me to sleep longer and more comfortably. Initial attempts with a full facemask resulted very quickly in a sore spot on the bridge of my nose, so I switched to a nasal pillow. Fortunately, I do not seem to breathe through my mouth at night and so the nasal pillow has had the same beneficial effects. The nasal pillow also allows me to speak while providing respiratory support so that I can voice-control my tablet to read books or watch movies, or to call my wife if I need help.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H379291090"><span class="h2">Emotional health</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Maintaining emotional health can be as challenging or even more challenging than maintaining physical strength when living with ALS. I underestimated my own emotional challenges as my ALS progressed, and the psychological symptoms were sometimes harder to recognize, diagnose, and treat than physical symptoms.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3296471132"><span class="h3">Counseling</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Outside of the ALS clinic, I met with a psychologist a half-dozen times shortly after diagnosis specifically to discuss how I would disclose my diagnosis to immediate family. I restarted counseling with a different psychologist (the first one did not have an accessible office) two years after diagnosis, and I continue to meet with her weekly.</p><p>Within the multidisciplinary clinic, I worked during the first two years after diagnosis with a family psychologist who specializes in parenting issues during challenging times. Her counsel was especially helpful with respect to engaging with our then college-age younger son about ALS.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H843050170"><span class="h3">Anxiety</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>I was in complete denial about my level of anxiety from ALS. In reality, I had been in denial about my level of anxiety from the time of diagnosis onward, and the impact on me and those around me (especially my wife) for quite a few years. Initially I tried to suppress my anxiety, and then a year ago it pushed itself to the forefront of my life.</p><p>In March 2022, I reported occasional early-morning "electric" sensations on my chest, stomach, and upper extremities. This was diagnosed as paresthesias. By May 2022, the paresthesias were occurring more frequently and intensely, and some mornings I also felt short of breath. Simultaneously, my professional work schedule was becoming more stressful, and my best friend died after living eight years with colon cancer. I was in pretty rough shape and my primary care physician (PCP) had me try a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), but it only left me listless and further depressed. I thought that perhaps the shortness of breath necessitated using the BiPAP machine, so as I discontinued the SSRI, I started using the BiPAP every night, but that did not fully address my symptoms. My neurologist prescribed <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8453" href="/d/drug information/8453.html" rel="external">alprazolam</a> to address anxiety, but I was so fearful after the SSRI experience that I resisted opening the bottle. Finally, when I woke up three months later one night at 3 AM with very uncomfortable paresthesia, my wife suggested taking the alprazolam. I took one 0.25 mg pill, fell asleep within 15 minutes and woke up three hours later feeling much better. The same thing happened the next night. Fortunately, I had an appointment the next day with the palliative neurologist, and she replaced alprazolam with longer-acting <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9284" href="/d/drug information/9284.html" rel="external">clonazepam</a> at bedtime to avoid regularly rousing my wife in the middle of the night.</p><p>The combination of a minimal dose of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9284" href="/d/drug information/9284.html" rel="external">clonazepam</a> and continuous nighttime use of the BiPAP resolved the paresthesias, and I started sleeping much better. Several additional issues that I had not connected with anxiety largely dissipated. Running out of breath mid-sentence when speaking occurred much less frequently, an easily-triggered gag reflex with larger mouthfuls of food completely disappeared, and laryngospasms that had recently started became much less frequent. As self-aware as I thought I was, it took a winding path over six months and consultations with multiple physicians to realize the level of my anxiety and find the appropriate combination of solutions.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1060982232"><span class="h3">Palliative care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>One year after diagnosis, my clinic team scheduled a meeting for me with the multidisciplinary clinic's palliative neurologist. She helps with management of physical and emotional symptoms, as well as exploring a person's goals and preferences as it relates to their health. At the time, I thought I was doing reasonably well and chose not to have follow-up appointments. But I failed to understand that <strong>palliative care is not the same hospice</strong>. Palliative care can be helpful at all stages of the ALS journey and can start long before hospice care.</p><p>Almost five years after diagnosis, following a very difficult month, I requested a follow-up meeting with the palliative neurologist, and have been meeting monthly since then. Often my wife joins us for appointments. During these appointments the palliative neurologist has helped us navigate difficult conversations about potential treatment (eg, updating a POLST form) and end-of-life planning. She also introduced us to the "box" concept where we prepare each other for emotionally difficult conversations on our own by asking for permission to "open the box."</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H155589110"><span class="h3">End-of-life planning</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Planning for end-of-life is never an easy topic. Some ALS patients and/or caregivers are very proactive and others do not want to think about it, and there is an entire spectrum in the middle. One ALS patient I knew scripted his entire celebration of life ceremony. I, on the other hand, will not do any funeral planning as I see that event as one for surviving family to prepare in a way that is meaningful for them. Each patient and family will need to navigate these discussions and decisions in a way that feels appropriate.</p><p>Several years ago, I filled out <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fivewishes.org%2F&amp;token=oN6rXOmeBLkIpfIsq5mH5bC7IvBI8z%2BpBL7wO1g8SXLsAsYFWVL8VeCxfv1afruf&amp;TOPIC_ID=139137" target="_blank">Five Wishes</a> with the help of my wife and after discussion with my rabbi. This booklet helped to highlight and answer important questions that I may not have the ability to discuss easily at a later stage of ALS.</p><p>There are many other big-picture questions and conversations. My wife and I regularly explore these with each other, with our own psychologists, my palliative neurologist, and with the rabbis in our religious community. The insights and guidance of these professionals are sometimes comforting, sometimes challenging, and always valuable.</p><p>And there are many more details to consider. Some that are easy to overlook include leaving a record of your computer passwords (my wife and I share a password manager), leaving a list of people to notify of my death (I wish I had a list like this from my father when I was contacting extended family and friends after his death), and leaving a legacy for children and/or grandchildren. It may be a letter to be read at a future ceremony like a graduation or a wedding, or stories about your own life. One of our friends bought me a subscription to a storytelling service where I answer one prompt question each week, and after a year, they publish a book with the stories about my life I've written. It's been a wonderful way to capture and share these stories, which I very much enjoy writing, as part of my legacy, and I hope they will be a way for my young and future grandchildren to learn about me.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3436224677"><span class="h1">ADAPTIVE EQUIPMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many adaptive technologies and options for medical equipment are available to support my evolving needs as my ALS has progressed. My clinical team, including physical, occupational, and respiratory therapists, have provided guidance. In addition, online resources have also been helpful. (See <a class="local">'Physical and occupational therapies'</a> above and <a class="local">'Respiratory therapy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Resources and advice'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1462229000"><span class="h2">Equipment training</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Always get equipment and learn how to use it <strong>before</strong> you need it. My transition from a rollator to the sit-to-stand lift occurred in only three days. If I did not already have the equipment available, the result could have been a dangerous fall.</p><p>Each new device comes with a learning curve. In some cases, I adapted easily, such as using the motorized wheelchair. However, other equipment presented greater challenges. During the first week with the sit-to-stand lift, we had some frightening experiences, especially as my wife and a licensed home healthcare nursing assistant learned how to operate it. It would have been better to get some in-home training rather than fumble through it. A more recent example has been learning how to use an external condom catheter without injury. Nobody let us know that we needed to remove all pubic hair before using the condom. Additionally, nobody informed us about the need to use wipes to prepare the application site and more wipes for the next morning to help dissolve the adhesive. Only with persistent questioning of nurses and pharmacists did my wife learn about these tactics at the end of the first week, just as I was beginning to experience skin breakdown from lack of training. After several weeks, we switched to adhesive-free condom catheters and I have been much happier. (See <a class="local">'Self-advocacy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H262353868"><span class="h2">Ambulation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>At diagnosis, I had an almost unnoticeable limp. Nine months later, the multidisciplinary clinic physical therapist recommended an ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) to help maintain balance and conserve energy while I walked. Two years after diagnosis, I supplemented the AFO with a cane.</p><p>Around the time I started using a cane, I was advised to get fitted for a motorized wheelchair. It was a good thing I started early: the process of evaluation, fitting, insurance approvals, ordering, and delivery can take four to six months. I started using it less than two months after it arrived. Waiting too long to start the process could have resulted in a devastating fall.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1274676308"><span class="h2">Home environment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We moved from an inaccessible house to an accessible condominium two years after I was diagnosed. Even though it was designed for accessibility, we still had to partially rebuild my bathroom to make it fully accessible. The critical change was removing the shower stall and re-tiling the bathroom so that I can use a shower wheelchair and simply roll in and out of the shower corner. Additionally, we replaced the vanity with an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)-labeled sink and added a motorized lift seat to the toilet. The lift seat has a built-in bidet; the bidet has been a wonderful addition for comfort and cleanliness and makes it a little less "uncomfortable" when I may need to ask a visiting friend to help me use the toilet.</p><p>I have progressed over three years from using a bed cane to help get in and out of bed, to using a wedge pillow to make it easier to sit up, to using a fully electric hospital bed. The electric bed helps avoid caregiver injury when lifting me into a sitting position. I have also switched from a regular mattress to a low-air-loss mattress because I no longer move in bed; I lie flat on my back all night. Transfers between wheelchair, bed, and toilet are accomplished with a sit-to-stand lift.</p><p>When I could no longer get out of bed by myself, I used a bedside urinal in the middle of the night. This simple device helped me maintain overnight independence to urinate while lying on my back and allowed my wife to sleep without interruption (as my primary caregiver, her sleep is vital to both her and my health). In May 2022, I switched to using an external condom catheter overnight because I no longer have the arm strength to manipulate the urinal.</p><p>Middle of the night walks to the bathroom can be dangerous because we are not fully awake, the lighting is often poor, we may be trying to move quickly. The two most serious falls I experienced during the last year I was able to walk both occurred in the middle of the night when I was walking to/from the bathroom (one resulted in a hairline fracture of my upper left humerus, and the other required a 911 call for a "lift assist"). Patients should be encouraged to find alternate methods for nighttime urination sooner rather than later to avoid potentially injurious falls.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H245630684"><span class="h2">Driving</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For the first two years after diagnosis, I was able to drive without problem. I did obtain a handicap placard for my car, although it was almost one more year before I first felt the need to use it.</p><p>After two years (about the same time I started the fitting process for a wheelchair), I realized that it was getting harder to drive with a weakened left arm. I was referred to an occupational therapist certified as a driver rehabilitation specialist who advised some simple modifications to my car. The process to be evaluated for and install these modifications took three months and cost over USD $1500. By the time modifications were installed, I knew I was driving on borrowed time. I repeatedly wondered if I would have the humility to take myself off the road before getting into an accident.</p><p>In March of 2020, I received word that my office was closing for COVID-19, and with the general lockdown, I had no reason to drive anywhere for two months. When I finally got into a car as a passenger in mid-May 2020, I immediately realized that I could no longer drive safely. I called my insurance agent the next day and asked to be removed from our insurance policy.</p><p>Realizing my growing dependence on the wheelchair, and not wanting to be dependent on public transportation, my wife and I have since purchased a used van that had been modified with a ramp for loading a wheelchair.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2613005600"><span class="h2">Augmentative communication</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>I was referred to a speech language pathologist in an augmentative communication department for "message banking," a process by which my voice could be digitized so that, if I lost the ability to speak, I could enter text on a computer and then it could be read in my own voice. I made the appropriate recordings. Mercifully, six years after diagnosis, I have not yet needed my "digital voice," but there is tremendous comfort in knowing that I have this if I need it.</p><p>At the same visit, we discussed my increasing challenges typing, and an occupational therapist who specializes in technology for people with ALS was brought in to explain how we could use commercial software for voice dictation. Over the next two years, as my hands became weaker, I gradually reduced my typing and increased my dictation. More recently, I have lost the hand dexterity to use a computer mouse and have switched to a gyroscopic head mouse and have begun exploring eye-tracking devices. Today I am entirely dependent on voice dictation. This entire perspective was "typed" with it.</p><p>Other simple yet vital suggestions from my technology occupational therapist included how to use accessibility controls on my smart phone and tablet. The ability to use voice control for nearly all actions on both devices is a game changer! I can now lie in bed with my tablet held by a special stand in front of me and easily read and send texts or watch a movie without the need to move my hands. I consult with her once every six months because every appointment uncovers another gem of accessibility technology built into the devices we use every day that I can use at each stage of my progression.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H481350081"><span class="h1">COMMUNICATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H223648718"><span class="h2">Clinical and social services</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ongoing communication with my clinical team and local ALS social service organizations has been vital for all parts of my care. In the early days when I showed few symptoms, I did not communicate frequently with my clinical team outside of my quarterly clinic visits. As my physical condition has declined, it's a rare week that I do not exchange emails with or talk to at least one of my clinical providers.</p><p>Similarly, I maintain regular communication with the ALS social service organizations that I work with. All of these professionals would much rather that I contact them regularly with questions or to discuss changes in my condition than to risk an adverse event that could cause a much more serious situation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2005851044"><span class="h2">Family and friends</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It's vital for any ALS patient and their primary caregiver(s) to maintain a strong network of family and friends who can be called upon for everything from emotional support to help simply navigating daily life. My wife, who is also my primary caregiver, is enormously grateful anytime a friend calls and offers to drop off dinner. We are both grateful anytime someone volunteers to feed me so that my wife can simply enjoy her meal and have a momentary break from caregiving.</p><p>One of my strongest sources of support is a group of friends with whom I used to ride bicycles on weekends and enjoy a casual mid-ride brunch. Once I was no longer able to ride a bike, my friends would meet me at local diners to still enjoy the breakfast; they rode and I drove. More recently, our religious community has formed a "caring circle." My wife and I update a shared online document weekly with our needs (eg, deliver dinner on Tuesday night, drive me to a medical appointment on Thursday afternoon), and volunteers sign up to help us and give my wife a much-needed break.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H664747058"><span class="h2">Self-advocacy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It's incredibly important for patients and their caregivers to advocate strongly for themselves. ALS is complicated, and no single person knows every solution to the problems and challenges that ALS patients face, so sometimes asking the same question of multiple people can result in a combined answer that works.</p><p>It's also vitally important for caregivers to advocate for themselves. I have learned to discuss scheduling visits of friends and family with my wife so that those visits are helpful for her and can give her a break if she needs it rather than an event where she feels she needs to entertain or feed people when she is already exhausted.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1918591623"><span class="h1">IMPACT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3471373566"><span class="h2">Positive changes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some may ask how one can look at an ALS diagnosis and see anything that could be called a "positive change." In my case, continually looking for positives is a large part of what has kept me going for the last six years. Some examples include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Before diagnosis I was very much a "type A," control-oriented person. As I have lost more and more function over the past five years, I have learned to accept that I must let go of things that I cannot control, to have patience when I must wait for others to help me, and to enjoy things that I still can do while gracefully accepting the increasing number of things that I cannot do.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Some very special friendships have become much deeper and more intense. I have seen a level of care and love that I have never before experienced.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>I have been active in ALS research; I have a stack of signed consent forms more than two inches thick. Through my involvement in clinical trials, Expanded Access Programs (EAPs), and observational research studies, I have met some truly amazing and dedicated researchers. For the last two years, I have looked forward to spending a half-day at the hospital every two weeks getting an infusion of an experimental medication simply for the opportunity to spend time learning from people who are incredibly caring and empathetic.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>I have become active in ALS advocacy, doing everything from speaking about living with ALS to fundraising to mentoring of other ALS patients (and some of those patients also mentor me).</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, I have tried to focus on "living" rather than "battling ALS" or "struggling." I meet occasionally with my rabbi, and I regularly remind him that when he writes my eulogy, I want him to say that I "lived with ALS."</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3516485775"><span class="h2">Negative changes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While I try to stay as positive as possible, ALS mostly comes with negative changes, and I could probably write an entire dissertation on the challenges of living with ALS.</p><p>Some of the larger impact changes include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Constantly adapting to physical changes of ALS progression is a continual emotional drain. One ALS patient referred to this as "death by a thousand paper cuts." Just when you have mastered one change, another change comes up to throw you off balance.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Going anywhere outside of my home has become more and more challenging as my physical mobility has declined. I constantly think ahead about the next three to six hours to determine my schedule for eating, bathroom breaks, and caregiving needs. Aside from needing wheelchair accessibility, arrangements for toileting require something more complex than a handicap stall in a public bathroom. As a result, I plan hydration and bathroom breaks as part of any outing very carefully, and I simply decline to participate in some events if I don't think I can do so comfortably. I have come to manage my life around minimizing discomfort. It's very different from my previous lifestyle of simply enjoying life as it came and looking for serendipitous opportunities.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The emotional and physical toll on family caregivers, especially spouses, is immense. Caregiving by my wife is now a 24/7 job from which there is little respite, especially during COVID-19 when it is much more challenging to safely have friends, family, or professionals help.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Alas, <strong>caregivers do not receive the care and attention that they need and deserve</strong>. Most people will focus their attention on the patient. On the occasions when somebody simply asks my wife how she is doing, it means a lot to her and goes a long way towards acknowledging the incredibly difficult role that she has. At one recent clinical trial visit, a nurse with time between patients came into my room and sat down next to my wife and spent 20 minutes just listening to her while my infusion nurse took care of me. My wife was extremely grateful afterwards for the simple gift of someone recognizing she needed care, too.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3059269271"><span class="h2">Work</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>I realized within 15 minutes of receiving my diagnosis that my wife and I would have to sell the small software company we owned. To protect the future of the company, I chose not to disclose my diagnosis to our employees, customers, and larger professional community until after the sale was complete, a process that took two years. Those two years were enormously stressful (I woke up nauseous many mornings) because I went to work every day hiding my diagnosis and the future of our company from my colleagues. In retrospect, I was dealing with tremendous anxiety and in denial. (See <a class="local">'Emotional health'</a> above.)</p><p>Many ALS patients will choose, or find it necessary, to stop working soon after they are diagnosed. Following the sale of our company, I was able to continue working. However, as my physical strength has declined, I made modifications to my work routine. I gave up business travel one year after diagnosis. Later, I moved from typing to voice dictation. Four years after diagnosis, I was able to continue to work but with reduced hours, based on my increasing disability. This change was supported as a "reasonable accommodation" based on requirements set forth by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).</p><p>The single most important fact to share with ALS patients and their families if they plan to stop work immediately after diagnosis is that ALS patients have a special exception for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). ALS patients are <strong>immediately</strong> eligible for SSDI; they do not have to endure the standard five-month waiting period.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3017718635"><span class="h2">The impact of COVID-19</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>On the negative side, with a weaker respiratory system, I had to be especially careful about isolating, and so I was socially much more isolated from family and friends than before COVID-19. As we started to engage professional caregivers during COVID-19, we initially had to look for people who would work exclusively with us to minimize risk of infection.</p><p>As of April 2023, I am still cautious about COVID-19 contact in part because we have lost two close friends with ALS to COVID-19 in the last six months. There are times that I still feel quite lonely, or my wife and I accept more limited help because we are trying to minimize our risk. Just within the last month we have canceled three sets of dinner plans because a guest was feeling under the weather, and even though testing negative, we erred on the side of caution.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had negative impacts on patients with ALS, but there were also some unexpected benefits. I have been able to continue to work much longer than I originally expected because I was able to shift to working virtually. Because all meetings became virtual, I could participate on the same level playing field as my colleagues who do not have disabilities.</p><p>During the first summer of COVID-19, all my ALS clinic appointments became virtual. Relaxed Medicare rules allowed me to conduct virtual visits with all necessary members of my care team, so I was able to spend most of the summer at our vacation home. In my case, my care team knew my situation well enough that the lack of in-person contact did not adversely affect my care. In fact, the shift to virtual visits during COVID-19 turned out to be a huge benefit as I lost strength and mobility. Of course, virtual visits can never be a complete substitute for in-person visits, especially early or late in the disease progression, but they greatly facilitate care for ALS patients (and other patients with significant mobility challenges).</p><p>In addition to virtual visits, many ALS organizations moved their meetings online during COVID-19. This has created a wealth of new resources, especially for those patients in remote locations. I can frequently choose to attend as many as four or five online meetings per week between online support groups, ALS advocacy meetings, meetings to discuss progress in ALS research, and other selected topics.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H990602117"><span class="h1">RESOURCES AND ADVICE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ALS is a disease with a heterogeneous presentation and variable course. The needs of each patient will be unique based on the disease presentation. My perspective is based on my personal ALS journey, but I hope it provides insight helpful for clinicians working with any ALS patient.</p><p>Additionally, as my ALS symptoms have progressed, my perspective has constantly changed based on how I interact with the environment around me. Had I written this a year earlier, I would have emphasized other points and missed some key lessons I have learned over the past 12 months of loss of function. Similarly, I expect to have some different perspectives one year from now.</p><p>At the appointment where I was diagnosed, the neurologist stated at least three or four times "be careful what you read on the internet; there's a lot of garbage about ALS." I found that he was correct. I've been shocked at how much "garbage" there is.
