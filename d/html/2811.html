         Humanized monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) represent a significant addition to therapeutic armamentarium for a variety of malignancies. Many of the agents that are used for cancer therapy share a risk for infusion reactions, most of which occur with the first dose. Although the majority of reactions are mild and not life threatening, serious reactions can occur and may be fatal if not managed appropriately.
        </p>
        <p>
         After an introductory section summarizing the characteristics of infusion-related reactions (IRRs) and the general principles underlying prevention and treatment of these reactions, this review will discuss the reactions that occur with individual MoAbs used for cancer treatment and the prevention and management of these reactions. A discussion of infusion reactions to conventional cytotoxic agents is presented separately, as is a more in depth discussion of cutaneous adverse effects associated with both cytotoxic agents and the therapeutic MoAbs.

         </span>
         SIRs to intravenously administered MoAbs typically develop within 30 minutes to two hours after the initiation of drug infusion, although symptoms may be delayed for up to 24 hours. Reactions tend to be delayed after subcutaneous administration. (See
         <a class="local">

        </p>
        <p>
         The majority of reactions occur after the first or second exposure to the agent, but between 10 and 30 percent occur during subsequent treatments [
         <a href="#rid1">

         The exact mechanism responsible for infusion reactions caused by any of the MoAbs is unclear, although understanding of the pathophysiology is an area of active research. Several different types of reactions to MoAbs have been identified, which may have overlapping clinical features and pathophysiology [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Most reactions appear to be the result of antibody-antigen interactions resulting in cytokine release. The most predictable reaction occurs with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">
          rituximab
         </a>
         and is thought to be caused by the interaction of the drug with the target antigen (CD20) on circulating lymphocytes, followed by cytokine release from these cells as they are destroyed. Evidence for this mechanism includes the observation that severe and fatal reactions have typically occurred in patients with high numbers of circulating lymphocytes bearing the target antigen [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. However, rituximab can also cause type I reactions involving activation of mast cells and basophils, illustrating the point that one drug may be capable of eliciting multiple types of reaction [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         One group analyzed a series of 104 patients and proposed that reactions to MoAbs could be divided into five types, based on clinical signs and symptoms, timing, and biomarkers  (

         The first four types were amenable to desensitization, while SIRs do not require desensitization. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Overview of desensitization'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Other groups have categorized the reactions slightly differently, but also concluded that desensitization was useful in managing multiple types of reactions, and should be used to allow the patient to continue therapy with the drug of choice for their disease [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The mechanism underlying infusion reactions with therapeutic MoAbs might also be related to their ability to elicit human antichimeric antibodies (HACAs), human antihuman (HAHAs), or human antimouse (HAMAs) antibodies. However, a correlation between infusion reactions and HACAs or HAHAs has not been convincingly demonstrated for any drug. Furthermore, the development of antibodies to most of these drugs is far less common (one percent in one study [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]) than the incidence of infusion reactions [

          table 1
         </a>
         ). A common diagnostic mistake is equating anaphylaxis with anaphylactic shock and failing to recognize milder presentations. Anaphylactic shock is the extreme end of a spectrum, but the goal should be recognition and appropriate management of anaphylaxis in its milder forms, when it is more amenable to treatment and interventions can be undertaken to prevent subsequent, more severe reactions. Specifically, a patient who develops limited urticaria and mild wheezing after receiving a monoclonal antibody meets diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis. Administration of the drug should be stopped immediately. The patient should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be considered a candidate for premedication or drug readministration at a slower rate of infusion [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Instead, referral to an allergist should be arranged. In the future, the patient will either need to be changed to a different and non-cross-reacting drug or receive the drug that caused the reaction through a desensitization procedure.

         Anaphylaxis was traditionally defined as a constellation of signs and symptoms that arose from an IgE-mediated allergic reaction which resulted in explosive release of vasoactive mediators from mast cells and basophils throughout the body. However, the definition of anaphylaxis has been expanded in recent years to include any immune or non-immune reaction that leads to widespread activation of mast cells and/or basophils [

          9
         </a>
         ]. This more inclusive definition emphasizes the common endpoint of mast cell/basophil activation and the severity of the reactions that can result and places less importance on the mechanism by which the cells are activated.
        </p>
        <p>
         All reactions with features of anaphylaxis should be considered potentially severe because of the tendency of anaphylaxis to recur and worsen with re-exposure to the causative agent. As an example, a patient who develops limited urticaria and mild wheezing after receiving a medication should be presumed to have anaphylaxis and should not be considered a candidate for premedication and drug readministration at a slower rate of infusion. Instead, referral to an allergist and/or use of a desensitization protocol should be pursued. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Agents that can cause anaphylaxis'

         Evidence that a reaction was anaphylaxis can be obtained from blood tests collected at the time of the reaction and from skin testing, a technique employed by allergy specialists to identify drugs which are capable of causing mast cell activation, especially through IgE-mediated immune mechanisms. These two diagnostic tools are discussed in this section.

          An elevation in
         </strong>
         <strong>
          serum tryptase supports the diagnosis of anaphylaxis
         </strong>
         – Mast cells and basophils contain various chemical mediators that are transiently released into the circulation during anaphylaxis. Some of these are unique to these cell types and, if elevated, can help confirm that the reaction resulted from widespread activation of mast cells and basophils. The finding of an elevated serum total tryptase level suggests that the reaction was anaphylaxis, rather than a severe SIR.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The laboratory test that is most useful in this setting is a serum total tryptase level. Tryptase levels usually peak within three hours of the onset of symptoms, so blood should be drawn one to two hours after a reaction begins. Blood can be collected in a standard red top tube and serum should be frozen if it cannot be assayed promptly. Tryptase in frozen serum is stable for up to one year.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The upper limit of normal for serum total tryptase is 11.4 ng/mL in most laboratories. Any elevation in serum tryptase is consistent with anaphylaxis, although a normal tryptase level does not exclude anaphylaxis because tryptase elevations are not seen in mild anaphylactic reactions. A clinically significant elevation is defined as baseline tryptase x 1.2 + 2 ng/mL. Elevations in anaphylaxis can range from marginally elevated to greater than 100 ng/mL. In addition, if a patient's baseline tryptase is low (eg, 3 ng/mL), a rise to 8 ng/mL would be clinically significant, even though the higher level is still within normal limits. Thus, if a tryptase level is obtained immediately after a reaction, it is important to determine that individual's baseline by obtaining another value once symptoms have resolved for at least 24 hours. The interpretation of tryptase levels in anaphylaxis is discussed separately. (See

          Skin testing to evaluate anaphylaxis
         </strong>
         – Skin testing is a technique used by allergy specialists to determine if a drug is capable of activating mast cells in the skin and therefore potentially able to cause anaphylaxis if administered systemically.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Skin testing for drug allergy is generally performed by specialists with specific training in the technique, proper interpretation of results, and management of the rare allergic reactions that occur in response to the testing itself. Despite this, a few oncology centers perform this testing and have acquired some experience with testing for specific drugs, although this is not a widespread practice. The technique of skin testing is discussed in detail separately. (See

These reactions are much more prevalent in some areas of the southeastern United States, and due to preexisting IgE antibodies from tick bites that are specific for galactose-alpha-1,3 galactose [alpha-gal], which is present on the Fab portion of the cetuximab heavy chain [

        <p>
         Even humanized (&gt;90 percent) and "fully" humanized (&gt;99 percent) MoAbs can cause anaphylaxis, albeit uncommonly, because the transgenic cell lines used to generate the drugs cannot produce human carbohydrate side chains, and these side chains can act as allergens [

        </p>
        <p>
         Allergists/immunologists have a different approach to classifying infusion reactions, which divides them into reactions with features of mast cell or basophil activation (signifying potential progression to anaphylaxis) and those without such features (ie, SIRs). The severity of the reaction is considered separately. This approach is intended to identify patients at risk for anaphylaxis on re-exposure, regardless of the severity of the initial reaction. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Anaphylaxis'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with even mild symptoms of mast cell/basophil activation (eg, urticaria and dyspnea) must be treated with caution, because re-exposure to the causative agent could result in a fulminant and severe anaphylaxis. One of the authors (MC) is aware of unpublished cases in which failure to recognize anaphylaxis and manage it appropriately led to fatalities upon re-exposure to the causative drug, despite the premedications and reduced infusion rates that would have adequately managed most SIRs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, oncology specialists should be familiar with the characteristics of anaphylactic reactions and manage these rare reactions differently from SIRs. We recommend that patients with even mild signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis not be re-exposed to the causative agent until they have been evaluated by an allergy specialist with experience in drug allergy and desensitization [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. In particular, these patients should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be considered candidates for additional premedication and an attempt at drug readministration using a slower rate of infusion.

         Premedication can help prevent and/or reduce the severity of infusion reactions, particularly standard infusion reactions (SIRs). By contrast, anaphylaxis is generally not prevented by premedication, although the severity of the reaction may be reduced in some cases. Attempts to identify patients who are likely to develop infusion reactions have met with limited success.

         [in patients who reside in the Southeastern United States]). However, these regimens have been empirically derived rather than established through randomized trials. Furthermore, they are not completely protective, even for SIRs. Therefore, despite the use of premedication, patients must be monitored closely during and immediately following all infusions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because infusion reactions are most common during the first or second exposures, many clinicians eliminate premedication after the first two courses if there has not been a reaction. However, as noted above, between 10 and 30 percent of infusion reactions with these agents occur after the first two courses of therapy. In some institutions,

         Following a severe SIR, rechallenge is usually discouraged. However, the decision depends on whether the risk for a serious recurrent reaction is felt to be outweighed by mitigating clinical factors (ie, the potential clinical benefit of further treatment and no other reasonable alternatives). Examples at either end of the spectrum might include:

         By contrast, drug substitution rather than rechallenge would be more appropriate for a patient who develops an SIR while receiving

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         If a patient is felt to be a candidate for continuation of therapy because of the potential for clinical benefit and no other reasonable alternatives exist, then rechallenge may be pursued. In most cases, the mechanism of severe SIRs is not known, and so it is difficult to predict the best technique for preventing recurrence. However, we suggest the use of a "desensitization" protocol, in which the drug is readministered in a highly controlled manner, in sequential steps of gradually increasing dose. At the author's institution (MC), these reactions are managed in the same manner as anaphylaxis, with uniformly good outcomes [

         Rechallenge should not be attempted for suspected anaphylaxis. Instead, we suggest referral to an allergy specialist or an oncology center with experience in drug desensitization [

         Although this is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         recommended, there may be instances in which a patient with an apparent episode of anaphylaxis was rechallenged shortly after the reaction (eg, 30 minutes after symptoms have resolved) and appeared to tolerate the reinfusion. This situation can be misinterpreted as evidence that the reaction was not anaphylaxis or as an indication that the patient can receive additional courses safely in the future using standard administration. However, we urge caution in this situation. Mast cells and basophils, the cells involved in anaphylaxis, can be temporarily desensitized immediately after a reaction and may be unable to be activated further. However, the patient is at high risk for a recurrence of anaphylaxis as soon as the cells have recovered their sensitivity, a process which takes days to weeks. This phenomenon has probably contributed to the confusion that currently exists in the medical literature about the safety of rechallenge following a severe infusion reaction.

         Desensitization should only be carried out under close medical supervision by experienced individuals who are comfortable with emergency management of anaphylaxis. At some institutions, all desensitization protocols are performed by allergists.

         Protocols for desensitization are personalized, and risk stratification is required to maximize safety in patients who have presented with anaphylactic reactions. Allergists should be involved in the initial evaluation and qualification of patients for desensitization.

         Drug desensitization protocols are based upon administering increasing doses of medication in a stepwise manner, such that exposure is continuous, begins at very low doses, and increases gradually. The protocols presented herein have been performed successfully in published reports, although modifications may be needed in individual cases and experience with the technique is essential. Clinicians should avoid altering successful protocols to render them faster or significantly change the time interval between doses.
        </p>
        <p>
         Drug desensitization induces a state of temporary tolerance that is dependent on continuous drug exposure. Once the drug is cleared from the system, the state of tolerance is lost. Therefore, patients must be carefully counseled that they remain allergic to the drug and must be desensitized for each subsequent administration. At some institutions, initial desensitizations are carried out in the medical intensive care unit. If the procedure is well tolerated, subsequent desensitizations are performed on standard hospital floors or in hospital-associated infusion units.

         Gradual escalation to the recommended maintenance dose, usually over three to seven days, is required at initiation and after interruption of therapy for ≥7 days to minimize IRRs. In patients with lymphoid malignancies, the initial dose (3 mg) is given over two hours on the first day. Subsequent doses are increased to 10 mg daily then to the final maintenance dose of 30 mg/day three times per week every other day, as tolerated. Most clinicians administer the first three infusions over two hours until most of the B and T lymphocytes have been eliminated from the circulation [

Because of sustained blood levels, infusion reactions do not recur with the same or higher intensity with subsequent doses, as often happens with the slow dose escalations from 3 to 30 mg during the first week of intravenous therapy. Another advantage is that the entire dose can be given safely from the outset of therapy, without the need for a gradual dose escalation. However, the subcutaneous route of administration is associated with a high frequency of local site reactions (pain and erythema) [

Cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which may be life-threatening or fatal, has occurred in patients treated with blinatumomab. CRS has a specific definition and grading schema that are separate from standard immune reactions in the most recent National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  (

In a series of patients living in the southeast US who experienced severe reactions to cetuximab, 17/25 were found to have IgE antibodies in pretreatment serum that were specific for galactose-alpha-1,3 galactose, an oligosaccharide present on the Fab portion of the cetuximab heavy chain [

          37,38

There is some evidence to suggest that patients develop IgE antibodies to galactose-alpha-1,3 galactose as a result of tick bites, as the distribution of patients with cetuximab reactions is similar to that of the Lone Star species of tick found in the southeastern US, and many patients have reported reactions following a series of tick bites [

         One option for patients in high-risk areas is to begin the drug infusion at a lower rate initially (eg, 2.5 to 3 mL/minute) under close observation by an advanced practitioner (clinician, clinician assistant, nurse practitioner) familiar with the immediate management of anaphylaxis and physically present during at least the first 30 minutes of the initial infusion. In addition, the patient could be questioned in advance about characteristics that have been identified as possible risk factors for reactions to

         We would suggest that patients with any of these possible risk factors be observed especially closely during their first and second exposure to

          cetuximab
         </a>
         , particularly in high-risk areas. Although these approaches may not eliminate reactions in highly sensitized patients who react to low doses of the drug, close observation will ensure that the infusion is stopped at the earliest sign of allergic symptoms. In the absence of a reaction during the initial 30 minutes, the rate of infusion could be increased and the remainder of the dose administered over 90 minutes. Patients with pruritus, hives, or any allergic symptom during the initial 30 minutes should have the infusion stopped, have their skin tested within two weeks, and if positive, can be candidates for rapid desensitization [

         The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved manufacturer's package insert recommends premedication with an H1 antagonist 30 to 60 minutes prior to the first dose. The benefit of glucocorticoid premedication, in addition to an antihistamine, was suggested by the MABEL (Monoclonal Antibody Erbitux in A European Pre-Licensure) registry database of over 1000 patients treated with

         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ]. Cetuximab-related infusion reactions were recorded in 16 percent of the population. Rates of any infusion reaction were significantly lower among those pretreated with an antihistamine plus a glucocorticoid as compared with an antihistamine alone (9.6 versus 26 percent) and for grade 3 or 4 reactions (1.0 versus 4.7 percent).
        </p>
        <p>
         An important point is that premedication would not be expected to prevent true IgE-mediated anaphylaxis, so clinicians must remain vigilant for signs of this type of reaction. (See

          irinotecan
         </a>
         , for which premedication with both a glucocorticoid and antihistamine is recommended. For patients receiving cetuximab alone, pretreatment with an antihistamine alone is acceptable, although the addition of a glucocorticoid (with or without an H2 receptor antagonist) is reasonable for those living in high-incidence areas. (See

         infusion is typically initiated at a rate of 50 mg/hour; in the absence of an infusion reaction, it is increased by 50 mg/hour every 30 minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/hour. Subsequent infusions can be started at a rate of 100 mg/hour if the initial infusion was well tolerated and the rate increased by 100 mg/hour every 30 minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/hour if there is no evidence of an infusion reaction.

All subsequent cycles of rituximab can be administered over 90 minutes, with 20 percent of the dose given in the first 30 minutes, and the remainder over the next 60 minutes. The safety of this approach was shown in the phase III RATE trial, in which 363 previously untreated patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who did not experience a grade 3 or 4 infusion-related reaction to rituximab (in combination with one of two different chemotherapy regimens, CHOP versus CVP) during cycle 1 all received a faster infusion in cycle 2, and if well-tolerated, all subsequent cycles [

          96

         ]. Twenty percent of the total dose was administered in the first 30 minutes, and if tolerated, the remainder was administered over 60 minutes. The incidence of grade 3 IRRs during cycle 2 was 1.1 percent (95% CI 0.3-2.8). Based upon these results, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a 90-minute infusion for rituximab starting at cycle 2 for patients with NHL who did not experience a grade 3 or 4 infusion-related adverse reaction during cycle 1. Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease and high circulating lymphocyte counts (&gt;5000/microL) are not recommended to receive the faster infusion, even in the absence of a severe infusion reaction.

The FDA-approved labeling information suggests that patients be observed closely for 60 minutes after the first infusion and for at least 30 minutes after subsequent infusions. If a significant infusion-associated reaction occurs, slow or interrupt the infusion and administer appropriate medical therapies.

         There is a wide spectrum of severity, ranging from mild fever and chills to life-threatening anaphylaxis with bronchospasm, and hypotension. Anaphylaxis (characteristic features being urticaria, wheezing, hypotension, and gastrointestinal symptoms but not fever) must be differentiated from all other types of IRRs (termed standard infusion reactions [SIRs]), regardless of severity.

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Anaphylaxis is likely to recur despite premedication and typically becomes more severe upon re-exposure. For these reasons, patients with symptoms of anaphylaxis (even if mild) should not be re-exposed to the drug until they have been evaluated by an allergist or oncologist with experience in drug allergy.

          Prevention
         </strong>
         – For certain agents, specific prophylactic maneuvers can be helpful; however, despite premedication, clinicians must be prepared for an IRR to occur during each drug administration. Standing orders should be in place to allow immediate intervention without waiting for the clinician to arrive. (See
