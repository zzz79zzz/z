         Understanding the natural history of food allergy in childhood is essential in managing patients with these disorders. The natural history of a food allergy includes information on the acquisition of the allergy, the likelihood that it will be outgrown, and its usual duration.
        </p>
        <p>
         Food allergy most often begins in the first two years of life. Certain food allergies, such as those to cow's milk (CM) and hen's egg (HE), are usually outgrown during childhood or adolescence, whereas peanut and tree nut allergies are more likely to persist into adulthood or may develop in later childhood or adulthood.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic review provides an overview of the natural history of food allergy in children and is focused on immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated allergy. Food allergy in adults is reviewed separately. The clinical manifestations and treatment of food allergy are also discussed separately. (See

         The term "food allergy" refers to an abnormal immunologic reaction to a food that results in the development of symptoms on exposure to that food. This clinical reactivity is assessed by history or challenge. Such reactions can be mediated by IgE antibodies directed against specific food proteins that activate mast cells and basophils or can arise from other cellular processes involving eosinophils or T cells. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2398.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The term "sensitization" is used to denote the presence of IgE directed against a specific antigen (a "positive" test), as detected by in vivo (skin prick test [SPT]) or in vitro (fluorescent-enzyme immunoassay [FEIA]) testing. However, a patient who is sensitized to a particular food may not be clinically reactive upon exposure to the food. Less commonly, a patient may have a clear history of food-allergic reactions with low or undetectable levels of food-specific IgE.

          PREVALENCE OF CHILDHOOD FOOD ALLERGY

         Up to one-third of parents/caregivers report adverse food reactions in their young children, although the rates of verifiable food allergy are much lower [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-6
         </a>
         ]. Nonimmunologic adverse reactions account for the bulk of adverse food reactions. Food sensitization and/or allergy occur in approximately 5 to 10 percent of young children, with peak prevalence at approximately one year of age. However, studies that measure sensitization to food allergens can overestimate the prevalence of true allergic reactions to foods because not all sensitized children will develop symptoms upon ingestion. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Terminology'

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Most food allergy is acquired in the first or second year of life. The peak prevalence of food allergy is approximately 6 to 8 percent at one year of age, although reported rates of oral food challenge (OFC) confirmed food allergy are as high as 11 percent [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-15
         </a>
         ]. Prevalence then falls progressively until late childhood, after which it remains stable at approximately 3 to 4 percent [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10,12,16
         </a>
         ]. Some studies have suggested that the prevalence of food allergy has increased over time.

         The prevalence of parentally reported food allergy in children (aged 0 to 17 years) in the National Health Interview Survey has slowly increased in the United States, from 3.4 percent in 1997 to 1999, to 5.1 percent in 2009 to 2011 [
         <a href="#rid17">

         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ], although there are signs that it may be leveling out, as the rate was 5.8 percent in 2021 [

         Parentally reported adverse food reactions were assessed with a prospective study of 3623 children followed from birth until the age of two years in Norway [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2,20
         </a>
         ]. Parents completed questionnaires at six-month intervals. The cumulative incidence of adverse food reactions was 35 percent by age two years. Cow's milk (CM), fruits (especially citrus and strawberry), and vegetables (especially tomato) accounted for nearly two-thirds of all reported reactions, with a cumulative incidence of 12 percent for CM. Other problematic foods reported by parents included hen's egg (HE; 4.4 percent), fish (3 percent), "nuts" (2.1 percent), and cereals (1.4 percent). The overall duration of food reactivity was short, with approximately two-thirds of the reactions resolving within six months of their onset. The probable explanation for the brief duration of most of these reactions is the commonplace nature of irritant, nonimmunologic food reactions in infants and young children. Mild perioral rashes after eating tomatoes or berries are examples, although IgE-mediated allergies to these foods are also possible.

         The German Multicenter Allergy Study followed the development of sensitization to common food allergens without clinical confirmation of food reactions in a large cohort of children [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21-23
         </a>
         ]. A total of 216 children from a birth cohort of 4082 children were assessed with serum food-specific IgE testing approximately yearly. The overall annual incidence rates for food sensitization decreased from a peak of 10 percent at age one year to 3 percent at age six years. Sensitization to HE and CM were most common, with peak prevalence rates of approximately 6 percent at age one year, followed by wheat and soy. A Danish study that followed 276 children showed similar results, with approximately 6 percent sensitized to CM and/or HE at 1.5 years, rising to approximately 14 percent at 5 years, and falling to 5 percent or less at 10, 15, and 26 years [

         The prevalence of doctor-diagnosed food allergy in children with a consistent clinical history and confirmatory testing was examined in a population-based cohort in Olmsted County, Minnesota from 2002 through 2011 [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27

         Young children who are sensitized to foods or have confirmed IgE-mediated food allergy are more likely than their nonallergic peers to develop allergic rhinitis and asthma later on. This association between early food allergy and later atopic respiratory conditions has been noted in multiple studies [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21,28-30
         </a>
         ] and is similar to that seen with atopic dermatitis. (See

         A meta-analysis of birth cohorts found that early life food sensitization was associated with approximately three times the odds of wheeze/asthma (odds ratio [OR] 2.9) and allergic rhinitis (OR 3.1) at ages four to eight years [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. In the Australian birth cohort mentioned above, food challenge-confirmed food allergy at one year of age was associated with a more than twofold risk of asthma diagnosis at age four years compared with those children not sensitized to foods (asthma prevalence of 23.9 percent compared with 11.5 percent) [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32

         The majority of childhood food allergies are lost over time, although the process of resolution varies a great deal among different foods and individual patients. (See

         </span>
         The mechanisms by which food allergy resolves are not fully understood, and multiple mechanisms are probably involved. Food-specific IgE levels tend to fall over time in most patients with food allergy. This loss of IgE is the best known predictor of the development of clinical tolerance [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33-35
         </a>
         ]. However, it is also clear that some patients become tolerant even with persistently elevated food-specific IgE levels and ongoing positive skin prick tests (SPTs). Thus, loss of IgE is not a requirement for, or even the primary mechanism of, the resolution of food allergy in these patients. Other humoral changes, including increased levels of allergen-specific immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) and/or mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA), may also play a role. Alternately, cellular changes, such as the induction of T regulatory cells, may be important.

          Role of avoidance
         </span>
         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Strict dietary avoidance of the foods to which a child is allergic has been a mainstay of food allergy management. The primary reason for avoidance is prevention of reactions. Strict avoidance is usually advised, rather than having patients ingest an allergen in subthreshold amounts, because patients may accidentally consume a larger amount than intended and elicit an allergic reaction. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2406.html" rel="external">
          "Management of food allergy: Avoidance", section on 'How strict must avoidance be?'
         </a>
         and
         <a class="local">
          'Determining if an allergy has resolved'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         It was also hoped that strict avoidance might increase the chance of outgrowing an allergy or hasten resolution. However, there were few studies to support this idea, and at least one study that found that neither strict avoidance nor accidental ingestion was associated with acquisition of tolerance [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36-38
         </a>
         ]. In addition, results from subsequent studies have suggested that regular exposure to extensively heated cow's milk (CM) and hen's egg (HE) in children who tolerated the more processed forms of these allergens shortens the time to resolution of the allergy [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39-41
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Role of baked milk in resolution of CMA'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="local">
          'Role of baked egg in resolution of egg allergy'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         It is not known whether intermittent trace consumption of allergen has any effect on resolution of allergy. In one study of young children, exposures to CM, HE, or peanut resulting in allergic reactions during food challenges or accidental ingestion did not appear to cause increases in sensitization [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Some patients demonstrate sensitization to a food that they consume (eg, a positive allergen SPT or elevated serum food-specific IgE), but they do not have a clear history of reactions to that food. Several small case series have reported that invoking strict avoidance of the food occasionally results in acute and severe reactions to the self-same food upon intentional or accidental reintroduction [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43-46
         </a>
         ]. This phenomenon may represent a loss of a desensitized state to a food that was maintained while it was regularly ingested. While there are no formal studies assessing the risk of occurrence of this uncommon outcome, decisions regarding removal of foods from the diet (eg, in patients with suspected food-triggered atopic dermatitis) need to consider this possibility. No foods should be removed from the diet based solely upon a positive blood test or SPT result (ie, based upon sensitization alone). (See

         The child with food allergy must be followed regularly by both the pediatrician and allergy specialist to assure that growth is normal and that adequate nutrition is provided. Consultation with a dietitian can help further education regarding allergen avoidance and adequate food substitutes. This may be necessary if there are many foods to be avoided and if there is slowing of growth. The allergy specialist should review all accidental exposures and food reactions in order to assure that avoidance measures are adequate, reactions are recognized promptly and treated appropriately,

         autoinjectors are current and available to the child in all settings (if appropriate), and that the patient and caregivers understand the management plan. Just as importantly, accidental exposures that did not result in reactions should be assessed with hopes that the allergy is resolving.

         The allergy specialist should evaluate the child at regular intervals to determine if the allergy has been outgrown. Reevaluation can be accomplished with in vitro and/or SPT and information on accidental exposures. Reevaluation is usually performed yearly; however, longer or shorter intervals may be more appropriate in some situations [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. As an example, a young child with a reaction to fruit might be evaluated every six months because reactions to fruit at this age are not necessarily due to true allergy and, even if they are, are quickly outgrown. In contrast, a 10 year old with peanut allergy (typically a lifelong allergy) whose tests remain elevated may only be tested every few years. In general, the higher the food-specific IgE level or the larger the SPT wheal, the less likely the child is to become tolerant in the short term. However, many young children will outgrow their allergy to foods such as CM and HE later in childhood or adolescence.

         The optimal testing method of monitoring specific food allergies has not yet been determined. Thus, various approaches are used. Some centers use in vitro testing (eg, fluorescent-enzyme immunoassay [FEIA] such as ImmunoCAP) in addition to clinical history to follow patients, whereas others use skin testing. Still other centers use both types of testing, especially when making decisions about whether or not to proceed to an oral food challenge (OFC). Testing for allergic disease is reviewed separately.

         Neither in vitro testing nor SPT is perfect in determining resolution of a food allergy. Negative tests do not guarantee loss of allergy with absolute certainty, and positive tests can persist even after a patient has developed tolerance to a food [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48,49
         </a>
         ]. Thus, a clinician-supervised OFC is often required to prove that the allergy has resolved. As an example, it is usually reasonable to proceed with an OFC to determine if the allergy has resolved in a patient who has tolerated a larger accidental exposure, even if in vitro or SPT results have not improved. OFCs must be performed with caution and should be performed only by an allergy specialist with full emergency equipment and medications on hand to treat possible reactions. (See

         As an example, soy allergy is typically outgrown more quickly than allergy to other common foods such as CM and HE. Thus, blood and/or skin testing is often performed yearly. Challenge is usually offered when the results of in vitro testing have reached levels of ≤20 kU/L, although some patients with peanut allergy may have far higher levels due to cross-reactivity between peanut and soy on in vitro testing. The approach to monitoring and testing for resolution for individual food allergens is discussed in the allergen-specific topics.

         Cow's milk allergy (CMA) is the most common food allergy among infants and young children. Resolution is gradual throughout childhood and adolescence and is influenced by various factors.

         CMA affects approximately 0.5 to 2.5 percent of children during the first two years of life, with lower rates reported for allergy confirmed by oral food challenge (OFC) compared with self-reported allergy [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,13,15,26
         </a>
         ]. Much of reported CMA is non-IgE mediated. A large Danish study published in 1990 confirmed CMA in 2.2 percent of children followed to age three years but noted that nearly one-half of the cases were non-IgE-mediated allergic conditions, such as dietary protein-induced proctitis/colitis, enteropathy, and enterocolitis [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28

         The resolution of CMA is variable, depending upon the type of allergy (IgE mediated or non-IgE mediated) [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28,48,50
         </a>

         <a href="#rid28">
          28,33,40,51
         </a>
         ]. Non-IgE-mediated CMA tends to resolve more quickly. The common CM protein-induced proctocolitis typically resolves by one year of age, and, for this condition, CM can be introduced at home. For food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), a careful OFC supervised by an allergy specialist in a setting appropriate for a high-risk procedure is warranted by the age of two to three years if there have been no recent reactions from accidental exposures. Challenges in patients with FPIES who were very ill upon presentation should be performed under close supervision in a hospital setting. Concomitant allergic rhinitis and asthma and onset of the allergy at less than one month of age are risk factors for persistent IgE-mediated food allergies. Introduction of extensively heated CM may speed resolution of IgE-mediated CMA [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ]. (See

         Resolution rates for IgE-mediated CMA are significantly lower than those of non-IgE-mediated CMA, although there are little data on population trends in resolution in the era of widespread testing for tolerance of extensively heated milk. One study followed 98 children (median age 24 months) with CMA (two-thirds with IgE-mediated allergy) for a median of two years (range: 6 to 72 months) [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. Development of tolerance occurred in 22 percent of those with IgE-mediated allergy compared with 59 percent of those with non-IgE-mediated CMA. In another study of 139 children with CMA (half with IgE-mediated allergy) followed for an average of seven years, CMA resolved in 34 percent by age 2 years, 55 percent by age 5 years, and 68 percent by age 10 years [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53
         </a>
         ]. However, tolerance was delayed in the subgroup of children with IgE-mediated CMA, with resolution occurring in none of these children by age 2 years, 22 percent by age 5 years, and 43 percent by age 10 years.
        </p>
        <p>
         Resolution rates vary in different study populations. Rates of resolution in children with IgE-mediated CMA followed in allergy practices are lower than those of children in the general population, probably because these children are more severely allergic, although other confounders have not been excluded. One large, retrospective study reported resolution rates in 807 children with CMA who were followed by allergy specialists [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. If resolution was defined as passing an OFC or having a cow's milk-specific IgE (CM-IgE) of &lt;3 kUA/L and no reactions within the past year, CMA resolved in 19, 42, 64, and 79 percent of children at ages 4, 8, 12, and 16 years, respectively. In contrast, 76 percent of children with IgE-mediated CMA in the previously described Danish study recruited from the general population were tolerant by age three years [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, several clinical features are associated with persistent IgE-mediated CMA, including reactivity to baked CM products; the presence of concomitant allergic rhinitis, asthma, or moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis; and onset of the allergy in the first month of life [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33,40,51,54
         </a>
         ]. As an example, an Israeli study followed 105 children with CMA for a period of eight years [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ]. Sixty-one percent of patients with persistent CMA had asthma compared with 19 percent in the resolution group. However, this association may just reflect the fact that these children were followed later into childhood than children whose allergy had resolved.

         In general, the higher the CM-IgE, the less likely the child is to become tolerant over time. In the retrospective study discussed previously, persistence was more likely in patients with higher initial levels of CM-IgE [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. Median CM-IgE in the first two years of life was 19 kUA/L in the children with CMA that persisted compared with 1.8 kUA/L in those with CMA that eventually resolved [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. In addition, CM-IgE levels in persistent CMA tended to increase over the first three to four years of life and then gradually decrease, while those in resolving CMA were stable initially and then gradually declined. Similarly, in a prospective series of 293 children aged 3 to 15 months with CMA, 72 percent (88 of 122) with a baseline CM-IgE &lt;2 kUA/L had resolved CMA compared with only 23 percent (19 of 82) of those with baseline CM-IgE ≥10 kUA/L [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>

         Another study examined the rate of change in levels of CM-IgE over time, in relation to the patient's age, in children who developed CMA before the age of four years [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57
         </a>
         ]. CM-IgE levels decreased more rapidly in those who developed tolerance. Independent of initial levels, the percentage amount that CM-IgE dropped in one year correlated with the likelihood that the child would pass an OFC performed at that time. If the CM-IgE dropped 50, 75, 90, and 99 percent, there was a 31, 45, 66, and 95 percent chance of passing the OFC, respectively. For CM-SPT, declining SPT wheal size over time is also predictive of resolution [

         Hen's egg allergy (HEA) is one of the most common food allergies of childhood. The presence of HEA is a marker for subsequent sensitization to aeroallergens, as well as the later development of asthma [

          21,62

Patients are typically reevaluated yearly, with clinical history and in vitro testing and/or SPT. Egg-specific IgE (E-IgE) levels may indicate probability of resolution and the likelihood that a child has outgrown the sensitivity.

Peanut and tree nut allergy affects at least 0.5 to 3 percent of children and may be increasing over time. Although it was initially believed to be a lifelong sensitivity in nearly all cases, subsequent studies have shown that tolerance can develop in approximately 20 to 30 percent of patients. Less is known about tree nut allergy, although a minority of patients appear to lose this sensitivity as well.

         Many studies from the United States and Europe have estimated the prevalence of peanut and tree nut allergies at 0.4 to 1.3 percent in children and 0.5 to 1 percent in the overall population [
         <a href="#rid74">
          74,75,77-80
         </a>
         ]. As an example, a meta-analysis of peanut allergy in Europe that included clinical history and OFCs found a rate of peanut allergy of 1.6 percent, although there were large geographic variations [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. In population-based Australian studies of 1 year olds conducted between 2007 and 2011 and 10 to 14 year olds surveyed between 2011 and 2014, the rate of peanut allergy was 3 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively [
         <a href="#rid81">
          81,82
         </a>
         ]. Using a similar design, the same group again assessed the rate of peanut allergy among one year olds in Australia in 2018 to 2019, after new guidance to introduce peanut, and did not find a statistically significant change in the rate of peanut allergy in a standardized population (2.6 percent) [
         <a href="#rid82">
          82
         </a>
         ]. The rate of tree nut allergies varies widely throughout the world. In a systematic review, the prevalence of tree nut allergies in children was 0 to 1.4 percent when confirmed by OFC, 0 to 4.9 percent by self-report, and 0.8 to 6.5 percent based upon sensitization. In Europe, hazelnut allergy was most commonly reported, while Brazil nut, almond, and walnut were most common in the United Kingdom and walnut and cashew in the United States [

         <a href="#rid75">
          75,86

         <a href="#rid87">
          87

         <a href="#rid88">
          88

         ]. However, studies that incorporate measures of sensitization have not shown the same increase. Rates of IgE sensitization to peanut were steady among US children in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 1988 and 1994 and 2005 and 2006 [

         Recurrences have been reported in patients thought to have outgrown peanut allergy, although this is unusual. Recurrence of tree nut allergy has not been studied. Infrequent ingestion of peanut may be a risk factor for recurrence/resensitization, but these data are derived from small numbers of cases.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a follow-up of two studies, 62 of 64 patients who passed challenges subsequently ate peanut, but most did so infrequently (ie, once a month or less) [
         <a href="#rid76">
          76,78
         </a>
         ]. There were two possible cases of recurrent reactions. In a third study, recurrent reactions were found in 3 of 36 patients (8 percent) with a clear history of peanut allergy who had previously passed a peanut OFC [
         <a href="#rid99">
          99
         </a>
         ]. An example of a case was a six-year-old girl who had presented at age one year with generalized urticaria and facial angioedema within five minutes of eating a peanut butter cracker. Her PN-IgE level at diagnosis was 2.79 kUA/L, and she had no history of other food allergies. At age 4.5 years, her PN-IgE level was 1.1 kUA/L, and she passed peanut OFC. She subsequently ate only "may contain peanut" products until approximately 1.8 years after the initial OFC, when she had two bites of Butterfinger ice cream and within 15 minutes developed urticaria, coughing, difficulty breathing, throat tightness, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. A repeat PN-IgE level was &gt;100 kUA/L. An SPT was not performed, and a DBPCFC was deferred because of the severity of the reaction and the high PN-IgE level.
        </p>
        <p>
         In this and several other small series of patients with resolved peanut allergy, it appears that recurrence may be more common among those who continue to avoid peanut or eat it infrequently [

         IgE-mediated wheat allergy affects 0.1 to 1 percent of children in the United States and Europe, where wheat is a staple in the diet [

          3,11,25,104,105

         Wheat allergy resolves by adolescence in most patients. Earlier resolution is seen in the general population followed by pediatricians compared with referred patient populations seen at tertiary-care centers. Peak wheat-specific IgE has some predictive value in determining the age at which tolerance develops, and higher levels may indicate risk of persistent allergy.
        </p>
        <p>
         In studies of children with food allergy and atopic dermatitis, wheat allergy was outgrown in 25 and 33 percent of children over a one- and two-year follow-up, respectively [
         <a href="#rid107">
          107,108
         </a>
         ]. In the general population, wheat allergy resolves in 80 percent of patients by five years of age [
         <a href="#rid102">
          102
         </a>
         ]. However, tolerance appears to develop more slowly in a highly atopic population followed at a tertiary-care center, as is seen in similar populations with CMA and HEA [
         <a href="#rid101">
          101

         ].

         A retrospective study examined the natural course of IgE-mediated wheat allergy in 103 children followed at a large referral center from 1993 to 2007 [
         <a href="#rid101">
          101
         </a>
         ]. OFCs to wheat were performed in 61 percent during the study period. The median age at which tolerance was acquired was 6.6 years. However, the median age at resolution varied considerably depending upon peak wheat IgE (approximately 2, 4, and 10 years of age for children with peak wheat IgE levels &lt;20, 20 to 50, and &gt;50 kUA/L, respectively). Overall, tolerance was achieved by 29, 56, and 70 percent at 4, 8, and 14 years of age, respectively. In children aged two to eight years, the median wheat IgE levels associated with resolved allergy ranged from 21 to 25 kUA/L, whereas the median levels associated with persistent allergy ranged from 62 to 70 kUA/L. Patients with wheat sensitization (wheat IgE &gt;20 kUA/L but no history of symptomatic exposure) passed OFCs at rates similar to the children discussed above who had a history of symptomatic wheat allergy.

         Earlier studies suggested that soy allergy is typically outgrown in the preschool-age years [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28,107-109

          110

         In one series of 30 children with lentil allergy, the median age of onset was 1.5 years, and the allergy had resolved in 50 percent by 3.5 years of age [

         As mentioned previously, adverse reactions to fruits, vegetables, and other cereal grains are typically very short lived in children [

          64,109,116
         </a>
         ]. Many of these reactions may represent intolerances or irritant reactions rather than true allergy, and most children will lose their sensitivity to these foods within a period of 6 to 12 months. A minority of children have severe, IgE-mediated allergies to these foods that may persist over time, however. Children may also develop oral allergy syndrome (food-pollen allergy syndrome). (See

          Prevalence and atopic march
         </strong>
         – The peak prevalence of food allergy is approximately 6 to 8 percent at one year of age and then falls progressively. By late childhood, the prevalence is 3 to 4 percent and remains stable thereafter. Children with food allergy are at high risk for developing later allergic rhinitis and asthma. (See

         <strong>
          Natural history
         </strong>
         – Most childhood food allergies are lost during childhood or adolescence, although certain allergies tend to persist, such as those to fish/shellfish and peanut/tree nut. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Overview of resolution'

         <strong>
          General monitoring of the child with food allergy
         </strong>
         – Optimal monitoring of the child with food allergies requires the cooperative input of both the general pediatrician (to assess growth and development) and the allergy specialist (to address ongoing education, proper medication use, and reevaluate allergic status), as well as a dietitian in children with allergies to multiple foods that are staples in the diet. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Monitoring the child with food allergy'

         <strong>
          Serial testing
         </strong>
         – Most allergy experts use a combination of historical information from accidental exposures and periodic in vitro and/or skin testing. As an example, a challenge may be offered at a higher specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) level if there is a history of a recent accidental exposure without a reaction. Alternatively, a challenge will not be offered when the specific IgE is below the designated cutoff level but the patient has had a recent exposure that triggered a reaction. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Serial testing'

         <strong>
          Oral food challenge
         </strong>
         – An oral food challenge (OFC) medically supervised by an allergy specialist is recommended to confirm that a food allergy has resolved since in vitro and skin tests can remain positive in patients who achieve clinical tolerance and, conversely, tests can become negative in patients who still react upon ingestion, although the latter situation is uncommon.

         – Cow's milk allergy (CMA; all types) affects approximately 2.5 percent of children under two years of age. The most common forms of non-IgE-mediated CMA are transient childhood conditions that are almost always outgrown, with the exception of eosinophilic esophagitis. IgE-mediated CMA may persist into adolescence, although it is usually outgrown by adulthood. (See
