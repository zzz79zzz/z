         Acute painful episodes are likely to be the most common reason for individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) to seek medical attention.
        </p>
        <p>
         When a patient with SCD presents with pain, the evaluation (to characterize the pain and uncover any associated conditions) and the treatment for the pain (analgesia and other interventions) both need to occur rapidly. A major aspect of the evaluation involves distinguishing between pain due to vaso-occlusion and pain that signifies more serious complications of disease, which often require separate evaluations and treatments in addition to analgesia.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic review discusses the immediate evaluation of the individual with SCD who presents with acute pain, and the testing needed to identify other SCD complications or comorbidities that require treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Separate topic reviews provide detailed discussions of our approaches to providing analgesia for acute vaso-occlusive pain, chronic SCD pain management, and the role of blood transfusion in treating acute SCD complications such as stroke, acute chest syndrome, and multiorgan failure.

         Patients with SCD who present with acute pain should have a rapid assessment for the possibility of other serious complications concurrently with the treatment of pain.

          Features associated with acute vaso-occlusive pain

          —
         </span>
         Acute vaso-occlusive pain in SCD is intense; it can begin as early as six months of age and typically lasts throughout life [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. The intensity can range from mild to debilitating, and the duration can last from hours to days. Mothers with SCD have compared their intensity of acute pain to be more severe than pain associated with labor.
        </p>
        <p>
         Common locations for vaso-occlusive pain include the back, chest, abdomen, and long bones. Infants and toddlers may present with dactylitis (pain and swelling from infarctions involving the hands and feet). Premenstrual hormonal changes may be associated with an increase in vaso-occlusive pain episodes. Neuropathic pain, which may include components of central sensitization, peripheral nerve injury, and/or hyperalgesia, increases with age and is likely underdiagnosed in individuals with SCD.
        </p>
        <p>
         The
         <strong>
          gold standard
         </strong>
         for assessment of the pain is the patient's (or family's) report of the pain severity and similarity to or difference from previous vaso-occlusive pain episodes. There are no specific laboratory findings associated with vaso-occlusive pain.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Analgesia should not be delayed
         </strong>
         while awaiting other information such as laboratory tests, and results of laboratory testing should not be used to justify withholding of pain medication or use of a lower dose. Studies have suggested that misperceptions of health care providers can interfere significantly with adequate assessment of pain intensity, and in turn may lead to insufficient treatment. These considerations and supporting evidence are presented in more detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7144.html" rel="external">

         Analgesia remains the cornerstone of therapy for vaso-occlusive pain, and opioids are often needed for patients who present to their clinician after being unable to control the pain at home. Analgesia should not be delayed while performing additional evaluations, and triage wait time should not exceed 30 minutes. Our approach to acute pain control in SCD, including these issues, is presented in detail separately. (See

         SCD can be associated with vaso-occlusion in almost any site, and this in turn can lead to potentially life-threatening infarction, infection, or other complications. General features that suggest an additional complication are listed above. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Features that suggest an additional complication'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Initially, we review the likelihood of each potential complication based on the patient's clinical presentation, as summarized in the table (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110434" href="/z/d/graphic/110434.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). In individuals with high-risk features in their history, abnormal vital signs, physical examination findings, or major changes from the baseline complete blood count (CBC), we obtain targeted laboratory tests and/or observe the patient in the hospital.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are several high-risk features and areas of potential concern that we consider to be risk factors for complications, and we pay particular attention to the following findings in a patient with SCD having acute pain:

         – Individuals who present with acute pain during pregnancy or postoperatively also warrant early intervention and close observation. These individuals are at increased risk for venous thromboembolism, acute chest syndrome, and infection. (See

         Pregnancy-related mortality is also increased. In a retrospective study from the National Inpatient Sample that compared outcomes of deliveries among Black people with SCD, Black people without SCD, and non-Black controls, the mortality rate of patients with SCD was &gt;10 times that of the Black patients without SCD and 26 times that of the non-Black patients [

         Once the history, vital signs, and examination have been reviewed for possible complications, the need for additional laboratory testing is determined. We systematically review the possible causes of these findings and determine which require further evaluation (

         ). These are discussed in more detail in the following sections. Exclusion of possible complications does not necessarily require ordering of additional testing, but it does require conversation with the patient, a thorough review of the common potential complications, and attention to features that suggest increased risk.

        <p>
         Observation in the hospital may be especially helpful in identifying or systematically excluding a potentially life-threatening complication, especially if the history suggests high-risk features and initial testing (laboratory values, chest radiography) is unrevealing.

         Pain in multiple areas or nonspecific pain may be a sign of an acute systemic illness such as multiorgan failure, an entity known as rapidly progressive acute chest syndrome, or a hemolytic transfusion reaction (HTR).

          Multiorgan failure
         </strong>
         – Individuals with multiorgan failure may have a history of organ dysfunction such as chronic lung disease or chronic renal disease, although this may not always be present. Presenting findings may include especially severe, diffuse pain, along with fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea. Blood pressure can be variably high or low. Laboratory studies in multiorgan failure may show evidence of bone marrow suppression (eg, hemoglobin level below the patient's baseline; thrombocytopenia) and evidence of increased hemolysis and/or rhabdomyolysis such as increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), increased creatinine kinase (CK), increased creatinine, marked increase bilirubin, and increased liver enzymes. Of note, some individuals with SCD have a low creatinine at baseline, so a clinically significant increase may appear to be within the normal range. Multiorgan failure is life-threatening, and urgent hematology and/or transfusion medicine input is appropriate so that exchange transfusion can be initiated. (See

          Rapidly progressive acute chest syndrome
         </strong>
         – A distinct phenotype of acute chest syndrome (ACS) has been identified, referred to as rapidly progressive ACS [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. This syndrome is characterized by respiratory failure ≤24 hours after the onset of respiratory symptoms and is associated with multiorgan failure. It is distinct from ACS that has a more subacute and protracted course. In a cohort of 173 individuals (97 children and 76 adults) with SCD and at least one ACS episode, rapidly progressive ACS occurred in 16 (21 percent) of the adults and 2 (2 percent) of the children [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. A decline in platelet count at presentation was the only predictor of developing rapidly progressive ACS (odds ratio 4.82 [95% CI 1.20-19.39]).

          Hemolytic transfusion reaction
         </strong>
         – HTRs can occur in the immediate post-transfusion period (ie, acute hemolytic transfusion reaction [AHTR]) or they may occur up to a month after transfusion due to antibody boosting from re-exposure to a red blood cell antigen (ie, delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction [DHTR]). Individuals with SCD are at increased risk of HTRs, especially DHTRs, due to the frequency of transfusions and the greater likelihood of alloimmunization. Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions may present as an acute vaso-occlusive event. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128123.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         AHTRs are generally more clinically severe because they involve a greater degree of hemolysis and the hemolysis is mostly intravascular; intravascular hemolysis can be associated with renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). However, DHTRs can also be clinically significant, especially in individuals with SCD who have ongoing compensated hemolysis at baseline. Presenting findings of AHTRs include acute back or chest pain, fever/chills, red urine, red plasma, oozing from catheter sites, and laboratory evidence of DIC (increased prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time [PT and aPTT], decreased fibrinogen, increased D-dimer). DHTRs may present with painless jaundice. Both AHTRs and DHTRs are associated with laboratory evidence of hemolysis, including reduced hemoglobin compared with the patient's baseline, increased LDH, and increased bilirubin. The evaluation and management of HTRs are presented separately. (See

          Opioid withdrawal
         </strong>
         – In a patient receiving opioids or who has recently had opioids discontinued, opioid withdrawal or neuropathic pain may present with diffuse pain. In opioid withdrawal, autonomic findings may be present such as tachycardia, tachypnea, restlessness, rhinorrhea, abdominal cramping, and/or diarrhea. Opioid withdrawal syndrome commonly presents as vaso-occlusive pain in patients who have been exposed to recent prolonged opioid use and have not undergone a tapering program [

         Stroke risk is increased in SCD (ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes), especially in those with a prior history of stroke, a history of silent cerebral infarcts, or increased transcranial Doppler velocities. Some individuals develop cerebral aneurysms with a moya-moya-like pattern. Focal or nonfocal neurologic findings may be present. There are no specific laboratory findings associated with stroke. Imaging is indicated to determine the presence, site, and features of a vascular lesion. Treatment with simple blood transfusion is appropriate for those with suspected stroke. (See

         Individuals with SCD are at risk for infection with encapsulated organisms including meningitis, due to their functional asplenia, which occurs by early childhood. This may be especially true in those who do not have access to prophylactic penicillin but is also possible in those receiving prophylaxis. (See

         The history may be helpful in distinguishing among these (eg, history of deep vein thrombosis [DVT] suggests greater likelihood of PE; history of cardiac disease or pulmonary hypertension suggests increased risk of cardiac ischemia; history of coughing with abrupt pain in the chest wall suggests rib fracture). However, a high level of suspicion for the possibility of ACS should be maintained regardless of history. (See

         A small proportion of children and approximately 20 percent of adults may develop a syndrome of rapidly progressive ACS associated with multiorgan failure. (See

        <p>
         Asthma or bronchospasm is a serious finding associated with increased risk of complications in an individual with acute pulmonary symptoms, and it warrants close observation and admission if bronchospasm does not resolve. Individuals with these conditions may have associated tachycardia, tachypnea, fever, and hypoxia. Many patients with chest pain and acute respiratory symptoms have had a bronchoactive pulmonary component despite the absence of a history of asthma or wheezing. Cough is more likely in children; adults with ACS may have severe chest pain without cough. Imaging (eg, chest radiography) is indicated if these diagnoses are considered; however, chest radiography may be negative initially in ACS.
        </p>
        <p>
         PE may be difficult to diagnose initially and often occurs without antecedent diagnosis of DVT. Additional risk factors for PE include pregnancy, prolonged immobilization, obesity, history of splenectomy, and history of other thrombophilia. An elevated D-dimer is also consistent with PE, as discussed in more detail separately. (See

         Cardiac chest pain is increasingly recognized in individuals with SCD, especially those with frequent vaso-occlusive pain, even in the absence of large vessel coronary artery disease. Acute myocardial ischemia may present as atypical chest pain that radiates to the arm. Patients with SCD who have acute myocardial ischemic disease are often younger and without traditional risk factors, and they have a higher mortality rate than non-SCD patients with cardiac ischemia [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. While any individual with SCD can develop myocardial ischemia, those with pulmonary hypertension, diastolic dysfunction, and corrected QT interval prolongation (QTc) are at increased risk. (See

         Bone infarction of a rib or the sternum typically presents as localized pain that can be elicited by pressing on the site of infarction. While individuals with rib infarction can develop ACS from hypoventilation and splinting, they are less likely to have a concomitant significant pulmonary parenchymal defect than those without rib tenderness. Individuals with rib infarction may have splinting hypoventilation, which predisposes to infection and ACS. (See

         Hepatic or splenic sequestration are characterized by massive shifts of a large proportion of the blood volume into the liver or spleen, which can cause hemodynamic instability tachycardia and hypertension. The spleen or liver may become enlarged and tender. The hemoglobin may decrease dramatically below the patient's baseline. Hepatic sequestration may be exacerbated by underlying liver disease due to iron overload (from transfusions), hepatitis C virus infection (HCV), or other causes of liver disease. These conditions require a high index of suspicion and close monitoring, due to the massive volume shifts and organ failure. Early specialist input is advised. (See

         Renal and urinary tract disease in children may not be associated with specific findings attributable to the site of infarction or infection (ie, flank pain may be absent). There may be suprapubic tenderness. Adults with urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis often present with dysuria or tenderness in the back, flank, or costovertebral angle. The urinalysis may show abnormalities related to infection (eg, red blood cells, white blood cells, bacteria) or infarction (eg, red blood cells). The creatinine may be increased. (See

         Individuals with SCD are at increased risk of gallstones and biliary disease due to chronic hemolytic anemia, which can lead to the production of heme pigment stones.

         Women with SCD can have acute vaso-occlusive pain either a few days before or at the same time as their onset of the menstrual cycle. This acute vaso-occlusive pain is distinct from dysmenorrhea, and the women can distinguish the difference [

         Optimal management of acute vaso-occlusive pain associated with the menstrual cycle (or of dysmenorrhea) in women with SCD is unknown. One option is birth control that abates the menstrual cycle. Our experience is that stopping the menstrual cycle will decrease the rates of vaso-occlusive pain associated with their menstrual cycle, dysmenorrhea, or both. The pros and cons of this strategy must be discussed with the patient. (See

         Not all extremity pain in SCD is related to acute vaso-occlusive pain episodes. Distinguishing the duration of the pain (acute versus chronic), location, intensity, and precipitating events may facilitate development of a working differential diagnosis. This subject is discussed in more detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5919.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         If the area is associated with swelling, tenderness, or warmth, bone infarction, dactylitis, gout, and osteomyelitis are possible. Gout and dactylitis tend to affect smaller joints, whereas avascular necrosis tends to affect the hips. However, avascular necrosis of the hip may present as referred pain to the pelvis, buttocks, groin, and/or leg. Osteomyelitis may cause variable joint involvement and is significantly less common than bone infarction; the white blood cell count is often increased, and imaging may show periosteal elevation or a fluid collection. The diagnosis of osteomyelitis is often delayed. In a prospective cohort study involving 88 patients with 125 joints affected by osteonecrosis of the femoral head, presentations included pain in the spine, knee, buttocks, and groin; sometimes the examination was normal [
         <a href="#rid11">

        <p>
         DVT may present with localized tenderness without fever or warmth. Individuals with SCD have a baseline increased risk for DVT, which may be further increased in the setting of pregnancy, recent surgery, or an acute medical illness. (See

         Blood transfusion is not used to treat uncomplicated vaso-occlusive pain that is not associated with any oxygen requirement to augment a low oxygen saturation, unless accompanied by a clinically significant drop from the patient's steady-state hemoglobin level (typically, a decline of greater than 2 g/dL from baseline) along with a declining or inappropriately low reticulocyte count, indicative of bone marrow suppression. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90145.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         However, as noted in the sections above, blood transfusion is indicated for the treatment of several of the potentially serious complications that may present with pain. Importantly, the decision to use blood transfusion is based on the presence of the complication rather than the hemoglobin level, because transfusions work by reducing the percentage of sickle hemoglobin and sickled red blood cells, not by increasing oxygen delivery. Exchange transfusion is most effective at rapidly lowering the percentage of sickle hemoglobin without causing hyperviscosity, but simple transfusion is often more rapidly available. A discussion of the indications, techniques, and other issues related to transfusion in SCD is presented separately. Early involvement of the specialist(s) with expertise in SCD and exchange transfusion is advised when one of these complications is suspected. (See

         The specific gravity of the urine may not be an indication of hypovolemia in children and adults with SCD because of hyposthenuria, a common finding related to the effects of SCD on the kidney. (See

         Isotonic fluids are not used unless there is clear evidence of hypovolemia based on a history of decreased fluid intake, increased fluid loss (eg, due to gastroenteritis with diarrhea or urinary tract infection with enuresis), or both. If isotonic fluid is given, a small bolus of fluid is given and the patient's volume status is re-evaluated. As an example, a child could be given 10 mL/kg of fluid; an adult could be given 500 to 1000 mL. We do not use isotonic fluid in the absence of clear hypovolemia in children and adults presenting with acute vaso-occlusive pain. (See

          Features of vaso-occlusive pain
         </strong>
         – Vaso-occlusive pain in sickle cell disease (SCD) can begin as early as six months of age, can range from mild to debilitating, and can last from hours to days. Common locations for vaso-occlusive pain include the back, chest, abdomen, and long bones. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Features associated with acute vaso-occlusive pain'

         <strong>
          Features that suggest another cause
         </strong>
         – Certain features suggest the possibility that an additional complication of SCD may be present, which may be potentially life threatening. These include the patient (or family) report that the pain is atypical; abnormal vital signs; major changes from the baseline complete blood count (CBC) or reticulocyte count; and other abnormalities on examination or initial laboratory testing, as discussed above. (See
         <a class="local">

          Rapid analgesia
         </strong>
         – Regardless of the cause of pain, appropriate
         <strong>
          analgesia should not be delayed
         </strong>
         while awaiting other information such as results of laboratory testing, and triage wait time should not exceed 30 minutes. Misperceptions among members of the health care team can interfere with adequate assessment and treatment of pain. These issues, and our approach to analgesia in SCD, are discussed in detail separately. (See

          Evaluation
         </strong>
         – Initially, we review the likelihood of each potential complication based on the patient's clinical presentation, as summarized in the table (

         ). In individuals with high-risk features, we obtain targeted laboratory tests and/or observe the patient in the hospital. (See

          Headache
         </strong>
         – Headache and/or mental status changes may indicate vascular disease (stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, aneurysm, migraine headache) or meningitis. Hypoxemia due to pulmonary complications may also cause mental status changes. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Headache, mental status changes, or both'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Chest
         </strong>
         – Chest pain may indicate ACS, the frequency of which is increased in individuals with vaso-occlusive pain, as well as pulmonary fat embolism, pulmonary embolism (PE), cardiac ischemia, or rib infarct. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Chest pain'

         <strong>
          Abdomen
         </strong>
         – Abdominal pain may indicate splenic or hepatic sequestration, which are potentially life threatening. Other possible causes include gallstone disease, renal infarct, urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis, endometriosis, pancreatitis, and ectopic pregnancy or pelvic inflammatory disease. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Extremity
         </strong>
         – Pain in an extremity may be due to vaso-occlusion, but it also may be a sign of bone infarction, avascular necrosis of a joint, dactylitis in an infant or young child, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or, rarely, osteomyelitis. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Role of transfusions
         </strong>
         – Blood transfusion is not used to treat uncomplicated vaso-occlusive pain when bone marrow function is adequate. However, as noted in the sections above, blood transfusion is indicated for the treatment of several of the potentially serious complications that may present with pain. Early involvement of the specialist(s) with expertise in SCD and exchange transfusion is advised when one of these complications is suspected. Careful assessment of the patient's volume status plays an important role in determining whether to give intravenous fluids and which type of fluids to give. (See
         <a class="local">
