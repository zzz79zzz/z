         Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted virus infection that is found worldwide. Genital herpes can be caused by either herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) or type 1 (HSV-1); most recurrences are caused HSV-2 as HSV-1 does not recur often in the genital area [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The seroprevalence of HSV-2 infections in people living with HIV is high (50 to 90 percent) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ] and genital ulcer disease can be more frequent, severe, and of longer duration than in patients without HIV [

         An HSV outbreak is defined as "primary" if the patient was HSV-seronegative for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 at the onset of genital lesions.

         Nonprimary first-episode infection refers to the acquisition of genital HSV-2 infection in a patient with pre-existing antibodies to HSV-1 (eg, an individual with prior orolabial herpes). It is very rare to see acquisition of genital HSV-1 infection in a patient with pre-existing antibodies to HSV-2. Most people living with HIV with a new diagnosis of HSV infection have nonprimary disease due to prior acquisition of HSV-1 infection.

         Antiviral treatment of newly acquired HSV-2 infection lessens morbidity, but does not eradicate latent virus, which can subsequently reactivate. In addition, some patients who have longstanding HSV-2 infection that has been asymptomatic can present with a first-recognized episode of genital herpes, especially in the setting of immunosuppression.
        </p>
        <p>
         Compared with patients with HSV-2 infection and no HIV infection, people living with HIV have more frequent and severe recurrences, particularly those with advanced immunosuppression (eg, CD4 cell counts less than 100 cells/microL) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. HSV-2 reactivation episodes can range from painful ulcers to asymptomatic lesions, or viral shedding without any mucocutaneous erosions. (See

         are the preferred antivirals for HSV infections. Each of these agents has been demonstrated to decrease pain, lesion duration, and viral shedding with comparable efficacy and safety among HIV-seronegative patients with primary and recurrent HSV-2 infection. The efficacy of these medications has also been evaluated in a number of clinical trials involving persons living with HIV [

         These nucleoside analogs inhibit HSV DNA polymerase after being phosphorylated by virally-encoded thymidine kinase. This key phosphorylation step limits the activity of these agents to virally-infected cells, thus achieving a favorable side effect profile. (See

         The treatment of first-episode HSV infection in the person living with HIV is similar to the treatment in the immunocompetent host. However, clinicians should be aware that treatment of HSV-related disease in those with HIV should continue until all lesions have completely healed [

         It was initially thought that there may be additional benefits to suppressive therapy for HSV in people living with HIV, such as reductions in HIV and HSV transmission to serodiscordant partners, and improvements in HIV outcomes. However, available data do

         In patients without HIV, suppressive therapy for genital herpes reduces the risk of HSV transmission to an uninfected partner. However, this approach has not been found to be effective for people living with HIV who are not on antiretroviral therapy (ART) [

         This approach involves self-administered antiviral therapy for individual outbreaks as they arise. Patients are counseled to start therapy at the first sign of prodromal symptoms (eg, tingling, paresthesias, pruritus), which may occur prior to the onset of discrete lesions. Patients should be provided antiviral medication, as any delay in administration will attenuate the benefit of the intervention.

        <p>
         In patients without HIV, episodic therapy can be as short as one to five days. However, patients with HIV and HSV ulcerative disease should be treated for a minimum of five days or until lesion resolution, which can be significantly delayed among patients with advanced immunosuppression [

         There are few placebo-controlled trials in people with HIV and HSV infection since the efficacy of

          acyclovir

        <p>
         There are no clinical trials comparing strategies of episodic versus suppressive therapy in people living with HIV and the clinical endpoints in the trials have varied. Also, several of these trials have used higher doses of antiviral medications for HSV than were used in the clinical trials among those without HIV [

         The number of clinical events in each trial is also influenced by the level of immunosuppression among the study participants. Of note, most of the studies discussed below were performed prior to the era of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART).

         – Suppressive therapy for genital herpes decreases the number of recurrences by approximately 80 percent and is well tolerated, without a need for laboratory monitoring.

         The incidence of IRIS-associated GUD due to HSV-2 has varied greatly in several observational cohorts, ranging from 9 to 50 percent [

         In a retrospective cohort of 199 people living with HIV starting ART, 22 (50 percent) of 44 patients had IRIS related to anogenital HSV-2 infection, making it the most common manifestation of IRIS in this cohort [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Eleven (50 percent) of 22 patients with HSV-2 IRIS had a previous diagnosis of HSV-2; only two (9 percent) were receiving suppressive antiviral therapy at the time of ART initiation.

         In a cohort of 1551 people living with HIV in French Guiana, the risk of genital HSV-2 ulcers was 4.5-fold higher in the first two months after starting ART as compared with no ART, and remained elevated in the first six months after starting therapy [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. After six months of ART, the rate of genital ulcers was equivalent to persons who were not receiving ART, suggesting that the risk of IRIS-associated genital ulcers is only transiently elevated.

         HSV shedding appears to increase shortly after ART initiation, but decreases with time on prolonged ART. In one study that evaluated 45 persons with HIV and HSV-2 coinfection, HSV-2 shedding increased by 2.9-fold following ART initiation and subsequently decreased by 2 percent with each additional month on ART [
         <a href="#rid28">

         ].

        <p>
         Although HSV shedding decreases with time, administering HSV-2 suppressive therapy when ART is initiated can decrease the risk of HSV-2-associated IRIS in patients with low CD4 counts. As an example, one randomized, placebo-controlled trial examined the effects of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9335" href="/z/d/drug information/9335.html" rel="external">
          acyclovir

         400 mg twice daily on progression of HIV infection in people with HSV-2 and HIV coinfection and not on antiretroviral therapy [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. In this study, 132 patients initiated antiretroviral therapy when their CD4 count dropped to &lt;250 cells/microL or when they received a diagnosis of WHO stage IV disease. The prevalence of GUD increased in the first three months following ART initiation (Prevalence Risk Ratio [PRR] 1.94, 95% CI 1.04-3.62) and returned to baseline after six months of ART. The risk of GUD was 58 percent lower among those who received acyclovir as compared with those who received placebo (PRR 0.42, 95% CI 0.23-0.74). Among a subset of 96 women who had a monthly genital shedding assessment, the risk of shedding increased in the first three months after starting ART (odds ratio [OR] 2.58, 95% CI 1.48-4.49) and returned to baseline levels by month six. Shedding frequency was decreased among those who received acyclovir compared to placebo (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.04-0.41).

Some experts recommend evaluating the ongoing need for suppressive antiviral therapy on an annual basis, particularly when the CD4 count is &gt;200 cells/microL. However, some patients may desire continued suppressive therapy even after immune reconstitution due to concerns about HSV recurrence.

         The seroprevalence of herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 infections in people living with HIV is high and recurrent disease can be more frequent, severe, and of longer duration than in HIV-seronegative patient populations. (See

         Antiviral treatment of first-episode HSV-2 infection lessens morbidity, but does not eradicate latent virus, which can subsequently reactivate. Clinical HSV recurrences are a common problem among people living with HIV, particularly those with advanced immunosuppression (eg, CD4 cell counts less than 100 cells/microL). (See

         have well-established safety and efficacy for treatment of genital HSV infections in people living with HIV; these drugs are generally well tolerated at the currently recommended doses. Because efficacy appears to be similar among these antiviral agents, selection of any one (eg, acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir) should be driven mainly by cost, formulary considerations, and frequency of dosing for patient convenience.

         The principles of treatment of HSV-2 in people living with HIV are similar to those for persons without HIV. We recommend antiviral therapy for all patients with first-episode genital HSV infection (

         We recommend HSV antiviral therapy in people living with HIV who have clinical recurrences of HSV-2 infection (

          Grade 1B
         </a>
         ). Management options of recurrent disease include episodic therapy (eg, self-administered antiviral therapy for individual outbreaks as they arise) or suppressive therapy (daily administration of antiviral therapy for long-term maintenance). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Treatment strategies for recurrent disease'

         For patients with recurrent genital herpes, the choice of therapeutic strategy (ie, episodic versus suppressive therapy) should take into account efficacy of treatment, total pill burden (including antiretroviral medications), and history of disease severity. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Which strategy to select'

         Recommended doses of antiviral therapy are higher for both suppressive and episodic therapy for HSV recurrences in people living with HIV compared with patients without HIV; once-daily dosing has not been studied. In people living with HIV and HSV ulcerative disease, treatment should continue for a minimum of five days or until lesion resolution. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Dosing guidelines for antiviral therapy'

         The initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for people living with HIV with advanced immunosuppression can lead to a paradoxical worsening of underlying HSV infection. Among patients with a CD4 cell count &lt;250 cell/microL who have a history of genital ulcerative disease, we suggest coadministration of antiretroviral therapy for HIV and suppressive HSV antiviral therapy (
