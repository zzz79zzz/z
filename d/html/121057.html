         In the United States, ovarian cancer is the second most common gynecologic cancer, but it is the deadliest of the gynecologic cancers [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. A female's lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer is 1.3 percent [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. While the majority of diagnosed cases of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) are not associated with genetic mutations, an estimated 18 percent of cases are associated with germline mutations, most of which are attributable to breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (
         <em>
          BRCA1
         </em>
         ) or breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 (
         <em>
          BRCA2
         </em>
         ) mutations [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5
         </a>
         ]. High-grade serous is the most common histology associated with germline
         <em>
          BRCA1/2
         </em>
         mutations, but germline mutations have been identified in all epithelial histologies, except for mucinous, supporting genetic testing of all patients with EOC [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Patients with Lynch syndrome, characterized by a mutation in a DNA mismatch-repair gene (eg, mutL homolog 1 [
         <em>
          MLH1
         </em>
         ], mutS homolog 2 [
         <em>
          MSH2

         ], mutS homolog 6 [
         <em>
          MSH6

         <em>
          PMS2

          GERMLINE AND SOMATIC TESTING FOR GENETIC ALTERATIONS

         All patients with a diagnosis of ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer should have a genetic risk evaluation, irrespective of their family history, as the results may impact treatment decisions. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83397.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum", section on 'Testing for hereditary cancer syndromes'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         If germline testing is negative, we proceed with somatic
         <em>
          BRCA
         </em>
         testing to determine who may most benefit from a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Those with somatic BRCA mutations'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Multiple commercial and academic tumor genotyping assays exist for detection of somatic genetic alterations [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]. Guidelines favor testing patients for both germline and somatic mutations in order to optimize identification of germline mutations (which would open access to cascade testing of family members). Additionally, this strategy would expand identification of patients who may benefit from PARP inhibitors. Relying only on somatic testing to identify patients for "reflex" genetic testing historically may miss up to 5 percent of germline mutations due to differences in test coverage, variant classification, and the inability to detect large rearrangements by available commercial next-generation sequencing [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Relying only on germline testing will miss approximately 7 percent of patients who have somatic mutations only [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Improvement of testing sequencing and strategy remains an urgent area of investigation.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, genomic testing for DNA mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite-instable ovarian cancer should also be performed, given the option of immunotherapy as later-line treatment. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Mismatch repair deficiency/high microsatellite instability'
         </a>

         Approximately 13 to 15 percent of ovarian cancers are attributable to heritable mutations in
         <em>
          BRCA1
         </em>
         and
         <em>

         <em>
          BRCA
         </em>
         mutations have also been identified in ovarian cancer specimens.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network evaluated 316 stage II through IV high-grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer specimens and found that 3 percent of the cases showed somatic
         <em>
          BRCA1/2
         </em>
         mutations, compared with germline
         <em>
          BRCA1

         mutations in 9 percent and germline
         <em>

        </p>
        <p>
         In another study, 367 individuals with 390 ovarian carcinomas were analyzed; 88 germline mutations were identified among these cases [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11

         Briefly, for all patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), we treat with a platinum-plus-taxane combination, which may be administered either via intravenous/intraperitoneal (IV/IP) or the IV only route for optimally reduced disease; or via the IV only route, if suboptimally reduced. (See

        <p>
         For patients at higher risk of recurrence (eg, those with pleural effusions or ascites) we also incorporate

          bevacizumab

         , which is administered with a conventionally dosed IV chemotherapy regimen, followed by maintenance administration. The benefit of adding bevacizumab is not significantly modified by
         <em>

        </p>
        <p>
         Irrespective of whether IV/IP or IV treatment is administered, we suggest that these patients receive maintenance

         carriers with ovarian cancer may experience greater benefits with IP chemotherapy compared with noncarriers, and, in particular, with platinum agents (which cause DNA crosslinking, leading to cell death in

It is unclear, however, if the benefit for IV/IP treatment persists if poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are used as maintenance, given the absence of data addressing this question. Therefore, IV therapy without IP treatment is also acceptable.
