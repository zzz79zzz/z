         There is no anticoagulant that reduces thrombotic risk without simultaneously increasing the risk of bleeding. The decision to administer an anticoagulant is based on the assessment that the risk of thrombosis and its complications is a greater clinical concern than the risk of bleeding and its complications for the specific patient at a specific point in time.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic reviews the risks of bleeding with oral anticoagulants, comparison of bleeding rates, and strategies to reduce the risk of clinically serious bleeding.

        <p>
         The management of bleeding with specific anticoagulants is discussed in separate topic reviews:

         Technically, anticoagulants do not cause bleeding; bleeding is caused by a breach in the wall of a blood vessel. However, anticoagulants interfere with the normal hemostatic process that resolves microscopic bleeding events that would otherwise never become clinically apparent; as a result, anticoagulation may contribute to hematoma expansion and may convert clinically insignificant bleeding to clinically significant bleeding.
        </p>
        <p>
         Breaches of vascular integrity may be mechanical (eg, from trauma, tumor invasion, thrombosis, or hypertension) or due to altered endothelial cell barrier function (eg, with sepsis, ischemia, or certain chemotherapeutic drugs or biologic agents).

         </span>
         Subclinical bleeding (cerebral microbleeds and occult bleeding in other sites such as the gastrointestinal tract) may present as clinically significant bleeding when the individual is receiving an anticoagulant.
        </p>
        <p>
         Microbleeds are clinically silent minor bleeding events that are apparent on imaging studies; the term is generally restricted to bleeding in the brain and generally refers to bleeding in the setting of hypertensive vasculopathy and/or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1128.html" rel="external">
          "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy", section on 'Microbleeds'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Neuroimaging data suggest that microscopic pseudoaneurysm formation with subclinical leakage of blood is a potential mechanism for developing cerebral microbleeds. The regional distribution of these bleeds is consistent with the usual location of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in these conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to hypertension and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, cerebral microbleeds have been associated with other angiopathies, dementia, trauma, diabetes, cigarette smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (independent of smoking), and normal aging [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. They are often observed in individuals with ICH and ischemic stroke, as well as in healthy individuals without clinical evidence of stroke.
        </p>
        <p>
         We remain uncertain whether cerebral microbleeds should be used, in addition to other factors, to identify patients who may experience net harm from anticoagulant therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subclinical bleeding in other tissues or organs (eg, gastrointestinal) may be responsible for early bleeding seen with anticoagulant initiation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Anticoagulant initiation'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Screening for cerebral microbleeds or occult gastrointestinal bleeding is not routinely used in individuals on anticoagulation, as discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Risk factors for bleeding in specific sites'
         </a>

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Bleeding risk depends on a number of anticoagulant-related factors and individual patient characteristics  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120286" href="/z/d/graphic/120286.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Some of these are modifiable, such as the choice of anticoagulant, dosing, and use or avoidance of other medications that increase bleeding risk. Others are fixed, including patient age and ethnicity. Some underlying medical conditions and comorbidities can be modified and others cannot. Patients should be informed that anticoagulation may increase their baseline bleeding risk. Information should be provided about strategies they can use to minimize this risk and symptoms of bleeding for which they should seek medical attention. Given the high fatality rate related to these bleeding events, patients should be advised to promptly seek medical attention should they develop signs or symptoms of major bleeding.

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence for this lower risk comes from randomized trials in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) or venous thromboembolism (VTE). The absolute risks in patients with AF and VTE may differ because these conditions may be distributed across the population differently (eg, individuals with AF tend to be older and take more medications that may increase the risk of bleeding; those with VTE are generally younger and may have other factors, such as menstrual blood loss, that increase their risk of bleeding).

         However, individuals ≥75 years of age who are taking

         Comparisons of bleeding risks between the various available DOACs are limited by the lack of direct comparisons in randomized, controlled head-to-head studies. Indirect comparisons are limited by bias associated with the rationale for prescribing one DOAC over another in an individual patient. Thus, while we are confident there is a class effect favoring DOACs over

         preferable to treating bleeding after it has occurred. Even in warfarin-treated patients in clinical trials, the time to reversal is often hours and the morbidities associated with bleeding are great. Further, mortality was higher in warfarin-treated patients who bled than it was in DOAC-treated patients in the era when there were two effective reversal agents for warfarin (vitamin K and PCC) and no effective reversal agents for DOAC bleeding [

         Numerous studies, including those mentioned above, have demonstrated that the risk of bleeding is highest during the initial period (typically defined as the first three months) of anticoagulation, regardless of the indication for the anticoagulant. Examples of the absolute differences at different bleeding risks are shown in the table  (

         ). The mechanism is not completely understood. One hypothesis is that subclinical bleeding, if present, becomes apparent early during anticoagulation. A related concept is that individuals who have not bled during the first three months of anticoagulation are a select group of individuals who have an inherently lower risk of future bleeding [

         approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other comparable agency in other regions of the world. Systematic underdosing of DOACS, particularly in patients with atrial fibrillation, has emerged as a major concern; this practice is driven by the mistaken impression that lower drug doses are associated with lower risks of complications, including bleeding. This underdosing has been associated with an increase in death and avoidable thrombosis, including stroke, without a reduced risk of bleeding [

         Age and race (as well as other undefined genetic variables) may impact the risk of bleeding. However, the clinical significance is mainly in an awareness that some individuals may have a slightly greater risk. These factors are not used in bleeding risk scores and are not a reason to withhold anticoagulation. Age-related changes in anticoagulant dosing generally are not made, with the exception of dose reductions in individuals who are older than 75 or 80 years and are receiving a DOAC for AF, depending on the specific drug and other bleeding risk factors. These adjustments are discussed separately. (See

          Older age
         </strong>
         – Older age is generally cited as a risk factor for bleeding, even after adjustment for comorbidities associated with aging. The age cutoff is variously defined as &gt;60, &gt;65, &gt;75, or &gt;80 years; the risk increase is approximately linear. However, the risk of bleeding attributable to older age is often overestimated, and anticoagulants are underused in older individuals who may derive more benefit than younger individuals [

          14,15

         Prior bleeding may be a risk factor for future bleeding. However, the magnitude of risk is variable, and details of the prior bleed should be elicited. Most individuals with prior bleeding can re-initiate anticoagulation after recovery, especially if their baseline risk of thrombosis remains high and the reversible factors that contributed to bleeding are addressed. As discussed in a 2018 guideline from the American Society of Hematology (ASH), several studies have found that resuming anticoagulation following a major bleed (ICH or gastrointestinal [GI] bleeding) was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality, mostly due to reduced risk of recurrent VTE (relative risk [RR] 0.62, 95% CI 0.43-0.89) [

         </strong>
         – Sites of surgical bleeding are generally considered to be transient risk factors, and anticoagulation following surgery is often initiated within one to three days, as long as there were no unexpected surgical issues that would increase bleeding risk. Specific intervals for each anticoagulant are discussed in detail separately. (See

         The interval between bleeding and resumption of anticoagulation depends on the site of bleeding and the cause and is discussed in the linked topic reviews.

Close attention to anticoagulant dosing based on the glomerular filtration rate is important in individuals with kidney disease, as discussed separately. Compared to patients without kidney disease, patients with chronic kidney disease are more likely to experience major bleeding on anticoagulants, irrespective of which anticoagulant they receive.

          Cancer

         – Cancer and cancer therapy can increase bleeding risk by causing thrombocytopenia, increasing inflammatory cytokines, and disrupting vascular integrity at the primary tumor site or metastases. Tumor blood vessels are more likely to have structural and functional immaturity, which may also make them more inherently prone to bleeding [

         <a href="#rid23">
          23

         <a href="#rid24">
          24,25
         </a>
         ]. However, the concomitant increased risk of thrombosis related to cancer and cancer therapies may pose a more serious risk for some individuals than the increased risk of bleeding, as discussed separately. (See

         Intracranial bleeding, including intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic stroke, is usually the greatest concern because the risks of significant long-term deficits and mortality are high.

        <p>
         In a prospective series of 419 consecutive patients with atrial fibrillation who had an ICH while receiving a DOAC, multivariable analysis identified the following as risk factors: increasing age, use of an antiplatelet agent, white matter changes, hyperlipidemia, active cancer, high risk of falls, and low creatinine clearance [

          Prior stroke

         – Prior stroke is included in many risk models and clinical prediction scores for major bleeding; in most cases, these models (and the primary data from which they were derived) do not distinguish between prior ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke (see

          'Bleeding risk scores'

          Hypertension

Hypertensive vasculopathy typically causes ICH in deep brain locations (eg, putamen, internal capsule, caudate nucleus, thalamus, pons, or cerebellum).

          Cerebral amyloid angiopathy

         – Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), although usually asymptomatic, is an important cause of primary lobar ICH in older adults. CAA is characterized by the deposition of amyloid beta-peptide in the vascular wall of small- to medium-sized blood vessels in the brain and leptomeninges. This weakens the structure of the vessel walls and makes them prone to bleeding. (See

The available data are limited and insufficient to determine whether anticoagulant therapy increases the risk of bleeding from intracranial vascular malformations or unruptured intracranial aneurysms.

         Of these risk factors, hypertension is the most modifiable. The risk for falls may include several modifiable factors as well; strategies to reduce fall risk are presented in detail separately. However, clinicians generally overestimate the risk of bleeding with falls, resulting in unneeded withdrawal of anticoagulants [

         Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is another common site for major bleeding. In an analysis from the RIETE registry (Registry of Patients with Venous Thromboembolism) that examined risk factors for fatal bleeding in over 24,000 patients treated with an oral anticoagulant for acute VTE, there were 135 fatal bleeds during three months of therapy, and of these, gastrointestinal bleeding was the most likely bleeding site to result in fatality, representing 40 percent of fatal bleeds [

        <p>
         In some of the trials testing DOACs for prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer, the increased risk of GI bleeding was at least in part attributed to the presence of a GI tumor [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Numerous reviews have examined the risk of GI bleeding comparing DOACs with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">
          warfarin
         </a>
         . Although conclusions differ, a consensus has emerged that the overall rate of GI bleeding is not decreased in DOAC treated patients; however, whether one DOAC is superior to another cannot be determined with high certainty due to the lack of head-to-head comparative studies.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a large retrospective cohort study that assessed rates of hospitalization for GI bleeding, the adjusted incidence of hospital admission for GI bleeding was 115 per 10,000 patient-years (1.15 per 100 patient-years) [

         Several bleeding risk scores have been developed and validated, mostly in patients receiving
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">
          warfarin
         </a>
         for atrial fibrillation. However, these scores generally do not perform significantly better than clinician judgment based on close consideration of patient characteristics. As an example, in a prospective cohort of 515 patients, subjective estimates of bleeding risk made by the treating clinicians (mean clinical experience: three years) had similar accuracy in predicting bleeding as use of a risk score [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, a major benefit of these scoring systems is the identification of potentially modifiable factors that can be remedied as a means of reducing bleeding risk in anticoagulated patients  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120286" href="/z/d/graphic/120286.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). However, not every association implies causation. As an example, anemia is likely to be a marker of increased risk because anemia is caused by bleeding [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. Anemia has also been proposed to contribute to bleeding risk by reducing platelet interactions with the vessel wall.
        </p>
        <p>
         While most of the scores include prior stroke as an independent risk factor for major bleeding, they do not appear to distinguish between hemorrhagic versus ischemic stroke.

         These risk calculations are imprecise, do not include all possible risk factors, and cannot account for variations in the severity of comorbidities. They cannot predict bleeding risk in an individual patient; rather, they only predict bleeding in an exposed patient population. Studies have found higher predictive value when other variables such as cerebral microbleeds were also included [

         The initial indication for anticoagulation as well as any changes in thrombotic risk and bleeding risk should be reviewed periodically for each patient. In some cases, the risk-benefit calculation may shift, and changes may be warranted in the decision to use an anticoagulant, in the specific agent selected, and/or in the dose.
        </p>
        <p>
         Examples include discontinuation of the anticoagulant after three months of therapy for selected individuals with a first provoked deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or reduction from therapeutic-dose DOAC to prophylactic dose of DOAC after six months of therapy in selected individuals with DVT for whom continued anticoagulation is indicated. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1362.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of the treatment of proximal and distal lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT)"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         It is also important to pay attention to drug adherence. A switch from
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">
          warfarin
         </a>
         to a DOAC or the addition of low-dose
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9771" href="/z/d/drug information/9771.html" rel="external">
          vitamin K
         </a>
         may be appropriate in individuals taking warfarin who have significant INR variability despite good medication adherence. In contrast, however, switching to a DOAC is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         advised in individuals with poor INR control that is due to poor drug adherence, as one or two missed doses of a DOAC could reduce the efficacy of anticoagulation more than one or two missed doses of warfarin, and use of a DOAC eliminates the ability to monitor adherence effectively. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1334.html" rel="external">
          "Warfarin and other VKAs: Dosing and adverse effects", section on 'Poor INR control/vitamin K supplementation'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, patients should be treated with a dose of anticoagulant that has been proven effective for their indication and comorbidities rather than with the lowest possible dose.
        </p>
        <p>
         The selection of anticoagulant takes into account a number of factors related to the patient's underlying condition, values and preferences, and burdens of therapy, as discussed in separate topic reviews listed below. All other factors being equal, the risk of serious bleeding appears to be lower with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs; including the direct thrombin inhibitor

         Combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy is likely to increase bleeding risk (see

          'Concomitant antiplatelet medications'
         </a>
         above), and combined therapy should be restricted to settings in which the benefit is expected to outweigh the risk. (See

         Unnecessary antiplatelet therapy should be discontinued. This may require specific conversations with the patient about over-the-counter antiplatelet medication such as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">
          aspirin
         </a>
         or NSAIDs, which may not be listed on the medication list. A selective COX-2 inhibitor may be safer than other agents. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7992.html" rel="external">

          warfarin

         and were enrolled in one of six anticoagulation clinics that participated in a quality improvement consortium in the state of Michigan [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50
         </a>
         ]. Of these, over 3100 (45 percent) were receiving concomitant antiplatelet therapy, but the indication was unclear for over 1300 (nearly one-half of those on antiplatelet therapy, or 20 percent of the entire cohort). Of all the patients on concomitant antiplatelet therapy, over 2000 were not receiving a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The authors concluded that there was a large opportunity to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding by discontinuing the antiplatelet agent when it was not indicated, or using a PPI when the antiplatelet agent was needed. These interventions are discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Approaches to risk reduction'

         For individuals receiving anticoagulants, we generally advise patients to avoid routine use of NSAIDs for pain or fever when other agents such as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">
          acetaminophen

         are available. When an NSAID is indicated, we ask patients to limit the duration of use and/or to use a selective COX-2 inhibitor if appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other medications may increase the risk of anticoagulant-associated bleeding by potentiating the effects of the anticoagulant, and these medications should be avoided when possible [

         Although not well studied, gastric protection, typically with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), is given to many individuals treated with therapeutic-dose anticoagulation, especially those with additional risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding.

         A 2022 meta-analysis of six observational studies and one randomized trial that included patients receiving an oral anticoagulant found an association between PPI use (or histamine 2 receptor blocker use in one study) and reduced risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (relative risk [RR] 0.67, 95% CI 0.61-0.74) [

         Several published case reports have described individuals (some in their late 70s and 80s) being treated with anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation who subsequently developed gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, with various etiologies; in some cases, a reversal agent for the anticoagulant was used in the acute setting [

          Mechanism
         </strong>
         – Anticoagulants do not technically cause bleeding; they interfere with normal hemostasis that would otherwise prevent microbleeds from becoming clinically significant. Anticoagulation is used when the benefits of reducing thrombosis risk outweigh the increased risks of clinically significant bleeding. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pathogenesis of anticoagulant-associated bleeding'

          warfarin
         </a>
         , although the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding is likely similar between the DOACs and warfarin. The risk of anticoagulant-associated bleeding is greatest during the initial period of use and is often dose-dependent, but bleeding can occur at prophylactic and therapeutic doses. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Risk factors related to the anticoagulant'

         <strong>
          Comorbidities
         </strong>
         – Several patient factors contribute to bleeding risk, including the age of the patient; prior bleeding; comorbidities such as impaired kidney or liver function, diabetes, cancer, and obesity  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ). The risk of bleeding is also increased with severe thrombocytopenia (eg, platelet count &lt;50,000/microL) and with concomitant antiplatelet medications. However, none of these are absolute contraindications to anticoagulation, as discussed above. (See
         <a class="local">

          ICH
         </strong>
         – Intracranial bleeding is a feared complication of anticoagulation. Important risk factors include a history of stroke (especially intracerebral hemorrhage [ICH]), hypertension, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. ICH risk is reduced with DOAC treatment compared with

          Risk reduction
         </strong>
         – The risk of anticoagulant-associated bleeding can be minimized by periodically reviewing the indication for anticoagulation, risk-benefit ratio, dose, adherence, concomitant medications (nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], other antiplatelet agents, and other over-the-counter medications), and patient comorbidities.
