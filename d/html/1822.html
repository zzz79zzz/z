ANAs are detected in patients with a variety of systemic as well as organ-specific autoimmune conditions, as presented in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89802" href="/z/d/graphic/89802.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The threshold for a positive test was chosen to favor sensitivity for conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).</p><p>There are important limitations to consider when deciding to test a patient for ANAs. By design, the indirect immunofluorescent test for ANAs is positive, at a dilution of 1:160, in 5 percent of the normal adult population. The ANA test was intended to have this degree of sensitivity to assist in the diagnosis of patients with SLE. Because the prevalence of ANA-associated diseases in the general population is only approximately 1 percent, four out of five individuals will have false-positive results. Due to the sensitivity of the ANA test for the detection of autoantibodies, the test cannot be used to screen a healthy population for the presence of autoimmune diseases. Of note, the prevalence of ANAs in the healthy population increases with age, and ANAs are twice as likely to be detected in healthy women compared with men [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3273421569"><span class="h2">The importance of pretest probability</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ANA testing is most likely to be clinically useful in establishing a diagnosis when there is moderate to high pretest probability that a patient has a systemic autoimmune disease. For example, if there is clinical evidence of SLE (eg, photosensitivity, pleurisy), systemic sclerosis (SSc; Raynaud phenomenon, skin changes) or Sjögren's disease (SjD; unexplained dry eyes and dry mouth), the ANA results are likely to be helpful. By contrast, if the ANA test is ordered less discriminately, the majority of positive results will likely reflect false positives and may potentially distract the clinician from the correct diagnosis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4232937571"><span class="h2">When to test for ANAs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ANA testing is helpful when a patient’s symptoms, physical findings, and laboratory results suggest a moderate to high suspicion of one or more of the following diagnoses:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>SLE (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4668.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults", section on 'Laboratory testing'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Drug-induced lupus (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4677.html" rel="external">"Drug-induced lupus", section on 'Laboratory tests and characteristic autoantibodies'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7546.html" rel="external">"Mixed connective tissue disease", section on 'Laboratory testing'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>SSc (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7539.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) in adults", section on 'Laboratory testing'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>SjD (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5603.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis and classification of Sjögren’s disease", section on 'Serologic and other laboratory testing'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dermatomyositis (DM) and polymyositis (PM) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15653.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults", section on 'Laboratory testing and imaging'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Raynaud phenomenon (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7543.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Raynaud phenomenon", section on 'Laboratory testing for secondary Raynaud phenomenon'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Autoimmune hepatitis (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3665.html" rel="external">"Overview of autoimmune hepatitis", section on 'Autoantibodies'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3621.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of primary biliary cholangitis", section on 'Laboratory tests'</a>)</p><p></p><p>In 2002, a committee appointed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) issued guidelines about when to test for ANAs in considering the diagnosis and prognosis of specific conditions [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Although these guidelines are helpful when the clinician knows the patient’s diagnosis, the guidelines do not address the problem most frequently faced by clinicians: Patients who have vague musculoskeletal symptoms and an unknown diagnosis. For example, a patient might experience musculoskeletal pain and fatigue. These symptoms are common in both autoimmune diseases and many other disorders. Some clinicians use the ANA test, somewhat indiscriminately, to try to identify patients who have an underlying autoimmune disease. Whether this is an appropriate use of the ANA test is controversial, as it will lead to more false-positive ANA results. Guidelines developed by experts in some countries advise against ordering an ANA test at the initial evaluation of patients with vague symptoms (see  <a class="medical medical_society_guidelines" href="/z/d/html/118881.html" rel="external">"Society guideline links: Antinuclear antibodies"</a>). However, there have not been well-designed studies to inform these guidelines.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H119499275"><span class="h2">Rheumatologic causes of a positive ANA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many systemic autoimmune conditions are associated with a positive ANA, including SLE, drug-induced SLE, MCTD, SSc, SjD, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), DM, PM, juvenile DM (JDM), and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89802" href="/z/d/graphic/89802.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). ANAs are also frequently detected in patients with Raynaud phenomenon and people who have given birth to a child with neonatal lupus syndrome (NLS). In addition, a patient may have ANAs for years, if not decades, before developing the symptoms of an autoimmune disease [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Several studies have described the types of diagnoses that were ultimately made in adults with a positive test for ANA. The reported percent of patients with a positive ANA who are diagnosed with an ANA-related autoimmune disease varies from 9 to 51 percent, likely reflecting differences in the clinical reasons for ordering an ANA test and therefore the pretest probability [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>]. Across studies, the most commonly diagnosed ANA-related autoimmune disease was SLE, followed by drug-induced SLE, undefined or mixed connective tissue disease, and SSc [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3133426226"><span class="h2">Nonrheumatologic causes of a positive ANA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ANAs are detected in the serum of patients with other conditions, including organ-specific autoimmune diseases, infections, and malignancy. ANAs may also be detected in healthy people taking certain medications and in individuals who have a family history of autoimmunity  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89802" href="/z/d/graphic/89802.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Organ-specific autoimmune diseases</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Autoimmune thyroid disease</strong> – Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common organ-specific autoimmune disease associated with a positive test for ANA [<a href="#rid4">4,6</a>]. The rate of developing hypothyroidism in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis is approximately 5 percent per year (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7854.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis)"</a>). Hypothyroidism develops very gradually and patients and their caregivers may not recognize the subtle progression of symptoms; patients may therefore be quite symptomatic before the correct diagnosis is made. The presence of ANAs and antithyroperoxidase antibodies may identify patients at risk for hypothyroidism and thereby facilitate diagnosis. Graves' disease is also associated with positive ANAs [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Other</strong> – Other organ-specific autoimmune diseases with increased prevalence of ANAs include autoimmune hepatitis, PBC [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], inflammatory bowel disease [<a href="#rid9">9</a>], and interstitial lung disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3665.html" rel="external">"Overview of autoimmune hepatitis", section on 'Autoantibodies'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3621.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of primary biliary cholangitis", section on 'Laboratory tests'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Infection</strong> – ANAs have been detected in patients with various types of viral infections including Epstein-Barr virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus, and parvovirus B19 [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Malignancy</strong> – ANAs have been described in patients with malignancies including lymphoma [<a href="#rid11">11</a>] and hepatocellular carcinoma [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].

It is critical that clinicians understand the advantages and disadvantages of these ANA assays and be aware of the method that is used by their laboratory. Because of concerns about the lack of sensitivity of solid-phase assays [<a href="#rid21">21</a>], in 2009, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommended that the initial test to detect ANAs should be IIF with the HEp-2 cell substrate. This recommendation has been supported by the European Federation of Laboratory Medicine, the European Autoimmune Standardization Initiative, and the International Consensus on Antinuclear Antibody Patterns [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Despite these recommendations, some clinical laboratories use solid-phase assays as the initial test for ANAs for reasons that include the efficiency of automated testing and lower labor costs.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H784023"><span class="h3">Indirect immunofluorescence test for ANA (preferred)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The IIF test using the HEp-2 cell substrate is the most widely used assay for the detection of ANA and remains the reference method of choice for the detection of these antibodies [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>]. When positive, the IIF ANA test report will include both the endpoint titer and staining pattern or patterns.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Technique</strong> – IIF takes advantage of a HEp-2 cell line, which has cells with large nuclei (making staining patterns easier to see). In addition, HEp-2 cells contain nearly all of the clinically important autoantigens, making these cells ideal for the detection of the corresponding autoantibodies. The cells are grown on and subsequently fixed to glass slides, permeabilized with a solvent, and then overlaid with diluted patient serum. After an initial incubation, the slides are washed to remove nonadherent immunoglobulins and other serum proteins, and the cells are then incubated with a fluorescein-conjugated antibody directed against human immunoglobulin. The fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies bind to human antibodies, which have reacted with antigens present in the HEp-2 cell substrate. After washing to remove unbound fluoresceinated antibodies, slides are examined using an ultraviolet microscope. If fluorescence is detected at one or more screening dilutions (often 1:40 and 1:160), the serum is serially diluted and retested. An endpoint is reached when fewer than half of the cells on the slide show detectable fluorescence. The ANA titer is reported as the dilution prior to this endpoint, or the highest dilution at which fluorescence is detectable in at least than half of the HEp-2 cells.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Preparation of the HEp-2 cell substrate, including fixative and permeabilization techniques, can affect which autoantibodies might be detected by IIF.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Advantages</strong> – The major advantage of this method is that a large number of autoantibodies can be detected using the HEp-2 cells [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. IIF using the HEp-2 cell substrate is also more sensitive for the diagnosis of systemic autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Disadvantages</strong> – Disadvantages of the IIF technique include the labor-intensive nature of the assay and the requirement for well-trained technicians to read and interpret the results. Because the staining pattern usually does not identify the responsible autoantibody, additional testing using solid-phase assays is often required. In addition, some autoantigens may not be present in the HEp-2 cell substrate or may be difficult to detect due to variations in the techniques used to prepare the HEp-2 cell-containing slides. These limitations may lead to a false-negative ANA test. The Ro60 antigen, for example, may be lost from the HEp-2 cell substrate during the cell membrane permeabilization step and may not be detected in HEp-2 cell substrate if the cells are fixed with methanol (as opposed to acetone) [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. A patient with SLE or Sjögren's disease (SjD) may therefore be ANA negative by IIF if anti-Ro60 is the only autoantibody present in serum [<a href="#rid24">24</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1818.html" rel="external">"The anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antigen-antibody systems"</a>). Similarly, antibodies directed against ribosomal P antigens may be difficult to detect using the HEp-2 cell substrate [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1817.html" rel="external">"Antiribosomal P protein antibodies"</a>.).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4068891703"><span class="h3">Solid-phase assays</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several techniques have been introduced to make the process of detecting autoantibodies more efficient. These techniques, collectively referred to here as "solid-phase assays," include ELISA, fluorescent microsphere assays, and immunoline assays. Solid-phase assays provide semiquantitative results that may be reported as being within a “positive,” “indeterminate,” or “negative” range for each specific autoantibody.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Technique</strong> – In solid-phase assays, a panel of purified native or recombinant autoantigens is prepared and each antigen is immobilized on a solid surface (microtiter plate, fluorescent microsphere, or membrane). The panel of antigens used in solid-phase assays may include all or some of the following: Ro/SSA, La/SSB, Sm, U1 ribonucleoprotein (RNP), Scl-70, PM-Scl, Jo-1, centromere, histone, ribosomal P, and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Diluted human serum is incubated with the immobilized antigen and, as with the IIF assay, a secondary antibody is used to detect bound autoantibodies. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8461" href="/z/d/drug information/8461.html" rel="external">Fluorescein</a>, or an enzyme that can catalyze a colorimetric assay, is conjugated to the secondary antibody. Quantification of the amount of autoantibody in the patient’s serum can be achieved by measuring the amount of fluorescence (fluorescent microsphere assay) or the extent of colorimetric change (as in the ELISA and immunoline assays).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Advantages</strong> – The major advantages of solid-phase assays are their suitability for high-throughput testing and the semiquantification of test results. The efficiency that automation offers is especially important for laboratories that conduct high-volume ANA testing. Solid-phase assays may significantly decrease the labor cost of ANA testing [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. An additional advantage of solid-phase assays is that a positive test also provides identification of the responsible autoantibody.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Disadvantages</strong> – A serious concern about using the solid-phase assay as the initial assay for ANA is its potential lack of sensitivity compared with IIF using the HEp-2 cell substrate. The number of autoantigens that are included in solid-phase assays is limited compared with the number that are present in the HEp-2 cell substrate. As an example, most solid-phase assays do not contain antigens found in the nucleolus; patients with autoantibodies directed against these structures will have a falsely negative solid-phase ANA result. In addition, some studies suggest that solid-phase assays are less sensitive than IIF for the diagnosis of systemic autoimmune diseases, including SLE [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H29384595"><span class="h1">INTERPRETING A POSITIVE TEST FOR ANA USING INDIRECT IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) testing for antinuclear antibody (ANA) will report a titer, representing the highest dilution at which fluorescence is observed in at least than half of the human epidermoid carcinoma (HEp-2) cells.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1442729996"><span class="h2">Definition of a positive result</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is considerable controversy concerning the ideal dilution considered to indicate a "positive" ANA test. The optimal serum dilution to be used to screen for ANA by IIF should be defined by each laboratory and should be chosen so as to detect autoantibodies in approximately 5 percent of a normal population.</p><p>It is helpful to understand how the threshold for a positive test was developed. In a large multicenter study of healthy volunteers 20 to 60 years of age, ANA were detected in 32 and 5 percent of the sera at dilutions of 1:40 and 1:160, respectively [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. In this same study, the prevalence of ANA in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), and Sjögren's disease (SjD) was determined. ANA were detected at a dilution of 1:40 in 97, 100, and 84 percent of patients with SLE, SSc, and SjD, respectively. At the 1:160 dilution, the sensitivity of the ANA test decreased to 95, 87, and 74 percent, respectively. Based on these results, the authors suggested that positive ANA results at the 1:40 dilution should be reported so as to permit detection of as many patients with ANA-associated autoimmune diseases as possible. Unfortunately, this suggestion has caused confusion among clinicians, because a high prevalence of low-titer ANAs in healthy individuals is an inherent feature of the assay. If one estimates that the prevalence of ANA-associated diseases in the general population is 1 percent, it is evident that most individuals with ANA detected at a dilution of 1:40 (approximately 30 percent of the normal population) have a false-positive result.</p><p>Because the IIF test for ANA has the potential to result in a large number of false-positive results, an international group of experts recommended that the initial screening dilution should be defined by each individual laboratory, based on testing serum from an adequate number of normal individuals [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. A dilution that produces a positive result in 5 percent of normal controls should be considered the optimal screening dilution. We therefore consider an ANA titer of greater than or equal to 1:160 as positive. However, this recommendation has not yet been universally accepted. It is therefore important to know the dilution thresholds used at a specific laboratory to most accurately interpret results.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2332867411"><span class="h2">Significance of titer</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As noted above, the threshold at which an ANA is considered positive may differ by laboratory. A high titer is more suggestive of an underlying autoimmune disease such as SLE [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. However, a high-titer ANA in isolation is not diagnostic of any particular autoimmune disease. Some ANA may be present in very high titer and yet not indicate that an autoimmune disease is present. As an example, if anti-DF70 antibodies are the only cause of the positive ANA, the presence of these antibodies suggests the absence of a systemic autoimmune disease (see below).</p><p>After ANA have been detected in a patient with autoimmune disease, the test does not need to be repeated because there is no evidence that changes in ANA titer serve as a marker of disease activity.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7908990"><span class="h2">Significance of staining patterns</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The results of IIF testing for ANA includes the staining pattern (or patterns) produced by the patient's serum, in addition to the antibody titer  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89803" href="/z/d/graphic/89803.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). Although the term anti-"nuclear" antibody would imply that only nuclear staining patterns are important, the international consensus is that all staining patterns observed in HEp-2 cells, including nuclear, cytoplasmic, and cell-cycle related patterns, should be reported [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. ANA staining patterns are somewhat helpful in identifying the autoantibodies that are present in a patient’s serum and are loosely associated with the underlying autoimmune disease. As an example, the most common ANA pattern in patients with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is nuclear speckled, which is produced by antibodies directed against U1 ribonucleoprotein (RNP). However, many different ANA patterns, including homogeneous, speckled, or nucleolar, may be detected in patients with SLE. Because ANA patterns are not specific for autoantibodies or individual autoimmune disorders, a positive test for ANA by IIF often leads to additional testing using solid-phase assays (see <a class="local">'Solid-phase assays'</a> above) to detect specific, disease-associated autoantibodies.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1496302220"><span class="h3">Nomenclature</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An International Consensus on Antinuclear Antibody Patterns (ICAP) workshop was held in São Paolo, Brazil in 2014.

One study at a tertiary pediatric center found that of the 113 patients referred for a positive ANA (defined as a titer of 1:40 or higher), 72 had an autoimmune disease at the time of referral (including JIA in 44, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE] in 16, dermatomyositis [DM] in 3, undifferentiated connective tissue disease in 2, uveitis in 2, and other in 5) [<a href="#rid82">82</a>].

(See  <a class="medical medical_society_guidelines" href="/z/d/html/118881.html" rel="external">"Society guideline links: Antinuclear antibodies"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H784220"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical utility and limitations of ANA testing</strong> – Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is an important tool in diagnosis of certain autoimmune diseases. The threshold for a positive test was chosen to favor sensitivity for conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). (See <a class="local">'Clinical utility and limitations of ANA testing'</a> above and <a class="local">'Background'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>The importance of pretest probability</strong> – The higher the prior probability that a patient has a systemic autoimmune disease, the more likely the results of an ANA test will assist in establishing the diagnosis. As an example, if there is clinical evidence of SLE (eg, photosensitivity, pleurisy), the ANA results are likely to be helpful. By contrast, if the ANA test is ordered indiscriminately, the majority of positive results will be falsely positive and may potentially distract the clinician from the correct diagnosis. (See <a class="local">'The importance of pretest probability'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>When to test for ANA</strong> – ANA testing is helpful when a patient’s symptoms, physical findings, and laboratory results suggest a moderate to high suspicion of an ANA-related autoimmune disease, including SLE, systemic sclerosis (SSc), and Sjögren's disease (SjD)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89802" href="/z/d/graphic/89802.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'When to test for ANAs'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Causes of a positive ANA</strong> – ANAs are detected in patients with a variety of systemic as well as organ-specific autoimmune conditions, infections, and malignancy, as presented in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89802" href="/z/d/graphic/89802.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). ANA may also be detected in healthy people taking certain medications and in individuals who have a family history of autoimmunity. (See <a class="local">'Rheumatologic causes of a positive ANA'</a> above and <a class="local">'Nonrheumatologic causes of a positive ANA'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Techniques to detect ANA</strong> – Methods for testing ANA have different technical limitations that decrease their sensitivity for the detection of some specific antibodies. It is critical that clinicians understand the advantages and disadvantages of these ANA assays and be aware of the method that is used by their laboratory. (See <a class="local">'Techniques to detect ANA and nomenclature'</a> above and <a class="local">'Methodologies'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Interpreting a positive test for ANA using indirect immunofluorescence</strong> – When positive, the indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) ANA test report will include both the endpoint titer and staining pattern or patterns. (See <a class="local">'Interpreting a positive test for ANA using indirect immunofluorescence'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Significance of ANA titer</strong> – There is considerable controversy concerning the ideal dilution considered to indicate a "positive" ANA test. The optimal serum dilution to be used to screen for ANA by IIF should be defined by each laboratory and should be chosen so as to detect autoantibodies in approximately 5 percent of a normal population. (See <a class="local">'Definition of a positive result'</a> above and <a class="local">'Significance of titer'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Significance of ANA staining patterns</strong> – ANA staining patterns are loosely associated with underlying autoimmune diseases; however, additional testing is often required to identify specific, disease-associated autoantibodies. (See <a class="local">'Significance of staining patterns'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Interpreting a positive test for ANA using solid-phase assays</strong> – Solid-phase assays provide semiquantitative results that may be described as being within a “positive,” “indeterminate,” or “negative” range for each specific autoantibody. (See <a class="local">'Interpreting a positive ANA with solid-phase assays'</a> above.) A positive test for ANA by solid-phase assay identifies the target of autoantibodies.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Follow-up evaluation</strong> – The need for follow-up testing in patients with positive or negative ANA test will depend on the degree of clinical suspicion of an ANA-related autoimmune disease as well as the type of ANA test used. (See <a class="local">'Follow-up evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>When to refer to a subspecialist</strong> – Patients with a positive ANA should be referred to a rheumatologist when there is concern for systemic autoimmune disease and when assistance is needed for further patient evaluation. In the absence of other evidence of an ANA-related rheumatologic condition, there is no specific ANA titer that requires rheumatologic consultation. (See <a class="local">'When to refer to a subspecialist'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Repeating ANA testing</strong> – In patients with a negative ANA test, repeated testing for ANA usually is not indicated unless there are new signs or symptoms of a rheumatic disease. In patients with a positive ANA test and ANA-related autoimmune disease, changes in ANA titer are not helpful as a way to monitor disease activity. (See <a class="local">'Repeating ANA testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Counseling patients with a positive ANA and low suspicion of autoimmune disease</strong> – If a patient with low suspicion for autoimmune disease has a positive ANA test, then the full differential diagnosis of a positive ANA test should be considered  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89802" href="/z/d/graphic/89802.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), including the high prevalence of false-positive results in the healthy adult population. (See <a class="local">'Counseling patients with positive ANA and low suspicion of autoimmune disease'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2043763"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges Morris Reichlin, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Satoh M, Chan EK, Ho LA, et al.
