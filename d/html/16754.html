         Addiction is a chronic or relapsing condition for many patients. Yet the traditional treatment model for addiction has emphasized episodic intensive treatment for medically supervised substance withdrawal and/or stabilization, followed by time-limited outpatient care. In recent years, public and private health care systems and clinicians are coming to recognize that chronic or relapsing addiction, like chronic physical conditions such as diabetes or hypertension, typically requires continuing, long-term care.
        </p>
        <p>
         Continuing care for addiction includes routine assessment and treatment customized to the needs and preferences of the individual patient [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The patient’s clinical status and risk of relapse are monitored systematically and longitudinally. The intensiveness of treatment is adjusted as the addiction waxes and wanes over time. Patients receive training in self-management skills and linkage to other sources of professional and community support.
        </p>
        <p>
         Continuing care for chronic or relapsing addiction along with its clinical and theoretical context, components, and efficacy are reviewed here. The treatment of specific substance use disorders (SUDs) and determining the appropriate level of care for patients with SUDs are reviewed separately.

         Treatment of addiction has traditionally been short-term and focused on acute episodes of care. After initial medically-supervised substance withdrawal and/or stabilization at a higher level of care (eg, inpatient or residential), patients would typically receive a time-limited course of outpatient treatment. A national survey of outpatient substance use disorder (SUD) treatment programs found that the planned duration of outpatient care was most often 90 days, while the actual duration was less than 30 days [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Treatment has largely taken place in specialty addiction programs that employ a single modality of treatment, often without access to medication.
        </p>
        <p>
         For many patients, however, addiction is a chronic or relapsing condition that lasts many years subsequent to diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Studies have found that 40 to 60 percent of patients treated for alcohol or other drug dependence return to regular use within a year following treatment [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The conceptualization of addiction as a chronic disease is supported by comparison of its manifestations, course, etiologic factors (genetic and environmental), pathophysiology, and response to treatment with other chronic medical illnesses (eg, type 2 diabetes mellitus, asthma, and hypertension) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Addiction causes predictable and persistent structural and functional changes in the brain. Volume loss of numerous types of brain tissue and structures has been found in individuals with SUDs, including alcohol use disorder [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ], cocaine use disorder [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ], opiate use disorder [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ], and polysubstance use disorder [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Numerous neurotransmitter systems involved in reward and stress pathways in the brain are affected by chronic use of alcohol and other drugs, including dopamine and endorphins [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Early onset addiction can severely disrupt the development of effective life skills in many areas of functioning, leading to chronic deficits. Even patients who achieve abstinence may have difficulty developing the kinds of meaningful and satisfying lives that can provide a buffer against relapse.

         Individuals with chronic addiction vary in their clinical status and needs. Some patients are at high risk for relapse and need long-term, highly-structured continuing care. Patients who have been abstinent for long periods may only need brief, periodic check-ins to monitor for changes in substance use or risks of relapse. Patients at intermediate risk of relapse may need more active treatment and more frequent monitoring of progress.

         Continuing care emphasizes that SUD care needs to be adjusted up or down in intensity and frequency over time as patients go through alternating periods of abstinence and use at varying levels of SUD severity [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,18
         </a>
         ]. Brief, infrequent clinical contact may be sufficient during extended periods when a patient is doing well. However, when the patient’s risk of relapse rises or an episode of substance use begins, treatment needs to be ratcheted up to a higher level of care (eg, more frequent sessions, additional modalities, and/or in a more intensive setting) that is adequate to interrupt and address the processes putting the patient at risk [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The failure to achieve other early treatment goals, such as committing to abstinence, attending mutual help or other meetings, developing better coping behaviors and increased confidence in their efficacy, and identifying reliable sources of social support, may also indicate a need for more intensive continuing care [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Addiction counseling, for example, is titrated to the patient’s clinical status and risk of relapse. Counseling is provided in increasingly diverse formats that vary in intensiveness, for example, face-to-face or by telephone, individual or group sessions. The duration of a counseling session is typically between 30 to 60 minutes for individual sessions and 60 to 90 minutes for groups, while the duration of a brief check-in is typically 15 to 30 minutes.

         Effective management of chronic addiction requires that patients are able to make good use of nonclinical supports, both within themselves and in the community. The ability to learn and to practice good “self-care” is an important part of the management of chronic disorders of all types [

         ]. One of the key goals is to equip patients to engage in healthy behaviors, such as a nutritious diet and exercise, and other basic tasks of good self-care. Although some of these tasks vary from disorder to disorder, they generally include:

         All patients who complete the acute phase of treatment should have a relapse prevention plan that documents potential triggers of relapse and early warning signs, along with strategies to respond. The plan should name sponsors, family members, or friends who have agreed to help, in addition to clinicians and their contact information.
        </p>
        <p>
         A variety of active outreach efforts have been included in continuing care interventions to maintain contact with patients over extended periods of time. These contacts can provide opportunities for the continuation of treatment after patients have relapsed, even if they have lost motivation for recovery. Outreach techniques include telephone calls, home visits, care managers, home visits, couples counseling, and assertive linkage to services.

         Clinicians should regularly assess patients’ clinical status during the course of continuing care, ideally using a standardized quantitative instrument that reliably detects improvement or deterioration over time. Routine use of quantitative assessment can facilitate continuing care of addiction in multiple ways:

         To enable clinicians (or care managers) to monitor caseloads of patients receiving low burden, infrequent treatment during periods of clinical stability, and to identify patients at an early stage of deterioration. In our clinical experience, patients are often resistant to more intensive interventions once they are well into a state of relapse. Catching deterioration before it becomes too severe may allow for discussion about a less intensive intervention with a more receptive patient.

         <a href="#rid27">
          27

         ]. Participants in the trials typically had heavy alcohol or drug use or a diagnosis of SUD. The interventions, which may not have been explicitly labeled continuing care, were based on continuing care principles. Multimodal interventions included a variety of active outreach techniques to enhance motivation for treatment and increase engagement and continuation of care over an extended period. Among the activities studied were telephone calls, home visits, care managers couples counseling, and assertive linkage to services. (See

         Randomized trials of extended continuing care for patients with substance dependence have found mixed results [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33-36
         </a>
         ]. As an example:

         In a trial, 252 adults with alcohol use disorder (49 percent with concurrent cocaine use disorder) who were completing a public intensive outpatient program (IOP) were randomly assigned to receive continuing care with counseling (largely telephone-based), continuing care with briefer telephone calls providing monitoring and feedback but not counseling, or treatment as usual alone, without continuing care [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         At 18-month follow-up, patients assigned to receive continuing care with counseling in addition to treatment as usual reported reduced alcohol use (odds ratio 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.1) and heavy alcohol use (odds ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.03-2.94) compared with the group receiving treatment as usual alone. During months 12 to 18 of the follow-up period, rates of any alcohol use in each three-month segment were lower in the counseling and the monitoring/feedback groups compared with the control group (approximately 30 versus 50 percent). No clinically significant effects were seen in cocaine use. Treatment effects from the 18-month intervention were no longer present at 24 months [
         <a href="#rid20">

         The positive findings from this study [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ] were replicated in a second study examining extended telephone continuing care in 262 patient with alcohol use disorder attending IOP [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. As in the prior study, significant reductions in alcohol use were observed while the treatment was provided, but not during a six-month posttreatment period.
        </p>
        <p>
         Extended telephone continuing care may help promote reduced rates of criminal activity in individuals with cocaine use disorders. A follow-up analysis that combined data from three telephone-based continuing care studies found that patients with cocaine use disorder who were randomized to the intervention had 54 percent lower odds of a criminal sentence over a four-year follow-up than those in standard care, controlling for criminal sentence in the year prior to enrollment in the study, gender, age, and study enrolled in [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The evidence for telephone continuing care provided for shorter durations is mixed. A study randomized 406 patients with co-occurring substance use and mental health disorders to receive usual postdischarge care or usual care plus three months of weekly telephone monitoring sessions [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. Results indicated there were no differences between the treatment conditions on days of alcohol use, drug use, or psychological problems over a 15-month follow-up. However, a secondary analysis of this study found that telephone continuing care did produce lower alcohol use severity than standard care in participants with an incarceration history and in those with less severe depression symptoms [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Another study compared two interventions with 10 and 3 telephone contacts, respectively, to a one-contact control condition provided to 240 patients with alcohol use disorder following residential treatment. The results found that the 10-contact telephone intervention produced higher rates of alcohol abstinence at a six-month follow-up, compared with the control condition. Conversely, the 3-contact intervention was not effective relative to the control [

ACHESS has been evaluated as a continuing care intervention for alcohol use disorder in two randomized controlled trials, one in 349 graduates of residential treatment programs [
         <a href="#rid41">

          34
         </a>
         ]. In both studies, A-CHESS reduced heavy drinking over 12 months compared with standard care. Finally, the A-CHESS app was also used in a third study which tested the efficacy of linking multiple daily assessments done by A-CHESS to specific recovery services on the app in 401 participants. Results indicated that the assessments led to increased abstinence via use of the recovery services on the app [

          Need for continuing care
         </strong>
         – Moderate-to-severe substance use disorders (SUDs) are typically chronic or relapsing conditions; however, treatment of addiction has traditionally been short-term and focused on acute episodes of care. Chronic or relapsing addiction, like chronic physical conditions such as diabetes or hypertension, typically requires continuing, long-term care. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Chronicity of addiction'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Patients with a mild SUD are not typically candidates for continuing care, but they should receive follow-up assessment during the year following treatment. Continuing care may be indicated for those who relapse and experience a worsening of symptoms. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Efficacy'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Continuing care emphasizes ongoing monitoring after an initial period of treatment with the intensiveness of treatment adjusted to the patient’s clinical status and risk of relapse as the patient’s addiction waxes and wanes over time. (See
         <a class="local">

          Components

         – Patients treated in a continuing care model are provided training in self-management skills, linkage to other sources of support, and measuring/monitoring of their clinical status over time. (See

         <strong>
          Customization
         </strong>
         – Continuing care for patients with addiction should be customized to the individual patient’s needs and preferences. Treatment needs are determined through assessment of the patient’s clinical status, risk factors for relapse, and clinical indications for more intensive treatment. (See
         <a class="local">
