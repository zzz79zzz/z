Early pregnancy loss (EPL), which occurs in the first trimester, is the most common type. Individuals experiencing pregnancy loss are evaluated for conditions that require emergency treatment and then counseled regarding the different management options, which include expectant, medication, and surgical management.</p><p>This topic will review the treatment options available to patients with pregnancy loss up to 20 weeks of gestation. Related content on risk factors and etiology, clinical presentation, the role of ultrasound in diagnosis of pregnancy loss, management techniques, and stillbirth is presented separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5439.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy loss (miscarriage): Terminology, risk factors, and etiology"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5442.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy loss (miscarriage): Clinical presentations, diagnosis, and initial evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/130879.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy loss (miscarriage): Ultrasound diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128965.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy loss (miscarriage): Description of management techniques"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6740.html" rel="external">"Stillbirth: Maternal care"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In this topic, we will use the term "patient" to describe genetic females. We recognize that not all people capable of pregnancy identify as a woman or female and we encourage the reader to consider the specific counseling needs of transgender and gender-expansive individuals.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3900221365"><span class="h1">USE A PATIENT-CENTERED APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is critical for clinicians to avoid inserting their personal biases when counseling patients regarding management of pregnancy loss. It is common for clinicians to have a strong opinion about the "best" option in any given clinical scenario. However, the best evidence indicates that all management options (expectant, medication, or surgical) are reasonable in a majority of cases, and patients are most satisfied when they are able to choose (ie, shared decision-making) [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Data suggest patients presenting to an emergency department for pregnancy loss care may not be offered all clinically appropriate options [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2295794753"><span class="h2">Elicit patient preferences</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are several questions clinicians can ask to elicit a patient's preferences in this setting:</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Have you had a previous pregnancy loss? If yes:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Did it pass naturally (ie, spontaneously) or did you receive treatment?</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Did anything unexpected happen?</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Do you feel that you made the right decision?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>What worries you the most about this process? For instance, some individuals are concerned about having unpredictable bleeding that may occur with expectant management, while others are fearful of an invasive surgical procedure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Do you feel most comfortable having the pregnancy pass on its own, or do you prefer the idea of removing the pregnancy as soon as possible? Patients are also educated that the amount of time to achieve a completed miscarriage with expectant management varies based on the type of miscarriage. (See <a class="local">'Expectant management'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>How comfortable are you with minor procedures? What are your concerns about pain? For some patients, the pain control options available for a surgical procedure will factor into their decision.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2764182884"><span class="h2">Enable patient to choose treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Enabling patients to choose their treatment approach whenever medically safe is an important component of care. Studies consistently demonstrate that individuals often want to participate in treatment planning. It is not meaningful to talk about what proportion of individuals prefer a specific treatment option; rather, it is important to recognize that preferences vary, and patients report they want to participate in treatment decisions [<a href="#rid4">4-8</a>]. Patients who have had a prior pregnancy often use that experience to inform their treatment choice. Primigravid patients with a loss may seek more advice and input from their provider and trusted support persons [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. A study of quality-of-life scores reported that individuals who were managed according to their own preferences had better outcomes [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3518863510"><span class="h1">PRESENT TREATMENT OPTIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are three management options for pregnancy loss: expectant, medication, and surgical management. Expectant management is when patients prefer to "wait and see" without any intervention; medication management is when medications, not a procedure, are primarily used; surgical management refers to any management that is primarily procedure based. All three management options are available for pregnancy loss up to 20 weeks of gestation. The patient weighs the efficacy, degree of intervention, advantages, risks, and complications of each option to make a treatment plan.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H488826888"><span class="h2">Expectant management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Expectant management implies the patient waits for the pregnancy tissue to pass on its own. Patients may initially elect expectant management and then pursue surgical or medication management if the pregnancy has not passed in a reasonable time or if bleeding, infection, or other complications develop.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Factors for consideration</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Patient preferences</strong> – Individuals may select expectant management because they prefer a less invasive or "more natural" approach, desire more time to consider treatment options, or want to avoid surgical procedures.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Gestational age</strong> – In regions where active management is accessible, expectant management is generally discouraged after approximately 13 weeks of gestation because of increased risk of complications. If access to active management is limited, then expectant management is offered.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Unpredictable onset, duration, and degree of heavy uterine bleeding and cramping</strong> – Patients who desire expectant management are counseled that they may experience heavy vaginal bleeding and/or uterine cramping [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. There are no predictive factors that guide the patient as to when symptoms may begin. Instructions for when to contact the clinician should be provided. Patients should also understand that, although a less-invasive approach may be desired, surgical uterine aspiration may still be required for retained products of conception, infection, and/or bleeding or evidence of hemodynamic instability.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Efficacy and variable amount of time needed to complete miscarriage</strong> – While approximately 70 to 80 percent of all patients with first-trimester pregnancy loss will have an empty uterus by 14 days of expectant management, the percentage of miscarriages completed spontaneously by 14 days is lower for individuals with prolonged loss without expulsion (eg, several weeks' discrepancy between ultrasonographic and menstrual period dating) and nonviable pregnancies with an empty gestational sac than it is for those with incomplete miscarriage. The amount of time for completed miscarriage does not vary based on how the pregnancy was conceived (eg, spontaneous, assisted reproductive technology). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">A study that followed 1096 individuals with first-trimester pregnancy loss reported the following completion rates for expectant management by type of pregnancy loss [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Incomplete miscarriage</strong> – Seven-day completion of 53 percent (117 of 221); 14-day completion of 84 percent (185 of 221).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Prolonged loss without expulsion</strong> – Seven-day completion of 30 percent (41 of 138); 14-day completion of 59 percent (81 of 138).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Nonviable pregnancy with empty gestational sac</strong> – Seven-day completion of 25 percent (23 of 92); 14-day completion of 52 percent (48 of 92).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Up to 12+6 weeks of gestation</strong> – Expectant management is approximately 70 to 80 percent effective in the first trimester table [<a href="#rid10">10-12</a>]. Patients may continue expectant management in the first trimester as long as they remain hemodynamically stable and without signs or symptoms of infection. The authors advise considering medication or surgical management if the pregnancy has not passed after approximately four weeks of expectant management in the first trimester; this is a general approach and is tailored to the desires and medical needs of each patient.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">We also discuss that the longer the patient waits for spontaneous passage of the pregnancy, the risk of complications or difficulty increases, including infection, heavy bleeding and/or hemorrhage, and incomplete passage of tissue. Any of these may prompt the need for medication or surgical management despite the patient's initial desire for minimal intervention. Additionally, the patient may only experience partial passage of tissue. In a trial comparing the three treatment options for patients with first-trimester pregnancy loss, approximately one-third of patients had evidence of retained products of conception on follow-up ultrasound performed 10 to 14 days after tissue passage [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. In this study, rates of infection were similar among patients managed expectantly (3 percent) versus medically or surgically (2 and 3 percent, respectively). However, unplanned hospital admissions and unplanned surgical procedures were higher in the expectant management group. Surgical procedures performed in emergency circumstances are generally considered to be of greater risk compared with planned procedures.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>13 to 19+6 weeks of gestation</strong> – Expectant management is more commonly used at later gestational ages in low- and middle-income countries; the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises against second-trimester expectant management because of lack of safety data [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. There are few data on efficacy of expectant management in the second trimester. One older source indicated approximately 85 percent of individuals with an intrauterine fetal demise over 24 weeks of gestation would spontaneously labor within three weeks of diagnosis, but this is a different population from those with second-trimester loss [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In the second trimester, increasing time between diagnosis of pregnancy loss and management leads more rapidly to increased risks, including life-threatening ones such as disseminated intravascular coagulation. As a result of the increasing risk profile with expectant management in the second trimester, the authors advise immediate intervention (medication or surgical) in the second trimester. In some cases, with appropriate counseling and thorough understanding of the risks and benefits, patients may choose to wait two to four weeks before undergoing medication or surgical management. Oral analgesia should be offered to those choosing expectant management, and they should be counseled to come to a health facility/hospital if they experience severe cramping or heavy vaginal bleeding. The risks of expectant management are otherwise similar to those of medication management. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128965.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy loss (miscarriage): Description of management techniques", section on 'Complications of medication management'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>≥20 weeks of gestation (stillbirth)</strong> – While the nomenclature and definitions of stillbirth, or late fetal death, vary, stillbirth commonly describes delivery of a fetus of ≥20 weeks of gestation with no signs of life. The issues around stillbirth and its management are presented separately.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6827.html" rel="external">"Stillbirth: Incidence, risk factors, etiology, and prevention"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6740.html" rel="external">"Stillbirth: Maternal care"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5402.html" rel="external">"Stillbirth: Maternal and fetal evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1394311018"><span class="h2">Medication management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Medication management typically involves the patient taking two different medications (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10263" href="/z/d/drug information/10263.html" rel="external">mifepristone</a> followed by <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9657" href="/z/d/drug information/9657.html" rel="external">misoprostol</a>) over 24 to 48 hours to induce passage of the uterine contents [<a href="#rid9">9,14,15</a>]. In settings where mifepristone is not available, misoprostol-only protocols can also be used, but the efficacy is somewhat lower than that of the combined regimen. However, combination therapy is often not offered to US patients, despite improved efficacy compared with misoprostol-only, likely because of drug prescribing restrictions [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128965.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy loss (miscarriage): Description of management techniques", section on 'Medication management'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Factors for consideration</strong> – Medication management approach offers patients more control over the timing of tissue passage, is highly effective, and generally does not require surgical intervention [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. In addition, the patient chooses when to initiate the medication, the surroundings, and presence of support persons. While the efficacy of medication management is slightly lower compared with uterine aspiration (99.6 versus 99.8 percent, respectively, in one study of first-trimester abortion), some individuals are motivated to avoid a surgical procedure, if possible [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. A large body of evidence demonstrates the safety of both medication and surgical approaches, and each individual's treatment preferences should drive management whenever clinically safe.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Efficacy of combination versus single agent treatment</strong> – Combined treatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10263" href="/z/d/drug information/10263.html" rel="external">mifepristone</a> followed by <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9657" href="/z/d/drug information/9657.html" rel="external">misoprostol</a> is preferred as it has higher efficacy compared with misoprostol-only therapy. Efficacy rates (ie, rate of empty uterus following treatment) of approximately 70 to over 90 percent have been reported; treatment efficacy varies with medication, gestational age, presence of uterine bleeding, and duration of follow-up [<a href="#rid14">14,15,19,20</a>]. Efficacy is on the higher end of the spectrum for individuals treated with combination therapy, gestational age less than nine weeks, and onset of uterine bleeding prior to treatment [<a href="#rid14">14,19</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Up to 12+6 weeks gestation</strong> – A trial comparing combination therapy with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10263" href="/z/d/drug information/10263.html" rel="external">mifepristone</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9657" href="/z/d/drug information/9657.html" rel="external">misoprostol</a> with misoprostol-only for 300 individuals with pregnancy loss through 12+6 weeks of gestation reported the following [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Efficacy by day 8</strong> – 87.8 versus 71.1 percent, respectively.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Efficacy by day 30</strong> – 91.2 versus 75.8 percent, respectively. These results included a small number of patients who received a second dose of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9657" href="/z/d/drug information/9657.html" rel="external">misoprostol</a> if the uterus was not completely empty at the first follow-up visit.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>13 to 19+6 weeks of gestation</strong> – Medication management efficacy data for second-trimester pregnancy loss are largely extrapolated from the second-trimester medication abortion literature [<a href="#rid21">21-23</a>]. Studies specific to second-trimester abortion report 24-hour expulsion rates of 73 to 97 percent following combined treatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10263" href="/z/d/drug information/10263.html" rel="external">mifepristone</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9657" href="/z/d/drug information/9657.html" rel="external">misoprostol</a> [<a href="#rid24">24-27</a>]. One small trial of 64 patients undergoing medication abortion between 18 and 23 weeks of gestation reported higher rates of placental retention in subjects receiving misoprostol alone versus mifepristone and misoprostol (6.3 versus 3.1 percent) [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90163.html" rel="external">"Second-trimester pregnancy termination: Induction (medication) termination"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mechanism of action</strong> – <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10263" href="/z/d/drug information/10263.html" rel="external">Mifepristone</a> is an antiprogestin that binds competitively with the progestin receptor and results in decidual necrosis while priming the uterus and cervix for prostaglandin activity [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>]. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9657" href="/z/d/drug information/9657.html" rel="external">Misoprostol</a> is a prostaglandin E1 analog and works as a uterotonic, making the uterus contract and expel the pregnancy tissue [<a href="#rid30">30,31</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risks</strong> – General risks of medication management include retained tissue that requires surgical evacuation (8 to 9 percent), blood transfusion (2 percent), and pelvic infection (less than 1 percent) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. When patients elect for medication management, it is important they understand that aspiration for removal of retained tissue or the placenta is possible. Complications are presented in detail separately.

Medical conditions that might increase the risks associated with medication abortion, particularly the risk of hemorrhage, include bleeding dyscrasias, significant cardiopulmonary disease, and use of an anticoagulation medication; surgical management is preferred for these individuals. (See <a class="local">'Surgical management'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Safety</strong> – Overall, the safety of medication management in the second trimester is reduced as compared with the safety of surgical management [<a href="#rid32">32,33</a>]. However, this is only true if there are clinicians trained and skilled at performing dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) for this gestational age range. In settings where there is a dearth of capable D&amp;E providers, medication management becomes the primary method of pregnancy loss management in the second trimester.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H329569560"><span class="h2">Surgical management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surgical management with vacuum aspiration of the uterus is performed with either manual or electric vacuum aspiration systems.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Factors for consideration</strong> – Surgical management is predictable, highly efficacious, and offers rapid resolution of miscarriage [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. The procedure typically occurs in a health care facility, where pain medication can be administered, and takes under 15 minutes to complete. Recovery can be as fast as 20 to 30 minutes for individuals who receive minimal or no sedation. Patients have the ability to schedule a specific date and time. Return to usual activities is typically the same day following procedures performed for first-trimester pregnancy loss. Individuals who want to minimize pain and/or bleeding and prefer a predictable course may prefer this route.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Efficacy</strong> – The efficacy of early surgical management using vacuum aspiration is nearly 100 percent [<a href="#rid1">1,18</a>]. Although much of the efficacy data for surgical management come from the abortion literature, not studies evaluating early pregnancy loss (EPL) management, there is no reason to expect outcomes of surgical management to be different based on the diagnostic indication of abortion or EPL (as matched for other factors) [<a href="#rid34">34,35</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risks</strong> – The risks of surgical management are mainly the risks related to the procedure and include incomplete evacuation, injury (eg, cervical laceration, perforation of the uterus), bleeding, infection, and formation of intrauterine adhesions. Rarely, an individual may require additional surgery as a result of surgical complications from uterine aspiration.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient medical comorbidities</strong> – Surgical management is favored for individuals with anemia or bleeding abnormalities or those who require anticoagulant medication.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Comparison with hysteroscopic resection</strong> – Hysteroscopic resection has been proposed as an alternative to vacuum aspiration for patients with retained products of conception (ie, incomplete spontaneous abortion). The rationale is that focal resection rather than aspiration of the entire cavity could reduce the risk of postoperative uterine adhesions and preserve fertility. However, in a trial comparing hysteroscopic resection (n = 282) with uterine aspiration (n = 281) for patients with retained pregnancy tissue, live birth rates at two years of follow-up were similar between the groups (62.8 versus 67.6 percent, absolute risk difference -4.8, 95% CI -13.0 to 3.0) [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. The elapsed time to conception was similar as well (median 5.7 versus 4.9 months, absolute median difference 0.4, 95% CI -0.4 to 1.2). All included patients desired future pregnancy and pregnancy was defined as an intrauterine gestation of at least 22 weeks. Hysteroscopic resection also requires additional equipment and is less readily available compared with uterine aspiration. Routine hysteroscopic resection is therefore not advised.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Additional considerations for</strong> <strong>13 to 19+6 weeks of gestation</strong> – Surgical management in the second trimester typically requires both cervical preparation and cervical dilation.

This can be done at the time of diagnosis, treatment, and/or follow-up visit to ensure this serious medical condition is not missed. When patients have a positive depression screen or demonstrate persistent elevated levels of distress or depression symptoms, clinicians can either offer treatment for depression or refer to a mental health care provider.
