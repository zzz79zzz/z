Diagnosis is usually made in childhood, although diagnostic delays and variable disease manifestations are common, and some individuals may be diagnosed with FA in adulthood.</p><p>Management of patients with FA is challenging because hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is curative for bone marrow failure and hematologic neoplasms but not for the non-hematologic features. Patients also require increased surveillance for both hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies, and reduced-intensity therapy is typically used for HCT and cancer treatment.</p><p>This topic review discusses the management and prognosis of FA.

HCT outcomes in patients with FA have improved dramatically since 2000, a trend made possible by the development of FA-specific reduced intensity approaches to conditioning and improvements in the understanding of supportive care needs for these patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/132753.html" rel="external">"Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS)", section on 'Fanconi anemia'</a>.)</p><p>We refer all patients with FA who have evidence of bone marrow failure to a specialized HCT center to discuss the risks and benefits of HCT and to initiate evaluation of potential HCT donors. It may also be appropriate to refer individuals with FA who do not have bone marrow failure to an HCT center to discuss these issues. However, we do not advocate performing HCT in individuals with adequate bone marrow function, with the rationale that some individuals with FA, including those with mild cytopenias, will not develop bone marrow failure. Additionally, HCT prior to the onset of bone marrow failure may require increased conditioning intensity and thus carries risks of increased toxicity. (See <a class="local">'Allogeneic HCT'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2617630073"><span class="h2">Monitoring bone marrow function</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Our initial approach to the monitoring of bone marrow function is stratified according to the severity of bone marrow failure  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57755" href="/z/d/graphic/57755.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and the presence or absence of clonal hematopoietic neoplasms:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For those with mild bone marrow failure, defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) between 1000 and 1500/microL, platelet count between 50,000 and 150,000/microL, and hemoglobin (Hb) ≥10 g/dL, we monitor the complete blood count (CBC) with differential every three to four months as long as the blood counts remain stable, and we perform a bone marrow examination with cytogenetics annually. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If there are changes in blood counts without an apparent underlying cause (eg, infection), the frequency of CBC monitoring is increased and bone marrow studies are repeated, regardless of the date of the last study.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For those with moderate bone marrow failure (ANC between 500 and 1000/microL, platelet count between 30,000 and 50,000/microL, Hb between 8 and 10 g/dL) whose counts continue to decline, we initiate HCT planning with an HLA-matched related donor (first choice) or closely matched unrelated donor. (See <a class="local">'Allogeneic HCT'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Androgen therapy may be a reasonable option to improve blood counts for some patients including those with moderate bone marrow failure for whom no donor is available, those who do not meet medical eligibility criteria for HCT due to pre-existing organ dysfunction or ongoing infection, and those who decline HCT. (See <a class="local">'Androgens'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Alternatively, if the patient is asymptomatic with stable cell counts and no clonal abnormality, it may be reasonable to monitor the CBC every three to four months and perform a bone marrow examination annually as done for mild bone marrow failure. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If there is a cytogenetic abnormality known to be associated with poor-risk MDS in the absence of other MDS-defining features, the CBC and bone marrow should be monitored more frequently (eg, CBC every one to two months; bone marrow every one to six months), and the best-available donor HCT should be pursued. (See <a class="local">'Allogeneic HCT'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For those with severe bone marrow failure (ANC ≤500/microL, platelet count ≤30,000/microL, Hb &lt;8 g/dL), and/or transfusion dependence, we pursue HCT with the best available donor. An HLA-matched sibling who has been determined not to have FA is preferable, with the second choice being a closely matched unrelated donor. If neither of these options are available, a trial of androgen therapy may be attempted while (or prior to) pursuing other alternative donors such as cord blood or haploidentical HCT, with attempts to limit transfusion exposure and opportunistic infections during the androgen trial. For individuals who do not have access to HCT for whatever reason (eg, medically ineligible, lack of donor, cost), androgen therapy or investigational approaches such as gene therapy may be used. (See <a class="local">'Androgens'</a> below and <a class="local">'Therapies under development'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>This monitoring schedule and management approach is consistent with the 2014 <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanconi.org%2Fimages%2Fuploads%2Fother%2FFA_Guidelines_4th_Edition_Revised_Names_in_Appendix.pdf&amp;token=%2FwmHOG%2BPhqT49RSCc8bbEH9dHr48vZFidcR8kMk%2FOl6f9pn7b53JJUAIlVFcXDzC5%2FcFNnEBo9CNFjszlxM32w7dLhFKmCAUslckWdvg3J7OSHo7v7%2F6Wc0FtBBSCOoXEdclOJjZY2kkzuQZYcfajA%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=109777" target="_blank">Fanconi Anemia Guidelines for Diagnosis and Management</a> from the Fanconi Anemia Research Fund [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Of note, immunosuppressive therapy (IST), which is used frequently in patients with acquired aplastic anemia, has no role in the treatment of FA because the disease is not immune-mediated.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3496204996"><span class="h2">Allogeneic HCT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Allogeneic HCT is the only established curative therapy for patients with FA and severe bone marrow failure, transfusion-dependent anemia or thrombocytopenia, MDS, or AML [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. We urgently refer these patients for HCT. The preferred approach is to use bone marrow (rather than peripheral blood stem cells) from an eligible sibling who is HLA-matched at 8 of 8 alleles of the four most commonly tested HLA genes (HLA -A, -B, -C, and DRB1) or a closely matched unrelated donor.</p><p>HCT is curative for bone marrow failure and potentially for hematopoietic neoplasms, but it does not cure other manifestations of FA. As noted above, HCT appears to increase the risk of squamous cell cancers, especially in individuals with severe graft-versus-host disease (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/109795.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Fanconi anemia", section on 'Solid tumors'</a>). Additionally, insulin resistance, bone health disorders, and other endocrinopathies may be worsened by HCT, and require close lifelong monitoring [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Identification and management of organ dysfunction'</a> below.)</p><p>Potential donor sources include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Related donors – It is critical that all potential sibling or other related donors undergo genetic testing or evaluation for chromosomal breakage, to ensure that they do not also have FA. This testing is necessary because family donors who are apparently asymptomatic and healthy may have FA, but lack classic findings due to mosaicism, incomplete penetrance of FA-associated abnormalities, or young age/late onset of disease manifestations. For potential related donors who have nonhematologic features of FA, but in whom chromosomal breakage testing performed on a blood sample is normal, chromosomal breakage testing should be performed on a fibroblast sample to exclude the possibility of testing a hematologic revertant. HCT performed with a family donor who also turns out to have FA, even if mosaic and/or asymptomatic, would carry a very high risk of graft failure. On the other hand, siblings who are only carriers of one heterozygous mutation in an autosomal recessive FA-associated gene are eligible as donors.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unrelated donors – Although unrelated donor HCT carries a substantial risk of long-term toxicity, we consider it preferable to delaying HCT while attempting to use non-curative supportive care to increasing blood counts. Individuals with FA are at risk for significant toxicity from standard chemotherapy doses used for HCT conditioning. Strategies developed at the University of Minnesota and other centers that incorporate reduced doses of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13191" href="/z/d/drug information/13191.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a> (20 to 60 mg/kg total dose; representing 50 to 90 percent reduction compared with conventional cyclophosphamide conditioning doses), in combination with immunosuppressive but otherwise low-toxicity agents such as <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13305" href="/z/d/drug information/13305.html" rel="external">fludarabine</a> and antithymocyte globulin, have been extremely effective in matched sibling donor HCT for FA. Rates of engraftment associated with these approaches are &gt;90 percent, and overall post-HCT survival by five years is &gt;94 percent in most series reported since 2005 [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. Matching with high-resolution HLA genotyping, T cell depletion, and conditioning regimens with lower toxicity have also improved outcomes from unrelated donors. Issues related to HCT are discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/132753.html" rel="external">"Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS)", section on 'Fanconi anemia'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with FA who lack a closely matched related or unrelated donor, if the parents are interested in having additional children, in vitro fertilization (IVF) with pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) can be considered. This approach can ensure that future children will not have FA and also select for an HLA-matched sibling that can be used as a future donor. While not always effective and associated with challenging ethical, emotional, and financial dimensions, this approach has facilitated successful matched sibling donor HCT [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. This approach is not optimal for individuals with FA who have an urgent need for HCT (eg, those who require transfusions or have severe neutropenia despite optimal supportive care), since it may take one to two years before a healthy sibling donor is available. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6783.html" rel="external">"Preimplantation genetic testing", section on 'Potential candidates for PGT-M'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We consider use of an alternative donor source only in the context of a clinical trial. Examples include: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Umbilical cord blood (UCB) HCT appears to be less effective than matched unrelated donor bone marrow for patients with FA. In a series of 93 patients with FA who underwent UCB HCT, overall survival was 40 percent [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Another report of alternative donor HCT at the University of Minnesota (1995 and 2012) showed an increased risk of neutrophil and platelet engraftment failure and severe GVHD, and a trend toward increased risk of mortality in 31 recipients of UCB HCT compared to 73 patients receiving HLA-matched, T cell-depleted unrelated donor bone marrow transplant [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Use of UCB units with higher stem cell doses and incorporation of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13305" href="/z/d/drug information/13305.html" rel="external">fludarabine</a> into conditioning regimens may improve outcomes in the future.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Haploidentical HCT using a parent or other related donor is under investigation at several centers. This approach shows promise, although outcomes are not as good as those seen with closely matched unrelated donors [<a href="#rid9">9-12</a>]. </p><p></p><p>Pre-transplant evaluation, donor selection, conditioning regimen, optimal stem cell source (eg, bone marrow rather than peripheral blood) and post-transplant care are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7089.html" rel="external">"Hematopoietic cell transplantation for aplastic anemia in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/132753.html" rel="external">"Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS)", section on 'Fanconi anemia'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1182002631"><span class="h2">Androgens</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Androgen therapy is not curative, but it may be appropriate for patients who lack a closely matched related donor for HCT, or for those for whom HCT is not pursued due to family/caregiver preference or medical eligibility [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. Androgen therapy is also increasingly used to support blood counts for a period of weeks to months while parents attempt IVF with PGD and until the resulting HLA-matched donor is able to donate.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Choice of androgen</strong> – <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13199" href="/z/d/drug information/13199.html" rel="external">Danazol</a> is our preferred androgen for use in FA [<a href="#rid15">15-18</a>]. <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="94655" href="/z/d/drug information/94655.html" rel="external">Oxandrolone</a> and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="97035" href="/z/d/drug information/97035.html" rel="external">oxymetholone</a> have been removed from the market.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Toxicity</strong> – Adverse effects (AEs) associated with androgen therapy include virilization, growth abnormalities, behavioral changes, hypertension, and liver tumors. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The most concerning side effects of androgens in patients with FA involve the liver, and include transaminitis, cholestasis, peliosis hepatis, and liver tumors. In a series in which androgens were administered to 36 patients with FA and 97 patients with other conditions such as acquired aplastic anemia, those with FA were more likely to develop androgen-associated liver tumors at a younger age than those without FA [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Of 36 liver tumors reported overall, 21 were hepatocellular carcinomas and 13 were adenomas. In the German experience mentioned above, liver adenoma was reported in the records of 12 of 26 patients (46 percent) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Given these concerning risks, patients receiving androgen therapy should have liver chemistry profiles monitored every one to two months, with liver ultrasounds performed every 6 to 12 months.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Efficacy</strong> – Approximately one-half of patients with FA will respond to androgen therapy [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with severe bone marrow aplasia are less likely to respond than those with residual bone marrow function, and responses can take weeks to months. Thus, the recommended time to initiate a trial of androgen therapy is when a patient has developed moderate to severe bone marrow failure  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57755" href="/z/d/graphic/57755.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), but is not consistently transfusion-dependent. Androgen therapy has the most dramatic effect on the erythroid lineage and can improve Hb levels within a few weeks of initiation. Responses in the platelet count are generally slower and less complete, and neutropenia may not completely resolve [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]. If blood counts stabilize or improve after initiation of an androgen, the daily dose may be tapered to the minimum effective dose to avoid nonhematologic toxicity.
