         Acquired clonal chromosomal abnormalities are present in the tumor cells of many hematologic malignancies. Certain cytogenetic abnormalities are closely (sometimes uniquely) associated with morphologically or clinically distinct subsets of leukemias or lymphomas and, in many cases, cytogenetic analysis is important for diagnosis, stratifying treatment, estimating prognosis, or distinguishing benign from malignant cell populations. Chromosome banding techniques and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are the most common clinical tools for karyotypic analysis.

         This topic reviews terminology of cytogenetic (chromosomal) abnormalities in hematologic malignancies, clinical settings for analysis, and methods of detection.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cytogenetic abnormalities in individual diseases are discussed in detail in the appropriate topics. A review of various genetic tools is presented separately. (See

An exception is a single cell with a well-characterized recurring abnormality (eg, the Philadelphia chromosome associated with chronic myeloid leukemia [CML]) or a single cell in a post-treatment sample with one or more aberrations that were observed in the pre-treatment sample. An abnormality in a single cell is also considered to represent a cytogenetic clone if the abnormality is confirmed by another method, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or a molecular technique [

         <strong>
          Deletion (del)
         </strong>
         refers to loss of chromosomal material. Deletions can be an interstitial deletion (in which two breaks, in either the short arm or long arm of the chromosome, cause loss of the intervening material), or due to unbalanced translocations. An example of an interstitial deletion is isolated del(5q) in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), in which a variable portion of the long arm of chromosome 5 is lost. (See

          Reciprocal translocation
         </strong>
         refers to an exchange in which there is no obvious overall loss of chromosomal material. Standard nomenclature is to designate the involved chromosomes in the first set of parentheses and the specific breakpoints in a second set. As an example, the reciprocal translocation associated with CML is t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2), which involves a reciprocal translocation between the long arm of chromosome 9 at band q34.1 (9q34.1) and the long arm of chromosome 22 at band q11.2 (22q11.2). The derivative chromosome 22 is the so-called Philadelphia chromosome  (

          Chromosomal inversion (inv)

         Cytogenetic analysis is necessary for diagnosis of some hematologic malignancies and it provides key confirmation of other presumptive diagnoses. In general, molecular techniques that define the underlying molecular abnormalities are important for complementing cytogenetic findings, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Importantly, rare cases with cryptic genetic rearrangements (sub-karyotypic) that result in recurring fusion genes can only be diagnosed by molecular techniques, since they are not detectable by conventional karyotypic analysis.

         Chromosome analysis often detects primary and secondary chromosome abnormalities. Serial evaluation can reveal clonal evolution of a malignancy. Chromosome analysis provides evidence of a complex karyotype with ≥3 chromosomal abnormalities, or a monosomal karyotype with loss of two autosomal chromosomes, or one autosomal chromosome and ≥1 structural abnormality. Complex karyotypes and monosomal karyotypes are strongly associated with an unfavorable prognosis in AML and MDS. (See

However, in most clinical cases, FISH serves as a complement to conventional cytogenetic analysis because it may not detect additional chromosomal abnormalities or multiple clones  (

          5
         </a>
         ]. The target DNA is the nuclear DNA of interphase cells or the DNA of metaphase chromosomes that are affixed to a glass microscope slide. Importantly, FISH does not require live cells (eg, from bone marrow or blood smears or freshly-prepared touch preparations), as it can be used with cytospin slides or fixed and sectioned tissue. (See

         Commercially available FISH probes are typically bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones (usually several hundred kilobases long) that are directly labeled with fluorochrome and hybridized to the target DNA.

         Chromosome banding and FISH can examine cytogenetic abnormalities at the single cell level, whereas clinically-available molecular techniques generally examine populations of cells. However, cytogenetic techniques have certain disadvantages. Chromosome banding only detects genetic abnormalities that involve large regions of chromosomes (rather than small pieces of DNA), while FISH is less sensitive than molecular techniques for detecting MRD. Cytogenetic analysis should be complemented by morphology and molecular techniques for diagnosis of hematologic malignancies.

          Technical challenges
         </strong>
         – Conventional cytogenetic analysis of tumors is often technically difficult because of the complexity of the chromosomal pattern and the presence of multiple abnormal clones.

         <strong>
          Sensitivity
         </strong>
         – Cytogenetic techniques are considerably less sensitive for detecting MRD, compared with molecular techniques  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ). As an example, the lower limit for detecting a cytogenetic abnormality by FISH is 1 to 5 percent of cells, whereas reverse transcription (RT)-PCR or NGS panels have sensitivity of 1 cell per 10,000 or greater [

          Smaller genetic abnormalities
         </strong>
         – Cytogenetic techniques can detect abnormalities that involve large regions of chromosomes (eg, numerical or structural chromosome abnormalities), but they don't detect point mutations or small regions of gene deletion (&lt;10 Mb) or amplification.

          Chromosomal abnormalities in hematologic malignancies
         </strong>
         – Acquired clonal chromosomal abnormalities are present in malignant cells of many hematologic malignancies. Certain cytogenetic abnormalities are closely or even uniquely associated with distinct morphologic or clinical disease subsets. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction'

         <strong>
          Clinical applications
         </strong>
         – Cytogenetic studies can confirm certain diagnoses (eg, chronic myeloid leukemia [CML], acute promyelocytic leukemia [APL]), assess prognosis (eg, acute myeloid leukemia [AML]), detect measurable residual disease (MRD; eg, AML, acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]), and identify disease transformation (eg, blast phase CML).

         <strong>
          Specimen acquisition
         </strong>
         – Cytogenetic evaluation of leukemia can use bone marrow, blood, or a tumor mass, while evaluation of lymphomas can use involved lymph nodes, marrow, blood, tumor masses, or malignant effusions. Conventional cytogenetic studies can be performed only on specimens that contain viable dividing cells; specimens immersed in preservatives or fixatives
         <strong>
          cannot
         </strong>
         be used for chromosome banding analysis. Specimens should be collected into a syringe coated with preservative-free heparin or in another container, promptly transferred to appropriate culture medium, and transported without delay at room temperature to the cytogenetics laboratory. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Obtaining and processing the specimen'

         <strong>
          Metaphase cytogenetic analysis
         </strong>
         – While technically challenging, conventional metaphase cytogenetic analysis can examine the entire tumor genome at the single cell level, which is especially important for hematologic malignancies with many potential genetic abnormalities (eg, AML). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Metaphase cytogenetic analysis'

         <strong>
          Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
         </strong>
         – FISH is a complement to conventional cytogenetic analysis that can rapidly and sensitively detect recurring numerical and structural abnormalities. It is most valuable for identifying abnormalities that are associated with a particular disease, but it may not detect additional abnormalities or multiple clones. (See
         <a class="local">
