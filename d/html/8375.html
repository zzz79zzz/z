         This topic review will provide an overview of the causes, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of neutropenia when it occurs as an
         <strong>
          isolated or predominant feature
         </strong>
         . Neutropenia is also a common manifestation of bone marrow defects associated with reductions in red bloods cells and platelets, such as aplastic anemia, leukemia, myelodysplasia, megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, and the administration of chemotherapy. These disorders are reviewed separately.
        </p>
        <p>
         Laboratory evaluation of neutropenia and neutrophil function, as well as various disorders associated with neutropenia are discussed separately.

         The absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is equal to the product of the white blood cell (WBC) count and the fraction of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and band forms noted on the differential analysis:

        <div class="formulaContainer">

        <p>
         Neutrophilic metamyelocytes and younger forms are not included in this calculation (

          calculator 1
         </a>
         ). An ANC &lt;1500/microL (&lt;1.5 x 10
         <sup>
          9
         </sup>
         /L) is the generally accepted definition of neutropenia for adults and children over one year of age. (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64984" href="/z/d/graphic/64984.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The normal range for the ANC varies somewhat with age (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef105415" href="/z/d/graphic/105415.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). The lower limit of normal is 5000/microL (5.0×10
         <sup>
          9
         </sup>
         /L) for the first week of life, then falls to 1000/microL (1.0×10
         <sup>
          9
         </sup>
         /L) between two weeks and one year of age [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Importantly, the range for ANC may be lower in individuals who inherit certain gene variants, as discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Normal variants'

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Neutropenia is often categorized as mild, moderate or severe, based on the level of ANC. Mild neutropenia corresponds to an ANC between 1000 and 1500/microL, moderate between 500 and 1000/microL, and severe with less than 500/microL. The risk of infection begins to increase at an ANC below 1000/microL (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63903" href="/z/d/graphic/63903.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). However, the risk is also dependent on the adequacy of the marrow reserve pool of granulocytes. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Infection propensity'
         </a>
         below.)

        <p>
         Leukopenia and granulocytopenia are generally used interchangeably with neutropenia, although they are somewhat different:

         Leukopenia refers to a low total WBC count that may be due to any cause (eg, lymphopenia and/or neutropenia); however, almost all leukopenic patients are neutropenic since the number of neutrophils is so much larger than the number of lymphocytes.

         </span>
         Granulocytopenia refers to a reduced absolute number of all circulating cells of the granulocyte series (eg, neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils); however, almost all granulocytopenic patients are neutropenic since the number of neutrophils is so much larger than the number of eosinophils and basophils.

         Agranulocytosis literally means the absence of granulocytes, but the term is often incorrectly used to indicate severe neutropenia (ie, ANC &lt;500/microL).

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Since most clinicians' exposure to neutropenia is through experience with malignancy or severe marrow failure syndromes (where neutrophil production is impaired and marrow neutrophil reserve is diminished), it is important to be aware that for most commonly encountered cases of neutropenia, the marrow reserve is not impaired and the propensity to infection may have little relation to the degree of neutropenia.

         Only about 3 percent of the body's neutrophils are circulating in the peripheral blood. The vast majority of neutrophils are in the bone marrow reserve pool and the remainder is in the tissue and marginated pool attached to the lining of blood vessels. Thus, a standard complete blood count (CBC) done on peripheral blood is, in effect, sampling the very smallest compartment of neutrophils and does not accurately reflect the body's capacity to protect against bacterial infection. The most important issue is whether adequate neutrophils get to the site of infection, not how many are sampled in passage from the marrow to the tissue. While one can infer tissue supply of neutrophils from the clinical history and certain physical findings (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62992" href="/z/d/graphic/62992.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ), there is no good clinical laboratory test available to quantitate tissue neutrophil delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
         Adequacy of the marrow reserve pool is the most critical determinant of propensity to infection in a neutropenic patient, although having a normal marrow does not guarantee protection against infection, as the condition causing the neutropenia may be associated with infection risk independent of the neutropenia. By "adequate marrow reserve" we mean normal marrow cellularity and normal maturation of the neutrophil series. We would consider low marrow cellularity or myeloid arrest at the myelocyte or metamyelocyte stage to imply decreased reserve. The risk of infection based on ANC is summarized in the table (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71724" href="/z/d/graphic/71724.html" rel="external">
          table 5
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         In the neutropenic febrile patient, management decisions must be made without information about the adequacy of the bone marrow reserve. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are the only ways to directly evaluate marrow reserve. The table lists clinical signs that infer marrow reserve (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62992" href="/z/d/graphic/62992.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ). If the bone marrow reserve pool is significantly depleted, there is a rough relationship between the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and propensity to infection (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63903" href="/z/d/graphic/63903.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         However, and importantly, if the bone marrow reserve pool is completely adequate, there is no relationship between the degree of neutropenia and propensity to infection. If the marrow reserve pool is normal, patients with an ANC of zero may be at no increased risk of serious infection because of the neutropenia. Essentially, patients with normal marrow reserve are able to deliver neutrophils to the site of infection, and those with no marrow reserve are not.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most clinicians are aware of the extreme danger present in patients with significant fever and very low ANC based on their experiences during training with patients who have received chemotherapy or who have bone marrow failure syndromes. These patients have no bone marrow reserve. Patients with immune mediated neutropenia but normal bone marrow reserve are on the other end of the spectrum and are at no increased risk of infection because of the neutropenia. Note that we are careful to say "no increased risk of infection because of the neutropenia" and not "no increased risk of infection." Neutropenia can be the presenting finding in common variable immunodeficiency, other immunodeficiency states, and collagen vascular diseases, all of which can have adequate marrow reserve yet put the patient at increased risk for infection for reasons other than the neutropenia. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8371.html" rel="external">
          "Immune neutropenia"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Various neutropenia syndromes are presented in the table according to marrow reserve (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71724" href="/z/d/graphic/71724.html" rel="external">
          table 5
         </a>
         ). Some disorders appear in more than one category. For example, post-infectious neutropenia usually has normal marrow reserve, but not always. Classification of neutropenias by marrow reserve status offers a mechanistic link to propensity to infection and has some bearing on treatment. Patients with decreased reserve are likely to benefit from treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, whereas this agent is not of benefit for patients with normal marrow. The clinical symptoms noted in the table (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62992" href="/z/d/graphic/62992.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ) can give the clinician some idea of the ability to deliver neutrophils to tissue and thus adequacy of marrow reserve. As examples:

         </span>
         If a neutropenic patient has a frank abscess or purulent exudate, they can get neutrophils to tissue and likely has a normal marrow.

         The presence of mucosal ulcerations and severe gingivitis suggests inability to deliver neutrophils. However, immune disorders can directly cause similar lesions in the presence of normal reserve neutropenia. (See

         Separate from the issue of propensity to infection, neutropenia can be a sign of an underlying systemic disorder (

          table 6
         </a>
         ). When neutropenia is discovered during the evaluation of a febrile patient, propensity to infection dominates. However, neutropenia is often discovered on a blood count done for some other reason. The approach to such patients is outlined below.

         Some individuals have an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1500/microL with no recurrent or severe infections, other cytopenias, or associated illnesses [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2

        <p>
         Normal variants in ANC are most often encountered in individuals of African descent, as well as Sephardic Jews, West Indians, Yemenites, Greeks, and Arabs. We favor the designation DANC; while it was previously called constitutional neutropenia or benign ethnic neutropenia, use of the term neutropenia might erroneously imply a pathologic condition [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2

         ] or a risk for infection. This normal variant is not associated with recurrent or unusual infections, other cytopenias, physical findings, or other causes of cytopenias (eg, medications, excessive alcohol consumption, liver disease, autoimmune conditions).

         </span>
         The causes of isolated neutropenia can be classified by mechanism or by etiologic agent. Neutropenia results from four basic mechanisms: decreased production, ineffective granulopoiesis, shift of circulating polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) to vascular endothelium or tissue pools, or enhanced peripheral destruction. Confirmation of one of these mechanisms requires leukokinetic studies employing bone marrow cultures, radionuclide tagging of blood PMNs, and other monitoring devices not readily available outside the research laboratory. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         The classification of neutropenia according to marrow reserve status is useful when thinking about mechanism of neutropenia and propensity to infection. However, classification based on whether the neutropenia is acquired or congenital and grouped by known causes or associations provides a practical means to approach the differential diagnosis of these disorders in a clinical setting (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69186" href="/z/d/graphic/69186.html" rel="external">
          table 6
         </a>
         ). That said, there is great overlap in the disorders listed, which is why we favor a classification based on marrow reserve. There are several named disorders that lead to neutropenia with normal cellularity, late myeloid arrest, and little or no propensity to infection. These likely represent various interactions between subtle genetic differences and environmental factors. Apoptosis of marrow precursors is now recognized as a common mechanism for many acquired and congenital neutropenias.

         Infectious neutropenias may represent the most common cause of acquired isolated neutropenia. A number of bacterial, viral, parasitic and rickettsial infections are responsible. In most instances, particularly with viral infections, the neutropenia is short-lived and rarely results in bacterial superinfection. Mechanisms include redistribution, sequestration and aggregation, and destruction by circulating antibodies. Hepatitis B virus, Epstein-Barr virus and human immunodeficiency virus can be associated with more severe and protracted neutropenia. (See

         Antineutrophil antibodies mediate neutrophil destruction either by splenic sequestration of opsonized cells or by complement-mediated neutrophil lysis. Immune neutropenia can occur as a myeloid-specific syndrome or in association with other cytopenias. Antineutrophil antibodies are involved in the pathophysiology of the neutropenia caused by some infections, drug exposure, and immune deficiencies. In addition, there are specific primary immune disorders characterized by neutropenia and antineutrophil antibody production.
        </p>
        <p>
         Assessment of immune neutropenias can be particularly problematic, because the propensity to infection may be more related to the underlying immune disorder than to the neutropenia. Thus, while immune disorders may have antibody-mediated neutropenia, they may also be associated with vasculitis, leading to mucosal ulcers. We have seen the oral symptoms completely resolve with treatment of the underlying vasculitis with no change in the absolute neutrophil count (ANC), proving that the mucositis and the neutropenia are not related. Usually, immune neutropenias have normal marrow reserve (

         – Neutropenia can occur in newborn infants secondary to transplacental passage of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies directed against neutrophil-specific antigens inherited from the father.

         – The term chronic idiopathic neutropenia, also known as benign chronic neutropenia, is used to describe chronic neutropenia for which there is no obvious cause. In contrast to autoimmune neutropenia, which is primarily a disease of infants and young children, chronic idiopathic neutropenia tends to occur in late childhood or adulthood and does not undergo spontaneous remission.

         Rare primary neutropenias occur and, when associated with severe recurrent infections as in the severe congenital neutropenias, can be treated successfully with hematopoietic growth factors. These syndromes include severe infantile agranulocytosis, myelokathexis, Shwachman-Diamond-Oski syndrome, Chediak-Higashi syndrome, and reticular dysgenesis. The diagnosis is made by examination of the bone marrow, which reveals myeloid hypoplasia. Congenital neutropenia can also be seen with certain inborn errors of metabolism such as glycogen storage disease and with some of the primary immune deficiency states. (See

         Cyclic neutropenia is characterized by recurrent mouth infections and regular oscillations in the numbers of blood neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, lymphocytes and reticulocytes at approximately 21-day intervals. It usually presents in childhood, as a familial syndrome, but there is a subset of patients with onset in adulthood. Treatment is largely supportive, and G-CSF has been effective in preventing infection and reducing symptoms. (See

         Recurrent infections are the only significant consequence of neutropenia. However, the classic signs of infection may be less evident in patients with neutropenia. This is particularly true in patients with bone marrow hypoplasia who are unable to respond to infection. In this setting, radiographs may not demonstrate pneumonia, or the patient may not exhibit abnormal tenderness with an early ruptured viscus.
        </p>
        <p>
         The propensity to infection in neutropenic patients has been discussed and is related to the degree of neutropenia (

          table 2

          table 5
         </a>
         ). Common sites of infection include the oral cavity and mucous membranes, the skin, and, with severe, persistent neutropenia, systemic infections of the lungs and bloodstream may occur. Endogenous bacterial flora are the most common pathogens.
        </p>
        <p>
         Recurrent ulceration of the mouth or oral mucosa in the presence of significant neutropenia may indicate inadequate neutrophil production. Similarly, gingivitis in the setting of chronic neutropenia may be the only sign that the marrow reserve is decreased. Conversely, the presence of a purulent exudate or draining abscess suggests the patient is able to make neutrophils (

         In a classic study in patients with leukemia published in 1966, which applies to neutropenia with decreased marrow reserve, the relationship between the frequency of infection and both the severity and duration of neutropenia was evaluated during 733 episodes of moderate neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] less than 1000/microL) and 125 episodes of severe neutropenia (ANC less than 100/microL) [
         <a href="#rid26">

         Efforts have been made to identify febrile neutropenic patients with a lower risk of bacteremia. In one pediatric study of 161 patients experiencing 509 episodes of fever and neutropenia, presentation with chills or hypotension, the requirement for fluid resuscitation, or the diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma were associated with a higher probability of positive blood cultures [
         <a href="#rid30">

         The risk is lower in patients with AIDS who may develop neutropenia in whom drug toxicity or autoimmunity may be responsible for the neutropenia. The risk for bacterial infection becomes significant when the ANC is less than 750 to 1000/microL [

         Children with the benign chronic neutropenia may have an ANC below 200/microL for months or years and remain free of serious infections [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33

         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. In both situations, the bone marrow generally shows normal granulocyte maturation up to either the metamyelocyte or band form stage with a paucity of PMNs. This bone marrow picture is referred to as a "maturational arrest."

         Well-appearing children with transient neutropenia, particularly of short duration, are also at low risk for infection. In one study of 119 children, infectious complications occurred in 4 of the 36 patients who had neutropenia for more than 30 days (two with stomatitis, one with cellulitis, and one with pneumonia) but in none with a shorter duration of neutropenia [
         <a href="#rid35">

         ].

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to differences in bone marrow reserve, several other factors may contribute to the variability in infectious risk. Many patients with chronic forms of neutropenia have normal or increased blood monocyte counts. Monocytes are functioning phagocytes such as the neutrophil and band forms and probably contribute to the lack of correlation between the ANC and infection risk [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36,37
         </a>
         ]. Neutropenia related to underlying immunodeficiency may have normal marrow reserve yet increased risk because of inability to make protective antibodies or mucosal barrier damage secondary to vasculitis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another difference is that the delivery of neutrophils to tissues in chronic severe neutropenia appears to be greater than in acute chemotherapy-induced neutropenia of equal degree [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29,38
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, recovery of neutrophils is evident at tissue sites before the blood [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. These observations indicate that the ANC does not always accurately reflect neutrophil availability at tissue or organ sites of infection.

         The specific pathogens isolated from infected neutropenic patients are almost exclusively pyogenic or enteric bacteria or certain fungi (eg,
         <em>
          Candida
         </em>
         species). They are usually endogenous bacteria including
         <em>
          Staphylococcus
         </em>
         aureus from the skin and Gram-negative organisms from the gastrointestinal and urinary tract. Isolated neutropenia does not increase the susceptibility to viral or parasitic infection. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Common sites of infection include the oral cavity and mucous membranes, the skin, and perirectal and genital areas. With persistent severe neutropenia, systemic infection occurs associated with bacteremia, and infections of the lung and gastrointestinal tract. Patients receiving broad spectrum antibiotics for two weeks or more while neutropenic are more prone to infection with enteric bacteria and/or fungi, while patients with indwelling catheters or other foreign bodies are more likely to become infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci.
        </p>

         One study evaluated the distribution of organisms for 909 episodes of bacteremia and associated outcome among 799 neutropenic febrile cancer patients [

Infection at a site other than blood alone was observed in 242 episodes; the sites of involvement included lung (about 40 percent), skin and soft tissue (about 30 percent), urinary tract, sinuses and oropharynx, skeletal, enteric tract, meninges, and endocardium [

         </span>
         The first step in the approach to the patient with neutropenia is confirmation of the diagnosis. Review of a Wright-Giemsa stained peripheral blood smear will confirm the reduced number of neutrophils. In all cases in which the white blood cell differential count has been generated by automatic counters, it should be repeated manually. Pseudoneutropenia can occur if blood is left standing for a prolonged period of time and in the presence of paraproteinemia and certain anticoagulants that can cause cellular clumping.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because most acquired cases of neutropenia are transient, monitoring of the blood counts for 8 to 12 weeks is often the best approach if there are no other important clinical factors present. An approach for following such patients is shown in the algorithm (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef66041" href="/z/d/graphic/66041.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). This algorithm works for patients of all ages, including adults. For isolated mild or severe neutropenia in the absence any abnormal clinical findings, obtaining serial blood counts at increasing intervals is the most reasonable approach. We recommend monitoring the sedimentation rate as well. Elevation of the sedimentation rate in the absence of other findings in a neutropenic patient can indicate deep-seated inflammation and may indicate a more serious type of neutropenia. According to this schema, if the patient develops clinical symptoms related to neutropenia or changes in other cell lines in the blood count, a full evaluation should be undertaken.

         ). While bone marrow aspiration is often thought of as the first step, we prefer to delay this test unless there is a clear indication to do it immediately. It is only diagnostic in the case of the progranulocyte maturation arrest seen in the rare case of severe congenital neutropenia or marrow infiltration. Most other disorders require other confirmatory testing. Thus, we prefer to do tests for collagen vascular disease and nutritional disorders first, prior to marrow examination.

        <p>
         Patients who have episodic infections should have twice-weekly measurement of the ANC for at least six weeks to confirm the diagnosis of cyclic neutropenia. Patients with cyclic neutropenia have decreased marrow cellularity one week before the nadir of their neutropenia. This is a rare syndrome and usually associated with symptoms every 21 days and should not be considered unless there is good clinical reason or family history. Bone marrow aspiration is not helpful in this disorder; tests for the ELANE gene are positive over 90 percent of the time. (See

         The clinical management of neutropenic states depends on the cause and degree of the neutropenia, as well as the presence of associated disease states. Patients with severe neutropenia and little marrow reserve may have sepsis, while patients with hypercellular marrow tend to have chronic infections or no infection. (See

         All patients with chronic neutropenia with decreased marrow reserve should receive regular dental care. Chronic gingivitis and recurrent stomatitis can be major sources of morbidity. If neutropenia and gingivitis are present, some experts offer oral antibacterial rinses with

         <a href="#rid39">
          39

         This group includes patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia or bone marrow granulocyte hypoplasia. There are multiple causes of the latter problem, such as aplastic anemia, severe congenital neutropenia, Shwachman-Diamond-Oski syndrome, pure white cell aplasia, large granulocyte lymphocyte syndrome, and drug-induced (toxic-form) agranulocytosis. The general approach involves preventive measures to limit the number and severity of infections and aggressive treatment of infections that occur. Patients should also receive aggressive antibacterial therapy for fever, even in the absence of signs of infection.
        </p>
        <p>
         Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) should be given to patients with decreased marrow reserve and an inadequate response to antibiotics. Treatment with G-CSF is indicated in most cases of severe congenital neutropenia, but is typically not needed for patients with Shwachman-Diamond-Oski syndrome.

         The organisms that cause infections in patients with severe neutropenia usually come from the gastrointestinal tract or skin and can result in the rapid onset of overwhelming sepsis. Thus, febrile patients with neutropenia related to marrow suppression should be treated immediately, following culture of body fluids, with broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics for coverage of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [
         <a href="#rid40">

        </p>
        <p>
         In general, patients with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1000/microL can be managed on an outpatient basis while those with an ANC of &lt;500/microL and marrow aplasia may require inpatient treatment with parenteral antibiotics (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63903" href="/z/d/graphic/63903.html" rel="external">
          table 2

          41,42
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         When a patient first presents with high fever and has a very low ANC, one must assume that the patient is high risk and has inadequate marrow reserve. The schema in the algorithm is an accepted approach to such patients (

          algorithm 2

         It is now recognized that even in post-chemotherapy patients, outpatient management of fever may be acceptable under certain limited circumstances. If there is any question, the patient should be admitted for observation and treatment.

         If the patient is

          table 5
         </a>
         ), they can be managed as any other patient. Unlike the "low risk" group as defined for oncology patients, these patients may not require any antibiotics at all. "Low risk" febrile oncology patients by definition have decreased marrow reserve and therefore are excluded from our low risk group. Otherwise, the oncology risk classification and treatment approaches are useful for non-oncological neutropenia cases as well [

        <p>
         Monitoring of the C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) daily or every other day during acute treatment can be very helpful in these patients, particularly in patients with established severe chronic neutropenia. Often, cultures are negative and treatment is purely empiric. A rapid response can indicate that the appropriate antibiotics have been selected, and poor response or increase in ESR after a response can indicate that a change in antibiotics is necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
         Antibiotics should be continued for several days after the fever has subsided and the sedimentation rate has normalized. If the ANC has risen above 500/microL on several measures, the antibiotics may be discontinued as long as no source of infection is apparent [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40

         If fever and neutropenia persist beyond seven days in the immunosuppressed patient, antifungal treatment should be considered. This approach has support in post-chemotherapy patients [

         Granulocyte transfusions have been given, if available, to patients with Gram-negative sepsis who have not shown a clinical response to antibiotics within 24 to 48 hours. Enthusiasm for the use of granulocyte transfusions has waned due in part to difficulties in procurement, to better antibiotics, and to the use of bone marrow growth factors. However, better methods of procurement and their rapid efficacy makes them a useful part of the armamentarium for treating neutropenic patients with sepsis. (See

         However, G-CSF therapy is not indicated for all causes of neutropenia. It is helpful in patients with neutropenia associated with early myeloid arrest and its use should be reserved for patients with demonstrated infectious morbidity related to the neutropenia. The literature is misleading with respect to the use of G-CSF in neutropenias, as there are a number of reports of patients even with benign neutropenia who were given G-CSF and recovered, when in fact they may have recovered spontaneously despite this treatment.

         Patients with late marrow arrests and a normocellular marrow have an adequate bone marrow supply of neutrophils and usually handle infections reasonably well. Children in whom the diagnosis of chronic benign neutropenia of infancy has been confirmed can be treated as normal children. Less aggressive therapy is also warranted in adults with an adequate bone marrow reserve and a several month history of severe neutropenia without serious infection. However, the subsequent course is not known when these patients are first encountered. As a result, they should initially be treated as other patients with severe forms of neutropenia.

         grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10

         Neutropenia is defined by ANC &lt;1500/microL in most populations. However, individuals of African descent, among others, may have ANC &lt;1500/microL without recurrent or severe infections. A common reason for this normal variant is called Duffy-null associated neutrophil count (DANC; formerly called benign ethnic neutropenia or constitutional neutropenia), which is associated with homozygous polymorphism of the Duffy red blood cell antigen.

         <strong>
          Overview
         </strong>
         – A peripheral blood WBC count samples the smallest compartment of neutrophils and does not accurately reflect the body's capacity to deliver neutrophils to tissues and protect against bacterial infection. Examination of the bone marrow, which contains most of the body's neutrophils, can determine this most effectively. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Propensity to infection and significance of neutropenia'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Etiology
         </strong>
         – Neutropenia can be either acquired or congenital (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69186" href="/z/d/graphic/69186.html" rel="external">
          table 6
         </a>
         ). Infection, drugs, and immune disorders are the most common acquired causes while congenital causes are rare and confined mostly to infants and children. The danger to the patient depends on the etiology, bone marrow status (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71724" href="/z/d/graphic/71724.html" rel="external">
          table 5
         </a>
         ), and the ANC (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63903" href="/z/d/graphic/63903.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Classification and etiology of isolated neutropenia'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical presentation'

         <strong>
          Diagnosis and management
         </strong>
         – The approach to the subject with isolated neutropenia is shown in the algorithm (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef66041" href="/z/d/graphic/66041.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Management depends on the cause of the neutropenia and includes the prevention of infection, regular dental care, antibacterial mouthwashes, aggressive antibacterial therapy for fever, and the judicious use of myeloid growth factors in selected patients with decreased marrow reserve. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnostic approach'
