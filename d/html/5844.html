For the hereditary causes, the enlarged thyroid gland, and the thyroid dysfunction that often accompanies it, may not be evident at birth.</p><p>Once a goiter is detected, the diagnostic evaluation is aimed at assessing thyroid function and identifying the underlying cause. Both of these factors will determine management.</p><p>This topic review will consider congenital goiters in newborns and infants.

It then migrates down to its normal location over the thyroid cartilage by 8 to 10 weeks of gestation. This path of migration is marked by the thyroglossal duct, which normally involutes.</p><p>Thyroid volume in term neonates is approximately 0.9±0.2 mL (mean±standard deviation [SD]), as measured by ultrasonography in 68 term neonates in Chicago [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], and increases with age and body surface area. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/120705.html" rel="external">"Approach to acquired goiter in children and adolescents", section on 'Thyroid volume in healthy children and adolescents'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1224569721"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most cases of congenital goiter are identified after a neonate is detected to have hypothyroidism by newborn screening tests. A goiter may be visible or palpable or, in some cases, only discovered after ultrasonography. Clinically apparent goiters are most commonly associated with one of the inborn errors of thyroid hormone production (dyshormonogenesis). (See <a class="local">'Inborn errors of thyroid hormone production'</a> below.)</p><p>Other cases may be identified on examination of an infant born to a mother with thyroid disease (either Graves disease or autoimmune thyroiditis). Occasionally, a goiter may be detected incidentally by routine fetal ultrasonography.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3636582417"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Congenital goiter can be caused by a wide range of disorders, including effects from transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies or goitrogens, genetic disorders, congenital anomalies, or iodine excess or deficiency (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71540" href="/z/d/graphic/71540.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The etiology usually can be determined by a combination of history, focused laboratory testing for the infant's thyroid function and maternal antibodies, and thyroid ultrasound. For selected patients, further testing may be needed to establish the etiology of the goiter.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H313614588"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clues to the cause of congenital goiter and to thyroid function often are found on a careful history:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Maternal Graves disease</strong> – A current or past history of maternal Graves disease suggests that the infant's goiter may be caused by one of two mechanisms:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The goiter may be caused by transplacental passage of maternal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor-stimulating antibodies. Such antibodies may persist for years even though the maternal hyperthyroidism underwent definitive treatment in the past, by either radioactive iodine ablation or thyroidectomy. Affected newborns will have clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism, known as neonatal Graves disease. (See <a class="local">'Neonatal Graves disease'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If the mother's Graves disease was treated with antithyroid drugs during the pregnancy, thyroid function represents a balance of the TSH receptor-stimulating antibody and effects of the maternal antithyroid drug. If the baby is hypothyroid, the antithyroid drug effect is predominant. If the infant is hyperthyroid, the TSH receptor-stimulating effect is predominant. (See <a class="local">'Prenatal antithyroid drug treatment'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Maternal autoimmune thyroid disease</strong> – If the mother has autoimmune thyroid disease, which is the most common cause of acquired hypothyroidism, the infant's goiter may be caused by transplacental passage of a TSH receptor antibody. In this setting, the infant's goiter is caused by a TSH receptor-stimulating antibody, or a combination of a TSH receptor-stimulating and -blocking antibody, where the stimulating antibody predominates, causing hyperthyroidism in the infant [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Production of only a TSH receptor-blocking antibody would be associated with hypothyroidism and a small or normal-sized gland but not a goiter [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. There also may be a history of congenital goiter with transient hypothyroidism in older (or occasionally, twin) siblings. (See <a class="local">'Neonatal Graves disease'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Goiter or thyroid disease in siblings</strong> – If there is no history of maternal thyroid disease (and if maternal autoimmune thyroid disease has been excluded by laboratory testing), the presence of goiter or thyroid disease in an older (or twin) sibling suggests a heritable disorder:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hypothyroidism in the infant or older siblings suggests the possibility of a heritable inborn error of thyroid hormone production (dyshormonogenesis).

(See <a class="local">'Other causes'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Iodine exposure</strong> – The history should explore the possibility of excessive iodine exposure or ingestion, either by the mother during her pregnancy or to the neonate in the first few weeks of life. Maternal iodine exposure may occur with drugs such as <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12587" href="/z/d/drug information/12587.html" rel="external">amiodarone</a>, health food supplements, or by diagnostic studies using radiocontrast agents containing iodine. A unique form of excess iodine ingestion may occur in mothers who consume seaweed soup and are breastfeeding their newborn infants. (See <a class="local">'Iodine excess'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1418679857"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most causes of congenital goiter result in a diffusely enlarged, symmetrical gland. If the thyroid enlargement is unilateral, this may represent thyroid hemiagenesis or, rarely, a tumor such as a teratoma. (See <a class="local">'Thyroid hemiagenesis'</a> below and <a class="local">'Thyroid neoplasm'</a> below.)</p><p>In neonates with hypothyroidism, the majority have no signs or symptoms other than goiter. More severely hypothyroid newborns may exhibit jaundice, myxedematous facies, macroglossia, and umbilical hernia. Infants born in regions of the world that lack newborn screening programs typically present with symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism that develop over the first few months of life. Infants born to mothers with severe iodine deficiency will manifest features of "endemic cretinism," including coarse facial features with macroglossia, wide sutures and large fontanels, distended abdomen with umbilical hernia, cutis marmorata, and sluggish reflexes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5836.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and detection of congenital hypothyroidism", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>In neonates with hyperthyroidism, clinical manifestations may include irritability, hyperphagia, poor weight gain, tachycardia, small anterior fontanel, hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly, and eye findings such as stare, exophthalmos, and lid lag. These symptoms may be present at birth or may develop during the first days or weeks of life, depending on the presence and timing of maternal antithyroid drug treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5839.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of neonatal Graves disease", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2179063563"><span class="h2">Initial testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Because clinical manifestations of either hyper- or hypothyroidism may be subtle or slow to develop, tests of thyroid function should be performed in all infants with congenital goiter.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thyroid function tests</strong> – Initial testing should include measurement of serum TSH and free thyroxine (T4). If there is a clinical suspicion of hyperthyroidism, measurement of serum total triiodothyronine (T3) should be included as it may be the first thyroid hormone to be elevated and it often is proportionally more elevated than the free T4. It is important to interpret thyroid test results using age-appropriate reference intervals. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5836.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and detection of congenital hypothyroidism", section on 'Serum tests of thyroid function'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thyroid receptor antibody tests</strong> – Selection of antibody tests depends on the results of the infant's thyroid function tests, sometimes also guided by a history of a maternal thyroid disorder:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Hypothyroid infant</strong> – If the infant is hypothyroid, the goiter usually is the result of maternal antithyroid drugs, one of the inborn errors of thyroid hormone metabolism, or maternal excess iodine ingestion. Measurement of TSH receptor-stimulating antibodies can be deferred, pending periodic monitoring of thyroid function in the neonate. (See <a class="local">'Hypothyroid infant (TSH elevated, free T4 low or normal)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">If the infant develops hyperthyroidism, measure TSH receptor-stimulating antibodies, as described below.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Hyperthyroid infant</strong> – If the infant is hyperthyroid, measure TSH receptor-stimulating antibodies in the mother and/or infant. This can be accomplished by measurement of either thyrotropin-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI; a functional bioassay) or thyrotropin-binding inhibitor immunoglobulins (TBII; a competitive inhibition-binding assay). TBII is sometimes labeled TRAb.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Maternal TSH receptor-stimulating antibodies are the most common cause of neonatal hyperthyroidism. Measurement of these antibodies in the infant and/or mother is particularly important if the mother has a history of Graves disease (current or past) but is worthwhile for all hyperthyroid infants since maternal Graves disease may not be recognized. For example, some women with a prior diagnosis of Graves disease who received definitive therapy may have indefinite persistence of TSH-receptor antibodies despite themselves being cured. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5839.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of neonatal Graves disease", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ultrasonography</strong> – We recommend that ultrasonography be performed in each case of congenital goiter. Ultrasonography will provide more accurate information than the physical examination about the location, shape, and size (transverse, depth, and longitudinal diameter) of each lobe of the thyroid gland, and the procedure is noninvasive and readily available. The size of the gland may provide a clue as to the etiology. As an example, hyperplasia without a history of a maternal thyroid disorder suggests a form of dyshormonogenesis. For some disorders, such as thyroid hemiagenesis, ultrasonographic findings are the only abnormality and can establish the diagnosis.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1026838437"><span class="h2">Subsequent evaluation for selected patients</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tests of iodine status</strong> – Tests of iodine status should be performed if excessive iodine exposure is suspected from the history and may also be performed if the infant has otherwise unexplained hypothyroidism. The most accurate test to confirm excess iodine exposure is measurement of 24-hour urinary iodine in the mother and/or infant. Measurement of a spot urine iodine and creatinine, yielding an iodine-to-creatinine ratio, or sometimes measurement of serum iodine levels, may also be used to confirm goiter due to excess iodine exposure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5836.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and detection of congenital hypothyroidism", section on 'Urinary iodine concentration'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Radionuclide uptake and scan</strong> – Radionuclide studies may be performed if an inborn error of thyroid hormone production (dyshormonogenesis) is suspected. This type of disorder should be suspected in a hypothyroid infant in whom other causes of hypothyroidism (antithyroid drugs, maternal TSH receptor-blocking antibodies, and iodine excess or deficiency) have been excluded. Among infants with congenital hypothyroidism, those with dyshormonogenesis are particularly likely to present with goiter. For most inborn errors of thyroid hormone production, radionuclide uptake is increased (best quantitated using iodine-123), except in the case of a mutation in the sodium-iodide symporter gene (<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.omim.org%2Fentry%2F601843&amp;token=tEpDslnpc0F0kICl%2Fz7sFUfdC7kgbt7z3sRDeh8bdyp%2BYdVvC7vNNF8IkLGJPFzk&amp;TOPIC_ID=5844" target="_blank"><i>SLC5A5</i></a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5836.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and detection of congenital hypothyroidism", section on 'Thyroid radionuclide uptake and scan'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Molecular testing</strong> – If the infant has hypothyroidism and an inborn error of thyroid hormone production (dyshormonogenesis) is suspected, molecular testing may be performed to confirm the specific diagnosis. Such information may facilitate genetic counseling, including recurrence risk in future siblings, but rarely affects the management of the patient. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5836.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and detection of congenital hypothyroidism", section on 'Disorders of thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If the infant has hyperthyroidism, the most likely cause is neonatal Graves disease. In the rare case where there is no evidence of Graves disease (ie, negative TSH receptor-stimulating antibodies), the possibility of either an activating mutation of the TSH receptor or McCune-Albright syndrome should be considered. In such cases, specific molecular testing of the TSH receptor gene or the G protein stimulatory alpha subunit gene from an affected tissue, respectively, may confirm one of these diagnoses. (See <a class="local">'Other causes'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2221477297"><span class="h1">ESTABLISHING THE ETIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) result narrows the diagnostic possibilities to those that cause hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or euthyroid goiter. The results of the history and antibody tests can establish the diagnosis in most cases (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71540" href="/z/d/graphic/71540.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Management generally depends upon thyroid function and identification of the underlying cause. For the hereditary causes, the enlarged thyroid gland, and the thyroid dysfunction that often accompanies it, may not be evident at birth.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1886679002"><span class="h2">Hypothyroid infant (TSH elevated, free T4 low or normal)</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4037132805"><span class="h3">Prenatal antithyroid drug treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In infants with prenatal exposure to antithyroid drugs due to maternal Graves disease, congenital goiter and hypothyroidism are most likely the result of transplacental passage of the antithyroid drugs. The antithyroid drugs <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12745" href="/z/d/drug information/12745.html" rel="external">propylthiouracil</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12592" href="/z/d/drug information/12592.html" rel="external">methimazole</a>, and carbimazole all cross the placenta and can cause fetal hypothyroidism and goiter.</p><p>For most of these infants, the hypothyroidism resolves by 7 to 10 days of life as the antithyroid drug is metabolized and excreted. Thyroid function should be followed at weekly intervals to confirm that it normalizes. This pattern confirms that the transient goiter and hypothyroidism were caused by the maternal antithyroid drugs. Because thyroid function normalizes in the vast majority of cases by two weeks of age, thyroid hormone treatment is not necessary. Once thyroid function normalizes, we recommend checking TSH and free thyroxine (T4) for another two weeks to assess for possible transition to hyperthyroidism (uncommon).</p><p>Occasionally, the infant transitions to hyperthyroidism during the first few days or weeks of life as the antithyroid drug is excreted. When this occurs, it is usually caused by maternal TSH receptor-stimulating antibodies, measurement of which will confirm this etiology (neonatal Graves disease) and distinguish it from other causes of neonatal hyperthyroidism.

These disorders can be distinguished by further history and testing for these disorders. (See <a class="local">'Subsequent evaluation for selected patients'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4016090904"><span class="h4">Inborn errors of thyroid hormone production</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An inborn error of thyroid hormone production (dyshormonogenesis) accounts for approximately 10 to 15 percent of cases of severe congenital hypothyroidism, usually with goiter. These disorders are usually first detected by newborn screening for congenital hypothyroidism [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].

The presence of goiter in affected infants is variable; when goiter is present, it may be detected by physical examination or by ultrasonography. The infant is typically hyperthyroid at birth. However, if the mother's Graves disease was treated with antithyroid drugs during the pregnancy, the infant may be either hyperthyroid or hypothyroid, depending on the balance of the TSH receptor-stimulating antibody and thyroid-suppressing effects of the thionamide drug.
