This topic reviews the etiologies of abdominal pain in adults. The emergency and non-urgent evaluation of abdominal pain of adults discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/290.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the adult with nontraumatic abdominal or flank pain in the emergency department"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6862.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain"</a>.)</p><p>Abdominal pain in pregnant and postpartum individuals is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4807.html" rel="external">"Approach to acute abdominal/pelvic pain in pregnant and postpartum patients"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF ABDOMINAL PAIN</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Neurologic basis for abdominal pain</strong> – Pain receptors in the abdomen respond to mechanical and chemical stimuli. Stretch is the principal mechanical stimulus involved in visceral nociception, although distention, contraction, traction, compression, and torsion are also perceived [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Visceral receptors responsible for these sensations are located on serosal surfaces, within the mesentery, and within the walls of hollow viscera. Visceral mucosal receptors respond primarily to chemical stimuli, while other visceral nociceptors respond to chemical or mechanical stimuli.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The events responsible for the perception of abdominal pain are not completely understood, but depend upon the type of stimulus and the interpretation of visceral nociceptive inputs in the central nervous system. As an example, the gastric mucosa is insensitive to pressure or chemical stimuli. However, in the presence of inflammation, these same stimuli can cause pain [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The threshold for perceiving pain may vary among individuals and in certain diseases. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/116196.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of chronic non-cancer pain in adults", section on 'Definition of pain'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Localization</strong> – The type and density of visceral afferent nerves makes the localization of visceral pain imprecise. However, a few general rules are useful:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Most digestive tract pain is perceived in the midline because of bilaterally symmetric innervation [<a href="#rid1">1,3</a>]. Pain that is clearly lateralized most likely arises from the ipsilateral kidney, ureter, ovary, or somatically innervated structures, which have predominantly unilateral innervation. Exceptions to this rule include the gallbladder and ascending and descending colons which, although bilaterally innervated, have predominant innervation located on their ipsilateral sides.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Visceral pain is perceived in the spinal segment at which the visceral afferent nerves enter the spinal cord [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. As an example, afferent nerves mediating pain arising from the small intestine enter the spinal cord between T8 to L1. Thus, distension of the small intestine is usually perceived in the periumbilical region.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Referred pain</strong> – Pain originating in the viscera may sometimes be perceived as originating from a site distant from the affected organ  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61375" href="/d/graphic/61375.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5-7</a>]. Referred pain is usually located in the cutaneous dermatomes sharing the same spinal cord level as the visceral inputs. As an example, nociceptive inputs from the gallbladder enter the spinal cord at T5 to T10. Thus, pain from an inflamed gallbladder may be perceived in the scapula  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61375" href="/d/graphic/61375.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The quality of referred pain is aching and perceived to be near the surface of the body. In addition to pain, two other correlates of referred pain can be detected: skin hyperalgesia and increased muscle tone of the abdominal wall (which accounts for the abdominal wall rigidity sometimes observed in patients with an acute abdomen).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">UPPER ABDOMINAL PAIN SYNDROMES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Upper abdominal pain syndromes typically have characteristic locations: right upper quadrant pain  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106199" href="/d/graphic/106199.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), epigastric pain  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106200" href="/d/graphic/106200.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), or left upper quadrant pain  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106201" href="/d/graphic/106201.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H629460690"><span class="h2">Right upper quadrant pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Biliary and hepatic etiologies cause right upper quadrant pain syndromes.</p><p>Biliary etiologies include  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106199" href="/d/graphic/106199.html" rel="external">table 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gallstones</strong> – Symptoms of biliary colic classically include an intense, dull discomfort located in the right upper quadrant, epigastrium, or (less often) substernal area that may radiate to the back (particularly the right shoulder blade). Patients may have associated nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis. The pain generally lasts at least 30 minutes, plateauing within an hour. Patients have an unremarkable abdominal examination. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/654.html" rel="external">"Overview of gallstone disease in adults", section on 'Biliary colic'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acute cholecystitis</strong> – The clinical manifestations of acute cholecystitis include prolonged (more than four to six hours), steady, severe right upper quadrant or epigastric pain, fever, abdominal guarding, a positive Murphy's sign, and leukocytosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/666.html" rel="external">"Acute calculous cholecystitis: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acute cholangitis</strong> – Acute cholangitis occurs when a stone becomes impacted in the biliary or hepatic ducts, causing dilation of the obstructed duct and bacterial superinfection. It is characterized by fever, jaundice, and abdominal pain, although this classic triad (known as Charcot's triad) occurs in only 50 to 75 percent of cases [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The abdominal pain is typically vague and located in the right upper quadrant. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/658.html" rel="external">"Acute cholangitis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction</strong> – Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction can be a cause of biliary pain in the absence of gallstones or biliary inflammation. Typically the pain is located in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium and lasts from 30 minutes to several hours. </p><p></p><p>Hepatic etiologies include  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106199" href="/d/graphic/106199.html" rel="external">table 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hepatitis</strong> – Patients with acute hepatitis (eg, from hepatitis A, alcohol, or medications) may have fatigue, malaise, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia in addition to right upper quadrant pain. Other symptoms include jaundice, dark urine, and light colored stools. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2692.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis A virus infection in adults: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/86934.html" rel="external">"Alcoholic hepatitis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Signs and symptoms'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3571.html" rel="external">"Drug-induced liver injury", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Perihepatitis</strong> – The Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome, or perihepatitis, is a cause of right upper quadrant pain in young females with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). It occurs in approximately 10 percent of patients with acute PID. It is characterized by right upper quadrant pain with a distinct pleuritic component, sometimes referred to the right shoulder. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7581.html" rel="external">"Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Perihepatitis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Liver abscess</strong> – Liver abscess is the most common type of visceral abscess. Patients generally present with fever and abdominal pain. Risk factors include diabetes, underlying hepatobiliary or pancreatic disease, or liver transplant. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2680.html" rel="external">"Pyogenic liver abscess", section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2680.html" rel="external">"Pyogenic liver abscess", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Budd-Chiari syndrome</strong> – Budd-Chiari syndrome is technically defined as hepatic venous outflow tract obstruction, independent of the level or mechanism of obstruction, provided the obstruction is not due to cardiac disease, pericardial disease, or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (veno-occlusive disease). As commonly used, the Budd-Chiari syndrome implies thrombosis of the hepatic veins and/or the intrahepatic or suprahepatic inferior vena cava. Symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, abdominal distention (from ascites), lower extremity edema, jaundice, gastrointestinal bleeding, and/or hepatic encephalopathy. There are a variety of causes, many of which are related to an underlying prothrombotic or hypercoagulable state  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef130488" href="/d/graphic/130488.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3562.html" rel="external">"Budd-Chiari syndrome: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3624.html" rel="external">"Etiology of the Budd-Chiari syndrome", section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Portal vein thrombosis</strong> – Clinical manifestations of portal vein thrombosis vary depending on the extent of obstruction as well as the speed of development (acute or chronic). It is common in patients with cirrhosis and is associated with the severity of liver disease. Patients may be asymptomatic or have abdominal pain, dyspepsia, or gastrointestinal bleeding. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3579.html" rel="external">"Acute portal vein thrombosis in adults: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88014.html" rel="external">"Chronic portal vein thrombosis in adults: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H629460696"><span class="h2">Epigastric pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pancreatic and gastric etiologies often cause epigastric pain  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106200" href="/d/graphic/106200.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acute myocardial infarction</strong> – Epigastric pain can be the presenting symptom of an acute myocardial infarction. Patients may have associated shortness of breath or exertional symptoms. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1472.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with suspected angina pectoris"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pancreatitis</strong> – Both acute and chronic pancreatitis are associated with abdominal pain that often radiates to the back. Most patients with acute pancreatitis have acute onset of persistent, severe epigastric pain. The pain is steady and may be in the mid-epigastrium, right upper quadrant, diffuse, or, infrequently, confined to the left side. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5652.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute pancreatitis", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The two primary clinical manifestations of chronic pancreatitis are epigastric pain and pancreatic insufficiency. The pain is typically epigastric, is occasionally associated with nausea and vomiting, and may be partially relieved by sitting upright or leaning forward. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5649.html" rel="external">"Chronic pancreatitis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis in adults", section on 'Abdominal pain'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Peptic ulcer disease</strong> – Upper abdominal pain or discomfort is the most prominent symptom in patients with peptic ulcers. Patients most often have epigastric pain, but occasionally the discomfort localizes to one side. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/26.html" rel="external">"Peptic ulcer disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gastroesophageal reflux disease</strong> – Most patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) complain of heartburn, regurgitation, and dysphagia. However, some patients may also complain of epigastric and/or chest pain. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2265.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux in adults", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gastritis/gastropathy</strong> – Gastritis<strong> </strong>refers to inflammation in the lining of the stomach.<strong> </strong>Gastritis is predominantly an inflammatory process, while the term gastropathy denotes a gastric mucosal disorder with minimal to no inflammation. Acute gastropathy often presents with abdominal discomfort/pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and hematemesis. Gastropathy may be caused by a variety of etiologies including alcohol and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/36.html" rel="external">"Acute hemorrhagic erosive gastropathy and reactive gastropathy", section on 'Acute hemorrhagic erosive gastropathy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8.html" rel="external">"NSAIDs (including aspirin): Pathogenesis and risk factors for gastroduodenal toxicity", section on 'COX-1 mediated NSAID injury'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Functional dyspepsia</strong> – Functional dyspepsia is defined as the presence of one or more of the following symptoms: postprandial fullness, early satiation, and epigastric pain or burning, with no evidence of structural disease (including at upper endoscopy) to explain the symptoms. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/19.html" rel="external">"Functional dyspepsia in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gastroparesis </strong>–<strong> </strong>Patients with gastroparesis can present with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, early satiety, postprandial fullness, bloating, and, in severe cases, weight loss. The most common causes are idiopathic, diabetic, or postsurgical  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52708" href="/d/graphic/52708.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2640.html" rel="external">"Gastroparesis: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H629461024"><span class="h2">Left upper quadrant pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Left upper quadrant pain is often related to the spleen  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106201" href="/d/graphic/106201.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Splenomegaly</strong> – Splenomegaly can cause left upper quadrant pain or discomfort, referred pain to the left shoulder, and/or early satiety. Splenomegaly has multiple causes  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69397" href="/d/graphic/69397.html" rel="external">table 5</a>).

Splenic infarction is associated with a variety of underlying conditions (eg, hypercoagulable state, embolic disease from atrial fibrillation, conditions associated with splenomegaly). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7134.html" rel="external">"Splenomegaly and other splenic disorders in adults", section on 'Abscess and infarction'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Splenic abscess</strong> – Splenic abscesses are uncommon and typically are associated with fever and tenderness in the left upper quadrant.

The patient may complain of left upper abdominal, left chest wall, or left shoulder pain (ie, Kehr's sign). Kehr's sign is pain referred to the left shoulder that worsens with inspiration and is due to irritation of the phrenic nerve from blood adjacent to the left hemidiaphragm.
