Severe generalized edema is known as anasarca. More localized interstitial fluid collections include ascites and pleural effusions.</p><p>The diagnostic approach to edema is based upon a thoughtful approach to the pathogenesis of its formation. Once a diagnosis is established, specific treatment of the underlying disorder can be given. If specific therapy is not available, general treatment such as optimization of fluid management can be considered.</p><p>The evaluation and management of edema in children will be presented in this topic review. The pathogenesis and etiology of edema in children are discussed separately.

A more detailed discussion on the etiology based on the pathogenesis of the edema is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6096.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology and etiology of edema in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Identify those conditions that are potentially life-threatening or have serious medical consequences, although most causes of edema are self-limiting disorders. Potentially life-threatening or serious medical disorders include anaphylaxis, hereditary angioedema with laryngeal involvement, decreased cardiac output (especially as a result of myocarditis or restrictive pericarditis), and liver and kidney disease.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The evaluation of a child with edema begins with a thorough history. The following should be included:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Edema location.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Establish time course (age at onset and duration of symptoms) to distinguish an acquired condition from a congenital condition. For example, edema of the hands and feet of a newborn girl is suggestive of Turner syndrome.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Associated complaints that suggest systemic disease or major organ dysfunction. As an example, shortness of breath suggests heart failure and/or pulmonary edema.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Additional concurrent illnesses or signs. A streptococcal infection one to three weeks earlier may point to poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Past medical and family history. A family history of recurrent angioedema, for example, may suggest hereditary angioedema as a possible diagnosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Weight gain and tight-fitting clothes and shoes. Such changes may have been ignored by parents/caregivers as they were thought to be normal signs of growth, rather than the onset of edema because of nephrosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of allergies and current medications. Allergies and adverse reaction to certain medications can present as angioedema in childhood. As an example, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are kininase inhibitors that result in high bradykinin levels and increased vascular permeability. ACE inhibitors are a common cause of drug-induced bradykinin-mediated angioedema that is manifested by swelling of the lips, tongue, pharynx, and larynx. Angioedema has also been seen with the use of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12829" href="/d/drug information/12829.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13371" href="/d/drug information/13371.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a>. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8099.html" rel="external">"An overview of angioedema: Pathogenesis and causes", section on 'ACE inhibitors'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8099.html" rel="external">"An overview of angioedema: Pathogenesis and causes", section on 'Aspirin and NSAIDs'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3800711353"><span class="h3">General assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>General assessment includes: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Measuring the child's growth parameters.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fully evaluating the cardiovascular system, including vital signs. Findings of tachycardia, tachypnea, gallop, rales, or hepatomegaly are seen in patients with heart failure, whereas tachypnea and rales alone may be indicative of pulmonary edema, which can be either cardiogenic or noncardiogenic. Increased blood pressure (BP) levels may reflect hypervolemia resulting from acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD) or glomerulonephritis. BP measurements are interpreted in relation to the patient's age, sex, and height percentile  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63856" href="/d/graphic/63856.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52646" href="/d/graphic/52646.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).

Because cellulitis also can manifest with regional edema, assessment of the patient for fever and local signs of inflammation is important. If the edema is localized to the face, the child also should be carefully evaluated for concurrent airway involvement, which can be life-threatening.</p><p></p><p>In addition, determine the presence of peripheral edema by the presence of pitting after pressure is applied to the edematous area. Pitting reflects movement of the excess interstitial water in response to pressure. Because peripheral edema locates preferentially in dependent areas, it is primarily found in the lower extremities of ambulatory patients and over the sacrum in patients at bed rest.</p><p>When the edema is nonpitting, lymphedema (which may also be associated with pitting edema) or pretibial myxedema should be considered. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/755.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of peripheral lymphedema"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7826.html" rel="external">"Pretibial myxedema (thyroid dermopathy) in autoimmune thyroid disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Clues from constellations of symptoms and signs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The child with edema must be assessed for associated symptoms or other medical conditions that may help suggest the underlying etiology.

Dipstick testing principally detects albumin. The finding of a markedly positive dipstick for protein in combination with hypoalbuminemia and clinical edema is virtually diagnostic of the nephrotic syndrome. False-positive results may be obtained with very alkaline or concentrated urines, or when urine is contaminated by some antiseptic agents (such as <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13146" href="/d/drug information/13146.html" rel="external">chlorhexidine</a> or benzalkonium chloride).

A sodium-restricted diet is tailored to provide the child with approximately 2 to 3 mEq of sodium/kg per day, the amount of sodium required for a growing child. A 10 kg child should therefore receive between 20 to 30 mEq of sodium per day or 460 to 690 mg of sodium per day. This strategy is continued up to a maximum sodium intake of 2000 mg/day in larger children.</p><p>Fluid restriction can be considered in patients with generalized edema, but must be done cautiously in patients with reduced effective circulating blood volume of noncardiac origin. This includes children with nephrotic syndrome and hepatic cirrhosis. Fluid limitations are based on specific patient characteristics and underlying cause. Patients with edema associated with the nephrotic syndrome who are being managed in the outpatient setting should be treated with sodium restriction, but not fluid restriction. Fluid restriction may result in a compromised intravascular volume, which could exacerbate the thrombotic tendency of this disorder [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19"><span class="h3">Diuretics</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children with edema and an associated expanded intravascular volume may be candidates for diuretic therapy, such as in heart failure and kidney failure. However, when diuretics are utilized in patients with either appropriate or depleted intravascular volume, there is a risk of both precipitating acute kidney injury and decreasing perfusion to peripheral tissues. As a result, creatinine and BUN levels should be monitored. In general, a significant decrease in tissue perfusion secondary to excessive diuresis and inadequate mobilization of peripheral edema can be detected simply by an otherwise unexplained rise in the BUN. A stable BUN and creatinine implies that perfusion to the kidneys (and therefore to other organs) is being well maintained and that the diuresis can be continued if the patient is still edematous.</p><p>As a result, the use of diuretics varies based on the clinical setting and should be avoided or used cautiously in children with intravascular depletion. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Heart failure – Children with heart failure with increased hydrostatic pressure and hypervolemia due to water and sodium retention may benefit from fluid removal. This can be achieved with the use of loop diuretics (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13329" href="/d/drug information/13329.html" rel="external">furosemide</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14520.html" rel="external">"Heart failure in children: Management", section on 'Diuretics'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Kidney disease – Diuretics also are useful in the treatment of edema resulting from kidney dysfunction with acute glomerulonephritis and acute or chronic kidney failure due to hypervolemia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In the child with nephrotic syndrome, diuretic therapy should be used sparingly and with great caution, as these children typically are hypoalbuminemic and intravascularly volume depleted. Thus, aggressive diuresis may lead to further intravascular volume depletion, thereby possibly precipitating acute kidney injury (AKI) and increasing the risk of thrombosis in this already susceptible group of patients [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. In children with nephrotic syndrome, diuretics should be administered with intravenous albumin as albumin raises the intravascular oncotic pressure and thereby protects the intravascular compartment against volume contraction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3047.html" rel="external">"Acute kidney injury (AKI) in minimal change disease and other forms of nephrotic syndrome"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6113.html" rel="external">"Symptomatic management of nephrotic syndrome in children", section on 'Diuretics'</a> and <a class="local">'Intravenous albumin infusion'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Liver disease – Diuretics need to be used cautiously in children with ascites due to cirrhosis as these children have a reduced effective circulatory volume. Aggressive diuresis of these patients may precipitate hepatorenal syndrome and overt kidney failure [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. The clinician must therefore closely monitor the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine concentration, as any unexplained deterioration of kidney function would imply an untoward effect on kidney blood flow. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In children with liver dysfunction, loop diuretics can induce a hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, which can lead to increased ammonia production by the kidney tubules and result in a hepatic coma in patients with early hepatic encephalopathy [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Thus, in the child with cirrhotic ascites, it is probably most prudent to use sodium restriction and possibly add <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12803" href="/d/drug information/12803.html" rel="external">spironolactone</a> to avoid the risks of hypokalemia. Spironolactone also is occasionally combined with loop diuretics in this setting [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. If active diuresis is needed, loop diuretics can be administered with intravenous albumin. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83172.html" rel="external">"Acute liver failure in children: Management, complications, and outcomes", section on 'Ascites'</a> and <a class="local">'Sodium and fluid restriction'</a> above and <a class="local">'Intravenous albumin infusion'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lymphedema – Diuretics are usually of little benefit in chronic lymphedema resulting from obstruction and may promote the development of volume depletion.
