         Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a disorder characterized by airway collapse during sleep, leading to complete or partial episodes of breathing cessation. Positive airway pressure (PAP) is the first-line treatment for OSA [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Despite advancing technology, poor tolerance and low adherence to PAP therapy remains a major barrier, leaving many patients untreated [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. For patients with OSA who cannot tolerate or decline PAP, hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HNS) is being increasingly used as a therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment of OSA using HNS is discussed in this topic. Treatment of OSA and management of nonadherence to PAP therapy are discussed separately. (See

         During sleep, HNS activates upper airway muscles, predominantly the genioglossus muscle, to produce tongue protrusion and airway opening at several levels by increasing retropalatal, retroglossal, and retroepiglottic airway space. Retropalatal opening is thought to be secondary to anterior movement of the palatoglossus muscle, which is anchored to the musculature of the tongue. Epiglottic engagement and hypopharyngeal expansion is likely secondary to incorporation of the C1 nerve branch, which innervates the geniohyoid muscle.
        </p>
        <p>
         To avoid muscle fatigue, the device uses phasic stimulation wherein neurostimulation only occurs at the initiation of each breath.
        </p>
        <p>
         Implantation of the device and long-term effects of stimulation do not alter airway anatomy or physiology; thus, therapy can be discontinued without sequelae.

         HNS is an option for patients with moderate to severe OSA who are unable to use or benefit from positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. Other treatment options include positional or weight loss therapy; mandibular advancement devices; ablative and reconstructive surgery for the oropharynx, hypopharynx, epiglottis, and base of tongue; or maxillomandibular advancement.

         HNS therapy is not recommended for patients with mild OSA (AHI &lt;15 events per hour). Since the major trial that demonstrated benefit was conducted in patients with a BMI &lt;32 kg/m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         , most United States commercial insurances require a BMI &lt;32 kg/m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         . However, limited clinical evidence supports benefit in patients with BMI &lt;35 kg/m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         such that Medicare coverage and coverage in Europe extends to patients with BMI &lt;35 kg/m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. In 2023, the FDA expanded indications to AHI &lt;100 events per hour and BMI to &lt;40 kg/m
         <sup>

         </sup>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Data to support HNS are largely derived from the Stimulation Therapy for Apnea Reduction (STAR) trial, which demonstrated efficacy of HNS in select patients with OSA [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8

         ] and Adherence and Outcome of Upper Airway Stimulation for the OSA International Registry (ADHERE) global registry.

         <span class="glyph">

         The STAR trial was a prospective cohort study that used HNS to treat 126 patients with moderate to severe OSA in whom PAP had failed or was not tolerated [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. At 12 months following HNS, the AHI decreased from 29.3 to 9 events per hour and the oxygen desaturation index decreased from 25.4 to 7.4 events per hour. Approximately two-thirds had a successful outcome (defined as a reduction of AHI by 50 percent to below 20 events per hour). Subjective measures, including the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (
         <a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/13440.html" rel="external">
          calculator 1
         </a>
         ) and the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, showed clinically significant improvement from baseline. Serious adverse events occurred at a rate of less than 2 percent. Randomized therapy withdrawal showed recurrence of symptoms and evidence of at least moderate OSA.

         Multiple single-center studies and one multicenter study following the STAR trial have also demonstrated similar effectiveness of HNS therapy in the clinical (eg, improved blood pressure control) and real-world settings [
         <a href="#rid9">

         Additional data from ADHERE has prompted the FDA to expand approval to include patients with an AHI between 65 and 100 events per hour and patients with a BMI between 35 and 40 kg/m
         <sup>
          2

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Data also suggest that the benefit is long lasting, provided patients adhere to therapy. Follow-up of the STAR trial at 60 months demonstrated persistent reduction in AHI with HNS therapy [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,17-20
         </a>
         ]. The ADHERE registry reported an average therapy compliance of approximately 5.6 hours per night and AHI reduction from 36 to 14.5 events per hour at one to two years [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]; at nine years, there was a 50 percent reduction in the AHI from baseline to the latest follow-up and the mean therapy use was 7.2 hours/night, although only a small number of patients were assessed [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients also subjectively report benefit. The ADHERE registry reported that 92 percent of patients had a better experience than with PAP therapy [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with apnea-predominant OSA appear to respond similarly to patients who have hypopnea-predominant OSA [

         When assessing patients for HNS therapy, additional considerations should be taken into account that may limit candidacy, including the following:

         – Most commonly, we place the device on the right side. This leaves access for cardiac devices, which are usually placed on the left. Nerve access and surgery is the same regardless of the side chosen. We consider the left side in select patients, such as patients with specific occupational or recreational activities that require right arm or shoulder motion, patients with an implantable medical device on the right, patients with prior surgery on the right neck or chest (which distorts anatomy), prior radiation of the right neck or chest (increases the risk of poor wound healing, infection, extrusion), or a history of right hypoglossal nerve palsy.

          Anesthesia

         – HNS device placement is performed under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. Transoral intubation is the most utilized approach. However, some surgeons prefer a transnasal intubation to facilitate intraoral access for placement of nerve integrity monitoring (NIM) needles and assessment of tongue movement. Preoperative evaluation of patients with OSA is discussed separately. (See

          Positioning
         </strong>
         – The patient is placed in the supine position. We usually turn the bed 180 degrees to allow for the head of bed to be positioned away from anesthesia while patient is supine, to allow for full access to the patient’s head and neck. The arms are tucked tightly to the body to allow access to the chest for the implantable pulse generator (IPG) and the respiratory sensor placement. Standard monitors (eg, telemetry leads, blood pressure cuff, and pulse oximetry) should be kept out of the anticipated surgical field.

          NIM
         </strong>
         – We utilize intraoperative NIM to assess hypoglossal nerve activity by analyzing electromyography (EMG) responses to neurostimulation. Since the genioglossus muscle protrudes the tongue and is the main airway dilator, it is the primary target for neurostimulation. We place one set of 18 mm paired EMG electrodes vertically in the floor of mouth on the ipsilateral side off the midline into the genioglossus muscle. We also place a second set of electrodes in the lateral aspect of the ipsilateral tongue just under the mucosa 3 to 4 cm from the tip of the tongue. This allows monitoring of the hyoglossus and styloglossus muscles, which are undesirable targets for neurostimulation as they retract the tongue.

          Placing the stimulation lead
         </strong>
         – A 3 to 5 cm incision is placed in the neck crease in the submandibular area from the midpoint of the submandibular gland and extending anteriorly. The platysma muscle is divided. The anterior border of the submandibular gland is identified, and the gland is retracted posteriorly. The tendon of the digastric muscle is then identified and retracted inferiorly. Further dissection is carried out to identify the posterior border of the mylohyoid muscle that is then retracted anteriorly. The hypoglossal nerve and the associated ranine vein are then visualized  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef138649" href="/z/d/graphic/138649.html" rel="external">

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         In most cases, we preserve the ranine vein and dissect it away from the hypoglossal nerve. In some cases, ligation of the ranine vein or its branches might be necessary to access and visualize the hypoglossal nerve. Further nerve dissection is carried out to isolate the medial branches of the nerve and also the adjacent C1 nerve branch.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         We identify the separation of the lateral and medial branches of the hypoglossal nerve often marked by an accompanying vasa nervorum. NIM is used to confirm anatomic identification of the medial and lateral branches by observing characteristic EMG signals and by visual observation of corresponding muscle contraction in response to neurostimulation at 0.1 to 0.3 volts. (See
         <a class="local">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Because stimulation of even tiny retractor branches within the hypoglossal nerve can compromise therapy outcome as a result of undesirable tongue motion, nerve stimulation is additionally performed at the superior edge of the medial division to identify and isolate late takeoff retractor nerve fibers. If found or suspected, further dissection should be performed to separate the retractor branch(es) prior to placement of the stimulation cuff. This action minimizes the risk of undesirable tongue retraction postoperatively.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         We next place the stimulation lead cuff on the medial branch of the hypoglossal nerve (ensuring that no retractor branches are trapped within the cuff). We also typically include C1 nerve fibers within the cuff. Once in place, the stimulation lead anchor is secured to the digastric muscle tendon.

          Inserting the IPG and respiratory sensor lead
         </strong>
         – To insert the IPG and respiratory sensor lead, we use a horizontal 4 to 5 cm incision on the anterior chest wall, approximately 4 to 6 cm below the clavicle on the ipsilateral side. Rarely, the lead may need to be implanted on the contralateral side (eg, revision cases with an infected or damaged lead).

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         The IPG pocket is then created superficial to the pectoralis major muscle. We use a two-incision approach that allows for the respiratory sensor lead placement through the same incision as the IPG [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,17
         </a>
         ]. The pectoralis major muscle is bluntly dissected over the second or third intercostal space, and fibers are separated to allow exposure of the intercostal muscles. The external intercostal muscle is identified and dissected to allow the exposure of underlying internal intercostal muscle.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         The respiratory sensor is placed in a medial to lateral direction in between the external and internal intercostal muscles. The respiratory sensor should be placed closer to the superior border of the rib away from the neurovascular bundle running on inferior aspect of the rib. The sensor lead anchors are sutured to the external intercostal muscle fascia, and the pectoralis fascia.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         The neurostimulation lead is tunneled from the neck incision into the IPG pocket in the subplatysmal plane. Neurostimulation and respiratory sensor leads are connected to the IPG. The excess lead wire is coiled posterior to the IPG. The IPG is placed into the pocket and secured to the pectoralis major fascia.

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Placement of the respiratory sensor lead has a possibility of causing pneumothorax. If clinically suspected and a small pneumothorax is found (eg, ultrasound or chest radiography) and the patient stable, the respiratory lead should be immediately removed, the overlying muscle layer should be closed, and respiratory sensor can be placed in a different intercostal space. If pneumothorax is significant, a chest tube or catheter needs to be placed immediately. Once the patient is stable, the respiratory sensor lead can then be placed in a separate intercostal space away from the chest tube to avoid device infection. Pneumothorax is best avoided by staying between the intercostal muscles and avoiding entering the pleural space.

          Interrogating the system
         </strong>
         – Once the device placement is complete, prior to incision closure, the system is interrogated to assess its proper function. The respiratory sensor function is tested utilizing an external programmer. It is important to observe a clear rise and fall of the respiratory wave tracing corresponding to inspirations and expirations. If the expected tracing is not observed, the placement and function of the sensor lead should be explored.

         Testing of nerve stimulation by the IPG is performed at various intensities and polarities to confirm unrestricted forward tongue protrusion [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. If tongue retraction or mixed activation (ie, both protrusion and retraction) is identified, we re-explore the previously dissected submandibular region to exclude any entrapment of late retractor branches in the stimulation lead cuff; if identified, we reposition the cuff ensuring that there are no retractor branches included in the cuff before incisions are closed.

         If no tongue movement is observed with device interrogation, it is likely due to poor electrode contact with the nerve or trapped air within the cuff. Irrigation within the properly placed cuff often resolves the problem. If the problem does not resolve, we check the lead connection to the IPG and assess the device for a defect. Rarely, devices may be damaged during dissection or electrocautery. Hardware damage requires immediate replacement of the relevant parts.

         Since the introduction of HNS therapy, there have been no reports of permanent hypoglossal nerve paralysis as a result of implant placement. However, postoperative tongue weakness is reported in less than 1 percent of patients (eg, asymmetry on tongue protrusion and limited movement of the tongue from side to side). It is typically associated with neuropraxia resulting from hypoglossal nerve manipulation (ie, focal demyelination from mild injury at the surgical site resulting in blockage of nerve conduction and transient weakness).

         HNS implant placement is not generally associated with significant bleeding, although patients on anticoagulant medications are more prone to intraoperative and postoperative bleeding.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some intraoperative bleeding can be encountered during dissection, especially around the ranine vein or its branches, or during tunneling of the stimulation lead into the IPG pocket. In most patients, bleeding can be managed with bipolar electrocautery or by application of pressure. In controlling any bleeding related to the ranine vein, particular care must be taken to avoid any injury to the hypoglossal nerve given its immediate proximity. Bleeding encountered during the lead tunneling can be controlled by direct visualization and cautery of the bleeding vessel and application of pressure. In rare cases, additional incision over the site of bleeding and exploration to identify the source of bleeding might be required.
        </p>
        <p>
         Postoperative hematoma formation is a rare complication of HNS implant surgery. In most cases, a hematoma or seroma can be managed conservatively (observation). We typically do not aspirate fluid or blood in order to avoid introduction of skin pathogens into the surgical site and development of a subsequent infection. If the hematoma continues to expand, we explore the surgical site and control bleeding in an operating room under sterile conditions.

         Postoperative pain and discomfort after HNS implant are usually managed with nonopioid analgesics. Pain typically resolves within a few weeks after surgery. Pain with swallowing is expected postoperatively and resolves over time. Pain at the IPG site can be due to implant movement during upper body movement. We often suggest activity restriction of the upper body until the discomfort is completely resolved.

In most cases, this requires revision. Assessment and management are discussed below. (See

         In any case of device malfunction or suspected hardware damage, therapy should be discontinued and revision surgery undertaken to replace the damaged device. (See

         Exposure – Lead or IPG exposure is rare (ie, erosion through the skin). Meticulous surgical technique to avoid superficial placement of the implanted system components can help avoid wound dehiscence and exposure of the IPG or leads. If exposure occurs, the exposed components or the entire HNS system should be removed. Surgical sites should be allowed to fully heal before reimplantation.

         Migration – IPG migration can occur, which, in some cases, can put tension on the stimulation or respiratory sensing leads. A large IPG pocket, inadequate fixation of the IPG at the time of implantation, obesity, increasing age, or issues with tissue laxity can contribute to IPG movement and displacement. When suspected, we obtain a chest radiograph to assess the position of the IPG and the leads. Repositioning or revision may be required.

         The need for revision, replacement, or removal of the implanted HNS system or its components is rare (eg, device damage or fracture, infection, need for magnetic resonance imaging, or patient request) [

         Revision and replacement surgeries are performed with a similar setup as initial device implantation (see
         <a class="local">
          'Surgical technique'
         </a>
         above). However, revision surgeries are technically more challenging due to obscured visualization of anatomic structures and are often complicated by fibrosis. For example, lead coiling under the implantable pulse generator (IPG) and the tunneled leads between incisions are often scarred and can have an unpredictable path. Removal of all lead-securing sutures and dissection along the tunneled course of the leads can facilitate removal of the implant and prevent inadvertent damage of the intact device parts.

        <p>
         Limited data suggest that parts replacement has a low complication rate. Data from the ADHERE registry reported safe IPG replacement in 14 patients, 2 of whom needed lead replacement as well. The operative time was, in general, shorter than that associated with the original implant [

         Several newer HNS implantable devices have been developed. They are commercially available in parts of Europe but not yet approved in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
         One device consists of an implantable rechargeable unit connected to a six-electrode stimulation cuff lead. The neurostimulator is implanted below the clavicle, and the stimulation cuff is placed through a submandibular incision on the main trunk of the hypoglossal nerve. It delivers continuous stimulation that cyclically targets various tongue muscles, and stimulation is not synchronized with respirations [

         Another device consists of two sets of paired stimulating electrodes and a receiving antenna and is implanted under the chin on top of the genioglossus muscles bilaterally. The electrode paddles are placed over the medial division branches of the hypoglossal nerve bilaterally. The system does not contain a respiratory sensor and implantable battery. It uses an external activation unit that is applied externally with an adhesive patch. Preliminary data suggest apnea-hypopnea index reduction from 24 to 13 events per hour and a success rate of 50 percent after six months of device use [

          Mechanism of action
         </strong>
         – Hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HNS) is being increasingly used to treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). During sleep, HNS activates upper airway muscles, predominantly the genioglossus muscle, thereby opening the airway to prevent obstructive events  (

         <strong>
          Patient selection
         </strong>
         – HNS is a second-line therapy that is an option for patients with OSA who are unable to use or benefit from positive airway pressure therapy. Our selection criteria simulate those in a major prospective study that demonstrated efficacy of HNS in select patients with OSA who fulfill all of the criteria listed in the table  (

          Technique
         </strong>
         – The procedure involves placing an electrode cuff of the neurostimulation lead on the medial division fibers of the hypoglossal nerve in the submandibular region of the neck  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef138650" href="/z/d/graphic/138650.html" rel="external">

          figure 1
         </a>
         ). We connect the stimulation lead to an implantable pulse generator (IPG) in the chest wall. The IPG is also connected to a respiratory sensor lead, which is placed in between the internal and external intercostal muscles. We interrogate the system to ensure tongue protrusion without retraction. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Surgical technique'
         </a>
         above.)

         </span>
         <strong>
          Immediate and early postoperative care
         </strong>
         – We obtain anterior-posterior chest and lateral neck radiographs in the recovery area to rule out pneumothorax and document the baseline position of the device components. Patients are generally discharged on the same day. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Postoperative care'

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         One week after the procedure, patients are assessed for wound healing and other adverse events including tongue and lip weakness, asymmetric smile, infection, hematoma, and pain. Most of these complications resolve over a few weeks. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Follow-up and device activation
         </strong>
         – We typically activate the HNS device in the office four weeks after implant placement. Settings are titrated to identify the lowest amplitude at which tongue protrusion passes the mandibular incisors. The patient is then instructed on self-titration and asked to use the device nightly. One to two months later, we assess patients for compliance and OSA symptoms and obtain a sleep test either at home or in laboratory. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Initial activation'
         </a>
         above.)

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         For those whose symptoms improve, and the sleep study confirms adequate OSA control with HNS therapy (approximately two-thirds), we instruct patients on nightly HNS therapy use and schedule clinical follow-up and a device check in 6 to 12 months. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Patients with optimal response'

         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         For patients with a suboptimal response to HNS, we assess and treat reasons for this, and perform device setting adjustment, if needed. Occasionally, awake or drug-induced sleep endoscopy-directed HNS reprogramming or the addition of adjunctive therapy may be needed. (See
         <a class="local">
