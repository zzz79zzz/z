         Symptomatic gallbladder disease is common and is typically managed with cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been associated with higher rates of biliary complications than open cholecystectomy. This may be related to technical constraints of the minimally invasive approach. Endoscopy-guided interventions are used to manage some postcholecystectomy biliary conditions (eg, bile leaks from the cystic duct remnant or gallbladder bed). However, cholecystectomy-related injuries that transect the common bile or common hepatic duct generally require surgical intervention. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3682.html" rel="external">
          "Repair of common bile duct injuries"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Management of postcholecystectomy biliary injuries often involves a multidisciplinary team with input from biliary endoscopists, interventional radiologists, and hepatobiliary surgeons.
        </p>
        <p>
         The focus of this topic is endoscopic management of biliary complications related to laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

         The clinical features, diagnosis, and non-endoscopic management of cholecystectomy-related biliary injuries are presented separately. (See

         Reported rates of bile leak following cholecystectomy range from 0.3 to 0.9 percent [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Bile leaks that are managed with endoscopic intervention usually originate from one of the following sites: the cystic duct remnant, the gallbladder bed, an accessory duct, or lateral injury to the common bile or hepatic duct [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         However, circumferential injury (ie, transection) to the common bile or common hepatic duct typically requires non-endoscopic assessment and repair, and this is discussed separately. (See

        <p>
         Postcholecystectomy biliary injuries have been described in several classification systems, and we typically use the Hanover classification  (

         <a href="#rid4">

         Postcholecystectomy bile leaks are often suspected based on presenting symptoms (eg, abdominal pain, fever, jaundice) and laboratory studies (ie, cholestatic pattern of liver test abnormalities). The diagnosis of bile leak is confirmed with imaging that demonstrates a fluid collection (eg, transabdominal ultrasound, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography [MRCP]). In addition, hepatobiliary cholescintigraphy (generally referred to as a HIDA scan) may also be performed when other studies are equivocal. Thus, most patients will have had laboratory studies and imaging, thereby mitigating the need for additional testing before endoscopy-guided intervention. Review of the radiographic imaging prior to endoscopy will help to define the biliary ductal anatomy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3681.html" rel="external">

         The goal of endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC)-guided therapy for bile leak is to eliminate the transpapillary pressure gradient, thereby facilitating transpapillary flow of bile into the duodenum rather than extravasation at the site of the leak.

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         For most patients with a postcholecystectomy bile leak who require endoscopic intervention, we perform ERC within 12 to 24 hours after the bile leak is diagnosed because delaying the procedure may lead to a longer hospital stay, increased costs, and possibly increased risk for adverse events. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3681.html" rel="external">
          "Complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy", section on 'Bile leaks (type A, C, D injury)'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         While consensus guidance and randomized trials on timing for endoscopic intervention for bile leaks are lacking, retrospective studies have suggested that procedure timing was not associated with worse outcomes [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. In a database study including over 1000 patients who underwent ERC for bile duct leak after cholecystectomy, timing of ERC (ie, within 24 hours, after two to three days, or after &gt;3 days) was not associated with significantly different rates of post-ERC adverse events (eg, infection) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. However, the possibility of selection bias cannot be excluded, and more studies are needed to evaluate other outcomes, including length of hospital stay and cost.

          Bile leak without retained stones

         – For most patients with bile leak but without retained stones, we typically perform ERC-guided placement of a transpapillary plastic biliary stent (size range, 7 to 10 French) without biliary sphincterotomy because this approach is effective for treating bile leaks while avoiding the possible risks associated with sphincterotomy (eg, bleeding)  (

          Bile leak with retained stone(s)

         – For most patients with retained common bile duct stone(s) and bile leak, we typically perform biliary sphincterotomy and stone extraction followed by biliary stent placement. Biliary sphincterotomy is needed prior to stone extraction with balloon or basket catheters. Removal of bile duct stones is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/674.html" rel="external">

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For patients with a lower grade bile leak in the setting of retained stones, some endoscopists perform sphincterotomy and stone removal without stent placement to manage the bile leak [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Lower grade leaks have been described as leaks that require complete or near complete intrahepatic filling with contrast to demonstrate contrast extravasation  (

         The biliary stent remains in place for approximately four to six weeks. After this indwelling time, most patients have recovered clinically (ie, no abdominal pain/distension, fever, or jaundice) and the bile leak has healed. If a percutaneous drain had been placed, the drainage should be less than 10 mL per day prior to removing the stent.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with a bile leak involving noncircumferential injury to the common bile or common hepatic duct, some clinicians obtain a HIDA scan in addition to assessing symptoms to confirm that the leak has resolved prior to stent removal. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3681.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with symptomatic improvement, we typically remove the stent by performing side-viewing endoscopy with cholangiography to confirm that the bile leak has resolved and to exclude the presence of sludge or retained bile duct stones [

         Imaging with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), abdominal computed tomography scan, or percutaneous cholangiography (ie, for patients with a percutaneous drain) confirms the diagnosis of refractory bile leak, excludes anatomic variations, and informs the approach to management [

The bile leak occurs because the cystic duct arose from an aberrant right hepatic duct, and leakage originates from the distal aspect of what appears to be the cystic duct and the transected right duct branch. This injury is usually identified on MRCP. (See

         Some patients with a cholecystectomy-related stricture or partially occlusive surgical clip are managed with endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC)-guided stricture dilation and stent placement. However, patients with biliary obstruction from complete transection or clipping of the common bile or common hepatic duct usually require radiology-guided percutaneous drainage with stenting and/or surgical intervention (hepaticojejunostomy)  (

         The diagnosis of postcholecystectomy biliary stricture is often suspected based on presenting symptoms (jaundice, abdominal pain, pruritus), laboratory studies (cholestatic pattern of liver test abnormalities) and imaging (eg, transabdominal ultrasound and/or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography [MRCP] showing dilated intrahepatic ducts). Thus, most patients will have had laboratory studies and imaging, thereby mitigating the need for additional testing before ERC. Review of MRCP prior to endoscopy will help to define the biliary ductal anatomy. (See

         For patients with a nonresolving common bile duct stricture despite serial ERC sessions with plastic stent exchanges for up to 12 months, endoscopic options include placement of a fully covered, self-expandable metal (FCSEMS). Use of FCSEMS for benign biliary strictures related to cholecystectomy is off label in the United States, although FCSEMS are approved for treating biliary strictures related to chronic pancreatitis. (See

         The decision to use FCSEMS for biliary stricture following cholecystectomy should be carefully made on an individual basis while balancing the potential benefits (eg, stricture resolution without surgical intervention) with potential adverse events (eg, stent migration) and costs.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients in whom FCSEMS placement is indicated, we typically use an 8 or 10 mm stent, depending on the initial diameter of the bile duct. The FCSEMS remains in place for three to six months, and then it is removed endoscopically.

         ]. In a study including 18 patients with postcholecystectomy biliary stricture, FCSEMS placement with median indwelling time of 11 months (range 1 to 14 months) was associated with stricture resolution in 13 patients (72 percent) [

          33

         ]. At five years after stent removal, 85 percent of patients with initial stricture resolution remained stent-free. Serious adverse events related to ERC with stent placement occurred in seven patients (39 percent) and included cholangitis (six patients) and pancreatitis (one patient), but all events resolved without long-term sequelae. Other possible adverse events include stent migration and stricturing at the stent margins [

         For patients with postcholecystectomy biliary stricture that does not resolve with endoscopic stenting, surgical intervention may be required for stricture resolution. (See

         After removing the stent(s) and confirming stricture resolution with ERC, we monitor patients periodically with liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin; eg, every three months for 6 to 12 months). If symptoms recur or liver enzymes rise over baseline values, we obtain imaging (eg, MRCP or repeat ERC) to evaluate for stricture recurrence.

          Background
         </strong>
         – Symptomatic gallbladder disease is common and is often managed with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been associated with higher rates of biliary complications than open cholecystectomy  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef139065" href="/z/d/graphic/139065.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). This may be related to technical constraints of the minimally invasive approach. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction'
         </a>
         above and

         <strong>
          Bile leak
         </strong>
         – The goal of endoscopic therapy for postcholecystectomy bile leak is to eliminate the transpapillary pressure gradient, thereby facilitating transpapillary flow of bile into the duodenum rather than extravasation at the site of the leak.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For patients with a bile leak from a peripheral site (eg, cystic duct remnant) or from lateral injury to the common bile or common hepatic duct, we suggest endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC)-guided placement of a transpapillary stent with or without biliary sphincterotomy rather than sphincterotomy alone because ERC-guided stent placement is more effective for resolving most bile leaks (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Bile leak'

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The biliary stent remains in place for approximately four to six weeks. After this stent indwelling time, most patients have recovered clinically (ie, no abdominal pain/distension), the bile leak has healed, and the stent is removed endoscopically.

          Biliary stricture
         </strong>
         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         For most patients with postcholecystectomy biliary stricture in the absence of complete obstruction of the common bile or common hepatic duct, we suggest ERC-guided intervention rather than surgery (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). An ERC-guided approach with biliary stent placement is less invasive and has been associated with long-term stricture resolution. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Biliary stricture'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         ERC with routine plastic stent exchange is performed approximately every three to six months for a total stent indwelling time of 6 to 12 months. After stricture resolution, we monitor patients with liver enzymes every three months for 6 to 12 months and obtain imaging (eg, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography [MRCP]) when there is a rise in liver enzymes over baseline values.
