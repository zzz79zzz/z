         Bone is the most common site of metastasis in cancer, and bone metastases are most prevalent among patients with cancer of the breast, prostate, and lung. Complications from bone metastases include pain, decreased performance status, and decreased quality of life (QOL), as well as skeletal-related events (SREs), which are defined as the need for radiation and/or surgery to bone, pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia of malignancy. SREs are most common in patients with lytic metastases, but they can also occur in patients with blastic metastases  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54124" href="/z/d/graphic/54124.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). SREs that are accompanied by symptoms (as opposed to identified on imaging tests) are known as symptomatic skeletal events (SSEs) and represent a more clinically meaningful endpoint. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91912.html" rel="external">
          "Epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of bone metastasis in adults", section on 'Epidemiology'

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         SREs and SSEs are clinical outcomes that can be distinctly measured; therefore, they are often used as endpoints in clinical trials investigating therapies for bone metastases, although not all studies include hypercalcemia of malignancy. Bone metastases are also associated with pain, particularly with motion, which significantly impacts QOL.
        </p>
        <p>
         Osteoclast inhibition has become an important component of managing patients with bone metastases to reduce the frequency and delay the onset of SREs and SSEs. While the frequency of SREs in patients not treated with an osteoclast inhibitor can be illustrated by the following historical data, it is important to state that improvements anticancer treatments in recent years may have also reduced the incidence of SREs [

         In a review of patients treated for metastatic breast cancer prior to the routine use of bisphosphonates, over 50 percent developed an SRE [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Other evidence suggests that in the absence of osteoclast inhibition, one SRE occurs an average of every three to four months in women with lytic bone metastases from breast cancer [

         Data from the untreated arms of older controlled trials of osteoclast inhibitors indicate that SREs have been most common in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer (two-year cumulative incidence 68 percent), followed by prostate cancer (two-year cumulative incidence 49 percent), and non-small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors (21-month cumulative incidence 48 percent) [

         In addition to osteoclast inhibition, management of patients with metastatic bone disease requires an integrated multidisciplinary management approach. The foundation of management entails antineoplastic treatment (eg, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, targeted therapies, external beam radiation therapy, bone-targeted radiopharmaceuticals) and may also include surgery as required for existing or impending pathologic fractures, as well as physical and/or occupational therapy to optimize function. As treatment of these patients is palliative, supportive interventions, such as analgesics and concurrent subspecialty palliative care consultation and management, are essential. (See

         Osteoclast inhibitors are indicated for the management of metastatic bone disease for most patients with solid tumors. However, the vast majority of the data for metastatic prostate cancer were generated in the castration-resistant state; hence, we advise that the use of osteoclast inhibitors be specifically applied to CRPC with bone metastases.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients in whom SREs and SSEs are unlikely (eg, those with minimal bone tumor burden) and for those with a limited expected survival (eg, those with extensive and progressive visceral metastases), treatment with osteoclast inhibitors should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Other indications for the use of osteoclast inhibition in cancer patients (eg, preventing bone loss related to androgen deprivation therapy [ADT], use in multiple myeloma) are discussed separately. (See

         Although osteoclast inhibitors are widely available, and despite their proven efficacy, the available
         <em>

         data suggest that a large proportion of patients (between 20 and 50 percent) who are otherwise eligible are not receiving osteoclast-inhibiting treatment to prevent SREs [

         For patients in whom an osteoclast inhibitor is indicated, preexisting hypocalcemia and/or vitamin D deficiency should be corrected prior to treatment. Ongoing assessment is needed during therapy due to the risk of secondary hyperparathyroidism.

         Patients with solid tumors may be vitamin D deficient, which places them at risk for hypocalcemia if they are treated with an osteoclast inhibitor without additional calcium (and vitamin D) supplementation [

        <p>
         If there are no contraindications (eg, history of recurrent renal stones), all patients receiving osteoclast inhibitors who do not have adequate dietary intake should receive calcium and vitamin D supplementation to decrease the risk of hypocalcemia. The use of calcium and vitamin D in patients who are at risk for hypercalcemia in the setting of bone metastases is not normally a concern as absorption of oral calcium is regulated by parathyroid hormone, which falls as serum calcium rises. In general, the principles and guidance on the use of calcium and vitamin D supplementation outlined by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) that apply to the general population are appropriate for patients with bone metastases from solid tumors [

While monthly denosumab may appear preferable to monthly zoledronic acid in terms of a modest improvement in SRE reduction and analgesic effects, and the fact that denosumab can be administered as a subcutaneous injection rather than an intravenous infusion, its use needs to be balanced by the significantly higher direct drug costs and the data demonstrating that a three-month dosing interval of zoledronic acid is noninferior to monthly dosing [

Nevertheless, the evolving data on dosing intervals for osteoclast inhibitors in breast cancer and CRPC have clearly influenced clinical practice for patients receiving these drugs in the setting of other solid tumors; in the absence of data from large prospective trials, many clinicians are de-escalating zoledronate and denosumab to 12-week administration after a variable period of four-week dosing [

Indeed, a combined Musculoskeletal Tumor Society/American Society of Clinical Oncology/American Society for Radiation Oncology (MSTS/ASCO/ASTRO) guideline for management of metastatic cancer to the femur discusses offering the 12-week dosing to all patients, regardless of histology [

         Multiple randomized trials have demonstrated significant reduction in the frequency of and an increase/delay in the time to onset of skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with bone metastases from a variety of solid tumors who are treated with an osteoclast inhibitor. We recommend the use of osteoclast-inhibiting therapy to reduce the risk of skeletal complications for most patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. For patients in whom SREs are unlikely (eg, those with minimal bone tumor burden) and for those with a limited expected survival (eg, those with progressive visceral metastases despite established anticancer therapies), treatment with osteoclast inhibitors should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

There are limited data addressing less frequent dosing than every four weeks for denosumab, and this approach cannot yet be recommended as a standard approach. However, on a case-by-case basis, every-12-week dosing may be appropriate for informed and selected patients with bone metastases from breast cancer or castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). For patients who have bone metastases from other solid tumors, there may be circumstances (eg, no rapid bone resorption, limited burden of bone metastases, and high likelihood of response to systemic anticancer treatment) where an extended dosing interval might be appropriate if it is compatible with the patient's goals of care.

         Bisphosphonates are analogs of pyrophosphate with carbon replacing the central oxygen  (

          figure 1

         <a href="#rid45">
          45,46
         </a>
         ]. Bisphosphonates have a direct apoptotic effect on osteoclasts, affect their differentiation and maturation, and thereby, act as potent inhibitors of bone resorption. In preclinical models, bisphosphonates have also been shown to influence macrophages, gamma delta T cells, osteoblasts, and tumor cells [

          46

         In a 2017 meta-analysis of randomized trials in advanced breast cancer, compared with placebo, bisphosphonates significantly reduced the absolute risk of SREs (excluding hypercalcemia) by 14 percent (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78-0.95) [

However, there are sufficient data in metastatic breast cancer and CRPC to support less frequent dosing (every 12 weeks rather than every 4 weeks), and we suggest this approach for most patients. A 2017 focused guideline update on the role of osteoclast inhibitors in metastatic breast cancer from the American Society of Clinical Oncology and Cancer Care Ontario, as well as the European Society for Medical Oncology guideline on bone health, supports every-12-week dosing as an alternative to monthly therapy [

          24,25
         </a>
         ]. A year 2020 joint guideline on treatment of metastatic carcinoma and myeloma of the femur from the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society/American Society of Clinical Oncology/American Society for Radiation Oncology also supports 12-week dosing as an alternative to monthly therapy for metastatic carcinoma of all histologies [

         dosed every three to four weeks prior to switching over to every-12-week dosing.

         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. In our view, the strongest data to recommend a change in dosing interval for patients with bone metastases is in breast cancer and the strongest data in support of initiating zoledronic acid at 12-week dosing is in breast, prostate, and multiple myeloma. Hence, we continue to treat patients with other tumor types, at least initially, with every-three- to four-week dosing of zoledronic acid, if a bisphosphonate is chosen. However, there may be circumstances (eg, limited burden of bone metastases, high likelihood of response to systemic anticancer treatment, patient preference) where an extended dosing interval might be appropriate for the individual.

The noninferiority margin was set at 7 percent absolute difference in the proportion of patients developing at least one SRE within two years, the primary endpoint. There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who developed at least one SRE (29.5 versus 28.6 percent for the every-4-week and every-12-week treatment, respectively) [

The lower border of the 95 percent confidence interval for the risk difference between the groups was greater than the noninferiority margin regardless of whether the analysis assumed that dropouts (ie, individuals who did not complete two years of treatment) did or did not have an SRE. There was also no significant difference in the time to first SRE in either group, in pain scores, or in the risk of jaw osteonecrosis. There was also no difference in the proportion of patients with renal dysfunction (1.2 versus 0.5 percent with every-4-week versus every-12-week therapy), although notably, in this trial each dose of zoledronic acid was modified according to the creatinine clearance prior to each dose, which is different from what is recommended in the

De-escalation of zoledronic acid in patients with bone metastases specifically from breast cancer is also supported by a second, more recent meta-analysis of five randomized trials [

        <p>
         These data add to the body of evidence that de-escalation of all common osteoclast inhibitors for metastatic bone disease is a reasonable alternative to monthly dosing in an informed patient who is not at imminent risk for significant SREs. Importantly, not all trials have consistently supported less frequent dosing [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26,42,53,57
         </a>
         ]. An unanswered question is whether there are subpopulations of patients with metastatic breast cancer or CRPC for whom initial therapy every four weeks is preferred with a later transition to less frequent dosing after a period of bone stability (preloading). An additional unanswered question is whether there could be benefit in escalating dosing from every three months to monthly in the setting of increasing risk of SREs. In our practice, we limit the use of initial extended dosing to those patients without extensive bone metastases or significant bone pain and a high likelihood of response to underlying systemic treatment.

However, if zoledronic acid is not available, pamidronate is a reasonable alternative, at least for women with metastatic breast cancer. For patients who are at increased risk of renal toxicity and for those who prefer an oral regimen, oral ibandronate or clodronate are reasonable. This substitution of oral for intravenous bisphosphonates can only be recommended for metastatic breast cancer.

         For patients in whom an osteoclast inhibitor is indicated, there are no data on the optimal duration of therapy. One approach, is to continue treatment indefinitely in the absence of excessive toxicity and as long as treatment is consistent with both the patient and the clinician's joint treatment goals. However, another acceptable option for patients who have well-controlled oligometastatic disease is to interrupt bisphosphonate therapy after a period of two years.
        </p>
        <p>
         This approach is consistent with European Society for Medical Oncology 2020 guidelines [

         A systematic review exploring longer durations of osteoclast inhibitor therapy showed that with longer follow-up, the risk of symptomatic skeletal events decreases while the risks of cumulative toxicities increases [

         Additional data suggest that treatment should be administered for a minimum of six months because it usually takes this amount of time on treatment before there is a demonstrable reduction in the rate of SREs [

         In our practice, we monitor patients serially with clinical exams and imaging to ensure that there is no worsening of bone disease during therapy with an osteoclast inhibitor. Monitoring tumor burden in bone requires serial assessment with a history and physical examination, laboratory studies (eg, serum alkaline phosphatase and consideration for using tumor markers, if available), and scans. The frequency of monitoring should be based upon tumor type, whether or not disease control is likely to be achieved with systemic anticancer therapy, and other clinically relevant issues, such as symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tumor-induced osteolysis is associated with increased turnover of bone resorption markers such as urinary N-telopeptide (uNTx) and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP). Bone biomarkers can provide additional information on prognosis and the likelihood of a skeletal-related event (SRE) [
         <a href="#rid87">
          87,88
         </a>
         ]. However, the utility of bone biomarkers in monitoring therapy for patients receiving an osteoclast inhibitor is controversial.
        </p>
        <p>
         We assess renal function, calcium, and electrolytes (or a biochemical profile) periodically throughout therapy. Vitamin D intake and/or levels can be assessed in the evaluation of calcium status. (See

        <p>
         Although effective inhibition of osteoclast activity can result in hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia, most patients do not become symptomatically hypocalcemic during therapy because of compensatory mechanisms. Patients are at higher risk of electrolyte imbalance if they have renal insufficiency, decreased compensatory mechanisms, or vitamin D deficiency. (See

          Morbidity of bone metastases
         </strong>
         – Metastases to bone are a common site of recurrence for many types of solid cancers. Bone metastases cause pain, impair quality of life, and cause skeletal-related events (SREs), including pathologic fracture, the need for radiation or surgery to bone, hypercalcemia, and spinal cord compression. Bisphosphonates and

         For most patients with bone metastases from solid tumors, we recommend the use of a bisphosphonate or

          denosumab

          Grade 1A
         </a>
         ). The vast majority of the data for metastatic prostate cancer were generated in individuals with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC); hence, we advise that the use of a bisphosphonate or denosumab be specifically applied to CRPC with bone metastases, not castration-sensitive disease.

         For patients in whom SREs are unlikely (eg, those with minimal bone tumor burden) and for those with a limited expected survival (eg, those with progressive visceral metastases despite anticancer therapies), treatment with osteoclast inhibitors should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

         For patients in whom an osteoclast inhibitor is indicated, dental care should be optimized prior to treatment, preexisting hypocalcemia and/or vitamin D deficiency should be corrected, and patients should be counseled on daily oral care and adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D during therapy (unless contraindicated).

         The selection of one osteoclast inhibitor over another is influenced by tumor type, patient preference, and other factors, such as route and frequency of administration, tolerance, accessibility, and cost. For most patients with bone metastases from breast cancer or CRPC,

          zoledronic acid

          denosumab

However, for patients with breast cancer or CRPC who have neither highly symptomatic nor extensive bone metastases, we suggest every 12 weeks rather than every 4 week dosing interval (

Switching to every-12-week dosing after a variable period of every-four-week dosing (eg, after three to six months) is an appropriate option for patients with stable bone disease. (See

There are limited data addressing less frequent dosing than every four weeks for denosumab, and this approach cannot yet be recommended as a standard approach. However, on a case-by-case basis, every-12-week dosing may be appropriate for informed and selected patients with bone metastases from breast cancer or CRPC. (See

However, there may be circumstances (eg, no rapid bone resorption, limited burden of bone metastases, and high likelihood of response to systemic anticancer treatment) where an extended dosing interval might be appropriate for any solid tumor if it is compatible with the patient's goals of care.

         For patients in whom an osteoclast inhibitor is indicated, there are no data on the optimal duration of therapy. One approach, is to continue treatment indefinitely in the absence of excessive toxicity and as long as treatment is consistent with both the patient and the clinician's joint treatment goals. However, another acceptable option for patients who have well-controlled oligometastatic disease is to interrupt bisphosphonate therapy after a period of two years. (See
