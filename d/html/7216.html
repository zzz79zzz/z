         Acute kidney injury (AKI), previously called acute renal failure (ARF), is a common clinical problem [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-7
         </a>
         ]. The 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Acute Kidney Injury defined AKI as
         <strong>
          one or more of three criteria
         </strong>
         [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The first two were a rise in serum creatinine of at least 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 micromol/L) over a 48-hour period and/or ≥1.5 times the baseline value within the seven previous days [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The third criterion was a urine volume ≤0.5 mL/kg per hour for six hours. However, in a 70 kg adult male, this would represent a urine volume as high as 210 mL in six hours, which, if maintained, would be 840 mL/day. Many healthy individuals could meet this criterion if they had limited fluid intake. Thus, the authors and reviewers of this topic do
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         agree with making a diagnosis of AKI based solely upon the urine volume.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other definitions and severity staging of AKI have also been proposed. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7238.html" rel="external">
          "Definition and staging criteria of acute kidney injury in adults"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The two major causes of AKI that occur in the hospital are prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Together, they account for approximately 65 to 75 percent of cases of AKI. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Frequency of prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis as a cause of AKI'

         This topic will review the pathophysiology, etiology, clinical presentation, and evaluation and diagnosis of prerenal disease and ATN as a cause of AKI. The diagnostic approach to patients with acute or chronic kidney disease (CKD), the possible prevention and management of ATN, and kidney and patient outcomes after ATN are discussed elsewhere. (See

         AKI is characterized by an abrupt decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The etiology can be classified into prerenal, intrinsic renal, and postrenal causes. (See

         Decreased GFR due to prerenal disease occurs in two settings [

        <p>
         Systemic hypoperfusion is initially sensed by cardiac and arterial receptors that respond to changes in pressure (or stretch). When the mean arterial pressure is reduced, due to a reduction in either cardiac output or systemic vascular resistance, activation of these receptors increases sympathetic neural tone and the release of both renin (leading to the generation of angiotensin II) and antidiuretic hormone. The ensuing arteriolar and venular constriction and stimulation of cardiac function return the systemic blood pressure and cardiac output toward normal. The arteriolar vasoconstriction occurs primarily in the renal, splanchnic, and musculocutaneous circulations, resulting in the relative preservation of blood flow to the heart and brain.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although these are appropriate systemic responses, renal vasoconstriction can diminish renal blood flow and GFR, which is flow dependent. In addition, if the compensatory systemic responses are incomplete, persistent reductions in cardiac output and/or arterial pressure can contribute to the decline in GFR.
        </p>
        <p>
         A common cause of prerenal disease is true volume depletion, which includes hypovolemia caused by dehydration, hemorrhage, or renal (diuretics) or gastrointestinal (vomiting, diarrhea) fluid loss. Kidney perfusion can also be reduced in edematous states such as heart failure and cirrhosis due to myocardial dysfunction and splanchnic venous pooling and systemic vasodilation, respectively. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Causes of prerenal disease'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         With all of these processes that cause prerenal disease, the GFR is diminished because of decreased renal blood flow. The glomeruli, kidney tubules, and interstitium are intact. The appropriate treatment is to increase kidney perfusion, as with volume repletion in patients with true volume depletion. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2296.html" rel="external">
          "Maintenance and replacement fluid therapy in adults", section on 'Replacement fluid therapy'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         By contrast to prerenal disease, in sepsis-associated AKI, high cardiac output may increase renal blood flow, yet GFR may be reduced. This is likely due to a decrease in afferent and, to a greater extent, in efferent arteriolar tone and a decrease in overall arteriolar resistance. This decrease in arteriolar tone eventually leads to a decline in the intraglomerular pressure, and thereby, in GFR. In an animal model of experimental hyperdynamic septic AKI, infusion of angiotensin II (which would increase arteriolar tone) led to decreased renal blood flow, increased urine output, and increased creatinine clearance [

         Prolonged and/or severe ischemia can lead to ATN. This can result in histologic changes, including necrosis, with denuding of the epithelium and occlusion of the tubular lumen by casts and cell debris. Postischemic (also called ischemic) ATN is discussed in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7228.html" rel="external">
          "Pathogenesis and etiology of ischemic acute tubular necrosis"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Any of the processes associated with prerenal disease can cause ATN, but kidney damage most commonly occurs in patients with hypotension, particularly in the settings of surgery, sepsis, or obstetrical complications. The other major causes of ATN include a variety of nephrotoxins that directly damage renal tubules via a number of different mechanisms [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Causes of acute tubular necrosis'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although kidney ischemia is the most common cause of ATN, the sensitivity of individual patients to a decrease in kidney perfusion is variable. In some patients, a few minutes of hypotension is sufficient to induce ATN, whereas others are able to tolerate hours of kidney ischemia without structural damage to the kidney, displaying the findings of prerenal disease, such as a normal urinalysis and a low fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) (see
         <a class="local">
          'Evaluation and diagnosis'
         </a>
         below). Such patients can eventually develop ATN if kidney perfusion is not improved.

          True volume depletion
         </strong>
         – Volume depletion may be caused by gastrointestinal disease (vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding), renal losses (diuretics, glucose osmotic diuresis), skin or respiratory losses (insensible losses, sweat, burns), and third space sequestration (crush injury or skeletal fracture). (See

          Edematous states
         </strong>
         – Heart failure and cirrhosis can result in marked reductions in kidney perfusion that parallel the severity of the underlying disease. The respective mechanisms are decreased cardiac output in heart failure and splanchnic venous pooling and systemic vasodilation in cirrhosis. (See

         Nephrotic syndrome, mostly in adults with minimal change disease, can also lead to AKI. Decreased kidney perfusion, reduced glomerular permeability, and excessive diuresis are among the mechanisms that may contribute to AKI. (See

          Selective kidney ischemia
         </strong>
         – Bilateral renal artery stenosis or unilateral stenosis in a solitary functioning kidney is frequently made worse by treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, or direct renin inhibitors. (See

         <strong>
          Drugs affecting glomerular hemodynamics
         </strong>
         – Drugs that affect glomerular hemodynamics can reduce the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by lowering the intraglomerular pressure that drives this process. This can occur by decreasing either afferent (preglomerular) arteriolar dilatation (eg, with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or calcineurin inhibitors) or efferent (postglomerular) arteriolar constriction (eg, with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II blockers).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The effect of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs is primarily seen in patients with underlying kidney hypoperfusion due to true volume depletion, heart failure, or cirrhosis, in which prostaglandin synthesis within or near the glomerulus is increased by vasoconstrictors such as angiotensin II and
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9709" href="/z/d/drug information/9709.html" rel="external">
          norepinephrine
         </a>
         and vasodilator prostaglandins help preserve kidney reperfusion and glomerular filtration. The effect of angiotensin inhibitors is also seen in these settings since angiotensin II helps maintain the intraglomerular pressure and GFR by increasing efferent arteriolar resistance. The mechanism with calcineurin inhibitors is less clear. The supporting data are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         Sepsis-induced ATN is often associated with prerenal factors such as decreased kidney perfusion and systemic hypotension. However, as discussed above, in sepsis-associated high cardiac output failure, an increase in kidney perfusion pressure may be observed [

          9,10
         </a>
         ]. Generally, these prerenal factors, when severe and sustained, lead to ATN. Other factors can also contribute, including release of cytokines and activation of neutrophils by cytokines. (See

         The history may reveal a cause of decreased tissue perfusion (eg, vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding, or sepsis). In addition, in hospitalized patients, a close examination of the clinical setting may help identify the underlying cause of AKI (eg, hypotension, sepsis, intraoperative events, aminoglycoside therapy, or the administration of radiocontrast media, particularly in patients at increased risk). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7214.html" rel="external">

         Among patients who develop AKI in the hospital, the day of onset can be determined if the serum creatinine concentration has been measured daily. Suppose, for example, that a patient has had a stable serum creatinine concentration, which began to rise progressively on day 5. In such a patient, there must have been some insult on day 4 (eg, hypotension, radiocontrast media) or a cumulative insult that has become clinically apparent (eg, aminoglycoside therapy). Careful perusal of the patient's chart may identify the probable cause.

         The urinalysis with sediment examination by urine microscopy is normal or near normal in prerenal disease unless it is superimposed on another cause of kidney disease. Hyaline and/or fine granular casts may be seen, but these are not an abnormal finding. In comparison, the classic urinalysis in ATN reveals muddy brown granular, epithelial cell casts, and free renal tubular epithelial cells  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56438" data-inline-graphics="56438" href="/z/d/graphic/56438.html" rel="external">

         Marked hyperbilirubinemia alone can, via an uncertain mechanism, lead to the formation of granular and epithelial cell casts in the absence of overt tubular injury [

          not
         </strong>
         distinguish between prerenal disease and ATN. In contrast, marked hyperbilirubinemia does not impair sodium reabsorption; thus, measurement of the FENa and the urine sodium concentration remains useful. In one study, patients with higher urinary bilirubin levels had large numbers of granular casts and renal tubular epithelial cells on urine sediment, regardless of the presence of AKI [

         The urine-sodium concentration is widely used in patients with suspected volume depletion. In the absence of a sodium-wasting state, the urine-sodium concentration in hypovolemic states should be less than 20 mEq/L and may be as low as 1 mEq/L in laboratories able to detect such a low level (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2298.html" rel="external">
          "Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of volume depletion in adults", section on 'Urine sodium concentration'
         </a>
         ). However, for the reasons described in the following discussion, measurement of the
         <strong>
          FENa is the preferred test
         </strong>
         for distinguishing prerenal disease from ATN as the cause of AKI.
        </p>
        <p>
         The urine-sodium concentration tends to be low in prerenal disease (less than 20 mEq/L) in an appropriate attempt to conserve sodium and high in ATN (more than 40 to 50 mEq/L) due, in part, to impaired tubular function induced by the tubular injury [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. However, frequent overlap occurs due to variations in water reabsorption, which can affect the urine-sodium concentration without affecting total sodium excretion. As examples:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         A patient with prerenal disease who is highly water avid due to increased secretion of antidiuretic hormone may have a higher than expected urine sodium concentration, despite a low rate of sodium excretion.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Conversely, decreased water reabsorption in ATN due to impaired concentrating ability can lower the urine sodium concentration by dilution.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The FENa, which includes the urine-sodium concentration, is the better test in patients with AKI since it only measures sodium handling (the fraction of the filtered sodium load that is excreted). It is not affected by changes in urine output, since the urine volume is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         included in the formula.
        </p>
        <p>
         The filtered sodium load can be determined from the product of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR, as estimated from the creatinine clearance) and the serum sodium concentration (SNa). Sodium excretion is equal to the product of the urine sodium concentration (UNa) and the urine volume (V). Thus:

         Where UNa and SNa are the urine and serum sodium concentrations, UCr and SCr are the urine and serum creatinine concentrations, and [(UCr  x  V)  ÷  SCr] represents the creatinine clearance. This equation can be simplified since the urine flow rate (V) terms cancel out, allowing the FENa to be estimated from simultaneously obtained serum and urine specimens without measuring the urine volume [

         The FENa may remain below 1 percent when ATN is superimposed upon a chronic prerenal disease such as cirrhosis or heart failure, or in a minority of patients with nonoliguric postischemic (ischemic) ATN who may have persistent kidney ischemia and less severe ATN.

         A FENa below 1 percent is not unique to prerenal disease, since it can occur with other causes of AKI that are associated with a low GFR and relatively intact tubular function. These include acute glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, rhabdomyolysis, and contrast-induced nephropathy.

         Patients with AKI are often treated with diuretics, which, if effective, can raise the FENa, even in patients with prerenal disease. Potential alternative in such patients, which have been less well studied than FENa, include the fractional excretion of molecules such as urea,

         The FENa defining sodium retention
         <strong>
          varies with the filtered sodium load
         </strong>
         : below 1 percent when the filtered sodium load is low due to the marked reduction in GFR in AKI and progressively lower as the filtered sodium load increases, reaching a value of
         <strong>
          less than 0.1 percent
         </strong>
         when the GFR is normal. If, for example, the normal GFR is 180 L/day (125 mL/min) and the normal plasma water sodium concentration is 150 mEq/L, then the daily filtered sodium load will be 27,000 mEq/L. In a patient with prerenal disease, urine sodium excretion can be reduced to less than 27 mEq/day, which represents a FENa below 0.1 percent, if a normal GFR is maintained.

         In contrast to the prompt recovery to baseline kidney function following volume repletion in pure prerenal disease, patients with prerenal disease who also have features of ATN may have delayed recovery to baseline kidney function after fluid repletion [

          43

         Unless contraindicated, a trial of intravenous fluid therapy is warranted in patients with a clinical history consistent with fluid loss (such as vomiting, diarrhea, or bleeding) and a physical examination consistent with hypovolemia (such as otherwise unexplained tachycardia, decreased skin turgor, cool extremities, and/or supine or orthostatic hypotension). In contrast, fluid administration is
         <strong>
          not

         warranted and may be harmful (eg, fluid overload and pulmonary congestion) in critically ill patients with AKI who do not have a history or physical or laboratory findings suggestive of hypovolemia [

         have peripheral edema. In the presence of peripheral edema, the edema fluid can be rapidly mobilized with fluid loss (as with diuretic therapy), which will minimize the degree of intravascular volume depletion  (

         Patients with mild-to-moderate hypovolemia are treated with isotonic fluid at a slower rate. The goal of therapy, volume repletion, requires that the rate of fluid administration be greater than the rate of ongoing fluid losses. One regimen that has been used is a fluid administration rate that is
         <strong>
          50 to 100 mL/hour above ongoing fluid losses
         </strong>

         The choice of replacement fluid may be influenced by concurrent abnormalities in serum sodium or potassium or the presence of metabolic acidosis. Potassium or bicarbonate may be added in patients who have hypokalemia or metabolic acidosis, respectively, while patients who are hypernatremic may be treated with one-half isotonic

         at two times the rate of isotonic saline therapy, respectively, to achieve the same degree of sodium repletion while also treating the hypernatremia. The choice of initial replacement fluid in hypernatremic patients is dependent upon the degree of hypernatremia. Careful monitoring of the rate of correction of the hypernatremia is important, with the composition and/or the rate of administration of the replacement fluid being adjusted accordingly. (See

         The following responses to fluid repletion are compatible with prerenal disease: restoration of adequate urine flow, improvement in kidney function, and a rise in urine-sodium concentration, which, if it is an isolated finding, can also reflect progression of prerenal disease to ATN. If the urine output does not increase, kidney function fails to improve with the restoration of intravascular volume, and prerenal disease is still suspected, invasive monitoring may be required to adequately assess the patient's volume status and help guide further therapy.

         The BUN/serum creatinine ratio is normal at 10 to 15:1 in ATN (measured in mg/dL) but is often greater than 20:1 in prerenal disease due to the increase in the passive reabsorption of urea that follows the enhanced proximal reabsorption of sodium and water [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. Thus, a high ratio suggests prerenal disease as long as other causes of a high ratio are not present. Other causes include gastrointestinal bleeding, which disproportionately increases the BUN, or loss of muscle mass in a chronically ill individual, which lowers creatinine [

         The serum creatinine concentration tends to rise progressively and usually at a daily rate greater than 0.3 to 0.5 mg/dL (26 to 44 micromol/L) per day in patients with ATN. A slower rate of rise with periodic downward fluctuations (due to variations in kidney perfusion) is suggestive of prerenal disease.

          Pathogenesis
         </strong>
         – The two major causes of acute kidney injury (AKI) developing in the hospital are prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Decreased kidney function due to prerenal disease occurs when kidney ischemia is part of a generalized decrease in tissue perfusion and when there is selective kidney ischemia. ATN can occur with prolonged and/or severe ischemia. This can result in histologic changes, including necrosis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction and definition'

         <strong>
          Etiology
         </strong>
         – Both prerenal disease and ATN can occur in a variety of settings. Prerenal disease may result from true volume depletion, hypotension, edematous states, and selective kidney ischemia, while ATN is principally due to all the causes of severe prerenal disease, particularly hypotension, sepsis, and nephrotoxins. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Evaluation
         </strong>
         – A careful history and physical examination can frequently identify events and/or disease processes that underlie prerenal disease or ATN, suggesting the underlying diagnosis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Evaluation and diagnosis'

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In addition to a careful history and physical examination, the initial evaluation to distinguish ATN from prerenal disease includes a number of laboratory measurements, close examination of the urine, and (if not contraindicated) fluid repletion. The principal diagnostic measures are urinalysis, response to fluid repletion, and fractional excretion of sodium (FENa). These three measures are used in combination with the clinical setting to help diagnose the underlying disorder. (See

         Urinalysis – The urinalysis is normal or near normal in prerenal disease; hyaline casts may be seen, but these are not an abnormal finding. In comparison, the classic urinalysis in ATN reveals muddy brown granular, epithelial cell casts, and free epithelial cells. However, the absence of these urinary findings does not exclude ATN. (See

         Fluid challenge (if appropriate) – The patient with a clinical history consistent with fluid loss, a physical examination consistent with hypovolemia (hypotension and tachycardia), and/or oliguria should be administered intravenous fluid therapy, unless contraindicated. This fluid challenge attempts to correct the fluid deficit and optimize kidney perfusion. (See

         Other tests – The FENa is typically less than 1 percent in prerenal disease (indicative of the sodium retention) and above 2 percent in ATN. There are conditions in which this distinction is not accurate, such as ATN superimposed upon a chronic prerenal state such as cirrhosis, a setting in which the FENa may remain below 1 percent. (See

         The serum creatinine is widely used in diagnosing the presence of AKI. However, since it is a suboptimal biomarker for this process, different urinary and serum proteins have been intensively investigated. Although there are promising candidate biomarkers, only one is approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States but not implemented in many medical centers. (See
