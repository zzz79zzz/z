         Acute placental abruption is a significant cause of both maternal morbidity and neonatal morbidity and mortality, particularly when it occurs preterm. Prompt intervention can reduce these risks. This topic will discuss the management of pregnancies complicated by acute abruption. The clinical features, diagnosis, and potential consequences of acute abruption are reviewed separately. (See

         </span>
         Pregnant people with symptoms of abruption should be evaluated promptly on a labor and delivery unit to establish the diagnosis, assess maternal and fetal status, and initiate appropriate management. Even those with an apparently small abruption who are initially stable may deteriorate rapidly if placental separation progresses or they develop sequelae from potential comorbidities, such as preeclampsia, trauma, or cocaine use.
        </p>
        <p>
         The following actions are reasonable initial interventions:

         Closely monitor maternal hemodynamic status (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, urine output). Assessment of multiple parameters is important because blood pressure in the normal range may mask hypovolemia if the mother has chronic hypertension or pregnancy-associated hypertension, which are risk factors for abruption.

         A quick and crude clotting test (Lee White test) can be performed at the bedside by placing 5 mL of the patient's blood in a tube with no anticoagulant for 10 minutes [

          1-3

         ]. Failure to clot within this time or dissolution of an initial clot implies impairment of coagulation and is suggestive of a low fibrinogen level. Prolonged oozing from needle puncture or surgical sites also suggests coagulopathy.

         Some clinicians believe urine toxicology is appropriate if substance misuse is suspected, while others believe verbal screening  (

         Patients with initially normal coagulation test results may develop coagulopathy over time. In those who continue to have (or develop) signs of moderate or severe abruption, notify the blood bank so blood replacement products (eg, red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, platelets) will be readily available, if needed, and repeat the blood count and coagulation studies. A critically low fibrinogen (≤200 mg/dL) is a common finding in severe abruption, thus early use of cryoprecipitate is often part of resuscitation.

         Replace blood and blood products, as required. If bleeding continues and the estimated blood loss has exceeded 500 to 1000 mL, we transfuse blood and initiate a massive transfusion protocol when the estimated or quantitative blood loss is &gt;1500 mL or when ≥4 units of blood are transfused (sample protocol: six units packed red blood cells, six units of fresh frozen plasma, one or two cryoprecipitate pools [each pool is composed of five individual units], and one dose of platelets [either a pool of four to six whole blood-derived platelet concentrates or a single apheresis platelet unit]).

         Our general approach to managing the most common clinical scenarios in patients with acute abruption is described below. In individual patients, some modification may be needed for patient-specific factors. No randomized trials and few observational studies have examined the management of pregnancies complicated by this disorder [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4

         ]. Therefore, our recommendations are based on case series and reports, personal experience, and good clinical judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a patient with abruption, the most important factors influencing the decision to deliver versus manage expectantly with close monitoring are gestational age (which affects the type and frequency of neonatal morbidity) and maternal and fetal status (which reflect the severity of the abruption). Delivery is required for term pregnancies and pregnancies complicated by a severe abruption (ie, maternal disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC], hypovolemic shock, need for blood transfusion, kidney failure; nonreassuring fetal heart rate pattern or biophysical profile; fetal growth restriction; fetal death) [

         The optimal route of birth in these cases minimizes the risk of maternal morbidity or mortality since fetal well-being is no longer a factor. In cases with a fetal demise, maternal coagulopathy should be assumed as typically &gt;50 percent of the placenta has separated. Early and aggressive use of blood and blood product replacement are often necessary. Unless vaginal birth appears imminent, expeditious delivery by cesarean is often desirable in this situation.

          Category III tracing (or biophysical profile score 0 to 4)
         </strong>
         – Expeditious delivery is indicated if the fetal heart rate pattern suggests an increased risk of fetal acidemia (ie, category III tracing). A biophysical profile score of 0/10 to 4/10 also suggests an increased risk of fetal acidemia and the need for expeditious delivery. Although tocolytics have been suggested for intrapartum resuscitation in response to intrapartum category III fetal heart rate tracings, we suggest not using tocolytics for this purpose in cases of suspected abruption as these medications can worsen any maternal hemodynamic instability and increase the volume of postpartum bleeding [

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Usually, cesarean is the preferred route of birth; however, if vaginal birth is imminent, then a spontaneous or instrument-assisted vaginal birth is likely the least morbid route of birth for the mother, regardless of hemodynamic status.

         In one of the only studies that evaluated cesarean birth for severe abruption with fetal bradycardia, a decision-to-delivery interval of less than 20 minutes was associated with better outcomes than a ≥30-minute interval [

          7
         </a>
         ]. Although this was a case-control study with only 33 cases, it underscores the principle that minimizing the duration of prolonged bradycardia before birth impacts outcome when the abruption is severe and supports our recommendation for urgent cesarean birth in cases of suspected abruption with fetal bradycardia.

          Category II tracing
         </strong>
         – Although a category II tracing may be managed expectantly in patients without abruption, it is ominous in the setting of a probable abruption because of the high risk for sudden fetal deterioration to a category III tracing and fetal death. Delivery management depends on gestational age, cervical dilation, and whether progressive deterioration in either the tracing or maternal condition is occurring. In particular, recurrent late decelerations or minimal/absent fetal heart rate variability should lead to emergency cesarean delivery. Close monitoring is essential, and preparations for urgent delivery should be made in expectantly managed cases. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16663.html" rel="external">

         For the stable mother, vaginal birth is desirable because it is generally less morbid than cesarean. Although a previous classical hysterotomy is a relative contraindication to labor and vaginal birth, the 4 to 9 percent risk of intrapartum rupture may be acceptable in the setting of fetal demise since cesarean birth has no fetal benefit. This decision should be individualized, taking into account factors such as cervical status and local resources for maternal care in the event of rupture. (See

         In all cases of fetal demise, maternal coagulopathy must be assumed, and blood and blood product replacement should be administered promptly.

         When the fetus and mother are both stable and there is no evidence of ongoing major blood loss or coagulopathy, conservative management with the aim of delivering a more mature fetus is the main goal before 34+0 weeks of gestation [

Contractions may be caused by the direct or indirect effect of thrombin and may lead to further placental separation, which may, in turn, cause further bleeding, creating a cycle of bleeding and contractions [

          12,13
         </a>
         ]. Administration of tocolytics may prevent further contractions, in theory breaking this cycle. However, tocolytics, especially beta-sympathomimetic agents such as

          Hospitalization
         </strong>
         – There are no compelling data to guide the length of a hospital stay for these patients. A reasonable approach is to monitor the patient in the hospital until the bleeding has subsided for at least 48 hours, fetal heart rate tracings and ultrasound examinations are reassuring, and the patient is asymptomatic. Discharge may be considered at that time for most patients; however, for patients with sonographic evidence of a large hematoma, we believe it is prudent to keep them in the hospital for a longer period for close monitoring since these patients may be at higher risk of prelabor rupture of membranes or progressive or recurrent placental separation.

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Patients who are discharged should be counseled to return immediately if they have more bleeding, contractions, decreased fetal movement, or abdominal pain. Sudden, catastrophic placental separation may occur without warning, regardless of whether patients are managed as inpatients or outpatients and regardless of the degree of initial placental separation. Therefore, a high index of suspicion for severe abruption and thorough patient counseling are important.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Delivery before 37+0 weeks is indicated if additional complications arise (eg, fetal growth restriction, preeclampsia, prelabor rupture of membranes, nonreassuring tests of fetal well-being, recurrent abruption with maternal instability).

Decision-making in these cases is based on patient-specific factors, balancing the estimated risk of progression/recurrence against the relatively small risk of complications associated with preterm birth at this gestational age.

         Patients with large hematomas, especially associated with oligohydramnios, are at high risk of fetal demise, preterm prelabor rupture of the membranes, and preterm birth. Expectant management with transfusion is an option for patients with substantial blood loss and a live fetus; hospitalization may be necessary. It is crucial that these patients be counseled about the risks for adverse maternal outcome and perinatal outcome. When coagulopathy is present, termination of the pregnancy may be the safest maternal option. (See

         In severe abruptions, blood may extravasate into the myometrium (called a Couvelaire uterus), which can be seen at cesarean. The Couvelaire uterus is atonic and prone to postpartum hemorrhage. Aggressive management of atony is needed to prevent disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and exsanguination; however, atony in this setting is less likely to respond to standard therapies for postpartum hemorrhage than atony from other causes; thus, these patients are at high risk for requiring hysterectomy.

         Because abruption, preeclampsia, and growth restriction appear to be variable clinical manifestations of uteroplacental underperfusion, in our practice, in subsequent pregnancies, we perform an ultrasound examination to screen for growth restriction approximately every four weeks starting at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation and continuing until birth. If growth restriction is detected, we manage these pregnancies accordingly. Monitoring for preeclampsia is already a standard focus of routine antenatal care. (See

         Routine periodic fetal antepartum surveillance (eg, nonstress test, biophysical profile score) in the absence of a documented high-risk condition is not helpful, as fetuses at risk of death from a sudden unpredictable insult, such as complete abruption, are rarely identified, and thus there is no opportunity for intervention to prevent fetal death or neurologic disability. Antenatal fetal testing is performed for standard obstetric indications. (See

         There are limited data on which to base timing of delivery in these patients.

Since most patients do not have a recurrence and most recurrences do not result in fetal death, a policy of delivery six weeks prior to the gestational age of the previous abruption would result in substantial morbidity from preterm birth, with minimal reduction in abruption-related perinatal death.

         There is increasing evidence that maternal vascular, metabolic, and inflammatory complications of pregnancy increase the risk for future cardiovascular disease (CVD; coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, peripheral arterial disease, transient ischemic attack, stroke). In a meta-analysis of 11 cohort studies including over 6 million pregnancies, nearly 70,000 abruptions, and nearly 50,000 cases of CVD (including stroke), the morbidity plus mortality rate from CVD among abruption and nonabruption groups was 16.7 and 9.3 per 1000 births, respectively (risk ratio [RR] 1.76, 95% CI 1.24-2.50) [

         – Pregnant people with bleeding, abdominal pain, or other symptoms suggestive of abruption should be evaluated promptly on a labor and delivery unit to establish the diagnosis, assess maternal and fetal status, and initiate appropriate management. A patient who is initially stable may deteriorate rapidly if placental separation progresses. (See

          'Initial approach for all patients'

         <strong>
          Evaluation
         </strong>
         – The initial approach includes continuous fetal heart rate monitoring, placement of large bore intravenous lines, assessment of blood loss and maternal hemodynamic status, ruling out other causes of bleeding (eg, placenta previa, vasa previa, cervical polyps or lesions), and evaluation for coagulopathy. Blood and blood products should be replaced aggressively, when indicated. An ultrasound should be performed to assess fetal growth, amniotic fluid volume, fetal activity, placental location and appearance, and evidence of clots/hematomas. (See

          Stabilization and triage
         </strong>
         – After initial evaluation and stabilization, the management of pregnancies complicated by clinically significant abruption depends on whether the fetus is alive or dead, maternal hemodynamic stability, and, if the fetus is alive, the fetal heart rate pattern and gestational age. (See

         <strong>
          Fetal demise
         </strong>
         – If the fetus is dead, the mode of delivery should minimize the risk of maternal morbidity or mortality. For most hemodynamically stable patients without coagulopathy, vaginal birth is preferable. Cesarean birth is preferable when vaginal birth is not imminent and rapid control of bleeding is required because of maternal hemodynamic instability or significant coagulopathy, or the mother is unwilling to accept adequate blood replacement therapy and is therefore likely to develop hemodynamic instability or coagulopathy during labor. (See
         <a class="local">

          Nonreassuring fetal heart rate pattern
         </strong>
         – When the fetal heart rate pattern is nonreassuring (category III), expeditious delivery is indicated. If vaginal birth is imminent, then a spontaneous or instrument-assisted vaginal birth is preferable, whether or not the mother is hemodynamically stable. Otherwise, cesarean birth is indicated. (See
         <a class="local">

         A category II tracing is ominous in the setting of a probable abruption because of the high risk for sudden fetal deterioration to a category III tracing and fetal death. A category II fetal heart rate pattern with recurrent late decelerations or minimal or absent variability is particularly ominous. Close monitoring is essential, and preparations for urgent delivery should be made in expectantly managed cases. (See

         For most pregnancies &lt;34+0 weeks of gestation with no evidence of ongoing major blood loss or coagulopathy, we suggest conservative management until 37+0 to 38+0 weeks. We administer a course of antenatal corticosteroids (see

          'Abruption at &lt;34+0 weeks of gestation'

For the subgroup of patients at 34+0 to 35+6 weeks who present with minimal signs and symptoms of abruption (eg, light bleeding, normal vital signs and laboratory results, uterine quiescence or mild irritability without tenderness, normal fetal heart rate pattern/biophysical profile score) and then stop bleeding, expectant management is a reasonable approach as long as they remain asymptomatic.

          Couvelaire uterus
         </strong>
         – The Couvelaire uterus is atonic and prone to postpartum hemorrhage. Aggressive management of atony is needed to prevent disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and exsanguination; however, atony in this setting is less likely to respond to standard therapies for postpartum hemorrhage than atony from other causes. These patients are at high risk for requiring hysterectomy. (See

         – The risk of recurrent abruption is 3 to 15 percent, compared with a baseline incidence of 0.4 to 1.3 percent in the general population. No intervention has been proven to lower the risk of recurrent abruption, and no tests are available that identify pregnancies at risk of recurrence or fetuses at risk of harm. (See

         <strong>
          Prognosis
         </strong>
         – A past history of placental abruption also predicts a greater likelihood of a small for gestational age neonate, preeclampsia, and spontaneous preterm birth in future pregnancies, even in the absence of recurrent abruption. We monitor patients for these complications.

          Timing of delivery
