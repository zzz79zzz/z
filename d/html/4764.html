Late complications of treatment for cHL include cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, and second malignancies. </p><p>Survivors of cHL treatment have an increased relative risk for developing a second cancer compared with the general population, but the absolute incidence of these cancers varies widely. The types of second cancer (eg, solid tumor, acute leukemia, another lymphoma) and the time course of development vary with the previous treatment (ie, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy) and host factors (eg, age at treatment, smoking). </p><p>This topic discusses second malignancies that occur in patients who have been treated for cHL.</p><p>Long-term follow-up of patients with HL, risk of second malignancy after hematopoietic cell transplantation, and other complications are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14232.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult survivor of classic Hodgkin lymphoma"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4316.html" rel="external">"Bleomycin-induced lung injury"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3558.html" rel="external">"Secondary cancers after hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90854.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/107443.html" rel="external">"Risk and prevention of anthracycline cardiotoxicity"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">GENERAL OBSERVATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients treated with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy (RT) for cHL have an increased risk of developing solid tumors and hematologic malignancies when compared with the general population [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>]. These second cancers have a significant impact on survival from HL. The relative risk of developing a second malignancy has varied greatly among studies and depends on factors related to the patient and the treatment, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Radiation dose and fields</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chemotherapy agents and doses administered</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient age at treatment</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Length of time after treatment</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Family history</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Smoking history</p><p></p><p>In addition to these factors, certain patients may have a genetic predisposition toward developing second malignancies after treatment of cHL. As an example, a genome-wide association study in survivors of cHL treated with RT reported that patients with certain single nucleotide polymorphisms at chromosome 6q21 were more likely to develop a second malignancy [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Further study of candidate genes in this region may reveal new data regarding the pathogenesis of second malignancies in this population.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3376329625"><span class="h2">Effect of elapsed time</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most deaths in the first 5 to 10 years after treatment are associated with relapse of HL, while later deaths are more likely to be due to other causes (eg, second malignancy, cardiovascular disease). The cumulative incidence of mortality from HL is exceeded by mortality due to other causes after 14 years from treatment  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71648" href="/z/d/graphic/71648.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. Although death from HL abates with time, the absolute excess risk of mortality from other causes remains elevated, with no apparent diminution of the excess risk beyond 20 to 30 years [<a href="#rid4">4,6,8-10</a>]. Importantly, all-cause mortality risk among long-term cHL survivors is significantly lower in patients treated in a more recent era [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>Different types of cancer exhibit distinct temporal patterns of development after treatment of cHL. As an example, in patients who received alkylator-based regimens, the risk of developing leukemia peaks at five to nine years post-treatment, whereas solid tumors typically develop after a latency period of ≥10 years [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. In one series, the median time to onset of acute leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and solid tumors was 5, 7.3, and 12.2 years, respectively [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The relative and absolute excess risks for particular cancers in an individual may differ from those observed in the entire patient population.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Relative and absolute risks</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Solid tumors account for most second malignancies in cHL survivors, with breast, lung, and gastrointestinal cancer being the most common. Although hematologic cancers are less common overall, the relative risk compared with the general population is higher. </p><p>The estimated overall relative risks in 11 large cohort studies were:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Leukemia – 10 to 80-fold</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>NHL – 3- to 35-fold</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Solid tumors (lung, breast, bone, stomach, colon, thyroid, melanoma) – &gt;2-fold</p><p></p><p>Leukemia and NHL are diseases with a low incidence in the general population; as a result, an increase in their relative risk following the treatment of cHL (ie, up to 80-fold) does not translate into a high likelihood of developing leukemia or NHL. In addition, the risk of leukemia in this study reflects the use of chemotherapy regimens, such as MOPP and MOPP/ABVD, which are no longer the standard of care. On the other hand, even though the relative risk of developing a solid tumor is lower (ie, twofold), the cumulative number of solid tumors that develop over the entire follow-up period is much higher than the number of cases of leukemia or NHL, because the incidence of solid tumors in the general population is so much higher  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57099" href="/z/d/graphic/57099.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>The absolute number of second cancers in patients with cHL that may be attributable to treatment (ie, excess cases) is estimated to be 40 to 90 malignancies per 10,000 patients per year (0.4 to 0.7 percent per year)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57099" href="/z/d/graphic/57099.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid8">8,12-17</a>]. Several retrospective case series have reported an actuarial risk of second cancer of 11 to 18 percent at 15 years [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]; 20 percent at 20 years [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>]; 28 percent at 25 years [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]; and 33 percent at 30 years [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>A combined analysis of three large studies including 6292 patients showed that ≥10 years after first treatment, lung cancer contributed most to the absolute excess cancer risk, with 34 excess cases per 10,000 cHL patients per year [<a href="#rid12">12,15,18</a>]. NHL (28/10,000 per year) was second, and leukemia (10/10,000 per year) third. In females, breast cancer accounted for the largest absolute excess risk (40/10,000 per year) in 10-year survivors.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Treatment risk factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The risk for various cancers varies with the specific treatment. As an example, chemotherapy that includes alkylating agents (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9815" href="/z/d/drug information/9815.html" rel="external">procarbazine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a>), such as escalated BEACOPP, second-line chemotherapy, and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT), are at increased risk for therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN), including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), whereas ABVD, which does not include alkylating agents is not associated with the development of t-MN. The development of secondary lung cancer appears to be related to the use of radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. </p><p>A meta-analysis of randomized studies of cHL treated from 1984 to 2007 identified 9498 patients with individual patient-level data [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. With a median follow-up of more than seven years, intensified chemotherapy was associated with improved progression-free survival (PFS), but a higher risk of t-MN, including MDS and AML. In patients who received combined modality therapy (CMT) versus chemotherapy alone, there were no differences in PFS or overall survival (OS), but there were more secondary malignancies in patients who received RT. In comparing involved-field versus extended-field and lower dose (20 Gy) versus higher dose RT, there was no significant change in rates of secondary malignancies. </p><p>A series of 5798 patients with cHL treated in Britain between 1963 and 2001, the relative risk (RR) of developing a second malignancy was higher with combined chemotherapy plus RT (RR 3.9) than with chemotherapy alone (RR 2.0) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Among patients treated with chemotherapy alone, the excess second malignancies were leukemia, NHL, and lung cancer. In this population, the excess risk peaked five to nine years after chemotherapy administration and was close to baseline by 15 years. In contrast, combination chemotherapy plus RT was associated with several other types of second malignancy and the excess risk remained for 25 years or longer.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Prognosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patient survival after the diagnosis of a second cancer is generally poor. In our series, the five-year survival rate after the development of a second malignancy was 38 percent, with the worst prognosis seen in those developing acute leukemia or lung cancer [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Patients who develop acute leukemia or MDS have a two-year survival rate of approximately 10 percent, while those who develop NHL or a solid tumor have 5- and 10-year survival rates of approximately 32 and 23 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Similarly, in another study, the median survival from diagnosis of second tumor was approximately 42 months and was especially poor in patients developing a second cancer following an HL diagnosis at the age of 40 years or older (median survival: approximately one year) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>Second cancers have a significant impact on survival from cHL [<a href="#rid14">14,16,22</a>]. The range of findings can be illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a 20-year follow-up study of almost 1300 patients (median follow-up 9.2 years) who were treated between 1966 and 1986, the cumulative risk of dying from cHL or acute treatment toxicity was 33 percent, while the risk of dying from a second cancer was 14 percent and that from all other causes was 20 percent [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Virtually identical findings were noted in a report from the International Database on Hodgkin's Disease [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The overall probability of 20-year survival in 14,315 patients with HL who were treated between 1960 and 1987 (average follow-up 6.7 years) was 50 percent; 37 percent died from cHL or acute treatment toxicity, and 10 percent died from a second cancer.</p><p></p><p>Patients who develop a second cancer are also at risk of developing a third cancer. In one series of 3122 Dutch patients treated for cHL between 1965 and 1995 and followed for a median of 23 years, 832 developed a second malignancy and 126 developed a third [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. The median time from cHL to second malignancy was 19 years and from second to third was four years. Cancer screening in long-term survivors of cHL is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14232.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult survivor of classic Hodgkin lymphoma", section on 'Late complications'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h1">NON-HODGKIN LYMPHOMA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While the relative risk (compared with the general population) of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is increased among cHL survivors, the absolute number of cases is low due to the low incidence in the general population. The reported incidence of NHL in large series of cHL survivors has ranged from 0.9 percent at an average follow-up of 6.7 years (0.6 percent in the subset in continuous complete remission) [<a href="#rid16">16,24</a>] to 1.6 percent at 15 years [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. The relative risk for NHL progressively increased with follow-up time in most [<a href="#rid14">14-16,25</a>] but not all studies [<a href="#rid12">12,26</a>]. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma is the most common subtype, accounting for 78 percent of the cases [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p>The largest experience comes from the International Database on Hodgkin's Disease, which evaluated the course of 12,411 patients with an average follow-up of 6.7 years [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. One-hundred-six cases of NHL were observed with a continuous increase in relative risk with follow-up in males (from 28.2 during the five- to nine-year period, to 120 during the 15- to 19-year period). In females, the risk increase was confined to the first 15 years, with a peak relative risk of 45.4 during the five- to nine-year observation period.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h2">Risk factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is little agreement on definitive risk factors for NHL in patients treated for cHL. It is possible that differences among studies represent differences in the patient populations examined. It is also possible that pathologic misclassification may confound the results, with recurrent cHL being misdiagnosed as NHL or NHL being initially misdiagnosed as cHL. This issue is of lesser concern when modern histopathologic techniques are used. Only a few studies have included expert review of the original tissue diagnosis as part of the study [<a href="#rid12">12,18,24</a>]. The risk of NHL appears to have declined over the past decade, perhaps related to the use of less immunosuppressive chemotherapy regimens in the initial treatment of cHL. In our experience, second NHLs seen after modern treatment regimens for cHL are more likely to be low-grade subtypes; a greater frequency of high-grade NHL was seen previously when more immunosuppressive regimens were used.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17"><span class="h3">Treatment modality</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are conflicting data concerning the impact of initial treatment modality on the risk of subsequent NHL. Several studies have found no apparent differences in increased risk between patients treated with chemotherapy alone, radiation therapy (RT) alone, or a combination modality [<a href="#rid12">12,13,15,26</a>]. However, other reports suggested an increased risk with combined modality treatment and treatment for relapse. A large International Database study included 106 patients who developed NHL; combined modality treatment and any type of treatment for relapse were associated with increased risk for NHL with relative risks of 2.2 to 4.5 [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18"><span class="h3">Host factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are also conflicting data on the importance of host factors such as sex and age on the risk for NHL. Some studies noted no relationship between these factors and NHL [<a href="#rid27">27</a>], while the International Database and report from the Netherlands Cancer Institute found that increasing age over 30 and, to a lesser degree, male sex were risk factors [<a href="#rid16">16,18</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19"><span class="h3">Tumor factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The development of NHL may be related in part to the diagnosis of cHL itself rather than its treatment. In particular, the histologic subtype of cHL and the immunosuppressive effects of cHL may influence the risk of NHL.</p><p>The risk of developing NHL differs among patients with different cHL histologies, with the greatest risk for NHL occurring in patients with nodular lymphocyte predominant disease (NLPHL) and the lowest risk in patients with nodular sclerosis HL (NSHL) [<a href="#rid16">16,18,27,28</a>]. In one study, for example, the relative risk of NHL among cHL survivors compared with the general population was 55.6 with NLPHL compared with 9.8 with NSHL [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. In another report, NHL occurred in 22 of 3033 patients with cHL randomized into clinical trials by the British National Lymphoma Investigation [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. The frequency of NHL ranged from 3.8 percent in NLPHL to 0.3 percent in NSHL. It has been suggested that the transformation to NHL may be part of the natural history of NLPHL, rather than being related to therapy [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Alternatively, it is often difficult to distinguish NLPHL from NHL, and in some cases the "secondary NHL" may simply be a recurrence of the initial disease.</p><p>In addition, cHL may be associated with a general state of immunosuppression [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>], which can predispose to the development of NHL as in transplant recipients. Support for this hypothesis comes from a detailed study of 14 patients who developed NHL within a median of 136 months from the diagnosis of cHL [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. The high prevalence of extranodal sites, either intermediate or high-grade lymphoma subtype, and immunophenotypic findings typical of NHL of B cell lineage patients were similar to those of NHL arising in immunosuppressed patients. It has been our experience that the incidence of NHL after cHL has decreased, perhaps due to the reduction or disuse of myelosuppressive agent combinations such as MOPP. In addition, we are now seeing more indolent NHL after cHL.

The risk of solid tumor development depends greatly on the type of treatment, age at treatment, follow-up interval, and family history.</p><p>The excess risk of lung and breast cancers appears to be related to their proximity to the radiation portals. As an example, in one study of 202 patients surviving at least five years after treatment for cHL, 20 of the 26 solid tumors following primary treatment were found within or adjoining the irradiated fields [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p>The overall relative risk for solid cancer, compared with general population expectations, is approximately 1.5 to 4.5 in long-term follow-up of studies of predominantly adults  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57099" href="/z/d/graphic/57099.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid13">13,15,16,18,33-38</a>] but much larger (approximately 12) in children [<a href="#rid39">39,40</a>].

The risk is inversely related to age at initial treatment. In one study, compared with the general population, patients who were first treated at age 31 to 39, 21 to 30, and 20 years of age or less, had a solid tumor relative risk of 4.9, 6.9, and 12.7, respectively [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>The risk of solid cancer overall is increased after radiation therapy (RT) [<a href="#rid12">12,14,15,34,39,42,45</a>].

In the British National Lymphoma Investigation, for example, one-third of all excess malignancies were lung cancers [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. In contrast, an American study found that breast cancer was most common, with only 10 percent of excess second malignancies being lung cancers [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The relative risk of lung cancer is only slightly increased in the first five years after treatment, with larger relative risks (usually five or more) thereafter until at least 20 years [<a href="#rid12">12,14-16,36,42,50,56</a>]. The relative risk of lung cancer is highest in patients treated with both chemotherapy and radiation before age 25; after this age, the relative risk of second lung cancers decreases in patients treated with radiation but not with chemotherapy [<a href="#rid40">40,49,56</a>]. Lung cancers after chemotherapy occur earlier than those following RT.</p><p>The prognosis of patients diagnosed with lung cancer following treatment of cHL is worse than that of patients with de novo lung cancer. This was illustrated in a retrospective analysis that compared outcomes among the 187 of 22,648 cHL survivors who developed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with those of 178,431 patients with de novo NSCLC [<a href="#rid57">57</a>].

In one study, the risk of lung cancer was threefold higher in cHL survivors with a first-degree relative with lung cancer, compared with those without a positive family history [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. In that study, there was a more than additive interaction between a positive family history of lung cancer and cHL treatment.</p><p>In patients who have received radiation, most of the tumors are found within or adjoining the irradiated fields [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Patients who receive higher radiation doses appear to be at greater risk. One study, for example, found a strong dose-response relationship between radiation dose and the risk of lung cancer at that site [<a href="#rid58">58</a>]. There was a relative risk of 9.6 for a dose of &gt;9 Gy compared with &lt;1 Gy, with a possible downturn in risk for doses of 15 Gy or greater [<a href="#rid58">58</a>]. The decrease in lung cancer risk at the highest doses has also been noted after RT for breast cancer [<a href="#rid59">59</a>].</p><p>Chemotherapy appears to play a definite role in the development of second lung cancers following treatment of cHL. In one mature series of second malignancies occurring after treatment in 5519 British patients with cHL, lung cancer risk was significantly increased after chemotherapy (relative risk [RR] 3.3), RT (RR 2.9), and mixed modality treatment (RR 4.3) [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. Most other studies have found an increased risk of lung cancer with chemotherapy treatment [<a href="#rid12">12,34,42,56,60</a>], but some have not [<a href="#rid18">18,36,58</a>].</p><p>There are conflicting data on whether certain regimens, such as those including <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9569" href="/z/d/drug information/9569.html" rel="external">lomustine</a> and or multiple alkylating agents, are more likely to increase the risk [<a href="#rid12">12,58</a>]. As an example, in two reports, the risk of lung cancer was significantly greater in those receiving MOPP chemotherapy as compared with those not receiving MOPP; further, the risk increased with the number of cycles of MOPP [<a href="#rid61">61,62</a>]. In one of these studies, the risk of lung cancer was not increased following <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9240" href="/z/d/drug information/9240.html" rel="external">chlorambucil</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10044" href="/z/d/drug information/10044.html" rel="external">vinblastine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9815" href="/z/d/drug information/9815.html" rel="external">procarbazine</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> (ChlVPP), implicating mechlorethamine rather than procarbazine [<a href="#rid61">61</a>]. In the other, both mechlorethamine and procarbazine were implicated [<a href="#rid62">62</a>].</p><p>Smoking appears to considerably increase the risk of lung cancer after chest RT (RR of 13 for ever-smokers compared with never-smokers in one series) [<a href="#rid60">60</a>]. The risk seems to be significantly increased in relation to the amount smoked after the diagnosis of cHL (but not the amount smoked before diagnosis) [<a href="#rid58">58</a>]. There appears to be a more than a multiplicative relation between smoking-related and radiation-related risks (ie, the RR for smoking plus RT was greater than would be obtained by multiplying the separate RRs for these exposures). Similar findings were noted in a case-control study in which the risk of lung cancer after treatment with both alkylating agents and RT was additive, while the risk of smoking was multiplicative  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78440" href="/z/d/graphic/78440.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid62">62</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H24"><span class="h3">Screening</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is evidence that low dose computed tomography (CT) scanning for patients at high risk for lung cancer allows for the discovery of a higher percentage of early stage disease, although the role of screening still remains controversial [<a href="#rid63">63,64</a>]. Screening recommendations are presented in more detail separately. In one single institution retrospective study, long-term survival in patients who developed lung cancer after cHL was only seen when the second cancer was identified as an incidental finding, providing additional evidence to support screening in high risk patients [<a href="#rid65">65</a>].

However, the importance of these factors is not well established and, to the degree that it induces premature menopause, MOPP might actually be protective, but this regimen has been largely replaced by ABVD, which is not associated with premature menopause.

Treatment with both chemotherapy (MOPP or MOPP-like) and RT was associated with a significantly lower risk of developing breast cancer than treatment with RT alone (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.22-0.91). Premature menopause following chemotherapy and/or pelvic (ovarian) radiation also resulted in a lessened risk. Taken together, these results suggest that hormonal stimulation may promote tumorigenesis in patients with cHL after RT has produced an initiating event. These results also suggest that treatment with preventative agents such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/z/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a> might provide a strategy to reduce breast cancer incidence in high-risk patients.

The risk for developing breast cancer was nearly doubled in females treated for cHL who had a first-degree relative with breast cancer, compared with those without a positive family history [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. However, one retrospective study investigated the potential contribution of pregnancy to the late development of breast cancer in 382 females with cHL [<a href="#rid81">81</a>]. Females receiving RT during pregnancy or within one month of pregnancy had an increased incidence of breast cancer compared with nonpregnant females and females receiving RT later than one month after completion of pregnancy (hazard ratio 22, 95% CI 6-91).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27"><span class="h3">Clinical and pathologic characteristics</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several retrospective studies have described the clinical and pathologic features of patients who developed breast cancer after treatment for cHL. Patients with second cancers appear to be younger with a higher incidence of bilateral disease than females with primary breast cancer.

There have been several small hospital-based case-control and case-series evaluating the pathologic features of breast cancer in cHL survivors [<a href="#rid82">82-87</a>].</p><p>The largest study was an analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database which included 2645 female patients who were diagnosed with cHL before age 35, treated with RT as part of their initial therapy between 1973 and 2000, and survived at least five years from initial therapy [<a href="#rid88">88</a>]. When compared with the general population, these patients had a sixfold increased risk of developing invasive breast cancer. The majority was ductal adenocarcinoma (79 percent) and developed in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. When compared with sporadic breast cancers, these tumors were more likely to display features associated with poor outcome such as estrogen and progesterone receptor negativity and high grade. Other studies have not seen these differences.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H28"><span class="h3">Prognosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prognosis of patients who develop breast cancer after treatment of cHL is variable, but appears to be worse overall than that of patients who develop breast cancer de novo [<a href="#rid89">89</a>]. However, because of the heightened awareness of the breast cancer risk, some studies have shown that these tumors are picked up at an early stage and have a good prognosis despite the presence of poor prognostic features. The prognosis is dependent on nodal status at presentation, as in patients with primary breast cancer. As an example, a study at Harvard Medical School evaluating MRI versus mammography has detected 16 breast cancers; only one patient had node-positive disease suggesting a relatively good prognosis for patients who develop breast cancer that is detected by careful surveillance after treatment of cHL.</p><p>In one series, for example, the five-year disease-free survival rates were much higher for patients with node-negative tumors compared with those with axillary involvement (85 versus 33 percent) [<a href="#rid82">82</a>]. In another report, the five-year disease-specific survival rate for pN0, pN1-3, and pN greater than 3, were 91, 66, and zero percent, respectively [<a href="#rid83">83</a>]. In addition, the tumor aggressiveness appears to vary. (See <a class="local">'Clinical and pathologic characteristics'</a> above.)</p><p>The majority of females who develop breast cancer and require local therapy to the breast are treated with mastectomy because of the risk of tissue necrosis after repeat irradiation of the breast [<a href="#rid66">66</a>]. With the use of partial breast irradiation with brachytherapy or conformal external beam irradiation, it may be possible to use lumpectomy and RT for patients with limited stage disease [<a href="#rid90">90</a>]. However, this approach should be offered as part of a clinical investigation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H29"><span class="h3">Screening</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A vigorous patient education program coupled with an early detection program for female patients treated with mantle irradiation might lead to earlier detection and improved survival [<a href="#rid66">66,91-94</a>]. One prospective trial for patients who were under 35 years of age at treatment demonstrated that the use of MRI, in addition to screening mammograms in this high risk population, identified additional breast cancers when compared with mammography alone [<a href="#rid95">95</a>].</p><p>Small prospective trials and retrospective analyses have demonstrated that screening programs can detect breast cancers in this population at an early stage. As an example, a prospective study of 90 female long-term survivors of cHL, all of whom had been treated with mantle irradiation, included patient questionnaires concerning awareness of the increased risk for breast cancer, written recommendations for breast examination and mammography, and annual follow-up [<a href="#rid96">96</a>]. Ten females developed 12 breast cancers during the study. All were evident on mammography; 8 of the 10 invasive cancers were node negative.</p><p>A retrospective study evaluated the use of screening breast MRI in 91 females with a history of chest irradiation [<a href="#rid97">97</a>]. The median age at the time of primary cancer diagnosis and presumed age at mediastinal radiation was 24 years. A total of 247 screening MRI examinations were performed over nine years. Suspicious lesions were detected on 27 MRI images (11 percent) among 21 patients, 30 of which were biopsied. Ten breast cancers were diagnosed; of these, four were detected by MRI alone, three were identifiable on MRI and mammography, while three were detected with mammography alone. These results suggest that MRI may provide additional information to that obtained by mammography but cannot be used in place of screening mammography in this population.</p><p>A prospective trial at Harvard Medical School performed annual breast MRI and mammogram over a three-year period in 148 females who had been treated with chest irradiation for cHL at age 35 years or younger and were greater than eight years beyond therapy [<a href="#rid95">95</a>]. Of 63 biopsies performed in 45 females, 18 (29 percent) detected a malignancy, all but one of which were preinvasive or subcentimeter node-negative disease. MRI detected five breast cancers that were missed by mammography, while mammography detected six breast cancers missed by MRI. MRI was associated with a higher false positive rate and led to more negative biopsies than mammography. Screening with MRI, mammogram, or both was associated with sensitivities of 67, 68, and 94 percent and specificities of 94, 93, and 90 percent, respectively, for the detection of breast cancer.</p><p>Outside of a clinical trial, our practice is to perform annual mammography in females treated with mantle irradiation starting 8 to 10 years after treatment or at age 40, whichever is first [<a href="#rid98">98</a>]. For patients who were age 30 or younger at treatment, we recommend an annual breast MRI as an adjunct to mammography. The American Cancer Society and American College of Radiology and the Society for Breast Imaging have recommended MRI screening in cHL survivors at high risk for breast cancer, such as those who received radiation to the chest between the ages of 10 and 35 years  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78361" href="/z/d/graphic/78361.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid99">99-101</a>]. The combination of mammography plus ultrasound may be an acceptable, less costly, alternative in this age group [<a href="#rid102">102</a>]. Either of these more intensive screening methods would be expected to increase the rate of false positives. However, earlier detection by such intense screening may also allow a subgroup to avoid cytotoxic drugs and further exposure to radiation.

After a median follow-up of 18.1 years, malignant mesothelioma had been diagnosed in eight males and five females with a median time from treatment of cHL to diagnosis of mesothelioma of 27.7 years.
