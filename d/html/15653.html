DM, unlike PM, is associated with a variety of characteristic skin manifestations. A form of DM, termed clinically amyopathic DM (CADM, also known as dermatomyositis sine myositis), is a condition in which patients have characteristic skin findings of DM without objective muscle weakness. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5159.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults"</a>.)</p><p>There is growing understanding that the term PM is falling out of favor given the increased understanding that many cases that would previously have been classified as PM are now better classified as the antisynthetase syndrome (without a characteristic rash), overlap myositis (with another connective tissue disease), or immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM). While it is now understood that muscle biopsy features are distinct in IMNM, previous studies often labeled these cases as PM, assuming the primary inflammation had been missed on the muscle biopsy sampling.</p><p>The diagnosis and differential diagnosis of DM and "PM" in adults will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and treatment of these diseases and of the related disorders that occur in children (known as juvenile DM and PM); malignancy in patients with DM and PM; and the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of inclusion body myositis (IBM) are discussed separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14918.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of inflammatory myopathies"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6419.html" rel="external">"Juvenile dermatomyositis and other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5159.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5160.html" rel="external">"Initial treatment of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5133.html" rel="external">"Treatment of recurrent and resistant dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13771.html" rel="external">"Cutaneous dermatomyositis in adults: Overview and initial management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13774.html" rel="external">"Management of refractory cutaneous dermatomyositis in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6418.html" rel="external">"Juvenile dermatomyositis and polymyositis: Treatment, complications, and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5162.html" rel="external">"Malignancy in dermatomyositis and polymyositis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5163.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of inclusion body myositis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5164.html" rel="external">"Management of inclusion body myositis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3970526696"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4005533043"><span class="h2">When to suspect the diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of dermatomyositis (DM) or polymyositis (PM) should be suspected in patients who present with proximal muscle weakness. The suspicion for DM in particular should be further increased if the patient has a cutaneous eruption suggestive of DM. Both PM and DM often have elevated creatine kinase (CK) at presentation, which may also raise suspicion of the disease in a patient presenting with weakness leading to difficulty in activities of daily living.</p><p>The diagnosis of clinically amyopathic DM (CADM) should be suspected in a patient presenting with a characteristic cutaneous eruption in the absence of muscle weakness, although some patients may have mild abnormalities in muscle-derived enzymes, electromyography (EMG), muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or muscle biopsy. Notably, despite lacking clinically meaningful muscle involvement, these patients may have associated systemic disease including interstitial lung disease or malignancy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13771.html" rel="external">"Cutaneous dermatomyositis in adults: Overview and initial management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23127474"><span class="h2">Initial evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients suspected of having DM or PM, the initial presentation generally determines the nature and scope of testing that may be required to confirm the diagnosis and to exclude other disorders that may cause similar weakness, cutaneous eruptions, or multisystem disease. In addition, the initial workup often involves input from different subspecialists and may include referral to a dermatologist, a rheumatologist, a pulmonologist, and/or a neurologist (neuromuscular specialist), depending on the predominant symptoms and clinical findings.</p><p>The evaluation begins with a careful history and physical examination, as well as selected laboratory testing. Additionally, the evaluation should help to differentiate patients with DM and PM from those with other conditions, including other systemic rheumatic diseases and metabolic, infectious, or malignant disorders, other causes of photosensitive or pruritic cutaneous eruptions, as well as neuropathies, neuromuscular diseases, and other myopathies, including drug-induced myopathy, metabolic myopathies, muscle dystrophies, and inclusion body myositis (IBM). (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3521417676"><span class="h3">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients should be questioned regarding the duration, mode of onset, location, and severity of weakness and/or cutaneous eruptions. The patient should be asked about their ability to carry out various activities that they commonly perform, such as climbing stairs, getting up from a chair, and carrying heavy groceries or other objects. The severity and distribution of myalgia, as well as the presence or absence of significant muscle or joint pain, swelling, or stiffness, should be assessed. True muscle weakness should be distinguished from complaints of fatigue or shortness of breath with exertion and from limitation due to joint disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5155.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with muscle weakness"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5159.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Regarding the skin, a history of photosensitivity and pruritus should be ascertained. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5159.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults", section on 'Skin findings in dermatomyositis'</a>.)</p><p>Patients should be asked about a history of dysphagia, which may suggest esophageal involvement, and of cough or shortness of breath, which may occur due to pulmonary involvement. Symptoms of other systemic rheumatic diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc), that may identify an overlap syndrome should be sought, and patients should be queried about cutaneous eruptions, photosensitivity, pruritus, fever, and Raynaud phenomenon. Patients should also be queried regarding whether they have been experiencing any symptoms suggesting malignancy and what screening and other testing has been performed for screening for cancer. The timing of the use of any drugs that may cause myopathy, particularly statins, should be determined. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5162.html" rel="external">"Malignancy in dermatomyositis and polymyositis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5166.html" rel="external">"Drug-induced myopathies"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6833.html" rel="external">"Statin muscle-related adverse events"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3487797362"><span class="h3">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Examination of the skin, muscles, and joints is central. Characteristic findings on skin examination should be identified, if present, but they are sometimes subtle. A thorough examination of the skin should be performed with particular attention to the scalp, face, eyelids, hands, feet, extensor surfaces, upper chest and back, arms, lateral thighs, and joints. A nailfold examination should also be performed, evaluating for periungual erythema as well as nailfold capillary abnormalities. A general physical examination should be performed, with particular attention to the heart and lungs, which should be carefully auscultated for pulmonary crackles. A thorough joint examination should be carried out to detect signs of inflammatory arthritis. A detailed neurologic and neuromuscular examination is critical to determine the severity and distribution of weakness and of muscle tenderness, as well as the presence or absence of other abnormal neurologic findings that may be indicative of a clinical myositis mimic. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5159.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults", section on 'Skin findings in dermatomyositis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5159.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults", section on 'Muscle weakness'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1117720185"><span class="h3">Laboratory testing and imaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We obtain the following general laboratory tests:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>CK – CK is the most sensitive muscle enzyme and should be tested and followed in all patients with suspected DM or PM. Patients may also have an elevation of other muscle-derived enzymes including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Aldolase may occasionally be useful in cases in which the CK is normal, as a small percentage of patients may have an elevated aldolase level, which suggests there may be perimysial involvement. However, we do not routinely test for aldolase. Elevations in aldolase may be suggestive of fasciitis, connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease [<a href="#rid6">6</a>], or a myositis associated with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Complete blood count with differential.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Comprehensive metabolic panel.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and/or C-reactive protein (CRP) – The CRP and/or ESR are often normal or only mildly elevated, even in patients with active muscle disease [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Markedly elevated CRP and/or ESR in a patient with an inflammatory myopathy should raise the suspicion of a coexisting infection, underlying malignancy, or could be seen in some cases of acute/subacute antisynthetase syndrome or anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5)-positive disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).</p><p></p><p>We also perform the following serologic tests, which may support the diagnosis if positive:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Myositis-specific autoantibodies (often available as a panel) including anti-Jo-1</strong> – Myositis-specific autoantibodies are associated with particular clinical syndromes within the idiopathic inflammatory myopathy spectrum, which includes DM and PM. These tests are positive in 45 to 85 percent of patients [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]; thus, a negative myositis panel does not rule out a diagnosis of DM or PM. Many experts use myositis autoantibody panels to determine what particular myositis phenotype may best fit the patient rather than to make a diagnosis of myositis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127066.html" rel="external">"Overview of and approach to the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies", section on 'Myositis-specific autoantibodies'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In many clinical settings, serologic test panels for idiopathic inflammatory myopathy are available from reference laboratories, in an effort to eliminate the need to order the numerous autoantibody tests individually. However, the results are often not available for several weeks, and treatment decisions may need to be made before the specific serologic profile is known. In addition, many commercially available myositis panels have varying degrees of accuracy. Hence, using careful clinical judgment based on the patient's examination and other studies is crucial.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Myositis-associated autoantibodies including anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB, anti-Sm, anti-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) antibodies, anti-PM-Scl, and anti-Ku antibodies</strong> – Myositis-associated autoantibodies are those found in patients with other systemic rheumatic diseases that can be associated with myositis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/127066.html" rel="external">"Overview of and approach to the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies", section on 'Myositis-associated autoantibodies'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Antinuclear antibodies (ANA)</strong> – While ANA detected by standard immunofluorescence methods may be present in up to 60 percent of patients with DM or PM, ANA testing is not diagnostic for DM or PM [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. An anti-cytoplasmic ANA pattern is typical of both anti-MDA5 and all antisynthetase autoantibodies.</p><p></p><p>Chest radiographs and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) with diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide should be performed in all patients with suspected or confirmed DM or PM, regardless of pulmonary symptoms. For patients in whom abnormalities are found on chest radiograph or PFTs, a high-resolution chest computed tomography (CT) scan with interstitial lung disease protocol should be completed. A high-resolution chest CT should be performed in all patients with a high risk of interstitial lung disease, such as patients with antisynthetase, MDA5, and overlap antibodies (eg, myositis-associated antibodies). This is discussed further below. (See <a class="local">'Assessment for interstitial lung disease'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5159.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults", section on 'Interstitial lung disease'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3940702369"><span class="h2">Subsequent evaluation based on clinical presentation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Our diagnostic approach varies according to the following patterns of clinical features:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2064747272"><span class="h3">Major patterns of disease</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients with characteristic skin findings and muscle weakness</strong> – Patients with characteristic clinical and laboratory findings that are pathognomonic of DM, which mainly include symmetric proximal muscle weakness with "specific" or pathognomonic cutaneous findings (eg, Gottron papules and/or a heliotrope eruption) in the setting of a marked elevation of muscle enzymes, in whom evidence suggesting an alternative diagnosis is lacking, may not require additional testing to confirm the diagnosis, including a skin or muscle biopsy (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5159.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults", section on 'Characteristic findings'</a> and <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> below). Some experts, however, also obtain an EMG and/or MRI in this setting to further document that findings characteristic of an inflammatory myopathy are present (see <a class="local">'Electromyography'</a> below and <a class="local">'Skeletal muscle imaging'</a> below). Others obtain a skin biopsy to confirm histopathologic changes compatible with a diagnosis of DM.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients with muscle weakness without characteristic skin</strong> <strong>findings</strong> – Patients presenting with symmetric proximal muscle weakness and elevated muscle enzymes without skin findings usually require a muscle biopsy to demonstrate either typical histopathologic findings of PM or an alternative diagnosis such as muscular dystrophy, metabolic myopathy, necrotizing myopathy, or IBM. EMG and/or muscle MRI may be performed to identify a site for muscle biopsy in some cases. Given the high sensitivity and specificity of anti-hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG) coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) autoantibodies, patients with these antibodies and a clinically consistent phenotype, especially with previous statin exposure, do not generally need to undergo muscle biopsy. (See <a class="local">'Muscle biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In patients with muscle weakness that is atypical (ie, asymmetric or more distal), in whom it may be difficult to distinguish between a myopathic and neuropathic disorder causing weakness, an EMG and/or MRI should be performed before a muscle biopsy. If myopathy is suggested by EMG or MRI, muscle biopsy should then be performed. (See <a class="local">'Testing for myopathy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients with cutaneous features without weakness</strong> – A distinct group of patients with "clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis" (CADM), historically called "dermatomyositis sine myositis," have classic cutaneous findings of DM without clinical evidence of muscle weakness [<a href="#rid9">9-12</a>]. There are two subsets within this group. One subset, referred to as "hypomyopathic dermatomyositis" (HDM), has subtle evidence of myositis upon investigation by laboratory, EMG, muscle biopsy, or imaging despite a lack of clinical muscle weakness; the other subset, classified as "amyopathic dermatomyositis" (ADM), includes patients without clinical weakness or laboratory or muscle study abnormalities.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients who present with cutaneous signs of DM but with normal strength and normal muscle enzymes often undergo a skin biopsy to rule out other cutaneous eruptions that mimic DM, although a diagnosis of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) cannot be excluded based on skin biopsy as described below. In such patients, EMG, MRI, or even a muscle biopsy may reveal occult muscle disease, but such studies are generally not needed in patients with classic cutaneous presentations if the clinician can be confident that there is no muscle weakness present. Findings on skin biopsy in patients with DM and the further evaluation of patients with CADM are described separately. Notably, patients with CADM may still have associated malignancy or systemic disease despite lacking muscle involvement; hence, further evaluation in these patients is still required. (See <a class="local">'Skin biopsy'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13771.html" rel="external">"Cutaneous dermatomyositis in adults: Overview and initial management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H315465968"><span class="h3">Testing for myopathy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As discussed above, the approach to additional testing for myopathy depends on the need for more diagnostic certainty. For example, in patients with characteristic skin findings of DM, proximal muscle weakness, and elevated CK, such testing may not be necessary in absence of a possible alternative diagnosis. However, for other patients in whom there is more uncertainty, additional testing is often required.</p><p>EMG and nerve conduction studies (NCS) are most useful early in the evaluation of a patient presenting with weakness in determining if the weakness is due to generalized myopathy versus motor neuron disease or some form of neuropathy. It is therefore most useful in patients with asymmetric or distal muscle weakness. However, if a CK is markedly abnormal (eg, greater than 2000 units/L), an EMG may not be required to confirm the presence of a muscle disease rather than a neuropathic disorder. An EMG can also be performed to help identify an appropriate muscle to target for patients in whom there is difficulty localizing an appropriate muscle group for biopsy.

EMG is most helpful in distinguishing myopathic causes of weakness from neuropathic disorders (eg, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS], peripheral polyneuropathy) and myasthenia gravis, if one is unsure of the cause of weakness following careful history and examination. In patients with equivocal muscle weakness on exam, EMG may be useful in identifying a suitable muscle for biopsy.

Because involvement is typically bilateral and symmetrical, we perform a unilateral EMG study to detect changes suggestive of an active inflammatory myopathy and then obtain a muscle biopsy on the contralateral side. In patients who are having blood drawn for muscle enzyme testing, it should be drawn prior to performing the EMG because samples obtained soon after (within 24 to 36 hours) may be elevated due to the trauma associated with needle insertion into the muscle. Additionally, the electromyographer should sample multiple sites, including the paraspinals, if initial sites are unremarkable, before concluding that there are no myopathic changes because muscle involvement may not be generalized.

MRI can demonstrate areas of edema (which is consistent with but not diagnostic for muscle inflammation), atrophy, fatty replacement, and calcification  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51395" href="/d/graphic/51395.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). Unlike muscle biopsy, MRI can assess large areas of muscle (eg, both thighs), thereby avoiding problems with sampling error. It is, however, nonspecific and may not distinguish the changes of inflammatory myopathy from those that occur in rhabdomyolysis, muscular dystrophy, or metabolic myopathy. Additionally, denervation may also present with muscle edema on MRI radiographically indistinguishable from that of myositis.</p><p>The typical MRI ordered is a bilateral thigh MRI using a myositis protocol. Despite being nonspecific for myositis, MRI can be particularly useful in helping to determine whether muscle disease is active in a patient with known DM or PM, especially in situations in which the patient's serum muscle enzymes are not reflective of the patient's muscle disease activity.</p><p>Within myositis subgroups, some patterns may be present based on the associated autoantibody. As an example, in a study including patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, MRIs of patients with immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) and anti-signal recognition particle (SRP) autoantibodies had more atrophy and fatty replacement than those with anti-HMGCR autoantibodies [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Muscle abnormalities were especially common in the lateral rotator and gluteal groups among patients with IMNM. Fascial involvement was most widespread in patients with DM. Fatty replacement of muscle tissue may begin early during the course of disease, particularly in IMNM [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>MRI can be helpful in cases with normal CK but elevated aldolase; fasciitis may be seen (which is also observed in GVHD myositis and checkpoint inhibitor-induced myositis). Some MRI findings may also help distinguish DM and PM from other inflammatory myopathies. In IBM, the MRI may show a predilection for vastus lateralis and medialis with sparing of the rectus femoris in the thighs and of the deep finger flexors in the forearm. Also, in patients with IMNM, abnormalities in muscle are more common in the lateral rotator and gluteal groups. Fascial involvement may be more widespread in DM when compared with IBM [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>Musculoskeletal ultrasound with power Doppler is another noninvasive technique that can be used to assess for the presence of myopathy. With inflammatory myopathies, muscle becomes hypoechoic, reflecting loss of normal muscle definition due to edema and fatty tissue infiltration. Hypervascular changes on power Doppler are seen in active early disease. While these changes are not specific for inflammatory myopathies, ultrasound can be an alternative to MRI in helping to establish the presence of muscle disease or in helping to locate an appropriate site for muscle biopsy.

Drug-induced myopathy can generally be distinguished from DM or PM based upon a careful clinical history of drug exposure, but, in patients in whom the diagnosis is uncertain, the distinction can usually be made by electromyography (EMG) and muscle biopsy if needed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5166.html" rel="external">"Drug-induced myopathies"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy</strong> – Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) is a distinct clinical subset of myositis that clinically resembles PM but is histologically distinct from PM or DM [<a href="#rid50">50,51</a>]. It is described most often following exposure to statins, but, unlike typical statin-induced myopathy, it persists following withdrawal of drug therapy [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. Patients with IMNM associated with statin use are often anti-hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG) coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) positive. Another subset of IMNM occurs commonly in younger patients with a more severe and refractory phenotype, typically associated with anti-signal recognition particle (SRP) antibody. In addition, another form of IMNM may also be seen in association with an underlying autoimmune rheumatic disease, such as SSc or mixed connective tissue disease. IMNM may be seen in association with malignancy or may be idiopathic.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">IMNM, similar to PM and DM, is characterized most often by proximal upper and lower extremity muscle weakness; however, patients also typically have very elevated muscle enzymes and a higher frequency of myalgia. EMG findings are typical of an inflammatory myopathy similar to PM and DM. In contrast to PM and DM, however, muscle biopsies show necrotic muscle fibers without significant inflammatory cell infiltrate around non-necrotic fibers, as well as a lack of perifascicular atrophy, and the deposition of membrane attack complex and major histocompatibility antigen on the sarcolemma of non-necrotic muscle fibers. IMNM has been associated with autoantibodies against HMGCR protein [<a href="#rid52">52</a>] and anti-SRP antibodies.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hypothyroidism</strong> – The myopathy associated with hypothyroidism can mimic the presentation of inflammatory myopathy, causing a subacute onset of proximal muscle weakness and elevated muscle enzymes. Coexisting clinical signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, including delayed relaxation phase of the deep tendon reflexes, lack of fibrillation potentials on EMG with relatively normal appearing motor units, and the absence of inflammatory changes on muscle biopsy, all help to distinguish hypothyroid myopathy from PM. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement is the preferred screening test. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7846.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>HIV infection</strong> – In addition to causing weakness through chronic disease and cachexia, HIV infection is also associated with an inflammatory myopathy that may be indistinguishable from PM but may also have features of IBM [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. The myopathy can either be a presenting manifestation of HIV infection or can occur in the later stages of infection. With the widespread use of combination ART, though, it is an uncommon occurrence [<a href="#rid54">54</a>]. Patients with HIV myopathy present with myalgias and muscle tenderness with elevated muscle enzymes. EMG findings in HIV myopathy are generally the same as those in idiopathic PM, and muscle biopsy demonstrates an endomysial mononuclear cell infiltrate with lesser accumulation of inflammatory cells (predominantly CD8 T cells and macrophages) around vessels or in the interfascicular space.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">HIV myopathy appears to have a better prognosis than idiopathic PM, with some patients improving spontaneously. For those who do not, high-dose glucocorticoids, as used in idiopathic PM, have been shown to be effective [<a href="#rid55">55-57</a>]. Therapeutic options for glucocorticoid nonresponders are uncertain. Immunosuppressive agents such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">methotrexate</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9026" href="/d/drug information/9026.html" rel="external">azathioprine</a>, which are employed in this setting in idiopathic PM, should be approached with caution in HIV-infected patients [<a href="#rid58">58</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In HIV-infected patients with myopathy, other considerations include rhabdomyolysis and opportunistic infections (eg, toxoplasmosis). Older-generation nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, predominantly <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10053" href="/d/drug information/10053.html" rel="external">zidovudine</a>, have also been associated with a myopathy that improves with discontinuation of the drug. However, these antiretroviral agents are uncommonly used, particularly in resource-abundant settings.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Myasthenia gravis</strong> – Myasthenia gravis is a disorder of the neuromuscular junction, caused by antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor. Although the classic physical examination finding in myasthenia gravis is muscle fatigability (the development of muscle weakness as exercise proceeds), the disease can occasionally cause diffuse weakness without prominent fatigability symptoms. Myasthenia gravis is distinguished from myositis by the frequent presence of facial muscle weakness, normal muscle enzymes, characteristic EMG changes, and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies. Myasthenia gravis can also occur in association with use of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5170.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96368.html" rel="external">"Toxicities associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors", section on 'Neurologic'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In contrast to myasthenia gravis, DM and PM rarely involve the oculobulbar muscles. A condition related to myasthenia gravis, known as the Lambert-Eaton syndrome, can mimic DM and PM more closely because the oculobulbar muscles are usually spared.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Muscular dystrophy</strong> – The muscular dystrophies are an inherited group of progressive myopathic disorders resulting from defects in a number of genes required for normal muscle function. Patients with muscular dystrophy occasionally have a prominent endomysial inflammatory cell infiltrate, which may cause diagnostic confusion with PM, particularly in dystrophic disorders such as limb-girdle and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophies. However, the inflammatory cell infiltrate in muscular dystrophy is typically limited to areas adjacent to necrotic muscle fibers, in contrast to the tendency of PM to involve non-necrotic muscle fibers.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Myotonic dystrophy</strong> – Proximal myotonic myopathy (PROMM), also known as myotonic dystrophy type 2, must also be considered in the differential diagnosis. It presents in adults, but, unlike in PM, the majority of patients exhibit myotonia, a slowed relaxation following a normal muscle contraction, and a family history of the disorder. There is often early involvement of the finger flexors in addition to proximal muscle groups, and other findings may be present, such as cataracts, mild cognitive impairment, and glucose intolerance. Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5147.html" rel="external">"Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inherited metabolic myopathies</strong> – Inherited metabolic myopathies include disorders of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, such as carnitine deficiency and myoadenylate deaminase deficiency. These diseases are characterized by intermittent episodes of acute muscle pain and tenderness, usually induced by exertion. The episodes are often accompanied by myoglobinuria with red or brown urine. Occasional patients develop chronic weakness after years of repeated acute episodes [<a href="#rid59">59</a>]. The evaluation of patients with suspected metabolic myopathy is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6193.html" rel="external">"Approach to the metabolic myopathies", section on 'Overview of clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other muscle disease</strong> – A variety of other myopathies may be mimics of PM. The following considerations and diagnoses should be noted:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Acute myopathy</strong> – Acute viral or bacterial infections (pyomyositis), immobilization, and trauma can be characterized by acute, fulminant presentations that are often complicated by rhabdomyolysis. However, rhabdomyolysis has been described only infrequently in case reports in the inflammatory myopathies [<a href="#rid60">60,61</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</strong> – Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also called motor neuron disease) can present with muscle weakness, but ALS has a number of clinical features that differ from DM and PM, including presentation with distal rather than proximal weakness, most often with asymmetric onset; presence of long-tract signs, such as hyperreflexia and muscle spasticity; absence of myopathic changes on EMG; and normal or only mildly elevated muscle enzymes (creatine kinase [CK] up to approximately 1000 units/L). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5136.html" rel="external">"Clinical features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other forms of motor neuron disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Familial idiopathic myositis</strong> – Muscle weakness occurring in multiple family members is not always due to inherited metabolic defects or dystrophies but may rarely result from the development of idiopathic myositis in several members of the same family. The clinical features of familial idiopathic inflammatory myopathy are similar to those of sporadic disease, although the frequency of myositis-specific autoantibodies is lower with the familial disorder [<a href="#rid62">62</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Chronic graft-versus-host disease</strong> – Muscle disease that is clinically and histopathologically similar to PM has been well documented in patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) [<a href="#rid63">63</a>]. The estimated frequency is 0.6 percent. The onset of myositis is typically more than one year after transplantation [<a href="#rid64">64</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3548.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic graft-versus-host disease", section on 'Musculoskeletal'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Focal myositis</strong> – Rare patients present with focal myositis that usually but not always progresses to the typical generalized form over time [<a href="#rid65">65</a>]. As distinct from DM or PM, these patients usually have marked pain in the affected limb.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Amyloid myopathy</strong> – Amyloid myopathy can occur in immunoglobulin-related or familial amyloidosis [<a href="#rid66">66</a>]. Other manifestations of the particular form of amyloidosis are typically present. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the demonstration of typical amyloid fibers on Congo red staining of a muscle biopsy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5158.html" rel="external">"Myopathies of systemic disease", section on 'Amyloid myopathy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Sarcoid myopathy</strong> – Myopathy may occur in one of several patterns, including an inflammatory myopathy, in a majority of patients with sarcoidosis, but it is usually asymptomatic. It is distinguished from DM or PM by the presence of other clinical and histologic manifestations of sarcoid. Approximately 50 percent of patients with granulomas on biopsy are ultimately found to have IBM [<a href="#rid67">67-70</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5586.html" rel="external">"Sarcoid myopathy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Myositis associated with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy</strong> – Myositis can also be observed in association with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy and is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96368.html" rel="external">"Toxicities associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors", section on 'Rheumatologic and musculoskeletal'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/114506.html" rel="external">"Rheumatologic complications of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy", section on 'Inflammatory myopathies'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Trichinellosis</strong> – Parasitic infections, particularly trichinellosis, may cause severe muscle pain and enzyme elevations, but it is distinguished by the history of ingesting inadequately cooked meat and by the presence of eosinophilia. Muscle biopsy can confirm the diagnosis, if needed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5719.html" rel="external">"Trichinellosis", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Diabetic amyotrophy and diabetic muscle infarction</strong> – Diabetic amyotrophy is characterized typically by acute, asymmetric, focal onset of pain followed by weakness involving the proximal leg, with associated autonomic failure and weight loss. Some patients present with distal involvement. The clinical findings in the setting of type 2 diabetes and the electrodiagnostic findings help to distinguish it from DM or PM. The diagnosis of diabetic muscle infarction is suggested clinically by the acute or subacute onset of muscle pain, swelling, and associated tenderness, often in the muscles of the thigh and calf, and may be confirmed by biopsy of the affected area. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5135.html" rel="external">"Diabetic muscle infarction"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5268.html" rel="external">"Diabetic amyotrophy and idiopathic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other skin disease</strong> – Lesions of DM are difficult to impossible to distinguish histologically from those of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), requiring careful clinical examination of the skin for confirmation of the diagnosis [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. This is particularly important in patients with CADM, who often present after being misdiagnosed as having CLE; the distinction must be made based upon clinical rather than histopathologic features. Findings that are more common in DM than CLE include pruritus and a predominance of CD4+ and chemokine receptor CXCR3-positive cells, as well as increased endothelial cell expression of the interferon-inducible myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) [<a href="#rid71">71</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with CLE may also develop facial erythema and other photosensitive eruptions, resembling some of the cutaneous features seen in DM. However, unlike in patients with CLE, the midfacial erythema seen in DM does not spare the nasolabial folds, helping with this distinction  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89101 graphicRef55875" href="/d/graphic/89101.html" rel="external">picture 5A-B</a>). Furthermore, DM may present with additional cutaneous clues that are not seen in CLE, for example, poikiloderma of the lateral thigh ("holster sign"). Another distinguishing feature between DM and CLE is the frequency of an adverse reaction to antimalarial therapy, with the prevalence in DM being much greater than in CLE [<a href="#rid72">72,73</a>]. Although these disorders may be distinguished by the severity of muscle involvement in classic DM or PM compared with CLE, by the organ systems involved, and by the serologic studies present, a careful cutaneous examination is the ultimate arbiter; hence, referral to a dermatologist with expertise in DM can be valuable.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Scalp involvement in DM may resemble psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis. Unlike in DM, a thicker, silvery or micaceous scaling may be present in psoriasis, and a more yellow, greasy scaling may be evident in seborrheic dermatitis. Unlike in DM, both scalp psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis lack any evidence of poikiloderma. Finally, scalp DM may be distinguished from both of these disorders on skin biopsy. The scalp disease in DM exhibits characteristic vacuolar interface changes, but psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis do not.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Drug-induced cutaneous DM should be suspected particularly in patients who have been treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8543" href="/d/drug information/8543.html" rel="external">hydroxyurea</a>, the most commonly reported cause, but it may also occur with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy, statins, and multiple other agents [<a href="#rid74">74,75</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H837803910"><span class="h1">POST-DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Additional studies are important in the evaluation of a given patient once the diagnosis of dermatomyositis (DM) or polymyositis (PM) has been made.
