(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7554.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)"</a>.)</p><p>SSc may affect only the skin and subjacent tissues but is generally associated with systemic involvement. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7539.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) in adults", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>The most serious kidney manifestation of SSc is scleroderma renal crisis (SRC), which occurs in a minority of patients. A review of SSc-associated kidney disease will be presented here, with the emphasis on SRC. Extrarenal manifestations of SSc are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7539.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) in adults", section on 'Major organ involvement'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PREVALENCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Autopsy studies reveal kidney pathology in approximately 60 percent of patients with SSc [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In addition, as many as 50 percent of patients with SSc have markers of kidney disease, as manifested by mild proteinuria, elevated serum creatinine concentration, and/or hypertension [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. However, many of these findings can be attributed to causes other than SSc. </p><p>The most serious kidney manifestation of SSc, SRC, occurs in as many as 5 to 20 percent of patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc [<a href="#rid3">3-10</a>]. SRC occurs in only 1 to 2 percent of patients with limited cutaneous SSc [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. However, since limited cutaneous SSc is the more common form of the disease, a substantial proportion of patients with SRC (approximately 20 percent) have limited cutaneous SSc [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>].</p><p>Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-related glomerulonephritis develops rarely, in less than 1 percent of patients with SSc [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Other types of kidney disease'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">SCLERODERMA RENAL CRISIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>SRC is a life-threatening complication of SSc. Prior to the widespread use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, almost all patients with SSc who had significant kidney involvement died within one year [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H168676722"><span class="h2">Risk factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A number of risk factors for SRC have been identified:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diffuse skin involvement </strong>–<strong> </strong>The most important risk factor for SRC is diffuse skin involvement, particularly if it is rapidly progressive [<a href="#rid5">5,7-9,15</a>]. A study of 826 patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc found that rapid progression of skin thickness was an independent predictor of early SRC (odds ratio [OR] 2.05, 95% CI 1.10-3.85) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The presence of palpable tendon friction rubs, common in patients with SSc who have diffuse skin involvement, is associated with a greater than twofold increase in the risk for SRC [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. SRC occurs infrequently in patients with limited cutaneous SSc and only rarely in patients with SSc who lack skin involvement (ie, systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Glucocorticoid use </strong>– The use of glucocorticoids, particularly in high doses, is associated with the development of SRC [<a href="#rid8">8,9,15,19-22</a>]. In a case-control study of 110 patients with SSc, moderate- to high-dose glucocorticoid therapy (≥15 mg/day of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> or equivalent) in the preceding six months was associated with a markedly increased risk of SRC (OR 4.37, 95% CI 2.03-9.43) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Other studies have found similar results, with approximately 60 percent of patients with SRC having had prior recent exposure to glucocorticoids [<a href="#rid8">8,9,23</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The use of higher doses of glucocorticoids might result in salt and volume retention, the initiation or worsening of hypertension, and the triggering of SRC in a subset of these patients. Glucocorticoids may also stimulate increased expression of the endothelin receptors in the kidney.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Serum autoantibodies</strong> – The presence or absence of certain serum autoantibodies appears to predict the risk for SRC:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Autoantibodies directed against ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase III are associated with a higher risk of SRC [<a href="#rid8">8,24-26</a>]. In a study of patients with SSc, anti-RNA polymerase III autoantibodies were detected in the serum of 59 percent of 96 patients who developed SRC compared with only 12 percent of 735 patients who did not develop SRC [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Another analysis of 1029 patients with SSc reported anti-RNA polymerase III autoantibodies in 52 percent of those who developed SRC [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>By contrast, anticentromere antibodies are associated with lower risk of SRC [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Anticentromere autoantibodies were observed in 1.8 percent of patients who developed SRC versus 29 percent in patients who did not.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9217" href="/d/drug information/9217.html" rel="external">Cyclosporine</a> – There is anecdotal evidence that cyclosporine, a renal vasoconstrictor, may accelerate kidney disease in patients with SSc. In one report, acute kidney injury (AKI) developed in three of eight patients treated with cyclosporine [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. However, a causal relation to the drug, rather than to SSc itself, could not be determined. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7357.html" rel="external">"Cyclosporine and tacrolimus nephrotoxicity"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other risk factors</strong> – Additional factors that may identify patients with SSc who are at increased risk for SRC include contractures at the large joints, new-onset anemia, and new cardiac events such as heart failure or pericardial effusion [<a href="#rid5">5,15,24,28</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Clinical presentation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>SRC is a relatively early complication of SSc that almost invariably occurs within the first five years after the onset of the disease. In a series of 110 cases of SRC, SRC occurred at a median duration of 7.5 months from the first non-Raynaud clinical manifestation of SSc [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. In some cases, SRC may even be the initial manifestation of SSc [<a href="#rid29">29,30</a>].</p><p>As described above, rapidly advancing skin induration is a major risk factor for SRC. However, SRC can occur in the absence of warning signs. (See <a class="local">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>SRC is characterized by the following features [<a href="#rid4">4,5,7,23</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Abrupt onset of moderate to marked hypertension, sometimes accompanied by manifestations of malignant hypertension such as hypertensive retinopathy (hemorrhages and exudates) and hypertensive encephalopathy [<a href="#rid23">23,31</a>]. In a review of 145 patients with SRC, 85 percent had new diastolic hypertension, with a mean peak blood pressure of 178/102 mmHg [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. The acute blood pressure elevation in SRC is typically associated with an increase in plasma renin activity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In approximately 10 percent of patients, SRC occurs in the absence of hypertension [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. However, some of these patients have blood pressures that are higher than their baseline values (eg, 130/80 mmHg in a young, thin woman whose baseline value was 100/60 mmHg). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute kidney injury.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A normal urine sediment. Glomerulonephritis is not a feature of SRC, and, accordingly, microscopic hematuria or cellular casts are uncommon. Heavy proteinuria is not a typical finding in SRC. </p><p></p><p>Other findings that may be associated with SRC reflect both the underlying vasculopathy and the marked hypertension. Laboratory parameters indicative of a thrombotic microangiopathy may be present, such as thrombocytopenia, anemia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), low haptoglobin, and schistocytes on peripheral blood smear  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70851" href="/d/graphic/70851.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). Additional clinical manifestations of malignant hypertension may include heart failure, pericardial effusion, headache, and seizures.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H502867787"><span class="h2">Pathology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The primary histopathologic changes in the kidney are localized in the small arcuate and interlobular arteries and the glomeruli [<a href="#rid5">5,32</a>]. The characteristic finding is intimal proliferation and thickening that leads to narrowing and obliteration of the vascular lumen, with concentric "onion-skin" hypertrophy. These histopathologic findings are similar to SSc-associated vascular lesions found in other organs  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70213 graphicRef54840 graphicRef69687 graphicRef78330 graphicRef75317" href="/d/graphic/70213.html" rel="external">picture 2A-E</a>).</p><p>SRC is a thrombotic microangiopathy similar to malignant hypertension (formerly called malignant nephrosclerosis), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), radiation nephritis, chronic kidney transplant rejection, and the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Because of the nonspecific kidney histologic findings common to all these entities, a kidney biopsy <strong>does not</strong> definitively establish the diagnosis of SRC. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h2">Diagnosis</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3641895348"><span class="h3">Initial evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of SRC should be considered in all patients with SSc who present with acute kidney injury, particularly if the patient has a concomitant sudden increase in blood pressure. Because acute kidney injury in patients with SSc is not always due to SRC, patients should be evaluated thoroughly for other causes of acute kidney injury using the same approach as that for patients without SSc. This is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7188.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to adult patients with subacute kidney injury in an outpatient setting"</a>.)</p><p>In addition, patients suspected of SRC should be evaluated for the presence of a thrombotic microangiopathy with a complete blood count, a peripheral blood smear, and measurement of serum LDH and haptoglobin. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88648.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to suspected TTP, HUS, or other thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3987642536"><span class="h3">Establishing the diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>SRC is a clinical diagnosis based upon the presence of characteristic features in patients with SSc. Kidney biopsy is generally <strong>not</strong> required to diagnose SRC, but sometimes may be helpful by ruling out other diagnoses and/or by providing useful prognostic information. (See <a class="local">'Pathology'</a> above.)</p><p>Although there is no generally accepted or validated definition of SRC, diagnostic and classification criteria have been proposed [<a href="#rid33">33,34</a>]. We take the following approach to the diagnosis of SRC:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients with SSc who have any high-risk features (ie, acute kidney injury early in the disease course [within five years of diagnosis], presence of skin involvement, autoantibodies to RNA polymerase III, or moderate- to high-dose glucocorticoid therapy [≥15 mg/day of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> or equivalent] in the preceding six months), we make the diagnosis of SRC if the patient meets the following two criteria: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Acute increase in blood pressure defined as any of the following: new onset of elevated systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg in a patient with previously normal blood pressure, an increase in systolic blood pressure of ≥30 mmHg above baseline, or an increase in diastolic blood pressure ≥20 mmHg above baseline. Blood pressure should be checked at least twice, with measurements separated by at least five minutes. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Acute kidney injury, as defined by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef83168" href="/d/graphic/83168.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), not explained by other causes. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients with SSc who do not have any high-risk features, we make the diagnosis of SRC if the patient meets the two criteria above plus at least one of the additional supportive findings below:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, as suggested by the following: new or worsening anemia not due to other causes, the presence of schistocytes on a peripheral blood smear, thrombocytopenia, elevated LDH, and/or low haptoglobin.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Evidence of target organ dysfunction, such as:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Hypertensive retinopathy (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3833.html" rel="external">"Moderate to severe hypertensive retinopathy and hypertensive encephalopathy in adults", section on 'Clinical manifestations and diagnosis'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Hypertensive encephalopathy (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3833.html" rel="external">"Moderate to severe hypertensive retinopathy and hypertensive encephalopathy in adults", section on 'Clinical manifestations and diagnosis'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Acute heart failure</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Characteristic changes on kidney biopsy (see <a class="local">'Pathology'</a> above)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rarely, patients with SRC may present without characteristic increases in blood pressure [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].

Patients with TTP/HUS characteristically present with thrombocytopenia, purpura, and prominent microangiopathic hemolysis and may have rapidly progressive kidney failure. The clinical manifestations may mimic SRC, but patients with TTP/HUS have no clinical or serologic signs of SSc.</p><p>Distinguishing TTP/HUS from SRC at presentation may present a considerable and urgent diagnostic challenge. The diagnosis of TTP/HUS is sometimes suggested by the presence of a potential inciting event, such as diarrhea in children or certain forms of chemotherapy in adults. In addition, TTP, but not SRC, is characterized by an absence or marked reduction (ie, &lt;10 percent) in the serum activity of the metalloprotease ADAMTS13. Kidney biopsy does <strong>not</strong> distinguish between these disorders. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88648.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to suspected TTP, HUS, or other thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1338.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of immune TTP"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h2">Surveillance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>SRC is a life-threatening complication of SSc. Patients with the diffuse cutaneous form of SSc, autoantibodies to RNA polymerase III, and early-stage disease are at greatest risk for SRC, particularly if skin involvement is advancing and/or tendon friction rubs are present. Close monitoring is most important during the first four to five years of SSc since SRC most frequently occurs during this phase of the disease. (See <a class="local">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p>The primary rationale for monitoring for SRC is that treatment is more likely to be effective when initiated early, before irreversible kidney injury has occurred. However, no studies to date have evaluated the effectiveness of monitoring patients with SSc for the development of SRC in terms of reducing morbidity and mortality.</p><p>We use the following surveillance regimen:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Blood pressure should be measured on a regular basis in <strong>all</strong> patients with SSc. For patients at high risk for SRC (such as those with early-stage diffuse cutaneous disease, rapidly progressive cutaneous involvement with tendon friction rubs, or the presence of autoantibodies to RNA polymerase III), we advocate daily home blood pressure measurements and, for others, twice-weekly measurements.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In patients with SSc, a persistent rise of 15 mmHg in the systolic blood pressure or a 10 mmHg rise in the diastolic blood pressure raises concern and the need for further evaluation, including determination of the serum creatinine. In patients with SSc taking antihypertensive medications, sustained hypertension &gt;140/90 mmHg, which is not readily corrected with dose adjustment and dietary salt restriction, would trigger further evaluation [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We measure serum creatinine at every clinic visit (eg, every three months) in all patients with SSc.

We avoid glucocorticoid use in patients with SSc whenever possible. We do <strong>not</strong> use angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or calcium channel blockers (CCBs) to prevent SRC. Among patients previously taking an ACE inhibitor for hypertension, we replace it with an alternative agent only if they are at high risk for SRC. (See <a class="local">'Surveillance'</a> above and <a class="local">'Prevention'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Treatment</strong> – SRC is a medical emergency that requires hospital admission. We use the treatment approach below:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Goals of therapy</strong> – The principal goal is to return the patient to their <strong>previous baseline blood pressure</strong> within 72 hours. For patients with SRC and hypertension who present with evidence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement, additional goals for immediate blood pressure lowering are the same as for any patient with hypertensive retinopathy and/or encephalopathy. (See <a class="local">'Goals of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>ACE inhibitors</strong> – For all patients with SRC, we recommend blood pressure control with an ACE inhibitor rather than other antihypertensive agents (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). We use <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9196" href="/d/drug information/9196.html" rel="external">captopril</a> because its rapid onset and short duration of action permit rapid dose escalation. For patients who are unable to take an ACE inhibitor, an ARB is an alternative option. Initial dosing and duration of ACE inhibitor therapy are discussed above. (See <a class="local">'ACE inhibitors in all patients'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Additional antihypertensive agents</strong> – For patients without sufficient blood pressure control despite maximum dose of an ACE inhibitor, we add a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8627" href="/d/drug information/8627.html" rel="external">amlodipine</a>. Beta blockers are usually<strong> </strong>avoided in patients with SSc because of the theoretical risk of worsening vasospasm. (See <a class="local">'Other antihypertensive agents'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Monitoring response to therapy</strong> – We follow kidney function, electrolytes, and laboratory markers of microangiopathic hemolysis during treatment. Because of the importance of ACE inhibitor therapy for survival and eventual kidney recovery, we do <strong>not</strong> stop ACE inhibitors even for a progressive rise of serum creatinine. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring response to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Kidney transplantation</strong> – Kidney transplantation is an option for patients with SRC who progress to end-stage kidney disease. We do not perform kidney transplantation for at least six months after the initiation of dialysis, given the chance of recovery of kidney function. (See <a class="local">'Kidney transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">D'Angelo WA, Fries JF, Masi AT, Shulman LE.
