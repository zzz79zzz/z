         Low fibrinogen predisposes to bleeding, and raising the fibrinogen level is indicated in patients with low fibrinogen who have active bleeding or who are at high bleeding risk. Cryoprecipitate and fibrinogen concentrates can provide fibrinogen, but there are differences in composition and possible adverse effects, and both products are not always available in all institutions.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the past, Cryoprecipitate was used to treat other deficiencies, but these uses are mostly outdated in high-resource settings.

         Most of the clotting factors are enzymes or cofactors present in small amounts in the circulation. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1371.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of hemostasis", section on 'Multicomponent complexes'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In contrast, fibrin, the product of cleaved fibrinogen (factor I) at the end of the coagulation cascade, is the major structural component of a clot; it forms a crosslinked meshwork that can span a gap in the vasculature until re-endothelialization occurs. Clots also contain platelets and often red blood cells (RBCs). Fibrin also contributes to wound healing. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1321.html" rel="external">
          "Disorders of fibrinogen", section on 'Functions in hemostasis and other processes'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Because of the structural role in clotting, fibrinogen abundance in the circulation is much greater than other clotting factors (typical concentration, 200 to 400 mg/dL; 5.9 to 11.8 micromol/L [SI units]). (See
         <a class="medical medical_society_guidelines" href="/z/d/html/115286.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Factor XIII crosslinks fibrin strands once they are assembled in the clot. (See

         It is composed of the insoluble coagulation factors (proteins) that precipitate out of solution after Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) or Plasma Frozen Within 24 Hours After Phlebotomy (PF24) is thawed between 1 and 6° C and centrifuged. The insoluble precipitate is resuspended in approximately 15 to 20 mL of plasma and refrozen at -18° C. This process creates one unit of Cryoprecipitate.

         At the request of the transfusing facility, most blood suppliers will provide prepooled Cryoprecipitate (one "bag") containing the Cryoprecipitate obtained from 5, 6, 8, or 10 units of FFP, which usually range in volume from 100 to 200 mL. (See

The advantage of this product is that it has a five-day shelf-life after thawing, compared with four to six hours for standard Cryoprecipitate.

Generally, institutions in the United States are more likely to stock Cryoprecipitate, and those in Europe and Canada are more likely to stock fibrinogen concentrates. Clinicians should familiarize themselves with the product(s) available at their institution.
        </p>
        <p>
         If more than one product is available, the choice between them depends on the relative efficacy, risks, and costs  (

          ABO compatibility
         </strong>
         – It is recommended to use Cryoprecipitate that is ABO compatible with the recipient's red blood cells (RBCs), particularly in neonates, small children, solid organ transplant recipients, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, to avoid passive transfer of ABO antibodies that can cause hemolysis. RhD type need not be considered, since Cryoprecipitate does not contain significant RBCs [

          Calculate dose
         </strong>
         – Since Cryoprecipitate can be provided as single units or as "pools" containing multiple units, the clinician should calculate the appropriate dose based on single units and let the transfusion service provide those units in the most efficient packaging (multiple single units or [most often] pooled units).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For most adults, an appropriate dose of Cryoprecipitate is between 5 and 10 units (one to two 5-unit "pools")  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef53854" href="/z/d/graphic/53854.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). A typical dose is provided in a volume of 50 to 200 mL. In the average patient, each unit raises the plasma fibrinogen concentration by at least 7 to 10 mg/dL, and 10 units will raise the fibrinogen level by approximately 70 to 100 mg/dL in a 70 kg recipient.

          Calculate by plasma volume
         </strong>
         – Calculate the recipient's blood volume by multiplying their weight in kg by 70 mL/kg. As an example, the blood volume of a 60 kg female = 60 kg x 70 mL/kg = 4200 mL. Then calculate the recipient's plasma volume by multiplying their blood volume by [1 - their percent hematocrit]. In the same example, if the hematocrit is 35 percent, multiply 4200 mL x [1 - 0.35]; 4200 mL x 0.65 = 2730 mL. Then convert their plasma volume to dL by dividing by 100. In the same example, 2730 mL ÷ 100 = 27.3 dL. Then calculate the desired change in fibrinogen. In this example, if the recipient's fibrinogen is 50 mg/dL and the desired level is 150 mg/dL, the desired increase is 100 mg/dL. Then multiply the plasma volume by the desired change in fibrinogen. In this example, 27.3 dL x 100 mg/dL = 2730 mg fibrinogen. The Association for the Advancement of Blood &amp; Biotherapies (AABB) Technical Manual recommends this calculation use an assumption that each unit of Cryoprecipitate contains 250 mg of fibrinogen, so 2730 mg ÷ 250 mg/unit = 10.9 units of Cryoprecipitate needed.

         ). However, since many units of Cryoprecipitate are pooled and transfused simultaneously, the risk per dose must be multiplied by the number of units in the pool. Pathogen-reduced Cryoprecipitate has a significantly lower risk of viral, bacterial, or parasitic infection compared with standard Cryoprecipitate. (See

          Transfusion reactions

         – Cryoprecipitate has a lower risk of causing a hemolytic transfusion reaction than plasma, and this risk can be mitigated further if ABO compatibility is assured. This is because the volume and hence the quantity of alloantibodies to RBC is smaller than in plasma. The risk of allergic transfusion reactions (urticaria, anaphylaxis) is likely to be the same as plasma, although this has not formally been studied. (See

         – Fibrinogen is cleaved to fibrin, the major structural component of the blood clot. Unlike enzymatic factors that only require a small concentration, circulating fibrinogen concentrations are much higher (200 to 400 mg/dL). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Fibrinogen role in blood clotting'

          Composition
         </strong>
         – Cryoprecipitate is manufactured using already frozen Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) or Plasma Frozen Within 24 Hours After Phlebotomy (PF24), thawing, and concentrating the proteins that precipitate. It contains fibrinogen (factor I), factor VIII, fibronectin, factor XIII, and von Willebrand factor (VWF). Pathogen-inactivated (PI) Cryoprecipitate is made from PI plasma.

          Differences between Cryoprecipitate and fibrinogen concentrates

         – In a bleeding patient with low fibrinogen, either Cryoprecipitate or

          Cryoprecipitate

         – Can be provided as single units or as "pools" containing five or more units. The clinician should check with the local hospital transfusion service or blood supplier to determine the exact composition of one "bag" of Cryoprecipitate (how many individual units are pooled to make up that "bag") to determine the correct dosage for a patient. In the average patient, each unit raises the plasma fibrinogen concentration by approximately 7 to 10 mg/dL; thus, 10 units will raise the fibrinogen by approximately 70 to 100 mg/dL in a 70 kg recipient  (
