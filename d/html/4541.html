          INTRODUCTION

         Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a chronic lymphoproliferative disorder (lymphoid neoplasm) characterized by a progressive accumulation of functionally incompetent lymphocytes, which are usually monoclonal in origin.
        </p>
        <p>
         CLL is considered to be identical (ie, one disease at different stages) to the mature (peripheral) B cell neoplasm small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), a clinically indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The term CLL is used when the disease manifests primarily in the blood, whereas the term SLL is used when involvement is primarily nodal.
        </p>
        <p>
         The natural history of CLL/SLL is extremely variable. While many cases follow an indolent course that is well controlled with standard therapy, others progress rapidly and die from complications or causes directly related to CLL/SLL.
        </p>
        <p>
         Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is performed in a minority of patients with relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL. Allogeneic HCT may cure a percentage of patients with CLL/SLL; it is reserved for relapsed and/or refractory CLL/SLL given the risk of treatment-related morbidity and mortality, and availability of alternative therapies. In contrast, autologous HCT is not curative and is rarely used given the efficacy of non-HCT therapies.
        </p>
        <p>
         The term "hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)" will be used throughout this review as a general term to cover transplantation of progenitor cells from any source (eg, bone marrow, peripheral blood, cord blood). Otherwise, the source of such cells will be specified (eg, autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation). (See

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The use of HCT in CLL/SLL will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, staging, prognosis, and non-HCT therapies are presented separately.

         Most patients with CLL/SLL are older adults and, due to the relatively benign course of the disease and efficacy of targeted therapies in the majority of patients, only a selected subset is considered for HCT. Transplant eligibility is determined based on a risk-benefit assessment and the needs and wishes of the patient. Eligibility for HCT varies across countries and institutions and depends on the type of transplantation (ie, allogeneic versus autologous), the conditioning regimen (eg, myeloablative versus nonmyeloablative), and compatibility between donor and recipient cells.
        </p>
        <p>
         While all types of transplant have been studied in CLL/SLL, nonmyeloablative or reduced intensity allogeneic HCT is the preferred type used by most centers.
        </p>
        <p>
         In most centers in the United States, patients meeting all of the following criteria may be eligible for nonmyeloablative or reduced intensity allogeneic HCT (see

         HCT is reserved for young, fit patients with relapsed and/or refractory CLL/SLL who have high-risk disease and ideally performed in the context of a clinical trial. Such trials are most appropriate for patients with clinically aggressive relapsed or refractory disease, including those with high-risk genetic factors (eg, deletion 17p13 and
         <em>
          TP53
         </em>
         mutations). HCT may also be considered for patients with histologic transformation to a more aggressive histology. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4728.html" rel="external">
          "Richter transformation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma", section on 'HCT'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The following sections describe the use of HCT at different times in the disease course. Interpretation of trials comparing HCT versus non-HCT therapies alone is complicated by changes in the standard care of CLL/SLL. Since these trials were performed, the availability of agents targeting the B cell receptor pathway and BCL2 have improved survival rates among patients who do not undergo HCT, therefore, HCT is less commonly used in this disease. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83749.html" rel="external">
          "Selection of initial therapy for symptomatic or advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma"

         Nonmyeloablative or reduced intensity allogeneic HCT is a potentially curative treatment option for young, fit patients with clinically aggressive relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL. The decision to use HCT in this setting is individualized based on the aggressiveness of disease and available non-HCT therapies.
        </p>
        <p>
         While relapsed disease is typically sensitive to additional non-HCT therapies, the duration of remission becomes shorter with each subsequent regimen. The selection of therapy for relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL, including the incorporation of HCT, is discussed in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4520.html" rel="external">
          "Treatment of relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia", section on 'Choice of therapy'

         <strong>
          Assessing disease aggressiveness
         </strong>
         – While limited, our best measure of disease aggressiveness is the length and quality of initial (and subsequent) remission(s). Patients with refractory disease or an initial remission duration significantly less than the median progression-free survival for an individual treatment regimen are more likely to have a short subsequent remission duration. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4520.html" rel="external">

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Certain genomic features are associated with more aggressive disease biology. While targeted agents have improved outcomes in these populations, patients with 17p deletion and/or
         <em>
          TP53
         </em>
         mutation treated with targeted agents have inferior outcomes when compared with other patients treated with these same agents. (See

          1-3

          Limitations of the evidence
         </strong>
         – Autologous HCT, myeloablative HCT, and nonmyeloablative or reduced intensity HCT have not been directly compared for the treatment of relapsed CLL/SLL in a randomized fashion. As such, judgement of these treatment modalities must keep in mind selection biases that limit comparisons of retrospective analyses and uncontrolled prospective case series. The use of each of these modalities is described in more detail below. (See

         A minority of CLL/SLL tumors transform to a more aggressive histology. Histologic transformation is associated with a poor prognosis. The use of allogeneic HCT for patients with treatment-sensitive transformed CLL/SLL is supported by small retrospective analyses, as discussed in more detail separately. (See

         Modern regimens for the initial treatment of CLL/SLL are well tolerated and produce prolonged responses in most patients. Allogeneic HCT is not recommended in this setting due to its higher morbidity and mortality rates. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83749.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Several retrospective analyses and a single multicenter prospective randomized trial have examined the use of high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous HCT in the treatment of newly diagnosed CLL/SLL. While some studies have demonstrated improvements in progression-free survival, none has shown an overall survival benefit. As such, management without HCT remains the standard therapy for patients with previously untreated CLL/SLL. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Autologous HCT'

         The role of HCT in CLL/SLL is changing with advances in targeted therapies and our knowledge of who might respond to these therapies. When HCT is performed, most experts offer a nonmyeloablative or reduced intensity allogeneic HCT, ideally in the context of a clinical trial.

         Reduced intensity and nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT have a treatment-related mortality of approximately 5 to 25 percent, and a three year overall survival (OS) of approximately 60 percent, with a significant proportion of patients achieving durable responses [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,4-11

         Myeloablative allogeneic HCT is rarely performed due to less toxic alternatives. It has a treatment-related mortality rate that approaches 30 to 50 percent [

         Autologous HCT is rarely performed. It has a low treatment-related mortality rate and may prolong progression-free survival (PFS), but not OS, in a subset of patients who are in complete response (CR) or have minimal disease at the time of HCT. Patients who undergo autologous HCT appear to have an increased risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome, perhaps as a result of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy administered before or during the preparative regimen.

         Myeloablative HCT has not been directly compared with nonmyeloablative/reduced intensity or autologous HCT or with non-HCT therapies in a prospective manner, and it is unlikely that such trials will be attempted due to the advanced age of most patients with CLL/SLL. Nonrandomized comparisons of myeloablative versus nonmyeloablative approaches, and single-arm studies of each approach are discussed in the sections below. (See

         Allogeneic HCT is the only treatment option for patients with CLL/SLL with the potential for cure. This appears to be largely due to the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect, which relies on graft immune cells to recognize and lyse the leukemia cells.

         A GVL effect in CLL is supported by the following observations:

         Nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT, which relies primarily on a GVL effect, has resulted in long-term remissions. (See

         CLL/SLL appears to be an excellent target for alloimmune effects, which characterize the GVL effect. Basic principles underlying graft-versus-tumor effects following HCT across diseases are discussed separately. (See

         A major complication with both myeloablative and nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT is the induction of GVHD. Efforts are underway to dissociate GVL from GVHD. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See

         When HCT is performed in CLL/SLL, most experts offer a nonmyeloablative or reduced intensity allogeneic HCT, ideally in the context of a clinical trial [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. The use of myeloablative conditioning regimens is limited by high treatment-related mortality. Nonmyeloablative approaches have been better tolerated in this patient population that tends to be older and often has other comorbid medical conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Uncontrolled studies have evaluated the efficacy of both myeloablative and nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT in CLL/SLL. Interpretation is limited by differences in patient selection, since variable criteria have been used to determine appropriate candidates for HCT. Eligibility criteria for myeloablative HCT are stricter; as such, patients who have undergone myeloablative HCT are likely to be younger and more clinically fit than those who have undergone nonmyeloablative HCT.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nonmyeloablative and reduced intensity conditioning regimens are less toxic and may improve OS when compared with myeloablative regimens. The following are the largest studies that have compared these two approaches:

         <a href="#rid23">
          23-25
         </a>
         ]. Observational studies also suggest that patients in CR at the time of HCT will have a better prognosis. As such, additional treatment should be used at the time of relapse to achieve a remission prior to HCT. Prognostic factors that predict for poor outcomes with standard therapy include a short duration of first remission, certain genetic risk factors (eg, deletion 17p,
         <em>
          TP53

         mutations), and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) genes.

         Reduced intensity conditioning or nonmyeloablative conditioning followed by matched-related or matched-unrelated allogeneic HCT offers the potential benefit of decreased treatment-related mortality when compared with myeloablative HCT, while still maintaining a GVL effect [

Specific regimens used for reduced intensity and nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT are discussed in detail separately. (See

         Autologous HCT is rarely performed for CLL/SLL. Although it may delay progression in a subset of patients, it does not improve OS and impairs quality of life (QOL). Non-HCT strategies are the preferred initial therapy for CLL/SLL. Targeted agents are also the main treatment modality used for relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL, either alone or in combination with allogeneic HCT. (See

High dose chemotherapy followed by autologous HCT can delay progression in a subset of patients who are in CR or have minimal disease at the time of HCT, but it is not curative and impairs QOL. The lack of a survival benefit likely reflects the efficacy of second- and third-line therapies in patients relapsing after standard initial therapy. In addition, impaired stem cell collection may limit autologous HCT in patients with prior exposure to

         Treatment options for CLL/SLL relapsed after allogeneic HCT include reduction of immunosuppression and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) in addition to other therapies used for relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL. Reduction of immunosuppression and DLI should be incorporated into the initial management of all patients with relapse unless concerns regarding graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or myelosuppression make this approach unfeasible.

          Transplant eligibility
         </strong>
         – Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is performed in a minority of patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). Most patients with CLL/SLL are older adults and, due to the relatively benign course of the disease in the majority of patients, only a small fraction of selected patients are considered for HCT.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Eligibility for HCT varies across countries and institutions and depends on the type of transplant and the conditioning regimen. While many types of transplant have been studied in CLL/SLL, nonmyeloablative or reduced intensity allogeneic HCT is usually preferred. In most centers in the United States, eligibility criteria include age &lt;75 years; normal cardiac, liver, and renal function; and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1  (

         <strong>
          Timing and pretreatment
         </strong>
         – HCT is reserved for patients with relapsed and/or refractory CLL/SLL, ideally performed in the context of a clinical trial. Such trials may be appropriate for young, fit patients with clinically aggressive disease, including those with high-risk genetic factors (eg, deletion 17p13 and
         <em>
          TP53
         </em>
         mutations). HCT may also be considered for tumors with transformation to a more aggressive histology. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Timing of transplant'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         At the time of relapse, patients are treated with non-HCT therapies with the aim of achieving a complete or partial response. Observational studies suggest better outcomes in patients in complete response at the time of HCT. Following response, nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT is a reasonable option for young patients with high-risk disease, as long as they have a good performance status and few comorbidities. (See

         The treatment of relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL is discussed in more detail separately. (See

          Type of transplant and outcomes
         </strong>
         – For most patients undergoing allogeneic HCT for CLL/SLL, we suggest nonmyeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning rather than myeloablative conditioning (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Data comparing these approaches is limited to observational studies and interpretation is limited by differences in patient selection. Nonmyeloablative and reduced intensity conditioning regimens are less toxic and may improve overall survival when compared with myeloablative regimens. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Nonmyeloablative versus myeloablative HCT'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Nonmyeloablative or reduced intensity allogeneic HCT can achieve a durable response in a significant proportion of patients. Side effects are much less than those of myeloablative regimens, and these approaches are better tolerated in older individuals. Reported treatment-related mortality ranges from 5 to 25 percent. The reported rates of overall survival are approximately 50 to 60 percent at five years and do not differ by cytogenetic risk group. Approximately half of patients will experience chronic extensive graft-versus-host disease.
