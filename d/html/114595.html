However, a <strong>panethnic approach</strong> (ie, without regard to race or ethnicity; also called universal approach) is increasingly being utilized.

Numerous laboratories offer panels ranging from several to hundreds of disorders. Increased use of expanded carrier screening has been enabled by decreasing costs and rapid advancements in genetic testing technologies, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS). NGS uses parallel sequencing of multiple small DNA fragments to determine sequence. It can test for genetic variants across multiple genes simultaneously, accurately, and cost-effectively. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/17039.html" rel="external">"Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS): Principles and clinical applications"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Historically, expanded panel testing was only utilized for the genetic conditions observed at an increased frequency within a specific high-risk group (individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent). However, a panethnic approach is increasingly being utilized.

(See <a class="local">'Patient counseling'</a> below.)</p><p>Prenatal identification of carriers provides an opportunity for parental education regarding their risk of having an affected offspring and its prognosis, fetal diagnosis (when desired and indicated), reproductive options, and modification of pregnancy management with affected fetus, including planning for birth at a tertiary care facility if indicated. This could lead to reduction in diagnostic cost and time, earlier treatment, avoidance of unnecessary treatments, and potentially in utero treatment [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2634978746"><span class="h3">Identification of carriers regardless of race/ethnicity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Carriers may not be identified with traditional screening strategies because many individuals:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Have a multiracial/multiethnic background, thus they may not be identified as belonging to a high-risk racial/ethnic group.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Are unaware of their full ancestry or true race/ethnicity (increasing population intermixing confounds what many people believe to be their race/ethnicity).

It is increasingly difficult to assign a single race/ethnicity to individuals in the modern global society. For example: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Up to 12 percent of infants born with a hemoglobinopathy identified via newborn testing in California in the 1990s did not belong to one of the groups targeted by the then-contemporary American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) ethnic-based carrier screening guideline [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the largest observational study of routine recessive disease carrier screening (a multiethnic population of &gt;23,000 individuals), 76.7 percent of carriers would have been missed by ACOG's traditional ethnic-based guideline in place at the time of the study (2013) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. With panethnic screening, 24 percent of individuals were identified as carriers for at least one disorder, and 5.2 percent were carriers for multiple disorders on the 108 disorder panel.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4192921508"><span class="h3">Identification of carriers with a negative family history and normal fetal sonogram</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Carriers may not be identified with traditional screening because:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>They have no family history of the genetic disorder(s) that they carry. This is common for rare disorders. With expanded carrier screening, a single laboratory panel can screen for hundreds of Mendelian disorders simultaneously, which could provide a potentially cost-effective means of identifying carriers for rare Mendelian disorders in the general population [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Although relatively rare, Mendelian disorders have been reported to account for 20 percent of infant mortality and 18 percent of infant hospitalizations in the United States [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Disorders with significant health disabilities also impact the individual's and family's quality of life.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>They have a normal second-trimester fetal ultrasound examination. Although some single gene disorders can be associated with abnormal fetal findings on routine second-trimester ultrasound examination, many are not, or the findings are subtle or transient. Expanded carrier screening provides an opportunity to identify individuals at risk for an affected offspring who might otherwise not have been identified by a fetal ultrasound finding in the absence of a known family history.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3213134456"><span class="h3">Other benefits</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Other benefits of panethnic expanded screening are that [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>It avoids potential ethnic/racial stigmatization.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>It removes patient and clinician responsibility for recognizing higher risk status.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2382971675"><span class="h2">Harms and limitations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Harms and limitations of a panethnic expanded carrier screening strategy compared with traditional carrier screening are discussed below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1161428750"><span class="h3">Unproven improvement in reproductive outcome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>At the population level, panethnic expanded carrier screening has not been proven to improve reproductive outcomes (eg, increased frequency of live birth) compared with single condition screening offered to high-risk groups based on ancestry and family history. Clinical validation studies of population screening using large panels are needed.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2929682937"><span class="h3">Identification of conditions of limited impact, uncertain prevalence, or variable, poorly defined phenotype</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The preconception/prenatal panels that commercial laboratories offer for expanded carrier screening include some disorders that result in only mild to moderate (rather than severe) health complications (eg, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase [<em>MTHFR</em>] gene variant), have significant variations in or poorly defined phenotype (eg, hereditary hemochromatosis), or have onset in adulthood (eg, <em>BRCA1</em>/<em>BRCA2 </em>testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility). In addition, the frequency of some conditions is unknown in the general population or within specific ethnic groups, rendering calculation of residual risk after a positive test inconclusive.</p><p>As the number of disorders included on a panel increases, the likelihood of identifying a carrier increases. As a result, more than half of patients screened with large panels may be found to be carriers for one or more disorders [<a href="#rid7">7,11,12</a>]. In one study in which nearly 24,000 patients were screened using a panel with 417 pathogenic variants associated with 108 recessive disorders, on average, 24 percent of individuals were positive for at least one condition and, when stratified by self-reported ethnicity, the frequency ranged from 44 percent of Ashkenazi Jewish individuals to 8.5 percent of East Asian individuals [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Use of panels with low-frequency conditions or a large number of genes may have downstream costs for additional laboratory testing. This increases the time and complexity of counseling, and thus may increase patient anxiety. (See <a class="local">'Choosing a laboratory and screening panel'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2329777759"><span class="h3">Identification of variants of uncertain clinical significance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Sequencing technologies may identify variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS), which are a change in the gene with unknown significance to function and/or health. These are more likely to be identified if the laboratory performs diagnostic sequencing in lieu of detection for specific pathogenic variants. With additional bioinformatics and data, a VUS could eventually be reclassified to be either deleterious or benign.</p><p>Although most laboratories do not reveal VUS in clinical reports, this practice is without oversight and not uniform. Variant interpretation is subjective, with laboratories developing their own tools, data mining of public repositories, and functional analysis with minimal guidance from governing bodies (eg, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics [ACMG] or the Association for Molecular Pathology) on variant interpretation, clinical validity, or utility [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. VUS can cause patient anxiety despite counseling, which is complex and time-consuming. Potential psychosocial consequences from medical uncertainty of a VUS result is important to consider in both pre- and posttest counseling.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1770658078"><span class="h3">Lack of detection of private or unique pathogenic variants</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Targeted high-throughput pathogenic variant analysis for specific pathogenic variants known to be associated with a particular disease has the potential to miss pathogenic variants that are private or unique within a family or ethnic group. Although the majority of laboratories now use comprehensive sequencing to minimize this risk, a few continue to use targeted variant analysis; therefore, providers should identify the molecular technology utilized by their chosen laboratory. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3947324666"><span class="h3">Identification of variants with personal health risks for the carrier</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although the primary goal of screening is to identify risks for offspring, disorders that pose a personal health risk for the carrier may be detected [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. For example, carriers of the fragile X premutation are at increased risk for premature ovarian insufficiency and early-onset ataxia syndrome. Carriers of <em>BRCA1</em>/<em>BRCA2</em> are at increased risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and other conditions.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H655960853"><span class="h3">Identification of X-linked conditions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The frequency of X-linked genes across populations is not known. There are no data or guidance on how to accurately provide pretest counseling to individuals who may discover unanticipated information about their health beyond reproductive risk for the pregnancy when X-linked conditions are included in an expanded panel.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1810354874"><span class="h3">Other</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The cost-effectiveness of a panethnic expanded approach to carrier screening has not been established compared with traditional targeted screening.

Panel composition markedly varies among laboratories (and even within the same laboratory), no laboratory offers a panel that is clearly superior, and there is no accepted standard or guideline for laboratories to determine which disorders to include.<strong> </strong>Commercial laboratories offer test panels that screen for anywhere from a few to up to several hundred disorders. The majority are autosomal recessive, but some may be X-linked or autosomal dominant single gene disorders.

ACOG suggested that obstetric providers determine a standard approach for their practice, but consider an individual's desire for genetic information based on their personal values and preferences.

This information informs preconception planning and pregnancy management. (See <a class="local">'Terminology'</a> above and <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Offer genetic carrier screening</strong> – Relevant professional societies recommend offering generic carrier screening to all pregnant individuals and those planning pregnancy. In the context of shared decision-making, patients should be informed of the range of available information from carrier screening panels and the limitations and benefits of the various options, and then pursue testing based on their desire for information. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Counseling</strong> – Pretest and posttest counseling are essential to the process of carrier screening in clinical practice, and include many components  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef114670" href="/d/graphic/114670.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Patient counseling'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Benefits</strong> – Genetic disorders are not isolated to certain populations. A major benefit of a panethnic expanded screening strategy compared with traditional strategies is identification of carriers who are not fully aware of their racial/ethnic ancestry or who are of multiracial/multiethnic ancestry and thus unaware of their reproductive risk for transmitting a heritable condition to their offspring. Another benefit is the ability to screen for many Mendelian disorders in a single test, including rare disorders where a family history of the condition is often absent. (See <a class="local">'Benefits'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Harms and limitations</strong> – Some limitations include (see <a class="local">'Harms and limitations'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Panels offered by commercial laboratories include some conditions that result in only mild to moderate (rather that severe) health complications (eg, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase [<em>MTHFR</em>] gene variant), have significant variations in or poorly defined phenotype (eg, hereditary hemochromatosis), or have onset in adulthood (eg, <em>BRCA1</em>/<em>BRCA2</em> testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The frequency of some conditions is unknown in the general population or within specific ethnic groups, rendering calculation of residual risk after a positive test inconclusive</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS) and unanticipated or incidental findings may be reported</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Lack of detection of private or unique pathogenic variants</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Identification of variants with personal health risks for the carrier</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Screening panels </strong>– Various strategies for expanded carrier screening panels have been proposed but no uniform or standardized process has been identified for best practice. General guidelines have been developed describing the types of conditions that could be included and should not be included. In general, screening is most appropriate for adult-onset conditions with a well-defined genotype and phenotype, a high carrier frequency that is known within the screened population, cognitive or physical impairment, need for significant surgical treatment or medical intervention throughout life, and/or decreased life expectancy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Professional societies discourage screening for disorders that typically have an adult-onset phenotype and molecular testing cannot distinguish between childhood or adult onset, variants with high allele frequencies and low phenotypic penetrance, or better screening performance with nonmolecular screening techniques.
