         The evaluation and management of pediatric tibial and fibular shaft fractures will be reviewed here. The general approach to tibial fractures, care of proximal tibial fractures in children, and stress fractures of the tibia and fibula are discussed separately. (See

         Lower leg fractures occur with an incidence of approximately 11 per 1000 children and are one of the more common lower extremity fractures in children [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. The mechanism varies depending on the age of the patient, with low energy falls and twisting injuries being more common in younger children and high energy motor vehicle accidents and sports-related injuries predominating in older children and adolescents  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72158" href="/z/d/graphic/72158.html" rel="external">
          image 1
         </a>
         ). The high-energy transmitted to the soft tissues surrounding the bone is relevant because of the significant risk for compartment syndrome associated with tibial shaft fractures. Thus, special attention should be paid to neurovascular status in the first 24 hours following such injuries. Open fractures, most commonly caused by vehicular related injury, are also a major concern with tibial shaft fractures because the anterior tibia is very close to the skin surface.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most tibial shaft fractures are short oblique or transverse fractures of the middle or distal third of the shaft. Tibial shaft fractures are associated with fibula fractures in 30 percent of cases [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. The average age at injury is eight years, and it is more common in boys than girls [

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The tibia is the major weightbearing bone of the lower leg  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54800" href="/z/d/graphic/54800.html" rel="external">
          figure 1

          figure 2
         </a>
         ). The proximal portion of the bone, the tibial plateau, forms the lower surface of the knee joint. The distal end of the bone forms the superior articular surface of the ankle joint at the tibiotalar articulation and the medial malleolus. The tibial shaft bridges the proximal and distal ends and its anterior surface lies just below the skin.
        </p>
        <p>
         In children, both the tibia and fibula consist of a long portion of bone (the diaphysis) with growth plates at either end  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79444" href="/z/d/graphic/79444.html" rel="external">
          figure 3
         </a>
         ). The distal physes, particularly of the fibula, are areas vulnerable to fracture when subjected to inversion and eversion stresses. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6547.html" rel="external">
          "Ankle fractures in children", section on 'Distal fibula fractures'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Pediatric bones have a lower cortical mineral content than adult bones, allowing children's long bones a greater degree of plasticity [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Thus, torus fractures and bowing deformities are injuries unique to the pediatric bone. While these injuries occur most commonly in the forearm, they are also seen in the tibia and fibula. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6536.html" rel="external">
          "General principles of fracture management: Fracture patterns and description in children", section on 'Buckle (torus)'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         A strong fibrous structure, the interosseous membrane, connects the tibia and fibula along the length of the two bones. Proximally, this structure, reinforced by strong anterior and posterior ligaments, forms a synovial joint, the proximal tibiofibular articulation. Distally, the interosseous membrane and three ligaments (the anterior, posterior, and transverse tibiofibular ligaments) stabilize the superior ankle joint.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another fibrous structure, the crural fascia, surrounds the bones and muscles of the lower leg. Fascial extensions and the interosseous membrane separate the muscles, nerves, and vessels of the lower leg into four distinct compartments  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66579" href="/z/d/graphic/66579.html" rel="external">
          figure 4
         </a>
         ). Three of these (the anterior, posterior, and deep posterior compartments) all border the tibia and can be compromised by tibial injury.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nerves and vessels lie within the anterior, lateral, and the deep posterior compartments  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54800" href="/z/d/graphic/54800.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>

          figure 4
         </a>
         ). Trauma that causes significant swelling in these compartments can result in neurovascular compromise. The key blood supply of the tibia arises from periosteal vessels and the nutrient artery. The nutrient artery originates from the posterior tibial artery and enters the posterolateral cortex at the middle third of the tibial shaft near the origin of the soleus muscle. Fractures in this region have the potential to compromise this blood supply.

          Spiral (toddler's) and oblique fractures
         </strong>
         – Most of these injuries occur in children under 11 years of age when the child's body rotates around a fixed foot. In older children, the force is often substantial (eg, skiing, contact sports) and may involve the tibia and fibula. However, in toddlers this injury often results from relatively minor trauma of which the caregiver may be unaware or may dismiss as trivial  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67469" href="/z/d/graphic/67469.html" rel="external">

          Transverse fractures
         </strong>
         – These fractures result from a direct blow to the lower leg that is perpendicular to the bone shaft and indicates a high degree of force (eg, motor vehicle collision)  (

          Bowing fractures

          6
         </a>
         ]. These fractures are more common in the radius and ulna but are also common in the fibula and can be associated with spiral tibial fractures. The abnormality may be subtle, requiring comparison views to detect on plain radiographs. (See

          Torus (buckle) fractures

         – Torus fractures (also known as buckle fractures) are caused by compressive forces that lead to buckling of the cortex. (See

         – These fractures are more likely to be open and are also at higher risk for compartment syndrome because of the high-energy mechanisms involved. Thus, careful examination for a puncture wound or laceration overlying the fracture and assessment of distal neurovascular status should occur. (See

         <strong>
          Toddler's fractures
         </strong>
         – These children typically have a markedly limp or refuse to bear weight on the affected extremity. There is usually no swelling or deformity of the distal tibia to guide the clinician to the site of injury. In cooperative children, tenderness to palpation is often found over the distal tibia. Tenderness may also occur when the provider places one hand at the knee, the other at the ankle, and gently twists in opposite directions. Alternatively, the provider can gently apply back-and-forth pressure to the heel of the foot and into the distal tibia.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Eliciting localized tenderness over the site of injury may be difficult, particularly in a child who is already crying. In these patients, the clinical findings of limp or refusal to bear weight may be the main clue to the injury.

          Identifying abusive injuries
         </strong>
         – Transverse fractures of the femur, humerus, or tibia are the most common type of long bone fracture associated with abuse, comprising 48 to 71 percent of abuse-related fractures in various studies. Thus, child abuse should be suspected when the reported mechanism does not correlate with the degree of injury. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6613.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In differentiating unintentional from abusive trauma in toddlers with spiral fractures, the clinician should understand that 90 to 95 percent of unintentional toddler's fractures of the tibia have a reported mechanism [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-9
         </a>
         ]. In these instances, the described force is typically low energy, and the fracture is minimally displaced. For example, the toddler may stumble and catch the foot between the bars of a crib, or may slip on toys on the floor while running. Like all long bone fractures, spiral fractures are suspicious (but not pathognomonic) for abuse when the patient is too young to walk or lacks a consistent history (ie, of having had a twisting or rotational injury).

         Toddler's fractures are a specialized case of spiral fractures of the distal tibia. The toddler's fracture is a nondisplaced fracture of the distal tibial shaft in patients in the age group from nine months, when weight bearing is just beginning, to approximately four years [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. The definition of toddler's fractures can be expanded to include fractures of other lower extremity bones including fractures of the foot and fibula, but the tibia is the most commonly affected bone because it bears most of the weight of the lower leg [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,12,13
         </a>
         ]. The physical examination findings usually are subtle.
        </p>
        <p>
         AP and lateral radiographs of the affected leg may show a faint hairline fracture that can be easily missed, mistaken for a nutrient vessel, or inapparent on initial films in almost a third of patients [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. The AP view is the best view for observing the nondisplaced spiral fracture coursing along the distal tibia  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67469" href="/z/d/graphic/67469.html" rel="external">
          image 2
         </a>
         ). Oblique views of the tibia can aid diagnosis when the AP and lateral plain radiographs are not revealing [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. In patients with clinical findings suggestive of a toddler's fracture but negative plain radiographs, repeat plain radiographs in seven days often show evidence of new bone growth. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Occasionally, young children present with a limp, but there is diagnostic uncertainty due to lack of reported history, prolonged symptoms, or fever. In these situations, advanced imaging may be warranted, either gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if infection is the primary concern or computed tomography (CT) if significant bone destruction is seen on plain film [
         <a href="#rid6">

        <p>
         Bone scintigraphy is very sensitive for toddler's fractures and infections, but it exposes the child to significant amounts of radiation. It may be useful when MRI is not available, the area of infection cannot be localized, or multiple areas of involvement are suspected, especially in patients with atypical presentations [

         Patients with type I open fractures of the tibia or fibula (ie, clean wound &lt;1 cm in length) usually have minimal soft tissue injury and intact local perfusion.

         Compartment syndrome may rarely occur prior to or after definitive orthopedic care of a tibial shaft fracture. When compartment syndrome is suspected based on clinical findings, immediate management includes relieving all external pressure on the compartment. Any dressing, splint, cast, or other restrictive covering should be removed. The limb should NOT be elevated. Elevation can diminish arterial inflow and exacerbate ischemia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Suspected compartment syndrome should prompt emergent orthopedic consultation. Compartment syndrome remains a clinical diagnosis. Although compartment pressure measurements can corroborate the clinical suspicion of a compartment syndrome, the patient with clear physical exam signs of a potential compartment syndrome should undergo fasciotomy with decompression of all involved compartments.

         Diagnosis of a tibial shaft fracture in a child, especially a nonambulatory infant, with a questionable mechanism of injury should prompt evaluation for child abuse once the patient is stable  (

         With the exception of Toddler's fractures, casting is the mainstay of treatment for nondisplaced tibial shaft fractures in children. Treatment consists of a long leg cast with the knee bent to 45 degrees at the knee and 90 degrees at the ankle for four to six weeks with frequent cast checks, followed by a short leg walking brace for an additional four to six weeks. The patient is ready for normal activity once full radiographic healing is demonstrated, and the fracture site is no longer tender to palpation.

         Prompt orthopedic evaluation is warranted for initial casting of children with tibial fractures associated with ipsilateral fibular fractures. However, subsequent treatment is not altered.

After the short leg cast is set, the rest of the cast is applied to the groin with the knee flexed 30 to 60 degrees. Casts applied during the acute phase of injury should be bivalved to allow for swelling.

         Isolated fibular fractures may be initially managed with a stirrup splint, analgesics, ice, and elevation. The child should see an orthopedist with pediatric expertise within one week. At that time, patients may receive a short leg walking cast. Alternatively, the stirrup splint may be used for the entire period of immobilization, typically three to four weeks.

        <p>
         Although the fibula is not essential to ambulation, children whose fractures are very painful or who are wearing a stirrup splint should be made non-weightbearing with crutches, as capable.

         For children with definite toddler's fractures on plain radiographs  (

         ), many experts suggest immobilization with a long leg cast. However, retrospective observational studies suggest that, for spiral fractures of the distal two thirds of the tibia, initial immobilization can be accomplished using a controlled ankle movement (CAM) walker boot or short leg cast with a low risk of fracture instability [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20-25
         </a>
         ]. These same studies included children who did not receive external immobilization and had good outcomes, though the numbers are too small to recommend this approach. Cast immobilization is associated with a significant risk for skin breakdown, longer duration of immobilization, and increased resource use (orthopedic follow-up visits and repeat radiographs) compared with a walking boot. Thus, a walking boot, when available, is preferred. Once immobilized, these patients warrant referral to an orthopedist in 7 to 10 days [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20,26-29

        </p>
        <p>
         Toddlers with a clear-cut history of trauma and an inability to bear weight on the affected extremity, regardless of negative radiographs, also warrant immobilization with a CAM walker boot, short leg splint or short leg cast. In these patients, a spiral fracture is the most likely cause for the findings and immobilization is appropriate until definitive diagnosis can be made. Such fractures usually become radiographically visible as a result of new bone growth approximately seven days after injury [
         <a href="#rid7">

         Patients with nondisplaced tibial fractures should be provided with immobilization (splint or cast) as previously described, made nonambulatory, and instructed to keep the fracture site elevated above the level of the heart as much as possible for the first 48 hours after injury. These patients may be discharged home with orthopedic follow-up in one week. (See

         We suggest that patients who require closed reduction of a tibial shaft fracture be admitted to the hospital to monitor for signs of acute compartment syndrome for 24 to 48 hours. This recommendation especially applies to patients with significantly malaligned fractures and those rare patients who need external fixation and pinning [
         <a href="#rid3">

        </p>
        <p>
         Tibial and/or fibular shaft fractures that undergo closed reduction should be evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon within a week. Subsequently, the patient is seen on a frequent basis for the first few weeks to monitor for any displacement or angulation.

          Clinical manifestations
         </strong>
         – Children with tibial and fibular shaft fractures may have pain, swelling, and/or deformity at the site of injury and are usually unable or unwilling to walk; children with an isolated fibular fracture may be able to walk with a limp. (See

These patients may be discharged home with orthopedic follow-up arranged within 7 to 10 days of the day of injury. (See

          Spiral (toddler's fractures)
         </strong>
         – Toddler's fractures represent a specific type of tibia fracture. The classic toddler's fracture, defined as a nondisplaced spiral fracture of the distal two thirds of the tibia  (

         ), may be treated less conservatively. Some orthopedic and pediatric emergency medicine practitioners may choose to place these children in a short leg cast, splint, or walking boot to control ankle movement (CAM). The evidence for this approach is limited to small studies. The standard practice remains full immobilization with a long leg cast or splint.

          Child protection
         </strong>
         – Diagnosis of a tibial shaft fracture in a child, especially a nonambulatory infant, with a questionable mechanism of injury should prompt evaluation for child abuse  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119442" href="/z/d/graphic/119442.html" rel="external">
          table 5
         </a>
         ). Consultation with a multidisciplinary child abuse team that includes a child abuse specialist is optimal, where available, and may support transfer to a center with these resources. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/103420.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In many parts of the world, a mandatory report to appropriate governmental authorities is also required for cases of suspected abuse. Additional evaluation for other injuries is also indicated. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6604.html" rel="external">
