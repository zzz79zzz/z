Prior to the advent of modern medicine, severe diarrhea was often fatal and disease outbreaks spread quickly, affecting large populations. Today, despite the success of interventions such as oral and intravenous rehydration therapy, diarrheal diseases remain a substantial cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, particularly in children and older adults. Worldwide, more than 500,000 children &lt;5 years died from diarrheal diseases in 2017 [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The underlying causes of diarrhea in children are numerous and vary by age and geographical location, among other factors.</p><p>Regardless of etiology, the evaluation and management of an infant or child with diarrhea require an understanding of the physiology of fluid and electrolyte transport in the gastrointestinal tract. This topic focuses on the pathophysiology of fluid absorption and secretion in diarrhea and a classification of diarrhea relevant to diagnostic evaluations.</p><p>Detailed reviews of the diagnostic approach and management of diarrhea in children are found in the following topics:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6456.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic approach to diarrhea in children in resource-abundant settings"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13956.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with acute diarrhea in resource-limited settings"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5878.html" rel="external">"Persistent diarrhea in children in resource-limited settings"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5877.html" rel="external">"Overview of the causes of chronic diarrhea in children in resource-abundant settings"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1727415866"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1884368674"><span class="h2">Diarrhea</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Diarrhea can be defined using one or both of the following measures:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stool frequency or consistency – For practical use in the clinical setting, diarrhea is typically defined by stool frequency and consistency. A common definition is the passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day, or more frequent passage than is normal for the individual [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The Bristol stool chart can be used to codify stool consistency [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. Diarrheal stools typically correspond to types 6 and 7 on the Bristol stool chart [<a href="#rid5">5</a>] (or its slightly modified versions for children [<a href="#rid6">6</a>] or infants [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stool weight or volume – In hospital settings where the volume of stools can be measured, diarrhea is defined as stool volume of more than 20 grams/kg/day in infants and toddlers (&lt;10 kg) or more than 250 grams/day in older children or teenagers [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H216785159"><span class="h2">Chronic diarrhea</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Chronic diarrhea is generally defined as diarrhea lasting greater than four weeks [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. This timeline is selected to distinguish between the acute diarrheal episode, which tends to be self-limited, and more prolonged diarrheal disease that warrants further evaluation and, possibly, intervention. The term persistent diarrhea is sometimes used to describe diarrhea lasting longer than two weeks; other times, the term is used interchangeably with chronic diarrhea.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2195262007"><span class="h1">FLUID MOVEMENT IN THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1821777725"><span class="h2">Normal fluid absorption and secretion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Large quantities of fluid are transported bidirectionally across epithelial barriers in the gastrointestinal tract for secretion of saliva, gastric juice, bile, and pancreatic fluid and for fluid absorption in the intestine. The quantity of fluid transported in the intestine is second only to the kidney, where approximately 180 L of fluid per day are filtered by the glomerulus and processed by various nephron segments.</p><p>In healthy adults, several liters of fluid are absorbed and secreted by the different segments of the intestine each day  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113253" href="/z/d/graphic/113253.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The salivary glands produce approximately 1.5 L of fluid per day, the stomach secretes 2.5 L of gastric juice, the liver produces 0.5 L of bile, and the pancreas produces 1.5 L of enzyme- and bicarbonate-rich fluid. To balance this, the small intestine absorbs 6.5 L of fluid and the colon additionally absorbs 1.3 L of fluid against significant osmotic gradients.</p><p>The small intestine performs most of the fluid absorption (83 percent) in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, diseases that affect the small intestine often result in clinically significant diarrhea. Although the colon absorbs a much smaller volume of fluid than the small intestine, it is critical for the generation of formed feces. The intestinal contents enter the colon with a water content of approximately 90 percent and leave the colon as feces, with a water content of 65 to 75 percent. Therefore, significant alteration of colonic function alone can also lead to clinical diarrhea.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H399575406"><span class="h2">Molecular mechanisms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Movement of fluid between the intestinal lumen and blood is driven by the active transport of ions (mainly Na<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>–</sup>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>, and K<sup>+</sup>) and nutrients (mainly glucose). Fluid absorption or secretion involves the coordinated activity of membrane transporters located on the apical (lumen-facing) and basolateral (circulation-facing) epithelial membranes. The intestinal epithelium is structurally configured into long, finger-like (in three-dimensional pathologic sections) or leaf-like projections (in two dimensions; villi) and glandular tube-like structures (crypts). The stem cells at the base of the crypt provide various differentiated epithelial cell types, including the more numerous enterocytes that ascend and populate the villus structure. In the small bowel, each villus is supported by as many as 10 distinct crypts. In the colon, the crypts are considerably longer than in the small bowel and produce epithelium that covers a flat luminal surface devoid of villi. Functionally, both ion and fluid absorption and secretion occur in enterocytes located in both villi and crypts, although, in the small intestine, secretory processes predominate in crypts and absorptive processes in villi  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113255" href="/z/d/graphic/113255.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Intestinal fluid absorption is driven by the active transport of Na<sup>+</sup> across the epithelium, with parallel Cl<sup>–</sup> or HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> absorption ( (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113255" href="/z/d/graphic/113255.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>), panels A and C). The electrochemical driving force for this process is provided by the basolateral Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase that exports intracellular Na<sup>+</sup>.

Diarrhea occurs when excessive amounts of fluid remain within the lumen of the intestine  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113254" href="/z/d/graphic/113254.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). This can occur because of increased secretion into the intestinal lumen or reduced absorption of water from the lumen to the body. In either case, there is an increased concentration of osmotically active particles (nutrients and/or electrolytes) within the lumen of the intestine, resulting in a net increase in the water content of the intestinal contents. Increased concentrations of osmotically active particles within the lumen occur through three primary mechanisms:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Loss of nutrient absorption or the presence of nonabsorbable solutes</strong> in the intestinal lumen ( (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113254" href="/z/d/graphic/113254.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>), panel B). Examples include the loss of nutrient absorption seen in celiac disease or in inflammation, and diarrhea caused by laxatives such as <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13070" href="/z/d/drug information/13070.html" rel="external">polyethylene glycol 3350</a> (PEG 3350). This mechanism underlies diet-induced (previously classified as osmotic) diarrhea, which improves with fasting. (See <a class="local">'Diet-induced (osmotic)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Increased secretion or reduced absorption of electrolytes</strong> (Na<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) across the epithelium ( (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113254" href="/z/d/graphic/113254.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>), panel C). Examples include diarrhea secondary to infection with <em>Vibrio</em> <em>cholerae</em>, which causes excessive secretion of chloride and loss of electroneutral sodium absorption. This mechanism underlies electrolyte transport-related (previously classified as secretory) diarrhea, which fails to improve with fasting. (See <a class="local">'Mechanisms of altered fluid transport in diarrheal diseases'</a> below and <a class="local">'Electrolyte transport-related (secretory)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Rapid intestinal transit</strong> resulting in reduced time for fluid absorption ( (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113254" href="/z/d/graphic/113254.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>), panel D). Examples include a variety of conditions that cause hypermotility of the intestine, including the functional diarrhea seen in infants and toddlers (sometimes termed "toddler's diarrhea"). (See <a class="local">'Motility-related'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5877.html" rel="external">"Overview of the causes of chronic diarrhea in children in resource-abundant settings", section on 'Functional diarrhea in young children'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Many of the underlying etiologies of diarrhea in children cause diarrhea through a combination of these primary mechanisms. For example, in inflammatory bowel disease, inflammation causes a loss of absorptive surface area and capacity, causing loss of nutrient transport as well as increasing active Cl<sup>-</sup> secretion and intestinal motility.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2315749951"><span class="h3">Mechanisms of altered fluid transport in diarrheal diseases</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Alterations in fluid transport between the intestinal lumen and the body underlie many of the causes of diarrheal illness.</p><p>Several common diarrheal conditions are characterized by loss of nutrient-driven electrolyte transport. As an example, patients with lactase deficiency are unable to hydrolyze lactose into glucose and galactose. This leads to loss of fluid absorption driven by the Na<sup>+</sup>/glucose co-transporter (SGLT1) and increased osmolality in the intestinal lumen. Lactase deficiency can be either acquired (eg, due to mucosal injury from enteric injury from infection or celiac disease), congenital (loss-of-function mutation in the lactase gene), or genetically driven, age-dependent acquired deficiency (hypolactasia). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2542.html" rel="external">"Lactose intolerance and malabsorption: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management", section on 'Primary lactose malabsorption'</a>.)</p><p>Certain enterotoxigenic pathogens cause diarrhea by stimulating fluid secretion. As examples, <em>V</em>. <em>cholerae</em> and enterotoxigenic <em>Escherichia</em> <em>coli</em> release bacterial enterotoxins (cholera toxin, heat-stable enterotoxin), which alter the intracellular levels of second messenger molecules such as cAMP, cGMP, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113256" href="/z/d/graphic/113256.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. These signal to the key channels that drive fluid absorption and secretion. Cholera toxin induces elevations in cAMP, leading to activation of the chloride channel CFTR and inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup> exchanger NHE3, resulting in massive secretory diarrhea. Bacteria can also increase various humoral agonists, neurotransmitters, or neuropeptide receptors such as 5-hydroxytryptamine, vasoactive intestinal peptides and the galanin receptor type 1, also activating Cl<sup>–</sup> secretion and inhibiting Na<sup>+</sup> absorption. Similarly, diarrhea caused by viruses is partly due to the action of viral enterotoxins such as rotavirus NSP4, resulting in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation, inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup> absorption, and increased Cl<sup>-</sup> secretion  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113256" href="/z/d/graphic/113256.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].

Invasive bacteria such as <em>Salmonella</em> and <em>Shigella</em> cause a tissue inflammatory response involving recruitment of immune cells and release of cytokines, resulting in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Enteropathogenic and invasive bacteria also result in alterations in channel protein expression, with consequent impaired Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>–</sup> absorption.

However, fluid absorption in the colon can often compensate for moderate loss of small intestinal absorptive function.</p><p>Although the colon absorbs a much smaller volume of fluid than the small intestine, it is critical for the generation of formed (dehydrated) feces [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Therefore, any condition that alters colonic fluid transport or increases colonic motility tends to result in abnormally watery stool and therefore diarrhea.</p><p>The colonic microbiome also plays an important role in driving fluid absorption in the colon. Colonic bacteria participate in the fermentation of dietary carbohydrates unabsorbed by the small intestine to produce short-chain fatty acids such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate. These are rapidly absorbed in the colon, enhancing absorption of Na<sup>+</sup> and water, and secretion of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Disruption of short-chain fatty acid production may therefore play a role in antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Conversely, stabilization of the colonic microbiome through the administration of probiotics can reduce diarrhea associated with antibiotic use. Alterations to commensal bacteria in the colon after antibiotic administration allows opportunistic pathogens such as <em>Clostridioides</em> <em>difficile</em> to displace the normal flora and can result in toxin-mediated inflammation and diarrhea.

A bile acid-enriched state is thought to occur in a subset of patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, inducing fluid secretion as well as reducing the transit time through the colon, resulting in incomplete fecal dehydration and diarrhea.

Some authors use the term to refer to diarrhea caused by active ion secretion into the intestine; this definition is problematic because it does not include watery diarrhea caused by defects in intestinal sodium absorption (eg, due to some causes of congenital sodium diarrhea and in viral infections). Others use the term to describe diarrhea with a low stool osmotic gap (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2591.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult with chronic diarrhea in resource-abundant settings", section on 'Characterizing the diarrhea type'</a>). This definition is also problematic because a low stool osmotic gap generally results from a combination of anion-driven fluid secretion and loss of Na<sup>+</sup>-driven fluid absorption. Referring to this type of diarrhea as only "secretory" is therefore somewhat misleading. Because of these definitional issues, we prefer to use the more precise term "electrolyte transport-related diarrhea" rather than "secretory diarrhea."</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mixed diarrhea – Lastly, diarrhea that is obviously neither "secretory" or "osmotic" or has an intermediate stool osmotic gap has been referred to as "mixed." Although intermediate values for the stool osmotic gap occur frequently, these often reflect the dietary intake at the time of testing. From a diagnostic standpoint, this category is rarely helpful.</p><p></p><p>Despite the above caveats, the terms "osmotic" and "secretory" diarrhea are widely used clinically and historically, and for the purposes of this topic review, we will refer to both the existing terms and our newer terminology.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1881281505"><span class="h2">Diet-induced (osmotic)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Diet-induced diarrhea occurs when osmotically active substances are present in the intestinal lumen, resulting in water retention.

Because this form of diarrhea is driven by osmotically active ingested nutrients (eg, carbohydrates) or exogenous substances (eg, osmotic laxative), the diarrhea will abate during fasting. Thus, a trial of fasting (&gt;12 hours) is a useful diagnostic test. This is ideally done in a hospital to carefully monitor both stool output and hydration status but can also be inferred from the history if the diarrhea abates during either deliberate or inadvertent fasting.</p><p>Primary lactose intolerance or PEG 3350 ingestion are examples of diarrheas with a purely osmotic mechanism. A diet-induced mechanism can also contribute to diarrhea from a variety of other causes. For example, enteric infections and inflammatory conditions such as <em>Salmonella</em> and inflammatory bowel disease can cause damage to intestinal epithelial cells and loss of absorptive surface area, leading to impaired nutrient absorption and diet-induced diarrhea.

ORS is a highly effective treatment that relies on the fact that SGLT1 transport is preserved in electrolyte transport-related (secretory) diarrheas such as those caused by bacterial enterotoxins. Beverages commercially marketed for hydration during exercise ("sports" beverages) have much higher concentrations of glucose and higher osmolarity, which reduces fluid absorption; these are less effective for oral rehydration.
