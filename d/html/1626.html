         The Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) has listed PN as a "high alert medication," in the same category of complexity and potential for error or harm as chemotherapy. Guidelines that describe safe practices for PN have been published by professional organizations [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-5
         </a>
         ]. These recommend that PN be prescribed by a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nutritionists, pharmacists, and nurses [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ] since it is complicated and requires advanced knowledge about issues such as nutrient metabolism and solute compatibility [

         When given for more than a few days, PN must be delivered via a central venous catheter (CVC; also called central PN [CPN]) because its high osmotic load is not tolerated by peripheral veins [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. PN may be given via a peripheral vein if it is significantly more diluted (&lt;900 milliosmole); this is termed peripheral PN (PPN). PPN is rarely indicated in the inpatient setting because of the ease of obtaining central access in the hospital. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Peripheral parenteral nutrition'

         <strong>
          Device options
         </strong>
         – Central venous access devices (CVADs) are the access of choice for the delivery of PN. This includes a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) or a tunneled CVC (TCVC; also referred to as TICC; eg, Hickman catheter, Groshong catheter, or implanted infusion port), as well as CVCs that are often in place in critically ill patients (eg, subclavian, internal jugular, or femoral CVC).

         <strong>
          Choosing a device
         </strong>
         – Choosing appropriate access should be individualized and depends upon duration of need for PN, local expertise, ability of the facility or individual to take care of the device, and presence of other risk factors for catheter-related blood stream infections (CRBSI; eg, previous sepsis with CVC in place). The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) has issued clinical guidelines to describe best practices in the selection and care of CVADs for the infusion of
         <strong>
          home
         </strong>
         PN in adult patients [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. We use similar principles when selecting CVADs for
         <strong>
          hospitalized
         </strong>
         critically ill patients in whom PN is indicated.

         </span>
         Short-term administration (&lt;30 days) – In general, we agree that for patients in whom short-term administration of PN is desirable or intended, PN delivered through a PICC is appropriate. As a less preferable alternative, PN may be administered through a subclavian, internal jugular, or femoral CVC if PN is only needed for very short periods (eg, transition to enteral nutrition is anticipated in the near future, such as a week or two) or if a PICC is not feasible or reasonable. The femoral site is least desirable due to an increased risk of CRBSIs [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. (See

          •
         </span>
         Long-term administration (≥30 days) – For long-term administration of PN, it is our practice to use PICCs preferentially because of the relative ease of insertion and removal compared with TCVC. ASPEN guidelines indicated a preference for a TCVC based upon expert opinion and observational studies that suggest infection rates may be lower with TCVC than other catheters [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10-13
         </a>
         ]. However, one systematic review suggested that infection rates were similar when PN delivered through a PICC was compared with TCVC delivery (relative risk 0.4, 95% CI 0.19-0.83) [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         When possible, we use a single lumen catheter dedicated to PN administration. If a multiple lumen CVC is used, one port should be dedicated solely for PN administration, even if previously used for other infusions before PN administration. For patients who have an existing CVC, a new CVC is not typically required unless there has been septicemia during the life of the existing line. In addition, catheter manipulations should be minimized.
        </p>

         PN is an admixture of solutions containing dextrose, amino acids, electrolytes, vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Lipid emulsion may be infused separately or added to the mixture. When lipid is infused separately, the PN is referred to as "2-in-1." When lipid is mixed with the other ingredients, it is referred to as total nutrient admixture (TNA) or "3-in-1." TNA is recommended by ASPEN and preferred by us, although choosing among formulations is institution- and clinician-specific [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Noteworthy is that the minimum triglyceride concentration in TNA must be ≥2 percent (ie, 2 g/100 mL) or the emulsion becomes unstable.
        </p>
        <p>
         PN may be custom-formulated in a hospital or compounding pharmacy or manufactured as a premixed solution. Use of one or the other is institution-dependent. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Premixed solutions'

         The exact composition and infusion rate are tailored to the nutritional and fluid needs of each patient and the estimated metabolic capacity for incorporation of the components, the details of which are discussed separately. (See

         Many hospitals maintain sterile compounding pharmacy facilities to mix PN. In some regions, freestanding compounding pharmacies provide this function for multiple hospitals. Home infusion companies most often provide custom-made solutions. The advantage to this method is that most components of PN can be adjusted to an individual patient's needs (eg, macronutrients, electrolytes, trace elements, and to a lesser extent, vitamins).

         Premixed solutions are commercially available ("off-the-shelf PN"). These have the advantage of not requiring specialty pharmacies for compounding since they are manufactured in large pharmaceutical settings. Their disadvantage is the diminished ability to customize the formula for an individual patient's needs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Premixed solutions contain various combinations of dextrose, amino acids (with electrolytes), and lipids. Vitamins, minerals, and trace elements are generally added to this solution. While there are many variations in macro- and micronutrient contents that can be ordered (eg, high- and low-protein formulas and electrolyte-restricted formulas), keeping a large variety in stock can be cost-prohibitive and institutions using premixed PN generally choose a few commonly used formulations.

         </span>
         Dextrose-containing stock solutions are available in a variety of concentrations (40, 50, 70 percent), but 70 percent is most commonly used. The caloric contribution of dextrose in medical solutions is 3.4 kilocalories (kcal)/g of dextrose, which differs from dietary carbohydrate (4 kcal/g). The reason for the difference is that water contributes to the weight of the dextrose-hydrate that is used to prepare PN.
        </p>
        <p>
         The percentage of calories that is contributed by dextrose is titrated according to individual factors, such as severity of illness, the caloric needs of the patient, and the underlying conditions. It is generally thought that dextrose dosage should not exceed 4 to 7 mg/kg/minute or 5 to 6 g/kg/dL.
        </p>
        <p>
         The amount of dextrose given on the first day of PN administration should be half of the intended goal. This helps attenuate the potential for refeeding syndrome and hyperglycemia. Dextrose can be increased to goal if electrolytes and glucose levels are satisfactory on the second or subsequent day. (See

         Amino acid solutions contain most essential and nonessential amino acids. The amino acid stock solutions come in concentrations ranging from 5.5 to 15 percent, and the caloric contribution of amino acids is approximately 4 kcal/g.
        </p>
        <p>
         The buffer most commonly used in amino acid solutions contains electrolytes in small quantities. It is occasionally necessary to use amino acid solutions with volume and electrolyte restriction (eg, for example in patients with kidney failure and hyperphosphatemia). These are usually 15 percent amino acid solutions and contain less sodium and acetate and are devoid of phosphate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Enrichment of PN with a variety of specialized amino acids, such as branched chain amino acids has been studied, but there is insufficient evidence to warrant their routine use [

         Lipids are provided as an emulsion that may be infused separately (ie, 2-in-1 PN) or added to the mixture (ie, total nutrient admixture or "3-in-1"). We prefer the latter.
        </p>
        <p>
         Lipids are a source of essential fatty acids (to prevent deficiency) and calories. The caloric contribution of a typical lipid emulsion is 10 kcal/g (or 2 kcal/mL in 20 percent emulsion) and 11 kcal/g or (1.1 kcal/mL in 10 percent emulsion). While dietary fat provides 9 kcal/g, parenteral lipids provide slightly more calories due to the contribution of calories from the emulsifiers used to create the lipid suspension for intravenous administration.
        </p>
        <p>
         Lipid infusion rates should not exceed 0.11 g triglyceride/kg/minute. When infused separately from PN, both 10 and 20 percent emulsions can be infused via peripheral vein.

        <p>
         In the United States, most lipid emulsion consists of long-chain omega-6 triglycerides derived from soybean and safflower oils. Mixtures of several types of lipids (eg, refined olive, soybean, and fish oil emulsions) have been approved and are also available for use in the US. However, randomized trials have not conclusively demonstrated any meaningful clinical benefit in association with any specific type of lipid emulsion in critically ill patients [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16-20
         </a>
         ]. Similarly, while omega-3 fatty acid-enriched PN was associated with a lower risk of infection in one meta-analysis [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ], trials in critically ill patients of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in enteral feeds were not beneficial. Further trials are needed before we can recommend supplementation of PN with omega-3 fatty acids. (See

         , as these are excreted in bile. A total bilirubin of 2 mg/dL is often used as a cutoff to restrict these, and it is often necessary to order the remaining trace elements individually.

         Once the caloric and protein needs of a patient has been determined, PN is generally administered as a continuous infusion with the total volume initially administered over 24 hours. Calculating the caloric and protein needs of an individual patient is discussed separately. (See

         The daily volume of PN is tailored to the nutritional and fluid needs of each patient. While enteral feeding formulas may be as concentrated as 2 kilocalories (kcal)/mL, it is difficult to concentrate PN much more than 1.2 kcal/mL. PN may be highly diluted to provide extra volume to patients who require it (eg, high output enterocutaneous fistula), but lipid concentration must be maintained above 2 percent in total nutrient admixture or the emulsion becomes unstable. (See

Once stable, laboratory draw frequency is an individualized decision. In very stable hospitalized patients, we recommend (at minimum) weekly laboratory draws. (See

         Guidelines suggest that when tolerance to enteral nutrition (EN) is evident, PN should be weaned and discontinued when &gt;60 percent of the patients' needs are met enterally, although there are no data to support this practice [

          Access
         </strong>
         – PPN can be delivered for short periods through a peripheral intravenous catheter (eg, a few days). Although PPN has an osmolality lower than that of conventional PN, PPN is still quite hyperosmolar and irritating to the peripheral veins. Frequent replacement of intravenous access is usually necessary. We do not infuse PPN via midline catheters as we have seen late stenosis at the midline catheter tip location.

         </span>
         <strong>
          Indications
         </strong>
         – PPN is rarely prescribed because it can be used only for a limited time. To deliver adequate nutrients, either a large enough volume and/or a high fat formulation must be used, making it generally impractical as a form of long-term nutrition support.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         PPN is useful when central access is delayed. In this circumstance, it can help to deliver calories sooner so that refeeding and glycemic control might be more quickly addressed once access is eventually achieved.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         PPN is also used when central access needs to be temporarily removed and continued feeding is critical (eg, "line holiday" for treatment of bloodstream infection in a malnourished patient). In this circumstance, PPN is a bridge until the line is replaced. This approach is not necessary if the patient is adequately nourished.

         </span>
         <strong>
          Components
         </strong>
         – Calculations for PPN are the same as for central PN, with the exception that fat usually composes 50 to 60 percent of calories. This helps minimize volume while keeping osmolality low. Osmolality must not exceed 900 milliosmole/L. Calculators for estimating PN osmolality are available online if not built into the institution electronic order.

         (PN) provides calories and nutrients parenterally. PN should be delivered through a single dedicated lumen of a central venous catheter, preferably a peripherally inserted central catheter. As an alternative, infusion through a subclavian or internal jugular vein catheter is appropriate for short-term administration (&lt;30 days). PN should be administered under the supervision of a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nutritionists, pharmacists, and nurses. (See

         PN may be manufactured in a premixed solution or custom-formulated in a hospital or compounding pharmacy. When lipid is infused separately, the PN is referred to as 2-in-1. When lipid is mixed with the other ingredients, it is referred to as total nutrient admixture (TNA) or 3-in-1. Choosing among formulations is institution- and clinician-specific, and practice varies. We suggest TNA rather than 2-in-1 formulations (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). This preference is based upon convenience and also preferred by guideline groups. (See

         The exact composition and infusion rate are tailored to the nutritional and fluid needs of each patient. Calculation of calorie and protein needs is discussed separately. (See

         <strong>
          Delivery
         </strong>
         – PN is generally administered as a continuous infusion with the total volume initially administered over 24 hours. In general, we start PN at half the daily requirements on day one and, if tolerated without uncontrolled hyperglycemia, precipitous change in electrolytes, or reaction to lipid, we proceed to the target goal on day two.

         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Monitoring
         </strong>
         – Routine monitoring of PN includes measurement of fluid intake and output, as well as selected laboratory studies. For most patients, serum electrolytes, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate are measured daily until they are stable; aminotransferases and bilirubin are measured at least once each week for the first few weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Triglyceride levels are also measured for the first two to three days of PN, and if stable, they are then measured weekly for a few weeks, then monthly. When concentrations rise above 400 mg/dL, we reduce the frequency of lipid administration (eg, two to three times per week); lipid infusion should be discontinued for triglyceride concentrations &gt;1000 mg/dL.

         <a class="local">
