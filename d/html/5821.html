Studies in adults show that T2DM and its comorbidities are important risk factors for vascular disease. It is likely, therefore, that identifying and treating children and adolescents with T2DM will improve long-term outcomes; however, it is important to appreciate that pediatric-onset T2DM differs from adult-onset disease, especially regarding durability of glycemic control [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>] and earlier emergence of complications [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>Only a few studies have examined the management of T2DM in the pediatric age group. The largest clinical trial, Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY study), has shown that oral agent monotherapy does not maintain durable glycemic control in a majority of patients with adolescent-onset T2DM (see <a class="local">'Approach to treatment'</a> below). Thus, it is important to optimize treatment using a combination of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions, with close monitoring and follow-up.</p><p>Ideally, the care of an adolescent with T2DM should be managed by a multidisciplinary team, including an endocrinologist, nurse educator, dietitian, mental health professional, and sometimes an exercise physiologist. However, in locations where these resources are not available, patients can be managed by primary care clinicians, following the guidelines outlined in this topic review [<a href="#rid9">9-12</a>]. Patients who do not achieve good glycemic control on <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12589" href="/d/drug information/12589.html" rel="external">metformin</a> monotherapy should be managed by or in consultation with an endocrinologist and diabetes educator, if at all possible. Family involvement is essential to initiate and support the lifestyle changes required in the management of a pediatric patient with this disorder.</p><p>The management of T2DM in children and adolescents is presented here. The epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis, comorbidities, and complications of pediatric T2DM are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5820.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, presentation, and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5826.html" rel="external">"Chronic complications and screening in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21782272"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diabetes</strong> – Diabetes mellitus can be diagnosed based on abnormal plasma glucose (fasting or random) and oral glucose tolerance test, or hemoglobin A1c (A1C).

Body mass index (BMI) provides an index for weight in relation to height. In children and adolescents, obesity is defined as a BMI ≥95<sup>th</sup> percentile for age and sex. Overweight is defined as a BMI ≥85<sup>th</sup> and &lt;95<sup>th</sup> percentile. Almost all youth with T2DM are overweight or obese.

Lifestyle modifications to reduce body weight should be initiated in all patients with this disorder  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef88489" href="/d/graphic/88489.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Nutrition therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Individualized nutrition therapy can be effective in improving glycemic control. Nutritional goals include [<a href="#rid14">14-16</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Improve glycemic control by balancing food intake with physical activity. This may include providing small meals to avoid wide glycemic excursions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Provide a diet that reduces caloric intake but also improves dietary quality to meet the nutritional requirements for normal health and growth.</p><p></p><p>The patient and family should consult with a registered dietitian with experience in pediatric nutrition and diabetes if possible [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. The dietitian can provide instruction on how to adjust dietary habits and behaviors to ensure adequate nutrition while reducing caloric intake. Consultation with a dietitian is particularly important for patients who do not achieve good glycemic control in the initial phases of treatment and require intensification of treatment. (See <a class="local">'Dietary prescription'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Weight goals</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In children and adolescents with T2DM, the optimal goal is a 7 to 10 percent decrease in body weight in those who have completed linear growth, or a body mass index (BMI) &lt;85<sup>th</sup> percentile for age and sex in those still growing [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Excessive weight causes peripheral insulin resistance and decreases insulin-mediated glucose uptake, which, in turn, places greater demands upon the already stressed insulin-producing beta cells. In adults with T2DM, weight loss reduces insulin resistance and improves insulin secretion. Similar benefits of weight reduction are seen in the pediatric age group. In obese children without T2DM, decreases in BMI of 0.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or more lead to improvements in insulin sensitivity [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Furthermore, in 20 adolescent patients with T2DM treated with very low-calorie diets for one to four months, BMI dropped from 43.5 to 39.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, hemoglobin A1c (A1C) decreased from 8.8 to 7.4 percent, and pharmacologic agents were discontinued in all but 1 of the 20 participants [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. However, very low-calorie diets may not be appropriate for longer duration treatment in children and adolescents.</p><p>Most youth with T2DM are at least 12 years old and have severe obesity; therefore, an intensive approach to weight management is warranted (ie, weight reduction rather than weight maintenance is indicated). Moreover, most youth with T2DM are in the later stages of pubertal growth and are already at or nearly at adult stature [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p>Although the goal is weight reduction, it is prudent to approach this goal stepwise. For many patients and families, it may be appropriate to set an initial goal of weight maintenance. After successful weight maintenance, further dietary intervention can focus on gradual weight loss to reach a BMI &lt;85<sup>th</sup> percentile. A weight loss rate of 0.5 to 1 kg per month is a reasonable goal for growing youth. Adolescents who have completed puberty should have a weight loss goal of approximately 0.5 to 1 kg per week, which is the same weight loss goal recommended for adults with T2DM. This goal is challenging and may be difficult to achieve for some adolescents.</p><p>The effects of weight loss surgery on glycemic control is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Surgical therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Dietary prescription</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although dietary prescriptions for patients with diabetes have traditionally used meal planning (ie, patient receives recommendations for the number of servings to consume from the different food groups), this approach is often difficult to follow long-term. In addition, meal planning can place too much focus on the child, while detracting from the importance of family changes in eating.</p><p>Dietary treatment for children with obesity, with or without T2DM, focuses on a gradual change of family and individual dietary habits to better achieve long-term goals [<a href="#rid12">12,16</a>]. The dietary counseling begins by determining the patient's and family's dietary preferences; patterns of physical activity, as well as sedentary behaviors ("screen time"); family time and financial constraints; cultural background; and educational level. Once sufficient data are obtained, the counselor can begin to give advice to move the patient toward a more healthful diet. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15848.html" rel="external">"Prevention and management of childhood obesity in the primary care setting"</a>.)</p><p>Patients are most likely to adhere to a diet that is adapted to their preferences and habits. Thus, dietary goals should include input from the child and family and be measurable and achievable. Important targets for counseling include  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef88490" href="/d/graphic/88490.html" rel="external">table 2</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decrease portion sizes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Substitute a fruit or vegetable for a carbohydrate-rich food. Use of glycemic index to guide food choices is an acceptable approach but has not been established to improve weight management or glycemic control [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decrease or eliminate high-caloric beverages (eg, sugar-containing soft drinks, juices) and replace them with water or calorie-free beverages.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reduce the frequency of eating out and increase family meals at home. In particular, youth who frequently consume fast food are more likely to have a higher caloric intake, leading to excess weight gain. Nutrition therapy should include guidance on the frequency and selection of food consumed away from home. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5361.html" rel="external">"Adolescent eating habits", section on 'Fast foods'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Because treatment often focuses on changing behaviors, frequent visits to the dietitian and/or practitioner may be needed for ongoing assessment and support. Counseling visits at least every four weeks allows the family to implement changes and maintain motivation and provides reinforcement. The addition of a mental health clinician to the care team is important to support healthy behavioral change strategies. Ideally, the mental health clinician should have knowledge of diabetes management and the particular psychosocial challenges associated with youth-onset T2DM [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Physical activity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Increased physical activity, independent of its effect on body weight, improves insulin sensitivity [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1777.html" rel="external">"Exercise guidance in adults with diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p>Youth with T2DM should be encouraged to engage in moderate to vigorous physical activity for at least one hour daily, with strength training at least three times weekly, and to decrease sedentary behaviors, eg, limiting nonacademic "screen time" (eg, television, video game, mobile device, and computer) to less than two hours daily [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. In some cases, it is appropriate to start with more modest goals and then gradually reduce the allowed screen time.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2675749072"><span class="h2">Other guidance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Screening for and counseling regarding high-risk behaviors, including smoking, vaping, and alcohol use, should be performed at diagnosis and regularly thereafter [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. While these behaviors can be harmful to any individual, those with T2DM are particularly vulnerable. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14583.html" rel="external">"Prevention of smoking and vaping initiation in children and adolescents"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6359.html" rel="external">"Management of smoking and vaping cessation in adolescents"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/107.html" rel="external">"Contraception: Issues specific to adolescents"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h1">PHARMACOLOGIC AGENTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12589" href="/d/drug information/12589.html" rel="external">Metformin</a> and insulin are the first-line therapies for treatment of T2DM in children and adolescents, as adjuncts to diet and exercise.

It is likely that there will be increasing use of these GLP-1 agonists before insulin initiation, given their potential benefits on weight as well as glycemic control. Further, a new study suggests benefits of a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, which led to FDA regulatory approval of one agent (see <a class="local">'Trials of SGLT2 inhibitors'</a> below). Consensus guidelines inform the initial and ongoing pharmacologic management of youth-onset T2DM [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2864929706"><span class="h2">Primary options</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Metformin</strong> – <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12589" href="/d/drug information/12589.html" rel="external">Metformin</a> is the first-line therapy for most patients, in conjunction with nonpharmacologic therapy (see <a class="local">'Metformin'</a> below). It is the only biguanide available in the United States. It improves insulin responsiveness by increasing insulin-mediated glucose uptake in the peripheral tissues and also by decreasing hepatic glucose production. Metformin has the additional benefit of producing modest weight loss; this is in contrast to the weight gain often associated with insulin, thiazolidinedione, or sulfonylurea therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1809.html" rel="external">"Metformin in the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Insulin</strong> – Insulin therapy is used initially for patients who present with ketosis or severe hyperglycemia, or for patients who have mixed features of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, as described below (see <a class="local">'Insulin'</a> below). Insulin therapy is helpful for these patients because they have inadequate insulin production (due to impaired beta cell function), in addition to insulin resistance. Guidelines recommend that insulin be used when random plasma glucose concentrations are ≥250 mg/dL or hemoglobin A1c (A1C) is &gt;9 percent (75 mmol/mol) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. A high proportion of individuals with T2DM ultimately require insulin therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1801.html" rel="external">"Insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>GLP-1 agonists</strong> – <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="121884" href="/d/drug information/121884.html" rel="external">Liraglutide</a>, extended-release <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="132373" href="/d/drug information/132373.html" rel="external">exenatide</a>, and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="140321" href="/d/drug information/140321.html" rel="external">dulaglutide</a> are approved in the United States for use in pediatric patients ≥10 years with T2DM, as an adjunct to diet and exercise management to achieve glycemic control [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. These drugs are incretin mimetics that act to increase glucose-dependent insulin secretion from beta cells and help to ensure an appropriate insulin response following ingestion of a meal. They may have the additional benefit of promoting modest weight loss, probably due to delayed gastric emptying and possibly through central effects on appetite. Studies in adults also show benefits on cardiovascular outcomes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1772.html" rel="external">"Glucagon-like peptide 1-based therapies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="121884" href="/d/drug information/121884.html" rel="external">Liraglutide</a> is administered by subcutaneous injection once daily.

These recommendations are based on a combination of expert opinion, observational studies, and the clinical trials of the drugs described above [<a href="#rid20">20,26,27</a>].

While clinical guidelines utilize failure to meet A1C targets as an indication to titrate therapy, in clinical practice, we also use a pattern of elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels as an indication to intensify therapy, generally using a target of FPG &lt;130 mg/dL (7.2 mmol/L). More stringent targets (A1C &lt;6.5 percent [47.5 mmol/mol] and FPG &lt;110 mg/dL [6.1 mmol/L]) may be appropriate in some patients, such as those with shorter duration of diabetes or those who achieve weight loss [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>].</p><p>If these goals seem unrealistic in the short term for an individual patient, it is reasonable initially to set a higher target (eg, A1C &lt;7.5 or 8 percent [&lt;58 or 64 mmol/mol]), then lower the target as tolerated by the patient. Use of realistic and attainable goals may help to engage the patient and promote adherence to medical and lifestyle therapies [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. It should be understood that these goals define an ideal target for glycemic control; higher thresholds are used to define treatment failure and for adding a second agent to the pharmacotherapeutic regimen. (See <a class="local">'Indications for dual or triple therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>A1C reflects long-term glycemic control and is typically measured every three months. Although traditionally reported as a percent, worldwide, A1C is increasingly reported as mmol/mol (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/15628.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>). Blood glucose can be monitored by the patient and family using capillary samples (fingersticks) and a glucose meter. Serial measurements of fasting, premeal, and interprandial blood glucose concentrations provide direct feedback on daily glycemic control that guides ongoing care.

Studies of CGM as a tool for glycemic control in youth-onset T2DM are limited [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. However, the ADA guidelines suggest CGM for adolescents who use insulin, based primarily on its utility in adults with insulin-treated T2DM [<a href="#rid14">14,40,41</a>]. We agree with this rationale and offer the technology when possible. Given that T2DM in adolescents is a more rapidly progressive disease than in adults, further studies utilizing CGM to improve outcomes in this population are needed.

In adults with T2DM, a major randomized trial (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study [UKPDS]) demonstrated that strict glycemic control (A1C ≤7 percent) reduced the risk of microvascular complications. Similar data are not available for youth with T2DM, but benefits of strict glycemic control can be inferred from these similar patient groups.

For patients with ketosis or ketoacidosis, insulin monotherapy should be used initially, and metformin should be added after the ketosis is cleared and blood glucose values have returned to normal or near-normal concentrations. (See <a class="local">'Insulin'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Monitoring</strong> – Body weight, body mass index (BMI), and A1C should be measured every three months. For the occasional more stable patient, this interval can be extended to four to six months. Blood glucose self-monitoring also should be performed fasting and two hours postprandial daily and more frequently when changing therapy or dosing or when glycemic control is poor. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intensification of therapy</strong> – Patients who do not meet or make progress toward attaining goals for glycemic control should be managed by optimizing nonpharmacologic therapy and intensification of pharmacotherapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients initially treated with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12589" href="/d/drug information/12589.html" rel="external">metformin</a> monotherapy (at maximal tolerated dosing) who do not achieve glycemic targets, either a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist (extended-release <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="132373" href="/d/drug information/132373.html" rel="external">exenatide</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="140321" href="/d/drug information/140321.html" rel="external">dulaglutide</a>, or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="121884" href="/d/drug information/121884.html" rel="external">liraglutide</a>) or basal insulin analog (glargine [U-100 or U-300], detemir, or degludec [U-100 or U-200]) may be added as a second therapeutic agent. The choice depends on patient and clinician preference. Insulin has the advantage of considerable clinical experience in adolescents and adults; it has the disadvantages of weight gain, need for frequent monitoring and dose adjustment, and risk of hypoglycemia. A GLP-1 agonist may promote weight loss and also offers ease of dose titration but may be more costly than insulin. For selected patients, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor is a reasonable alternative, especially for patients who strongly prefer an oral therapy.

Adjunctive therapy with a GLP-1 agonist or SGLT2 inhibitor improves glycemic control and is generally well tolerated, as shown in clinical trials in adolescents.
