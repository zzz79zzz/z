It occurs in people who have pollen allergy, although not all patients have obvious hay fever or seasonal allergy symptoms. Patients typically report itching and/or mild swelling of the mouth and throat immediately following ingestion of certain uncooked fruits (including nuts) or raw vegetables. The symptoms result from contact urticaria in the oropharynx caused by pollen-related proteins in these foods. Only a small proportion of affected individuals experience systemic allergic reactions, although the disorder must be differentiated from more serious forms of food allergy.</p><p>This topic reviews the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of OAS and describes associations between specific pollens and foods. The pathogenesis, management, and prognosis of OAS are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2403.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2407.html" rel="external">"Management and prognosis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h2">Terminology</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>At least two terms are used to describe this type of allergy:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1250202"><span class="h3">Oral allergy syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The term "oral allergy syndrome" (OAS) is widely recognized. However, it has been imprecisely applied in the literature to describe oropharyngeal reactions due to a variety of non-plant foods as well as both oropharyngeal and systemic symptoms due to plant foods in subjects with pollen allergy. This imprecision has led to considerable confusion. In this review, OAS is used to describe reactions caused by pollen-related foods that are <strong>limited to the oropharynx</strong>.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1250209"><span class="h3">Pollen-food allergy syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The terms "pollen-food allergy syndrome," "pollen-food syndrome," and "pollen-associated food allergy syndrome" (abbreviated PFAS or PFS) are increasingly used instead of OAS, both to emphasize the pathogenesis of these reactions and to describe the full range of oropharyngeal and systemic symptoms that can occur in response to pollen-related foods [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. In this review, PFS is the preferred term for the entire spectrum of reactions caused by pollen-related plant foods.</p><p>Non-plant foods, such as cow's milk, hen's egg, or seafood, do not cause PFS. Isolated oropharyngeal symptoms to foods that are not related to pollens may precede more severe systemic allergic reactions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2398.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview", section on 'IgE-mediated reactions'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prevalence of PFS in the United States has not been reported, although it is probably the most common food allergy in adult subjects, and there is a general impression that it has become more prevalent as respiratory allergy to pollen has increased over the past few decades [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Studies of prevalence include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In Central Europe, it has been estimated that approximately 5 percent of the general population suffers from PFS [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A study of 1272 Danish young adults (aged 22 years) used questionnaires, skin prick tests, and oral food challenges [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Overall, 17 percent reported symptoms to pollen-associated foods (83 percent with oral symptoms), which represented 74 percent of those reporting possible pollen allergy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A systematic review of 36 population-based studies on prevalence of plant food allergies, with data from a total of over 250,000 children and adults, showed significant heterogeneity between studies regardless of food item or age group [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Only six studies included food challenge tests, with prevalences ranging from 0.1 to 4.3 percent each for fruits and tree nuts, 0.1 to 1.4 percent for vegetables, and &lt;1 percent each for wheat, soy, and sesame.</p><p></p><p>PFS may first present in childhood, although the prevalence is difficult to estimate because data are based on selected allergy populations and not the general population. The following studies are examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>PFS to fruits and/or vegetables was reported in 93 percent of 72 children with severe rhinoconjunctivitis to birch pollen participating in a clinical trial of birch pollen immunotherapy [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>PFS was present in 24 percent of 1360 Italian children with pollen-induced allergic rhinitis and was associated with a longer duration of allergic rhinitis [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a cross-sectional study of children from a single Australian allergy center, PFS was reported in 4.9 percent overall, in 6.3 percent of children with allergic rhinitis, and in 12.1 percent in those with allergic rhinitis and demonstrable pollen sensitization [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A cross-sectional study of 267 Mexican children found an overall prevalence of 8.9 percent [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. In patients sensitized to pollen, the prevalence ranged from 9.6 to 12.2 percent, depending on the type of pollen; 62.5 percent of children with PFS were sensitive to pineapple [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In Japan, oral symptoms to Rosaceae fruits and/or soybean were reported by 1 to 3 percent of the 76,568 surveyed school-age children; these symptoms were associated with the geographic sensitization to alder pollen, supporting the underlying sensitization to Bet v 1 [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In South Korea, a multicenter, nationwide survey reported PFS in 41.7 percent of individuals with pollen allergy: 20 to 30 percent in individuals sensitized to a single-season pollen (only summer or only fall), and over 50 percent in those sensitized to all season pollens [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H970903170"><span class="h2">Natural history</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>PFS can develop in childhood or adulthood. Usually, patients develop allergic rhinitis to pollen first and then develop PFS following an increase in the severity of allergic rhinitis, although PFS might manifest in individuals with minimal allergic rhinitis symptoms. A small study found that the prevalence of PFS increased with age [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>Occasionally, PFS is the first manifestation with no or minimal allergic rhinitis symptoms reported by the patient. However, immunoglobulin E (IgE) sensitization to pollen is always detectable with skin or serologic testing. The mechanisms underlying these variations in clinical presentation are unknown. It is our clinical experience that, when PFS develops in a child, the number of foods that cause symptoms tends to increase over time. Some adults with pollinosis also progress to experiencing PFS to an increasing number of plant foods. In many patients, PFS tends to be a persistent condition that is lifelong, unless the patient undergoes immunotherapy for treatment of the underlying pollen allergy, and this is only successful in controlling symptoms of PFS in a subset of patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2407.html" rel="external">"Management and prognosis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)", section on 'Injection immunotherapy with pollen extracts'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">RISK FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is not known with certainty why some pollen-allergic patients develop PFS while others do not, although some risk factors have been identified:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sensitization to tree pollens (especially birch)</strong> – Sensitization to tree pollen, and specifically birch pollen, is associated with the highest rates of PFS. Allergy to grass pollen and weed pollen (commonly ragweed or mugwort) are less commonly associated with PFS. In a population of 936 unselected adults, for example, 24 percent were sensitized to pollen [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Pollen-sensitized individuals were evaluated for PFS with clinician-supervised oral food challenges. Symptoms to cross-reacting foods were recorded in 24, 10, and 4 percent of subjects sensitized to birch, mugwort, and grass, respectively.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Higher levels of pollen-specific IgE</strong> – There is evidence that the higher the specific pollen IgE antibody levels, the greater the likelihood of PFS [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. However, among patients with comparable serum levels of pollen-specific IgE antibodies, some patients react to one plant food, while others react to multiple foods. It is possible, although not proven, that both the affinity of the IgE antibodies as well as the recognition of the specific epitopes on pollen allergens affect the clinical expression of PFS.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sensitization to multiple pollens</strong> – Individuals sensitized to multiple pollens are most likely to be affected by PFS.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In the study described previously, 52 percent of people allergic to three pollens reacted to related foods [<a href="#rid15">15,18</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In an Italian study of children with allergy to grass pollen (mean age of eight years), PFS was reported in 20 percent of those allergic to grass alone and up to 46 percent of those sensitized to both grass and birch [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Having symptomatic pollinosis (nasal, ocular, or respiratory symptoms of pollen allergy)</strong> – Patients with nasal, ocular, and respiratory symptoms of pollen allergy (pollinosis) are at greater risk for PFS compared with patients who are sensitized to pollen but have no symptoms. In one large study of pollen-sensitized patients, the odds ratio of a clinical reaction to pollen-related fruits and vegetables was four times higher among those with symptoms of pollinosis [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Patients with pollen allergy can often be identified based on the history of suggestive symptoms during a known pollen season  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74234" href="/d/graphic/74234.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Another study showed that adult birch-allergic patients with PFS were more likely to have a longer duration of birch tree pollen allergy and asthma compared with birch-allergic patients without PFS [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Pollinosis usually precedes the development of PFS by a number of years in adults and children [<a href="#rid9">9,14</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Living in areas where certain pollens are prevalent</strong> – Associations between pollen and plant foods are strongly affected by geographic location and indigenous flora. PFS is more prevalent in areas where birch trees are common, and the population demonstrates high levels of pollen-specific IgE (particularly to birch) [<a href="#rid18">18,20,21</a>]. Birch trees and birch pollinosis are common in Central and Northern Europe and Northern Japan [<a href="#rid16">16,22,23</a>]. In Japan, Japanese cedar and plane tree pollens are associated with PFS.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Sensitization to birch pollen is very common in the United States, although birch trees are not particularly prevalent. This finding most likely reflects extensive homology among trees of the Fagales order, such as birch, oak, alder, hazel, chestnut, and hornbeam [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>]. In Mexico, trees from the <em>Quercus </em>species showed an association with PFS in children. In Japan, Japanese cedar pollinosis is associated with PFS to tomato [<a href="#rid11">11,26</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In most patients, symptoms are limited to the oropharynx. However, 2 to 10 percent may experience systemic symptoms, and patients with concomitant atopic dermatitis may notice a worsening of their cutaneous symptoms.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2434563946"><span class="h2">Oropharyngeal symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common signs and symptoms are pruritus, tingling, mild erythema, and subtle angioedema of the lips, oral mucosa, palate, and throat, sometimes accompanied by a sensation of throat swelling. Symptoms occur while or shortly after (within 5 to 10 minutes of) ingesting the culprit fruit, nut, or vegetable. Oral papules or blisters are occasionally reported, although blisters or vesicles in isolation are not typical. Isolated oropharyngeal symptoms are reported by 75 to 95 percent of subjects with PFS [<a href="#rid27">27-30</a>].</p><p>Symptoms usually resolve within minutes when the food is swallowed due to disruption of the structure of the allergen by gastric acid and proteolytic digestive enzymes.</p><p>Particularly with fruits (eg, apple), patients may report that one variety of the food is more troublesome than another or that the symptoms do not develop after every exposure. Some patients may also notice that they can eat apples picked fresh from the tree, but, once the fruit has been stored for several days, it seems to cause more symptoms. This may be due to an increase in the proteins in the fruit that cause PFS, many of which are involved in the responses to stress and which increase as a result of picking and storage [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22906921"><span class="h3">Seasonal pollen allergies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most patients have clinical symptoms of allergy (rhinitis, conjunctivitis, asthma) in response to pollen. Other patients may be sensitized to pollen but do not have clinical symptoms of seasonal allergy. These individuals can only be identified by objective testing for pollen IgE sensitization. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2407.html" rel="external">"Management and prognosis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22907059"><span class="h3">Seasonal variation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>PFS is an IgE-mediated reaction, and symptoms may increase during or following the pollen season because of seasonal boosting of pollen IgE levels.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8377411"><span class="h3">Impact of cooking</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In most cases, symptoms only develop in response to eating the raw, uncooked food. Some patients react predominantly to the peel of the raw fruit or vegetable and tolerate pulp [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Patients usually tolerate the culprit food in various cooked forms. Cooking, baking, or even briefly microwaving raw fruits and vegetables is usually sufficient to alter the allergens that are responsible for PFS. Tree nuts and peanuts are an important exception to this generalization, as roasted nuts can cause PFS. Implications for management are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2407.html" rel="external">"Management and prognosis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)"</a>.)</p><p>Double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFC) with roasted hazelnuts (140°C [284°F], 40 minutes) were performed in 17 birch pollen-allergic patients with DBPCFC-confirmed food allergy to raw hazelnuts. Challenge with roasted nuts was positive in 5 of 17 patients. The symptoms were generally mild and included PFS in all patients [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. The allergens that cause PFS are reviewed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2403.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Systemic reactions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Fewer than 10 percent of patients with allergies to fresh fruits and vegetables experience systemic symptoms. A few patients complain of nausea and abdominal discomfort, which may represent local esophageal and gastric symptoms that develop before the allergen is fully degraded. Some birch-allergic individuals develop analogous contact urticaria on their hands after handling raw potato. These two presentations are better classified as local reactions because the involved tissues are directly contacting the undigested food. Ingestion of large quantities of the raw plant foods tends to be associated with more severe symptoms.</p><p>True systemic reactions involve tissues that do not come into direct contact with undigested food. Symptoms may include the entire range of IgE-mediated allergic manifestations, such as urticaria, angioedema, nasal congestion, sneezing, flushing, wheezing, cough, diarrhea, and hypotension.</p><p>In a review of several studies of patients with PFS, which included a total of 1361 subjects, the following was reported [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>9 percent experienced associated symptoms outside of the gastrointestinal tract</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>3 percent at some time experienced systemic symptoms without oral symptoms</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>1.7 percent experienced anaphylactic shock</p><p></p><p>Patients who react to plant foods but do not report allergic rhinitis in response to pollens are at higher risk for systemic reactions, because these patients may not be sensitized to pollen and may have an independent food allergy rather than PFS. Such patients may be sensitized to more stable allergens, such as nonspecific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs). In one study, 82 percent of patients with birch-related fruit allergy without allergic rhinitis had systemic symptoms, while only 45 percent of those with both fruit allergy and allergic rhinitis had systemic symptoms [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. Anaphylactic shock occurred in 36 percent of those without allergic rhinitis versus 9 percent of those with allergic rhinitis. The high rate of systemic reactions in the subjects with allergic rhinitis in this preselected population was unusual and probably not representative of a general population of patients with PFS. A report of patients with severe hazelnut allergy without concomitant pollinosis documented IgE binding to heat-stable hazelnut proteins [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. In contrast, the sera from patients with PFS to hazelnut and pollinosis did not bind to these heat-stable proteins.</p><p>Other factors that may predispose patients with PFS to systemic reactions include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ingestion of large amounts of the raw plant food on an empty stomach.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increasing the pH of the stomach with medications, such as proton pump inhibitors, as this may impair digestion and destruction of the allergen. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2407.html" rel="external">"Management and prognosis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)", section on 'Antiulcer therapies'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The presence of "cofactors," such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or exercise, presumably due to a transient increase in gastric or intestinal permeability [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p></p><p>Certain foods have been associated with higher rates of systemic reactions, including peanuts, tree nuts, peach, and mustard.

In a cohort of 252 adults from Spain (Malaga and Barcelona), 93.2 percent had LTP syndrome (reactions to peach and at least another plant food with LTP), whereas 6.8 percent were LTP monoallergic.

Both skin testing and in vitro testing in the diagnosis of PFS are complicated by the variable and unstable nature of the responsible allergens and the extensive crossreactivity among them.

It may not be necessary to prove pollen sensitization if the patient's culprit food and seasonal symptoms match (ie, reactions to apple in a patient with rhinitis during tree pollen season) and if past reactions were consistently mild and limited to the oropharynx.</p><p>However, pollen sensitization should be confirmed by testing if either of the following is true:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>It is unclear from the history that the patient has pollen allergy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The patient has experienced systemic symptoms because patients without pollen sensitization may have an isolated allergy to a plant food (unrelated to pollen) and be at higher risk for systemic reactions.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26941167"><span class="h2">Oral food challenges</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with PFS will frequently have positive skin or in vitro tests to several related foods within a plant family. However, as in other forms of IgE-mediated food allergy, positive tests do not necessarily predict clinical symptoms upon ingestion. Thus, oral food challenge remains the only definitive method of identifying clinical reactions.</p><p>Although oral food challenges are the most conclusive means of confirming food allergy, challenges in PFS may be impacted by some of the same issues that affect skin testing. Allergen levels can vary among cultivars, within different parts of the fruit (peel versus flesh), with ripeness, or due to changes induced by storage [<a href="#rid81">81</a>]. Challenge studies suggest that a history of clinical reactivity can be confirmed by oral food challenges in only one-third of melon-allergic patients, in two-thirds of patients allergic to fruits from the Rosaceae family (peach, plum, pear, apple, almond, apricot, and strawberry), and in approximately 80 percent of patients allergic to fruits from the Prunoideae family (peach, apricot, plum, and cherry) [<a href="#rid64">64,67,82</a>].</p><p>The importance of obtaining a definitive diagnosis depends on the severity of the reaction, nutritional needs, food preferences, and social issues. In many cases, diet is empirically limited based on the clinical history and the results of skin prick testing, rather than formal food challenges. However, food challenge may be indicated in certain situations:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients with past systemic reactions to mixed foods, when the culprit food could not be unequivocally identified through skin or in vitro testing. In this case, the challenge would be performed in order to ascertain that the responsible food had been correctly identified.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients reporting symptoms to a specific food, in whom testing failed to demonstrate sensitization to that food. Challenge would be done in this situation because testing may have been falsely negative due to allergen variability.

An open challenge with the food in its natural form should always follow a negative-blinded challenge. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2396.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic evaluation of IgE-mediated food allergy"</a>.)</p><p>Special care is needed in preparing food for blinded challenges to confirm PFS because freeze drying, heating, and other processing methods can destroy the fragile allergens, leading to false-negative results [<a href="#rid67">67</a>]. Standardized protocols for challenges to raw fruits and vegetables are not available, although research protocols for double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFC) to fresh apple, peach, celery, carrot, and melon have been published [<a href="#rid44">44,64,67,83-86</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H623528072"><span class="h2">Endoscopic challenge</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The colonoscopic allergen provocation (COLAP) test has been evaluated in adult patients with gastrointestinal symptoms in response to foods, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. This form of testing induces wheal-and-flare reactions in the cecal mucosa within 20 minutes of the endoscopic challenge with recombinant Bet v 1 (rBet v 1) [<a href="#rid87">87</a>]. A wheal-and-flare reaction in COLAP was observed in 13 of 16 patients (81 percent) with a positive history of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with Bet v 1-related food ingestion compared with 4 of 18 patients (22 percent) with pollinosis and negative history of adverse food reactions. Nonallergic control subjects had no wheal-and-flare response in the cecal mucosa. The mucosal reaction to rBet v 1 was correlated with tissue eosinophil activation on biopsy, presence of pollinosis, and history of adverse reaction to Bet v 1-associated food allergens. The mucosal challenge with rBet v 1 may be a diagnostic tool that could facilitate the diagnosis of Bet v 1-associated allergy manifesting with gastrointestinal symptoms.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26941174"><span class="h1">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Other conditions that can mimic PFS include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An isolated food allergy (ie, primary food allergy) – Most of the foods that cause PFS can also cause food allergy without pollen sensitization.

Reactions are immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated and caused by allergens in plant foods that are homologous to pollen allergens. PFS is a more general term that encompasses both oropharyngeal and systemic reactions due to these allergens. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>The most common form of food allergy</strong> – PFS is believed to be the most common type of food allergy in adults and likely affects at least 5 percent of the population. It is also seen in children, although the prevalence is not known. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk factors</strong> – Patients sensitized to tree pollen, and specifically birch pollen, have the highest rates of PFS. Individuals with nasal, ocular, and respiratory symptoms in response to pollen are at greater risk for PFS than pollen-sensitized subjects without clinical pollen allergy. (See <a class="local">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Signs and symptoms</strong> – PFS usually presents with pruritus and swelling of the mouth and throat during or just after ingestion of fresh, uncooked fruits and vegetables. Oropharyngeal symptoms usually resolve promptly when food is swallowed, and cooked forms of the culprit foods are generally tolerated because the responsible allergens are susceptible to gastric acid, digestive enzymes, and heat. (See <a class="local">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2403.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Systemic symptoms are unusual</strong> – Although uncommon, systemic symptoms and reactions to cooked foods are both possible in PFS. Fewer than 10 percent of patients with PFS experience systemic symptoms, although they may be severe. Peanuts, tree nuts, peaches, and mustard are associated with more systemic reactions than other foods. (See <a class="local">'Systemic reactions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Relationships between specific pollens and foods</strong> – Homology among protein allergens results in patterns of associations among fruits, vegetables, nuts, and pollens  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60787" href="/d/graphic/60787.html" rel="external">figure 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79411" href="/d/graphic/79411.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). A similar phenomenon affects up to one-half of latex-allergic individuals and is called the latex-fruit syndrome  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60713" href="/d/graphic/60713.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). (See <a class="local">'Pollen-food associations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – The diagnosis of PFS requires suggestive symptoms in a patient who has evidence of specific IgE to the food in question accompanied by a clinical history of pollinosis or demonstrated sensitization to a pollen related to the culprit food. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – Evaluation of patients suspected of having PFS involves history, physical examination, objective testing for specific IgE (sIgE) to food and/or pollen, and possible oral food challenge. Extensive evaluation may not be necessary if symptoms are mild and limited to the oropharynx. In contrast, any patient with systemic symptoms requires a thorough evaluation. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Testing to confirm pollen sensitization</strong> – Confirmation of pollen sensitization either by skin testing (most accurate) or by IgE immunoassays is necessary if it is unclear if the patient has pollen allergy or if there were any systemic symptoms. Patients without pollen sensitization may have an isolated allergy to a plant food and therefore be at higher risk for systemic reactions. (See <a class="local">'Objective testing for pollen sensitization'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Indications for oral food challenge</strong> – Oral food challenge remains the only definitive diagnostic maneuver in some cases. In addition, challenge may be helpful for patients with past systemic symptoms who do not know if they tolerate cooked versions of the food or other closely related foods.
