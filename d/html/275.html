The universal emergency airway management algorithm provides the recommended approach to emergency intubation  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef76711" href="/d/graphic/76711.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef63518" href="/d/graphic/63518.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. This approach is based on several key assessments of the patient prior to intubation.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cardiac arrest airway?</strong> – The first assessment is to determine if the patient has a "cardiac arrest" airway (ie, presenting in cardiac arrest, agonal or absent respirations with absent or near absent circulation, or when chest compressions have begun). If so, the cardiac arrest airway algorithm is used  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef140481" href="/d/graphic/140481.html" rel="external">algorithm 3</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anatomic difficulty?</strong> – If the patient does not have a cardiac arrest airway, the next step is to determine if the patient represents an anatomically difficult airway. This requires assessment of specific patient attributes to predict the likelihood of difficulty in performing any of the major procedures in airway management: direct laryngoscopy and intubation, bag-mask ventilation (BMV), surgical airway management, and ventilation using an extraglottic airway. (See <a class="local">'Identifying the anatomically difficult airway'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>High-risk physiology?</strong> – A critically ill patient can be at higher risk of apnea intolerance, hemodynamic instability, or cardiovascular collapse with rapid sequence intubation (RSI), positive pressure ventilation, or both; some authors call this the "physiologically difficult airway" which independently increases patient morbidity and mortality following emergency airway management [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. Such physiologic derangements include refractory hypoxemia, hypotension, shock, severe metabolic acidosis, severe lung disease, and right ventricular failure. Administration of induction medications and neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) make the apneic phase of RSI intolerable to a patient with hypoxemia or severe metabolic acidosis and creates a risk for circulatory collapse in a patient with hypotension. (See <a class="local">'High-risk physiology present'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>RSI is the recommended method for managing the airway in a patient with spontaneous circulation who is felt to not have an anatomically difficult airway and does not have high-risk physiological derangements. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/270.html" rel="external">"Rapid sequence intubation in adults for emergency medicine and critical care"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">INCIDENCE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Incidence of difficult intubation and first-attempt success</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The precise incidence of difficult intubation in the emergency department (ED) is unknown. A difficult ED intubation can be defined as one that requires multiple attempts, multiple operators, multiple devices, excessive lifting force, external laryngeal manipulation, or performance with an inadequate glottic view. However, there are various ways of defining what constitutes a "difficult airway" or "difficult intubation." Conclusively determining that an intubation was difficult can only happen after the procedure is completed. How predictive the bedside assessment is for actual intubation difficulty varies based on these definitions. </p><p>The third phase of the multicenter National Emergency Airway Registry (NEAR III) project analyzed over 17,500 ED intubations and found that, in approximately 3 percent of cases, the airway was ultimately secured by a means other than the first method chosen [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Approximately 0.5 percent of cases required a surgical airway, with 75 percent of these performed as a rescue after failure of another method. Using these data and incorporating the success rate on first pass, use of a tracheal tube introducer ("bougie") or flexible intubating scopes (ie, fiberoptics) and cricothyrotomy rate, one would estimate the incidence of a difficult-to-manage airway in the ED to be approximately 10 to 15 percent. The incidence of intubation requiring more than two attempts or oxygen saturation falling below 93 percent (regardless of the numbers of attempts), is estimated to be in the 3 to 5 percent range. Overall failure, meaning that no airway was secured, was reported rarely, and data regarding whether hypoxic injury or other severe airway-related injury occurred were incomplete. In a single-center study, the incidence of anticipated airway difficulty based on bedside assessment and clinician gestalt was much higher, with nearly 50 percent of ED intubations falling into that category, although assessments varied by clinician expertise and experience [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. A retrospective study of emergency intubations performed by anesthesiologists outside the operating room reported that 351 of 3423 intubations (10.3 percent) were difficult (Cormack-Lehane grade 3 or 4)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef141367" href="/d/graphic/141367.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>Analysis of the NEAR data found that PGY-3 and PGY-4 residents in emergency medicine perform most intubations at academic hospitals, with first-attempt success rates of 80 percent when using the GlideScope video laryngoscope (VL), 83 percent for direct laryngoscopy (DL), and 90 percent with the C-MAC VL [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Fewer than 2 percent of intubations required more than three attempts. Ninety-seven percent of intubations by residents beyond the level of intern were successfully performed by the first operator. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/269.html" rel="external">"Devices for difficult airway management in adults for emergency medicine and critical care"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3351126105"><span class="h3">Effect of increasing video laryngoscopy use</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The increasing use of VL and other advanced airway tools is changing traditional concepts of airway difficulty. Historically, intubation difficulty has been defined based on the relative ease or difficulty of obtaining an adequate view of the glottis using a DL. The Cormack-Lehane scale is the standard gauge for such airway difficulty  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef141367" href="/d/graphic/141367.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. In the NEAR III study, VL use increased from less than 2 percent in 2002 to 2004 to almost 30 percent after 2008 [<a href="#rid7">7</a>], and NEAR data from 2016 through 2018 show that VL are now used as the first device in nearly two-thirds of all ED intubations [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Many of the anatomic challenges that confront clinicians using conventional laryngoscopes are mitigated or eliminated with video-enhanced devices. </p><p>When intubation by laryngoscopy is the selected method for emergency airway management, a VL should be used, whenever possible, for the first intubation attempt, especially if a difficult airway is anticipated. In a sub-group analysis of a 2022 meta-analysis (42 trials, 4100 patients), in patients with predicted, known, or simulated difficult airways, VL reduced the rate of failed intubation as compared with DL (4.5 versus 10.2 percent, relative risk [RR] 0.32, 95% CI 0.23-0.44) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Analysis of the NEAR VII dataset, comprising more than 11,000 adult intubations performed during 2016 and 2017, found VL to be superior to DL [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Multivariable regression analysis, controlling for confounders of first-attempt success, found that intubators were two to three times more likely to achieve first-attempt success using a VL compared with DL that was “optimized” by laryngeal manipulation, ramped patient positioning, tracheal tube introducer (ie, bougie) use, or any combination of the three.</p><p>Conventional laryngoscopes are still favored by some clinicians, and challenging DL can be improved by laryngeal manipulation, proper patient positioning, and a tracheal tube introducer. However, emergency medicine clinical studies heavily favor the use of VL, and we recommend clinicians become proficient with VL and use it whenever possible. DL continues to play an important role in hospitals without access to video equipment and in rare clinical situations (eg, a massively hemorrhaging upper airway without access to large-bore suction). For such settings, DL remains an important alternative to VL. Of note, MacIntosh blade type VLs can be used either as a VL or as a DL, so are well suited to training, skill retention, and rescue use when the video camera becomes occluded by extensive upper airway soiling.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Incidence of difficult bag-mask ventilation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Difficult bag-mask ventilation (BMV) has been studied extensively in the operating room but is challenging to assess in other settings [<a href="#rid10">10-16</a>]. Overall, although definitions vary among studies, the incidence of difficult BMV is universally low, and true failed BMV is rare.</p><p>Researchers in one prospective, observational study of 1502 operating room patients defined difficult BMV as the inability of a single clinician to maintain oxygen saturation above 92 percent or provide adequate ventilation. They found BMV to be difficult in about 5 percent of patients and impossible in only a single patient [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Subsequent, larger studies found difficult BMV to occur in approximately 3 percent of patients, with the lower incidence possibly due to exclusion of some patients who would have been difficult to ventilate [<a href="#rid11">11,17,18</a>]. In a cluster randomized trial of pre-assessment for difficult BMV involving 94,006 patients in 26 Danish anesthesia departments, researchers reported an incidence of unpredicted difficult BMV below 1 percent in both the intervention group, in which potential BMV difficulty was assessed using 11 explicit criteria (0.91 percent); and the control group, in which assessment was left to the anesthesiologist's discretion (0.88 percent) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>Among the selected patients studied in the operating room, the combined inability to intubate and inability to perform BMV occurs in only 1 in 5000 to 1 in 10,000 patients [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. This likely represents a reasonable estimate of the incidence of unexpected difficulty in the ED (ie, patients without identifiable characteristics associated with difficulty but for whom intubation and BMV are difficult). This observation underscores the safety of an approach to airway management that includes a preintubation assessment for difficult intubation and difficult BMV. In the absence of markers of difficult intubation or difficult BMV, the clinician will rarely encounter a patient who is both impossible to intubate and impossible to ventilate with a bag-mask. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/267.html" rel="external">"Basic airway management in adults", section on 'Bag-mask ventilation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Incidence of difficult cricothyrotomy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The incidence of difficult surgical cricothyrotomy in the ED, where the procedure is most often performed, or in the operating room is not known. Cricothyrotomy is not a technically difficult procedure in most patients, but infrequency of performance, time pressure during the procedure, lack of regular training, and the anxiety accompanying airway failure undoubtedly contribute to any difficulty encountered.</p><p>Several case series of emergency surgical cricothyrotomies have reported success rates approaching 100 percent with complication rates of 5 to 14 percent. Difficulty related to the procedure, including cases requiring excessive time to secure the airway, is not properly captured in these retrospective series [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/263.html" rel="external">"Emergency cricothyrotomy (cricothyroidotomy) in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Incidence of difficult extraglottic airways</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Extraglottic airways are most often used as rescue devices in the ED. These include the supraglottic airways (ie, laryngeal mask airways) designed to sit just above the glottis; and the retroglottic airways, designed to be inserted into the esophagus, and which provide proximal (oropharyngeal) and distal (esophageal) seals to permit "side-stream" ventilation (eg, Combitube, King LT Airway, EasyTube, and others).</p><p>The incidence of difficult insertion is not known for most of these devices. Disposable and reusable laryngeal mask airway devices have been shown to permit effective ventilation in 92 and 97 percent, respectively, of anesthetized patients [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Emergency medical technicians (EMTs) have used the Combitube in the prehospital setting, obtaining ventilation rates ranging from 79 to 95 percent [<a href="#rid23">23-25</a>]. One retrospective review of 162 patients managed by EMTs reported a success rate of only 70 percent with a 27 percent complication rate using the Combitube [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. In a single-center registry of 14,480 elective operating room cases managed with either an iGel or LMA, the rate of initial difficult ventilation was 0.5 percent; however, 60 percent were corrected with either repositioning or re-insertion. Overall, successful placement and ventilation occurred in 99.8 percent of all cases [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p>Success rates for extraglottic airways used in the ED are unknown. Analysis of data from the NEAR registry showed that extraglottic airways were seldom used as rescue devices and never as a primary airway in 7712 ED patients [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Patients with disrupted upper airway anatomy are poor candidates for a supraglottic or extraglottic airway device, as both rely on creating a seal between an inflatable cuff and the patient's mucosa.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">IDENTIFYING THE ANATOMICALLY DIFFICULT AIRWAY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Failure to identify, in advance, characteristics associated with difficult intubation or ventilation is one of the leading causes of failed airways in the operating room [<a href="#rid29">29,30</a>]. This concept likely extends to emergency airway management outside the operating room. Difficult airway assessment requires determination of the potential for difficulty with bag-mask ventilation (BMV), laryngoscopy and intubation, cricothyrotomy, and extraglottic airway insertion.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">The LEMON assessment for difficult intubation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The LEMON assessment uses a series of physical evaluations to determine whether difficult laryngoscopy and intubation is anticipated. The assessment was developed for DL and is most applicable to that technique, but we recommend its use when VL is planned as well because it identifies features that make laryngoscopy, whether direct or video, more difficult than when those features are not present (see <a class="local">'Difficult video laryngoscopy'</a> below). Each step is described:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">L: Look externally</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>This refers to the clinician's general impression that the airway will be difficult. Does the patient have abnormal facies or body habitus, unusual anatomy, or facial trauma [<a href="#rid31">31-33</a>], any of which can be expected to create difficulty? A general impression of airway difficulty is reasonably specific but not particularly sensitive. If an operator observes the patient and anticipates difficulty, that assessment likely is correct. Conversely, absence of obvious external markers of airway difficulty does not ensure success.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">E: Evaluate (3-3-2 rule)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The size of the mandible, the distance between the mentum and the hyoid bone, and the extent of mouth opening are all important geometric determinants of the success of DL [<a href="#rid34">34,35</a>]. These relationships are represented by the 3-3-2 rule  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60507" href="/d/graphic/60507.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) [<a href="#rid36">36,37</a>]. The rule describes three measurements found in normal patients (ie, patients in whom difficult laryngoscopy is <strong>not</strong> expected).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>3: This assessment indicates the ease of access to the airway. A normal patient can open their mouth sufficiently to permit three of their own fingers to be placed between the incisors. Adequate mouth opening facilitates both insertion of the laryngoscope and obtaining a direct view of the glottis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>3: This assessment provides an estimate of the volume of the submandibular space. A normal patient is able to place three of their fingers along the floor of the mandible between the mentum and the neck/mandible junction (near the hyoid bone).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>2: This assessment identifies the location of the larynx relative to the base of the tongue. A normal patient is able to place two fingers in the superior laryngeal notch (ie, the space between the superior notch of the thyroid cartilage and the neck/mandible junction, near the hyoid bone). If the larynx is too high in the neck, DL is difficult or impossible because of the angles that have to be negotiated to permit visualization.</p><p></p><p>Variations in patient size are accommodated by using the patient's fingers as the standard for measurement. Since the emergency department (ED) patient is often uncooperative or unable to perform the required steps, size is estimated by comparing the examiner's fingers with the patient's. The examiner's fingers are then used to estimate the proportions involved. Failure to achieve these three dimensions predicts difficulty visualizing the glottis during DL.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h3">M: Mallampati score</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Mallampati classification is a simple scoring system to help predict difficult intubation  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75229" href="/d/graphic/75229.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid38">38,39</a>]. It has been prospectively validated in several studies, although not as a solitary (ie, sufficient) predictor of difficult intubation [<a href="#rid40">40,41</a>]. The Mallampati score is best used as one part of a global airway assessment [<a href="#rid42">42,43</a>].</p><p>The Mallampati class, ranging from I to IV, relates the amount of mouth opening to the size of the tongue and provides an estimate of space for oral intubation by DL. In general, Mallampati class I or II predicts easy laryngoscopy, class III predicts difficulty, and class IV predicts extreme difficulty.</p><p>Many ED patients are unable to cooperate with a Mallampati assessment. In such cases, the examiner should gently open the mouth, if possible, and use a DL blade in the manner of a conventional tongue blade to assess the size of the tongue compared with that of the oropharynx.

Not all markers of difficulty are applicable to ED patients, and many are too complex or require evaluation (eg, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) that is not feasible in the emergency situation. The LEMON mnemonic described above  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64336" href="/d/graphic/64336.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) was developed by researchers in emergency airway management [<a href="#rid36">36,37</a>]. A prospective observational study of 156 patients undergoing intubation in the ED found that the LEMON evaluation accurately stratified patients according to the risk of difficult intubation [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. A subsequent large registry study performed in Japanese EDs evaluated the benefit of a "modified" LEMON assessment (ie, LEMON without Mallampati classification or measurement of thyromental distance) and discovered its most impactful feature was its ability to rule out difficulty [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. They found that when patients were completely LEMON negative, difficulty was rarely encountered (negative predictive value of 98 percent).

In a systematic review of 27 studies involving over 18,000 patients, the ULBT showed high specificity and high negative predictive value [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. The ULBT is performed by having the patient extend their jaw and cover the upper lip with their lower incisors.

Redundant upper airway tissue and the combination of chest wall weight and resistance from abdominal contents all impede airflow. Late third trimester pregnancy is a surrogate for obesity with respect to BMV as it creates many of the same problems.

If a flexible intubating scope is unavailable, then ATI should be performed with VL but will likely require a deeper degree of sedation compared with ATI with a flexible intubating scope.

The goal with the difficult airway, as with any emergency intubation, is to place a cuffed endotracheal tube in the trachea. Various devices can be used to accomplish this end.</p><p>An intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63844" href="/d/graphic/63844.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) may be placed, then an endotracheal tube passed through it. A common approach is to load an endotracheal tube over top of a flexible intubating scope (ie, fiberoptic device). The flexible scope is navigated into the airway using the ILMA device as a conduit to the laryngeal inlet, with the scope acting as an intubation guide over which the endotracheal tube can be advanced into place. A VL will likely achieve a glottic view superior to that of a standard laryngoscope, enabling intubation. A fiberoptic or video intubating stylet may also be used.
