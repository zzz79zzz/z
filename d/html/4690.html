However, compared with six cycles of ABVD, with Stanford V the total dose of doxorubicin is only 50 percent and the bleomycin dose is only 25 percent.

Compared to ABVD, progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer for BEACOPP (HR 0.53; 95% CI 0.44-0.64), but there was no difference detected for OS. BEACOPP was associated with more hematologic toxicities (eg, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) and infections, and with more myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML); there was no difference in secondary malignancies, treatment-related mortality, or infertility.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">A subsequent systematic analysis of the same four trials added a trial of BEACOPP versus ABVD in advanced stage cHL (stages III/IV) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. This analysis did detect a difference in OS (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.57-0.97) as well as PFS, but the survival difference is attributable to superior outcomes in patients with advanced disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>As examples of trials of unfavorable prognosis early stage cHL, the German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) and EORTC randomly assigned patients to RT plus BEACOPP versus RT plus ABVD. In both GHSG HD11 and EORTC H9U, there was no difference in OS or freedom from progression [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. However, compared with ABVD, overall grade 3/4 toxicity was greater with BEACOPP (74 versus 52 percent, respectively), most notably in regard to leukopenia (38 versus 25 percent, respectively), alopecia (58 versus 31 percent, respectively), and anemia (7 versus 1 percent, respectively) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>GHSG HD14 randomly assigned patients to CMT using hybrid chemotherapy (two cycles of escalated BEACOPP followed by two cycles of ABVD) versus CMT with four cycles of ABVD [<a href="#rid3">3,13</a>].

Patients are treated with a total of four cycles of ABVD if a complete response (CR) is achieved after cycle 2, if RT is incorporated in therapy; for other patients, the course of treatment is informed by results from PET/CT  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114572" href="/z/d/graphic/114572.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>GHSG HD11 reported that four cycles of ABVD was adequate chemotherapy when combined with RT (30 Gy), and resulted in five-year freedom from treatment failure (85 percent), OS (94 percent), and PFS (87 percent) in unfavorable prognosis early stage cHL [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The EORTC H9U trial included patients with unfavorable prognosis early stage cHL who were randomly assigned to 30 Gy involved-field RT (IFRT) plus either six cycles of ABVD or four cycles of ABVD; five-year event-free survival and OS were similar in all arms, suggesting that four cycles of ABVD is sufficient in this setting [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1350140418"><span class="h2">Radiation therapy (RT)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>RT alone is not adequate treatment for unfavorable prognosis early stage cHL.

With ISRT, the radiation field is reduced based on disease regression after chemotherapy in order to limit radiation to uninvolved normal organs. Intensity modulated RT, breath-hold techniques, and proton therapy can be used to further limit damage to normal tissues in select cases.</p><p>Compared with older techniques, contemporary approaches reduce acute and long-term toxicities while maintaining PFS rates [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Various definitions of RT techniques have been applied  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78652" href="/z/d/graphic/78652.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). We agree with the guidelines for modern RT in cHL published by the International Lymphoma Radiation Oncology Group (ILROG) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>Radiation fields are discussed in more detail separately.

This recommendation is consistent with the guidelines published by the International Lymphoma Radiation Oncology Group [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>The GHSG HD11 trial showed that treatment with four cycles of ABVD followed by 20 Gy yielded inferior PFS and freedom from treatment failure compared with four cycles of ABVD followed by 30 Gy IFRT (or by BEACOPP followed by either 20 Gy or 30 Gy IFRT) [<a href="#rid11">11,16</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1503237169"><span class="h3">Adverse effects</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common acute adverse events from RT include cutaneous and/or mucosal irritation and cytopenias. Long-term effects of RT include sclerosis/fibrosis, cytopenias, cardiopulmonary toxicity, and second malignancies. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/89528.html" rel="external">"Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment", section on 'Radiation side effects'</a>.)</p><p>Contemporary RT techniques (eg, ISRT) utilize lower doses and smaller field sizes than those used in the past and are associated with less toxicity without compromised efficacy. Most data regarding long-term effects of RT reflect doses and fields that were used in the past. The increase of second cancers in patients with cHL that may be attributable to treatment has been estimated at 0.4 to 0.7 percent per year [<a href="#rid17">17-23</a>].</p><p>The risks of second malignancies and other potential complications of RT are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4764.html" rel="external">"Second malignancies after treatment of classic Hodgkin lymphoma"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14232.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult survivor of classic Hodgkin lymphoma", section on 'Late complications'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3760307141"><span class="h3">Patients at higher risk with RT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The short-term and/or long-term risks of RT may be judged to be excessive for certain patients. As an example, in a young woman with non-bulky bilateral axillary and mediastinal disease with early complete response to chemotherapy, it is generally preferable to treat with chemotherapy alone and accept a slightly higher risk of recurrence in exchange for a reduced long-term risk of breast cancer. (See <a class="local">'Patients at higher risk with RT'</a> below.)</p><p>Such decisions are often nuanced.
