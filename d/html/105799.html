Flexible bronchoscopy is used for a growing number of diagnostic and therapeutic indications such that the clinician should be aware of the potential value of this procedure for their patient. Flexible bronchoscopy is also used with rigid bronchoscopy to access or evaluate the upper lobe airways as well as the distal lower lobe bronchi.</p><p>The general principles of patient preparation, as well as the procedural technique and complications of flexible bronchoscopy are reviewed here. The equipment, indications, contraindications, and procedures that can be performed using a flexible bronchoscope are described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4398.html" rel="external">"Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Overview"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4400.html" rel="external">"Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Indications and contraindications"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/106085.html" rel="external">"Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Associated diagnostic and therapeutic procedures"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2736574550"><span class="h1">PREPROCEDURAL PREPARATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H891151336"><span class="h2">Patient selection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients should be selected for flexible bronchoscopy after reviewing the history and clinical exam, and carefully weighing the indications and contraindications, which are reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4400.html" rel="external">"Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Indications and contraindications"</a>.)</p><p>Patients are generally asked not to eat or drink for at least six hours prior to the procedure and for patients who are intubated, feeding is discontinued for the same period of time. However, an emergent bronchoscopy can be performed when the patient is fasting for less than six hours depending on the indication.</p><p>Patients at high risk for infective endocarditis (IE) may be considered for antibiotic prophylaxis (eg, previous IE, prosthetic valves, congenital heart disease, ventricular assist devices) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Further details regarding antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of IE are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2147.html" rel="external">"Prevention of endocarditis: Antibiotic prophylaxis and other measures"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H672453366"><span class="h2">Informed consent</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once a patient has been selected for flexible bronchoscopy, the clinician should obtain informed consent from the patient or a designated decision maker. This involves discussing the indications, potential complications, benefits, and alternatives of the planned procedure and the type of sedation (moderate versus general anesthesia). Questions should be answered. Implied consent is acceptable when the bronchoscopy is emergent, the patient is incapable of giving consent due to altered mental status, and a surrogate decision maker is unavailable (eg, removal of a foreign body causing life-threatening airway obstruction or in massive hemoptysis). In such cases, the clinician should carefully document the reason that the informed consent is not possible and indicate why the emergent procedure is medically necessary. Some institutions require a documentation of the need for bronchoscopy by a second attending physician. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15076.html" rel="external">"Informed procedural consent"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1621.html" rel="external">"Ethics in the intensive care unit: Informed consent"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H106784364"><span class="h2">Personnel</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bronchoscopy can be performed in various hospital settings including the bronchoscopy or endoscopy suite, operating room, intensive care unit, postoperative anesthesia care unit, and emergency department. In all settings, an experienced team is essential to perform bronchoscopy safely, efficiently, and successfully.</p><p>There is a wide variation in personnel requirement depending upon the institution, clinical setting, and type of bronchoscopy (ie, inspection bronchoscopy versus an advanced diagnostic or interventional procedure). Similar principles apply if the bronchoscopy is scheduled or emergent:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ideally, the team should include the bronchoscopist, a nurse, and a technician. The technician or assistant is needed to set up the equipment, assist the bronchoscopist with collection of the specimens or performance of additional procedures, and clean the scope after completion of the procedure. The nurse usually does the preprocedure evaluation including medication review and then will monitor and record the patient's vital signs and each step of procedure as well as administer moderate sedation. At minimum, at least one qualified assistant in addition to the bronchoscopist should be present, especially in an emergent situation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For more complex bronchoscopic procedures (eg, interventional procedure requiring laser for tissue debulking or endobronchial ultrasound), additional personnel is often necessary (eg, a respiratory therapist or someone with knowledge of advanced airway management, laser technician to operate the laser equipment or cytology technicians to prepare and evaluate cytology specimen onsite).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1757948217"><span class="h2">Equipment and supplies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All equipment and materials necessary to perform the procedure, administer sedation, and manage the airway should be set up prior to the bronchoscopy.

These patients usually have an ETT or a tracheostomy tube that is connected to the ventilator. A special adapter is necessary for such procedures to avoid any air leak so that the patients can be adequately mechanically ventilated during the bronchoscopy. The adaptor allows the flexible bronchoscope to be inserted through the ETT or tracheostomy tube while the patient is being ventilated.</p><p>Similarly, special masks are available for patients on noninvasive ventilation (NIV) so that continued NIV can be administered while patients are undergoing bronchoscopy to avoid any leak [<a href="#rid5">5-7</a>]. However, bronchoscopy while on NIV is not commonly performed in the United States as these patients are at risk for possible intubation and if indicated patient should be intubated first.</p><p>It is important to check and make sure that all equipment are in the room and is functional prior to administering sedation.

It should be confirmed that the patient has not had anything to eat or drink during the six hours prior to the administration of topical airway anesthesia. The patient is then placed on continuous cardiac and pulse oximetry monitors, and supplemental oxygen is administered (generally 2 to 6 L/min by nasal cannula), with an ideal target peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) of 100 percent, but an SpO<sub>2</sub> above 96 percent is acceptable in select circumstances.

Use of lidocaine gel provides both lubrication and topical anesthesia. The patients may be asked to sniff the gel into the nostrils. A cotton tip swab covered with topical anesthetic gel is then gently inserted into the nostril (using a twisting motion) along the floor of the nasal passage until it reaches the back of the nasopharynx. This maneuver also helps identify for the operator whether or not the bronchoscope can easily pass through the nasal passage, which is the preferred route for entering the tracheobronchial tree. It is important during this latter step not to force the swab in order to avoid inducing an episode of epistaxis. Also, the nasal passage should be avoided in patients with thrombocytopenia or those who are at increased risk of bleeding.

Often, in emergent situations, the stomach contents can be aspirated through the feeding tube prior to the procedure to minimize the risk of aspiration. Some experts administer 1 to 2 mL of topical anesthesia (eg, 1 or 2 percent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/z/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a>) via the endotracheal tube (ETT), although this practice is variable and not well validated but helps with smooth insertion of the bronchoscope through the ETT and allows topical anesthesia of the trachea. In addition, topical anesthesia to the nasal passages is sometimes done in patients with tracheostomy to evaluate the upper airways, vocal cords, or trachea for stenosis or granulation tissue formation above the tracheostomy tube.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2227557760"><span class="h2">Route of entry</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The route of entry is usually preplanned.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nasal</strong> – The nasal route is preferred in most nonintubated, spontaneously breathing patients.

As an example, in patients with thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, small nasal cavities, or obstructing polyps, the nasal route is generally avoided and the oral route is preferred. The oral route is also used for bronchoscopic intubation or when flexible bronchoscopic assistance is needed during airway stent placement.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Endotracheal devices</strong> – For patients who are intubated with an ETT or have a tracheostomy tube in place, the bronchoscopist enters the tracheobronchial tree via the ETT/tracheostomy device usually at mid-level trachea. Thus, visual inspection of the upper airway or vocal cords is bypassed. Occasionally, when upper airway obstruction or oropharyngeal lesions is suspected in this population, the bronchoscope can be passed through the nose and mouth as for a nonintubated patient.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Both the bronchoscope and ETT/tracheostomy size should be taken into consideration. Typically, an endotracheal device with an inner diameter of 7.5 mm or greater is needed for patients who undergo bronchoscopy with a conventional bronchoscope. If not feasible, an ETT or the tracheostomy tube can be changed to a larger size or a smaller diameter bronchoscope can be used. Depending on the indication (ie, a quick bronchoscopic examination versus intervention) an appropriate size can be chosen.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Ventilator alarm settings and the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) will need to be increased to accommodate the increased airway pressure and reduction in oxygenation that typically occurs during bronchoscopy.

It is not as invasive as an ETT (as it is placed above the vocal cords) and can maintain adequate ventilation during a procedure with longer duration. As an example, endobronchial ultrasound and many interventional bronchoscopic procedures are done with LMAs. Similar to ETTs, the bronchoscope is passed through the LMA and inserted through the vocal cords to the tracheobronchial tree. When LMAs are used, the epiglottic aperture bars (if present) are typically cut prior to LMA insertion to facilitate passage of the bronchoscope, although there are newer LMA devices that do not have epiglottic bars and can be used without a bite block  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef138318" href="/z/d/graphic/138318.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3510156359"><span class="h1">PREPROCEDURAL UNIVERSAL PROTOCOL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The universal preprocedural and time-out protocol should be performed prior to beginning the procedure.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The preprocedure verification process requires that the clinician confirm that the correct patient is present and that the correct procedure is about to be performed on the correct site.

Sedation should not be initiated until the procedure room is prepared, equipment checked, the time-out is done, the upper airway is anesthetized, and all required personnel are present. It is also important to have a discharge plan in place for outpatients undergoing sedation, as patients are not allowed to drive home by themselves after the procedure. Agents typically used include short-acting benzodiazepines (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9650" href="/z/d/drug information/9650.html" rel="external">midazolam</a>) and opioids (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8441" href="/z/d/drug information/8441.html" rel="external">fentanyl</a>).

Reflecting this observation, in one retrospective study of more than 4000 bronchoscopies, 3 percent of whom had an associated bleeding event, almost all of the bleeding events resolved with conservative measures [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].

There are limited data comparing these agents. We usually start with ice-cold saline and then escalate to other options if bleeding is not controlled.</p><p>One double-blinded randomized study of 130 patients with bleeding during bronchoscopy compared the topical application of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/z/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a> (up to three applications; maximum 0.2 mg in 2 mL [1:10,000]) with TXA (up to three applications; maximum of 100 mg in 2 mL) after the bleeding could not be controlled with ice-cold <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> alone [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Cross over was allowed for up to three more doses of the other agent if bleeding needed further control. There was no difference in the rate of hemostasis between the groups (83 percent), and both agents were more successful in controlling moderate bleeding (87 [epinephrine] versus 89 [TXA] percent) than severe bleeding (40 [epinephrine] versus 58 [TXA] percent). There were no drug-related adverse events in either group. Another randomized trial reported that prophylactic administration of epinephrine (1:10,000-diluted topical epinephrine) in a post-lung transplant population reduced the incidence of severe hemorrhage compared with saline placebo (4 versus 24 percent) [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p>Recombinant factor VIIa, originally developed for hemostasis in hemophilia, has also been used topically during bronchoscopy to control bleeding, especially diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [<a href="#rid23">23-25</a>]. Fifty mcg/kg of activated recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) in 50 mL of 0.9 percent sodium chloride can be administered through the working channel of the bronchoscope [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p>Serious life-threatening bleeding that fails these conservative measures may be treated with several options including local ablative therapies, such as argon plasma coagulation (APC) or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser; the choice among these options depends on the source of bleeding, availability, or local expertise. APC or Nd:YAG laser ablative therapies work best if the source of bleeding is from the luminal walls of larger airways. For parenchymal bleeding, embolization or surgery are better definitive treatment options when above treatment options fail.</p><p>An endobronchial balloon blocker  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef138319" href="/z/d/graphic/138319.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) can be placed to isolate the bleeding lung and to maintain ventilation with the normal lung.

Most cases are minor with tension pneumothorax being rare. In a retrospective study of more than 4000 bronchoscopies, transbronchial biopsy was associated with pneumothorax rate of 4 percent [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. It is not clear whether imaging or navigational guidance reduces this rate. However, a registry-based study that included 312 patients who had a diagnostic biopsy for peripheral lung lesions, some of whom had imaging or navigational guidance, reported a pneumothorax rate of almost 2 percent [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. The same registry reported a pneumothorax rate of 3 percent when EBUS-guided procedures were performed [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].

A routine chest radiograph after a high risk procedure or if a patient is symptomatic, is a common practice to rule out pneumothorax.</p><p>Many cases are managed conservatively while the remainder require drainage of air, often with a chest tube. In a large retrospective study less than half of patients with transbronchial biopsy-associated pneumothorax required a chest tube [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].

Ideally, the bronchoscopy team should include an experienced bronchoscopist, a nurse, and a technician. All equipment and materials necessary to perform the procedure, administer sedation, and manage the airway should be set up and functional prior to the bronchoscopy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4400.html" rel="external">"Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Indications and contraindications"</a> and <a class="local">'Patient selection'</a> above and <a class="local">'Informed consent'</a> above and <a class="local">'Equipment and supplies'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Topical anesthesia</strong> – Flexible bronchoscopy must be performed in a monitored setting including an endoscopy suite, operating room, emergency department, postoperative anesthesia care unit or intensive care unit. Intravenous access should be established, cardiorespiratory monitoring started, supplemental oxygen administered, and the upper airway anesthetized. The route of entry is usually preplanned, with the nasal route being the most common. The universal preprocedural and time-out protocol should be performed prior to beginning the procedure. (See <a class="local">'Topical airway anesthesia'</a> above and <a class="local">'Route of entry'</a> above and <a class="local">'Preprocedural universal protocol'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sedation</strong> – Moderate sedation is generally used during flexible bronchoscopy. Sedation should not be initiated until the procedure room is prepared, equipment checked, the time-out is done, the upper airway is anesthetized, and all required personnel are present. Agents typically used include short-acting benzodiazepines (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9650" href="/z/d/drug information/9650.html" rel="external">midazolam</a>) and opioids (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8441" href="/z/d/drug information/8441.html" rel="external">fentanyl</a>).
