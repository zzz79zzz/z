         Subdural hematoma (SDH) forms when there is hemorrhage into the potential space between the dura and the arachnoid membranes. SDH in children differs significantly from SDH in adults because abusive head injury is a common etiology, especially in pediatric patients &lt;2 years of age [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In contrast to epidural hematoma (EDH), indications for operative management of SDH are less clear, and surgery is less likely to prevent morbidity and mortality. (See

         In the abused infant or young child, SDH is frequently discovered after physical examination and imaging. The history usually does not provide a plausible mechanism for the severity of injury and may be misleading. Frequently no mention of trauma of any kind is given. Common presenting complaints include altered mental status, seizures, apnea, breathing difficulty, or sudden cardiopulmonary arrest. (See

         Historical features may suggest an increased risk of SDH in patients with unintentional injury, such as:

         Because of the strong association between SDH and child abuse in infants and toddlers ≤2 years of age and because a history of head trauma is usually lacking, the clinician must maintain a high index of suspicion during physical examination of any child in this age group.
        </p>
        <p>
         In children with unintentional head injury, SDH can manifest as an alteration of mental status or focal neurologic deficit. Other findings might include fullness of the fontanelle or a jump in head growth.
        </p>
        <p>
         Up to 8 percent of neonates may develop a small SDH during labor and delivery but usually remain asymptomatic [

         Abused infants with SDH are typically &lt;2 years of age. External evidence of head injury, such as scalp hematoma, may be absent. These children demonstrate nonspecific clinical signs of brain injury, including:

         Large amounts of intracranial blood can accumulate prior to changes in the neurologic examination and may cause fever or hemorrhagic shock, particularly in infants with open fontanelles and cranial sutures.
        </p>
        <p>
         Bradycardia and pupillary changes are late findings often associated with rapid neurologic deterioration and poor outcomes despite rapid intervention. Because of delay in seeking medical attention, abused children with SDH may also present in cardiopulmonary arrest. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6610.html" rel="external">
          "Child abuse: Evaluation and diagnosis of abusive head trauma in infants and children", section on 'Physical examination'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Retinal hemorrhages, skull and skeletal fractures commonly accompany SDH in children with abusive head injury (shaken baby syndrome) and indicate major traumatic force that usually does not match the history. (See

         When abusive head injury is suspected, involvement of an experienced child protection team is crucial, and in many parts of the world (including the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia), reporting to a governmental agency is mandatory. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6600.html" rel="external">

         Intracranial bleeding should be suspected if there is a witnessed deterioration in neurologic status after an unintentional head injury. Depending upon the severity of traumatic injury, the child may present with a scalp hematoma and varying degrees of impaired consciousness and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59662" href="/z/d/graphic/59662.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). Often a small SDH is found by computed tomography (CT) of the head in patients who are neurologically intact. In these children, common symptoms include headache, vomiting, or irritability.
        </p>
        <p>
         Infants with mild head injury and SDH should undergo evaluation for predisposing factors including bleeding tendency, osteogenesis imperfecta, and glutaric aciduria type 1 although abusive head injury is still the most likely etiology in these children. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2927.html" rel="external">
          "Organic acidemias: An overview and specific defects", section on 'Glutaric acidemia type 1'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Other children will present in coma from large hematomas, possibly requiring urgent surgical evacuation. Lateralizing neurologic signs (eg, anisocoria, hemiparesis, hemiplegia) arise from compression of the third cranial nerve and brainstem. These are indicators of progression to cerebral uncal herniation. The side of the dilated pupil matches the side of the hematoma in roughly 90 percent of cases. The constellation of systemic hypertension, bradycardia, and respiratory depression (Cushing triad) is another late sign, and may be a preterminal event.

         Neuroimaging is an essential component of the evaluation of children with suspected inflicted head injury. In addition to establishing the diagnosis, imaging may provide documentation of the extent and timing of injuries.

         Depending on the degree of brain injury and size of hematoma, there may be associated uncal, subfalcine, or transtentorial herniation, as well as other signs of ischemia or hypoxia such as loss of grey-white distinctions in the brain on CT.

         Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is preferred for infants who are stable but require neuroimaging because of other injuries indicating physical abuse found on clinical examination and/or skeletal survey. In addition, MRI can be done in follow-up for patients with abnormal CT findings  (

         As with any head injury, a patient who presents with altered mental status after a significant trauma warrants emergency neuroimaging. Unenhanced head CT tends to be the study of choice. Although it may offer less diagnostic accuracy than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the detection of a subdural hematoma, CT detects SDH well enough to guide management and is more rapidly obtained [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5

         ]. In addition, it more accurately diagnoses skull fracture [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. In some centers, rapid MRI is used in preference to CT, and should also adequately show the hemorrhage.
        </p>
        <p>
         For clinically stable children with clear signs of extraaxial hemorrhage (ie, bleeding outside of the brain parenchyma) on CT, but for whom the space (epidural, subdural, or subarachnoid) in which the hemorrhage has occurred is less clear, it is often prudent to obtain further imaging.

         For children with an open anterior fontanelle, a bedside ultrasound with duplex Doppler may rapidly distinguish between subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage by detecting the course of blood vessels through the extraaxial space.

         MRI, when the clinical situation allows, is the preferred modality because it accurately identifies the space involved and demarcates the associated brain injury, such as stroke or contusion  (

         Making the distinction between enlarged subdural or subarachnoid space radiographically is important because the underlying cause can be significantly different.

         We recommend that most children with acute SDH, neurologic impairment, and midline shift on imaging undergo surgical evacuation. Frequently children who are comatose with severe brain swelling and signs of infarct on imaging are not good candidates for surgical evacuation of a SDH. This approach contrasts sharply with management of epidural hematoma in children where urgent surgery is always indicated in the presence of significant neurologic compromise.
        </p>
        <p>
         The decision to perform surgery on children with SDH is based upon physical findings and the results of neuroimaging. No clear criteria for operative care exist and no controlled studies of operative approach in children have been performed. Due to the flexibility of the pediatric skull, the indications for surgery might occasionally differ from that of adults, but must be decided on a case by case basis by a neurosurgeon with pediatric expertise. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1110.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Relative to EDH, the clinical presentation and radiographic findings in SDH are much more varied, and the time since injury ranges from hours to weeks. Factors for deliberation include the clinical presentation, the size of the hematoma, and the appearance of the underlying brain injury.

         In most cases, children with acute, unilateral SDH, neurologic impairment, and midline shift on unenhanced head CT should undergo surgical evacuation. Depending on the size and location of the SDH, the timing (acute or chronic), and the presence of other brain abnormality on head CT, immediate surgery is not likely to improve outcome in some children. Therefore, some children with severe brain injury may not be surgical candidates despite the presence of subdural hematoma. (See

         Some neurosurgeons perform subdural taps in stable patients with chronic subdural hematoma or subdural hygroma to facilitate resorption. As many as 42 percent go on to require further taps or another procedure [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,10
         </a>
         ], such as a subdural drain placement. For many patients, subdural taps or drain placement are performed as an intermediate step that helps determine the need for a more definitive procedure, such as placement of a subdural peritoneal shunt.

         If at all possible, the decision to manage SDH nonoperatively should be made in conjunction with a neurosurgeon who understands the subtleties that would distinguish the more benign lesion from one that is a surgical emergency. In instances where neurosurgery is not physically available to the managing physician and transport to a higher level of care poses risk to the patient, phone consultation and remote review of the head CT by a neurosurgeon may assist in guiding proper patient disposition and care.

         Frequently children who are comatose with severe brain swelling and infarction are not good candidates for surgical evacuation of a SDH. This situation contrasts sharply with EDH in children, for which urgent surgery is always indicated when significant neurologic compromise is present. (See

         Children managed nonoperatively should be observed in a facility where experienced pediatric trained personnel can monitor for neurologic changes. Patients with GCS ≤8 should have continuous intracranial monitoring of ICP during observation if the medical situation allows for safe insertion of the monitor.

        <p>
         A repeat head CT should be obtained within 24 hours or sooner if concerning features exist on the initial head CT. In addition, significant clinical deterioration requires emergent repeat head CT. Observational studies in children show that reimaging with a head CT detects an increase in SDH size in up to 14 percent of patients and that 4 percent undergo surgical evacuation or other procedure based on this progression [

         Children presenting with severe alterations in their level of consciousness and significant neurologic symptoms after unintentional head injury typically experience poor outcomes, independent of the size of the SDH, because of coexisting brain injury. In this respect, SDH differs substantially from EDH. Since an EDH often has little underlying brain injury, even a comatose, herniating patient can have an excellent outcome if rapid surgical intervention is achieved. (See

         Most victims of inflicted head injury with SDH have a poor outcome. In one series of 33 infants with SDH, most of whom had inflicted head injury, 75 percent died or had profound disability [

         For the survivors, inflicted brain injury in children has both short and long term neurologic, behavioral, and cognitive consequences. As with unintentional injury, the best prognostic indicator for neurocognitive recovery after inflicted injury is neurologic condition on presentation. Delayed presentation to a medical facility, low Glasgow coma score at time of presentation, and prolonged duration of coma are all correlated with unfavorable outcomes. (See

         Subdural hematoma (SDH) results from bleeding into the potential space between the dural and the arachnoidal membranes. On CT, a SDH appears concave as it spreads across the brain surface unrestricted by cranial sutures  (

         A history of major head trauma (eg, motor vehicle collision) is usually found in children with SDH caused by unintentional head injury.

         Head CT is the mainstay of diagnostic imaging because of the speed with which it can be obtained and interpreted, and its ability to demarcate in detail the extent of the hemorrhage for surgical planning and its superior detection of skull fractures. In some centers, rapid MRI is becoming the preferred imaging modality for children to reduce radiation exposure. (See

         Diagnosis of a SDH in a child with no plausible mechanism of injury should prompt involvement of an experienced child protection team (eg, social worker, nurse, physician with more extensive experience in the management of child abuse), if available.

         The decision to perform surgery on children with SDH is based upon physical findings and results of brain imaging; no clear criteria exist. We recommend that most children with acute SDH, neurologic impairment, and midline shift on imaging undergo surgical evacuation (

          Grade 1C
         </a>
         ). Frequently children who are comatose with severe brain swelling and signs of infarct on imaging are not good candidates for surgical evacuation of a SDH. This approach contrasts sharply with management of epidural hematoma in children where urgent surgery is always indicated in the presence of significant neurologic compromise. (See

         If at all possible, the decision to manage SDH nonoperatively should be made in conjunction with a neurosurgeon. In instances where neurosurgery is not physically available to the managing physician and transport to a higher level of care poses risk to the patient, phone consultation and remote review of the brain imaging by a neurosurgeon may assist in guiding proper patient disposition and care.
