In most cases of isolated proteinuria, the patient is asymptomatic, and the presence of proteinuria is discovered incidentally by use of a dipstick during routine urinalysis. The urine sediment is unremarkable (fewer than three erythrocytes per high-power field and no casts), protein excretion is less than 3.5 g/day (non-nephrotic), serologic markers of systemic disease are absent, and there is no hypertension, diabetes, and also no edema or hypoalbuminemia.</p><p>This benign presentation of isolated non-nephrotic proteinuria is different from that in patients with more prominent kidney disease who have one or more of the following: nephrotic-range proteinuria (≥3.5 g/day), lipiduria, edema, hypoalbuminemia, and/or an active urine sediment containing red cells (which are often dysmorphic) and red cell casts.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h2">Types of proteinuria</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are four basic types of proteinuria (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef85791" href="/z/d/graphic/85791.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Glomerular proteinuria</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Tubular proteinuria</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Overflow proteinuria</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Postrenal proteinuria</p><p></p><p>Glomerular proteinuria (ie, albuminuria) can be identified on a urine dipstick.</p><p>Some patients have more than one type of proteinuria. As an example, glomerular diseases, such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, can be associated with proximal tubular injury, leading to tubular proteinuria. In addition, patients with multiple myeloma and Bence Jones overflow proteinuria can also develop glomerular proteinuria and increased albumin excretion due to AL (primary) amyloidosis or a monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease.</p><p>Measuring the urine concentrations of both albumin and total protein (with either two separate tests or with a urine protein electrophoresis) can help determine the type of proteinuria [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In this study of 1011 patients, of whom 68 had a kidney biopsy, the ratio of the urine albumin to total protein concentration was generally less than 0.4 in patients with tubular or overflow proteinuria and greater than 0.4 in patients with predominantly glomerular proteinuria.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Glomerular proteinuria</strong> – Glomerular proteinuria is due to increased filtration of macromolecules (such as albumin) across the glomerular capillary wall. This is a sensitive marker for the presence of glomerular disease. The proteinuria associated with diabetic nephropathy and other glomerular diseases, as well as more benign causes, such as orthostatic or exercise-induced proteinuria, fall into this category. Most patients with benign causes of isolated proteinuria excrete less than 1 to 2 g/day. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3041.html" rel="external">"Glomerular disease: Evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tubular proteinuria</strong> – Low-molecular-weight proteins, such as beta2-microglobulin, immunoglobulin light chains, retinol-binding protein, and polypeptides derived from the breakdown of albumin, have molecular weights that are generally under 25,000 Daltons in comparison to the 69,000 Daltons molecular weight of albumin. These smaller proteins can be filtered across the glomerulus and are then almost completely reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. Interference with proximal tubular reabsorption, due to a variety of tubulointerstitial diseases or even some primary glomerular diseases, can lead to increased excretion of these smaller proteins [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Tubular proteinuria is often not diagnosed clinically, since the dipstick for protein is not highly sensitive for the detection of proteins other than albumin and because the quantity of non-albumin proteins excreted is relatively low. The increased excretion of immunoglobulin light chains (or Bence Jones proteins) in tubular proteinuria is mild, polyclonal (both kappa and lambda), and not injurious to the kidney. This is in contrast to the monoclonal and potentially nephrotoxic nature of the light chains in the overflow proteinuria seen in multiple myeloma.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Overflow proteinuria</strong> – Increased excretion of low-molecular-weight proteins can occur with marked overproduction of a particular protein, leading to increased glomerular filtration and excretion. This is almost always due to immunoglobulin light chains in multiple myeloma but may also be due to lysozyme (in acute myelomonocytic leukemia), myoglobin (in rhabdomyolysis), or free hemoglobin (in intravascular hemolysis) that is not bound to haptoglobin [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In these settings, the filtered load is increased to a level that exceeds the normal proximal reabsorptive capacity. Patients with myeloma kidney also may develop a component of tubular proteinuria since the excreted light chains may be toxic to the tubules, leading to diminished reabsorption. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7210.html" rel="external">"Kidney disease in multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies: Etiology and evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Postrenal proteinuria</strong> – Inflammation in the urinary tract, which can occur with urinary tract infection, can give rise to increases in urinary protein excretion, although the mechanism is unclear. The excreted proteins are often non-albumin (often IgA or IgG), and only small amounts are excreted. Leukocyturia is frequently present in such patients. Patients with nephrolithiasis or tumors of the urinary tract may also have proteinuria.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H265924166"><span class="h2">Amounts of proteinuria</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In normal individuals, low-molecular-weight proteins and small amounts of albumin are filtered by the glomerulus. The actual amount of albumin filtered each day in humans is controversial. The majority view is that no more than approximately 2 to 4 g/day of albumin are filtered normally, but some investigators claim that as much as 200 g of albumin are filtered each day (with nearly all of the filtered albumin "reclaimed" in the early proximal tubule) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Most of the filtered albumin enters the proximal tubule where it is almost completely reabsorbed, either intact or after degradation [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The net result is the normal daily protein excretion of less than 150 mg (usually 40 to 80 mg), of which approximately 4 to 7 mg is intact, immunoreactive albumin.</p><p>Previously, abnormal proteinuria was generally defined as the excretion of more than 150 mg of total protein per day. However, early kidney disease may be reflected by lesser degrees of proteinuria, particularly increased amounts of albuminuria.</p><p>The normal rate of albumin excretion is less than 20 mg/day (15 mcg/min); the rate is approximately 4 to 7 mg/day (3 to 5 mcg/min) in healthy young adults and increases with age and with an increase in body weight. Persistent albumin excretion between 30 and 300 mg/day (20 to 200 mcg/min) is called moderately increased albuminuria (formerly called "microalbuminuria"). </p><p>Albumin excretion above 300 mg/day (200 mcg/min) is considered overt proteinuria or severely increased albuminuria (formerly called "macroalbuminuria"), the level at which the standard dipstick becomes positive. At this level, much of the protein in the urine consists of albumin. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/119881.html" rel="external">"Diabetic kidney disease: Manifestations, evaluation, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3052.html" rel="external">"Treatment of diabetic kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p>Even within the normal range, higher amounts of albuminuria are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. This is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1545.html" rel="external">"Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) and cardiovascular disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1545.html" rel="external">"Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) and cardiovascular disease", section on 'High-normal albuminuria'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">DETECTION AND MEASUREMENT OF TOTAL URINARY PROTEIN EXCRETION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Two semiquantitative methods are available to screen patients for proteinuria. These are the standard urine dipstick and the precipitation of urine proteins with sulfosalicylic acid (SSA). Neither method is quantitative, and, if abnormal proteinuria is suggested by either technique, proteinuria should be quantified using a timed urine collection. (See <a class="local">'Quantitative measurement'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H424081"><span class="h2">Semiquantitative measurement</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Standard urine dipstick</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The standard urine dipstick primarily detects albumin but is relatively insensitive to non-albumin proteins. Thus, a positive dipstick usually reflects glomerular proteinuria. SSA can be used for detection of tubular or overflow proteinuria. (See <a class="local">'Sulfosalicylic acid test'</a> below.)</p><p>The dipstick is very specific but not sensitive to low levels of albumin excretion. The lower limit of detection is a urine albumin concentration of approximately 10 to 20 mg/dL. Thus, patients with moderately increased albuminuria (formerly called "microalbuminuria") will not usually be identified by this method unless the urine is highly concentrated. (See <a class="local">'Issues with measuring urine albumin'</a> below.)</p><p>Dipstick grading (negative to 4+, based upon increasing intensity of color changes) is only semiquantitative and is highly dependent upon urine concentration. Limited data suggest that using the urine-specific gravity to judge urine concentration may improve the ability to identify abnormal proteinuria with the dipstick [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. In one study of more than 2000 patients, for example, a urine dipstick for proteinuria of 2+ or higher was predictive of significant proteinuria (urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) greater than or equal to 500 mg/g) regardless of the specific gravity; however, a urine dipstick for proteinuria of trace or 1+ was only predictive of significant proteinuria if the specific gravity was 1.025 or less [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>False positive urine dipstick results may occur in the following settings:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>After the use of iodinated radiocontrast agents [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].

Use of SSA is primarily indicated in patients who present with acute kidney injury, a benign urinalysis, and a negative or trace dipstick, a setting in which myeloma kidney should be excluded. A significantly positive SSA test in conjunction with a negative dipstick usually indicates the presence of non-albumin proteins in the urine, most often immunoglobulin light chains. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7210.html" rel="external">"Kidney disease in multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies: Etiology and evaluation"</a>.)</p><p>The SSA test is performed by mixing one part urine supernatant (eg, 2.5 mL) with three parts (eg, 7.5 mL) of 3 percent SSA and grading the resultant turbidity according to the following schema (the numbers in parentheses represent the approximate protein concentration) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>0 = no turbidity (0 mg/dL)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Trace = slight turbidity (1 to 10 mg/dL)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>1+ = turbidity through which print can be read (15 to 30 mg/dL)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>2+ = white cloud without precipitate through which heavy black lines on a white background can be seen (40 to 100 mg/dL)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>3+ = white cloud with fine precipitate through which heavy black lines cannot be seen (150 to 350 mg/dL)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>4+ = flocculent precipitate (&gt;500 mg/dL)</p><p></p><p>Similar to the standard urine dipstick, the SSA test will record false positive results in the presence of many of the commonly used iodinated radiocontrast agents [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. How this occurs is not clear, but protein excretion may be overestimated by as much as 1.5 to 2 g/L. Thus, the urine should not be tested for protein for at least 24 hours after a contrast study. False positive results may also occur in the presence of penicillins, sulfisoxazole, and with gross hematuria [<a href="#rid12">12-14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H424310"><span class="h3">Urinary lysozyme</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Both the SSA and urine dipstick tests can detect urinary lysozyme, the production and excretion of which may be increased in patients with acute monocytic or myelocytic leukemia. Total lysozyme excretion is usually below 1 g/day but can exceed 4.5 g/day in some patients [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Thus, lysozyme excretion should be measured in patients who have a persistently positive urine dipstick for proteinuria in the absence of albuminuria, particularly if other signs of the nephrotic syndrome (such as edema and hyperlipidemia) are absent.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Quantitative measurement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Determination of the degree of protein excretion is a central part of the evaluation of patients with acute and chronic kidney diseases and in patients incidentally noted to have persistent proteinuria by a semiquantitative method. The quantity of protein excretion is clinically important for several reasons:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Most patients with the benign forms of isolated proteinuria excrete less than 1 to 2 g/day.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The degree of proteinuria is prognostically important in patients with primary and secondary glomerular diseases; higher degrees of proteinuria are associated with a more rapid progression to kidney failure, even in the absence of nephrotic syndrome.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The degree of proteinuria is used to monitor the response to therapy, as with immunosuppressive drugs for primary and secondary glomerular diseases or inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system to slow the progression of proteinuric chronic kidney disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7169.html" rel="external">"Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H424370"><span class="h3">24-hour versus spot urine collection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with persistent proteinuria should undergo a quantitative measurement of total protein excretion. The gold standard for measurement of protein excretion is a 24-hour urine collection, with the normal value being less than 150 mg/day.</p><p>The major limitations of measuring protein excretion in a 24-hour urine collection include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>It is cumbersome for patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>It is often collected incorrectly. (Over- and under-collections are common.)</p><p></p><p>The adequacy of the collection can be estimated by quantifying the 24-hour urine creatinine and comparing this value to the expected urine creatinine. As a general rule in adults under the age of 50 years, daily creatinine excretion should be 20 to 25 mg/kg (177 to 221 micromol/kg) of lean body weight in males and 15 to 20 mg/kg (133 to 177 micromol/kg) of lean body weight in females. From the ages of 50 to 90 years, there is a progressive 50 percent decline in creatinine excretion (to approximately 10 mg/kg in males, lower in females) due primarily to a fall in muscle mass. Formulas that incorporate race and weight with or without serum phosphorous in addition to age and sex may improve the estimation of creatinine excretion. This is discussed elsewhere in more detail. (See  <a class="medical medical_patient" href="/z/d/html/2181.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Collection of a 24-hour urine specimen (Beyond the Basics)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2359.html" rel="external">"Assessment of kidney function"</a>.)</p><p>Due to the limitations of a 24-hour urine collection, a number of shortcuts have been proposed. These shortcuts generally involve measuring the ratio of protein to creatinine (or occasionally the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR]) in urine specimens of less than 24 hours' duration. Most commonly, the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) in a spot first- or second-morning urine sample after avoiding exercise is used to estimate 24-hour proteinuria and to follow the effects of treatment in patients with proteinuric kidney diseases. Usually, the urine protein concentration in a spot sample is measured in mg/dL and is divided by the urine creatinine concentration, also measured in mg/dL, yielding a number that estimates the 24-hour protein excretion in grams per day (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/13493.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>) [<a href="#rid17">17-25</a>]. If SI units are used, the value for the UPCR (or UACR) in units of mg of protein per g of creatinine is divided by 8.8. As an example, a UACR of 30 mg/g creatinine is equivalent to 3.4 mg/mmol creatinine.</p><p>The UPCR is easy for patients and providers, and the correlation with daily protein excretion is reasonably good on the population level (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63722" href="/z/d/graphic/63722.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). However, the UPCR may produce errors when applied to the individual patient, especially in those who consistently excrete much more (or less) than 1 g/day of creatinine (which is typical for younger males and many younger females, respectively) or in those who are losing or gaining muscle mass. (See <a class="local">'Limitations of the UPCR and UACR'</a> below.)</p><p>The UPCR and the UACR in spot urine samples are both supported by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) as appropriate methods to ascertain kidney damage and aid in the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease. Some devices allow for quantification of urine albumin in spot urine specimens at the point of service (ie, in the clinic rather than the laboratory) [<a href="#rid26">26</a>], although these devices are not widely available.

Since the denominator of the UPCR is in grams of creatinine (ie, grams of protein per 1 gram of creatinine), the UPCR is an accurate estimate of 24-hour proteinuria only in someone who excretes 1000 mg/day of creatinine. However, the mean population creatinine excretion may actually be substantially higher than 1000 mg/day [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>]. As an example, in a study of 161 Japanese patients with IgA nephropathy, minimal change disease, or membranous nephropathy, the mean 24-hour urine creatinine content was 1170 mg/day [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p>In addition, the accuracy of the ratio is diminished if creatinine excretion is either markedly higher or lower than the average population value of 1000 mg/day.

In such patients, protein excretion is approximately 50 percent higher during the middle of the day than it is during sleep [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. Assume that the patient provides their clinician with a first-morning voided spot urine specimen (which reflects overnight protein excretion [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]) and, one month later, provides a spot urine specimen during a mid-afternoon clinic visit. The UPCR is 1.6 g/g in the first urine specimen and 2.4 g/g in the second. The clinician may interpret these findings to mean that the patient has worsening proteinuria even though there has been no true change.</p><p>The extent to which diurnal variability in protein excretion can affect the accuracy of the UPCR was evaluated in a study of 193 patients with lupus nephritis who had both random spot and 24-hour urine collections [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. The UPCR on the spot urine was compared with the UPCR of the 24-hour urine, rather than the 24-hour protein excretion, in order to account for variations in creatinine excretion. The spot UPCR differed from the 24-hour UPCR by more than 15 percent in 131 patients (68 percent of all patients). In 25 percent of the patients, the spot UPCR differed from the 24-hour UPCR by more than 50 percent.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4036205688"><span class="h4">Accuracy of spot urine estimates</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The accuracy of the spot UPCR is important among patients with proteinuric kidney disease.

However, in individual patients with kidney disease, the spot UPCR often does not accurately predict the result of a 24-hour urine, particularly in patients with lower degrees of protein excretion [<a href="#rid36">36-42</a>]. The following studies illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a longitudinal study of 302 patients from the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) cohort, proteinuria was quantified at baseline and at subsequent study visits by same-day spot UPCR and 24-hour urine protein excretion [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. All patients had biopsy-proven glomerular disease (30, 20, 20, and 30 percent with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, minimal change disease, membranous nephropathy, or other glomerular disease, respectively). Among adults, the spot UPCR accurately identified patients with elevated 24-hour urine protein excretion above clinically significant thresholds (0.5 g, 1.0 g, 2.0 g, 3.0 g, 6.0 g, and 10.0 g). However, the spot UPCR erroneously overestimated 24-hour urine protein excretion in 41 and 28 percent of patients whose excretion was &lt;0.5 g/day and &lt;1.0 g/day, respectively.

The estimated albumin excretion rate (or eAER) can be calculated by multiplying the spot UACR by the expected 24-hour creatinine generation (which can be calculated using a variety of equations) (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/95017.html" rel="external">calculator 2</a>). The eAER was derived in a large study of 1,693 patients with kidney disease using age, sex, race, and the UACR, and then was evaluated in two other large cohorts of patients with chronic kidney disease or diabetes [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. The eAER was significantly more accurate and less biased than the ACR in predicting the measured 24-hour albumin excretion. Using the eAER rather than the ACR to estimate albumin excretion may be particularly important in patients who have very large or very small muscle mass (eg, young athletic males and older adult females, respectively). Accuracy may be further increased if the eAER is calculated using values from a timed urine collection of 12 hours or more [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].</p><p>Similarly, the estimated protein excretion rate (or ePER) can be calculated by multiplying the spot UPCR by the expected 24-hour creatinine generation (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/95018.html" rel="external">calculator 3</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H425240"><span class="h4">Suggested approach to quantification</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The limitations outlined above, however, are not necessarily clinically important in patients with substantial proteinuria, since the exact degree of protein excretion (eg, 3 versus 4 g/day) is less important than the reproducibility of the test and changes with therapy.</p><p>We suggest the following approach to measuring and subsequently monitoring protein excretion, which takes into account both the greater accuracy of a complete 24-hour urine collection and the greater ease of monitoring with a spot urine specimen:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 24-hour urine collection should be obtained during the initial evaluation, measuring the excretion of both protein and creatinine.

Lipiduria is seen in patients with nephrotic syndrome, which implies glomerular disease. The serum creatinine should be measured and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated by use of the CKD-EPI formula (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/15635.html" rel="external">calculator 4</a>).

At a mean follow-up of 5.8 years, proteinuria disappeared in 23 percent, and 11 percent developed kidney function impairment, which was defined as a creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min and/or a serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL (133 micromol/L). Proteinuria was less likely to disappear in the 134 individuals with both proteinuria and hematuria (8 percent), and the rate of kidney function impairment was slightly higher (15 percent).</p><p>However, patients with higher amounts of isolated non-nephrotic proteinuria may not have an indolent course. In a general population sample of 2574 community dwelling adults, for example, approximately 40 percent of those who had dipstick proteinuria 2+ or greater (corresponding to an albumin concentration of 1 g/L or higher) had a rapid decline in kidney function (defined as an annual decrease in eGFR of 5 percent or more) [<a href="#rid67">67</a>].</p><p>Abnormal amounts of proteinuria, even moderately increased albuminuria (formerly called "microalbuminuria"), is an independent and significant risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, and long-term ESKD risk (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58089" href="/z/d/graphic/58089.html" rel="external">figure 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68921" href="/z/d/graphic/68921.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>).

In most cases of isolated proteinuria, the patient is asymptomatic, and the presence of proteinuria is discovered incidentally by use of a dipstick during routine urinalysis. The urine sediment is unremarkable (fewer than three erythrocytes per high-power field and no casts), protein excretion is less than 3.5 g/day (non-nephrotic), serologic markers of systemic disease are absent, and there is no edema, hypertension, diabetes, or hypoalbuminemia. (See <a class="local">'Isolated proteinuria'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Types of proteinuria </strong>– There are four basic types of proteinuria (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef85791" href="/z/d/graphic/85791.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) (see <a class="local">'Types of proteinuria'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Glomerular proteinuria </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Tubular proteinuria </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Overflow proteinuria </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Postrenal proteinuria </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Amounts of proteinuria </strong>– The normal daily protein excretion (including all proteins) is less than 150 mg (usually 40 to 80 mg). The normal rate of albumin excretion is less than 20 mg/day (15 mcg/min); the rate is approximately 4 to 7 mg/day (3 to 5 mcg/min) in healthy young adults and increases with age and with an increase in body weight. Persistent albumin excretion between 30 and 300 mg/day (20 to 200 mcg/min) is called moderately increased albuminuria (formerly called "microalbuminuria"). Persistent albumin excretion above 300 mg/day (200 mcg/min) is considered overt proteinuria or severely increased albuminuria (formerly called "macroalbuminuria"), the level at which the standard dipstick becomes positive. (See <a class="local">'Amounts of proteinuria'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Detection of proteinuria </strong>– Two semiquantitative methods are available to screen patients for proteinuria. These are the standard urine dipstick and the precipitation of urine proteins with sulfosalicylic acid (SSA). Neither method is quantitative, and, if abnormal proteinuria is suggested by either technique, proteinuria should be quantified using a timed urine collection. (See <a class="local">'Standard urine dipstick'</a> above and <a class="local">'Sulfosalicylic acid test'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Measurement of protein excretion </strong>– Patients with persistent proteinuria should undergo a quantitative measurement of total protein excretion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The gold standard for measurement of protein excretion is a 24-hour urine collection. The major limitations of measuring protein excretion in a 24-hour urine collection include the following: it is cumbersome for patients, and it is often collected incorrectly (over- and under-collections are common). (See <a class="local">'24-hour versus spot urine collection'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Most commonly, the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) in a spot first- or second-morning urine sample after avoiding exercise is used to estimate 24-hour proteinuria and to follow the effects of treatment in patients with proteinuric kidney diseases. Usually, the urine protein concentration in a spot sample is measured in mg/dL and is divided by the urine creatinine concentration, also measured in mg/dL, yielding a dimensionless number that estimates the 24-hour protein excretion in grams per day (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/13493.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>). If SI units are used, the value for the UPCR (or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR]) is divided by 8.8. (See <a class="local">'24-hour versus spot urine collection'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Although the UPCR correlates well with 24-hour urine protein excretion on the population level, its usefulness in predicting the true 24-hour protein excretion in any given individual is debatable (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63722" href="/z/d/graphic/63722.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). There are two major limitations of using random spot urine samples to quantify proteinuria: the UPCR and UACR are heavily influenced by the urine creatinine concentration (the denominator of the ratio) and therefore by the total daily creatinine production, and urine protein excretion can vary throughout the day. Consequently, the estimated protein excretion rate (ePER) (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/95018.html" rel="external">calculator 3</a>) and estimated albumin excretion rate (eAER) (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/95017.html" rel="external">calculator 2</a>), which can be calculated using information from a spot urine, may be more accurate estimates of daily protein and albumin excretion. (See <a class="local">'Influence of the urine creatinine'</a> above and <a class="local">'Variability of protein excretion'</a> above and <a class="local">'Estimated albumin excretion rate'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Approach to quantifying protein excretion </strong>– We suggest the following approach to measuring and subsequently monitoring protein excretion, which takes into account both the greater accuracy of a complete 24-hour urine collection and the greater ease of monitoring with a spot urine specimen (see <a class="local">'Suggested approach to quantification'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A 24-hour urine collection should be obtained during the initial evaluation, measuring the excretion of both protein and creatinine. The completeness of the 24-hour urine collection can be estimated from creatinine excretion, as described above.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If the initial 24-hour urine collection seems complete, then the rate of protein excretion is probably an accurate estimate. The ePER (or eAER) on this 24-hour specimen can be related to the total amount of proteinuria (or albuminuria) and also compared with a random spot ePER or eAER. Random specimens can subsequently be used to monitor the degree of proteinuria as long as muscle mass appears stable.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If follow-up measurements of the ePER (or eAER) suggest that a clinically important change in protein excretion has occurred, a 24-hour urine collection should be obtained to verify the change in proteinuria before therapy is altered.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Approach to the patient with proteinuria </strong>– After a patient has been identified as having proteinuria, a careful medical history and physical examination may reveal a cause, such as diabetes mellitus, malignancy, systemic autoimmune disease, or a prior history of kidney disease. The urine sediment should be examined for indicators of glomerular disease, such as hematuria with dysmorphic red blood cells, specifically acanthocytes; red blood cell casts; and white blood cells or white blood cell casts in the absence of infection. Lipiduria is seen in patients with nephrotic syndrome, which implies glomerular disease. The serum creatinine should be measured and the GFR estimated by use of the CKD-EPI formula. (See <a class="local">'Approach to the patient with proteinuria'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A patient with isolated proteinuria (normal urine sediment, normal kidney function) who has no obvious etiology identified by the history and physical examination should be evaluated for transient proteinuria and orthostatic proteinuria (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef85792" href="/z/d/graphic/85792.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Rule out transient proteinuria'</a> above and <a class="local">'Rule out orthostatic proteinuria'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If transient proteinuria and orthostatic proteinuria are ruled out, the patient is said to have persistent isolated proteinuria. The subsequent evaluation of patients with persistent isolated proteinuria usually involves referral to a nephrologist and, depending upon the degree of proteinuria and the results of other tests, a kidney biopsy (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef85792" href="/z/d/graphic/85792.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).
