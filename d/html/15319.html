         Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common genetic disorder, occurring between 1 in 400 and 1 in 1000 live births [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Affected individuals typically do not develop symptomatic disease until adulthood. Not uncommonly, asymptomatic children may be identified while undergoing abdominal imaging for screening due to a family history of ADPKD or incidentally for an unrelated issue. However, a small percentage of individuals with ADPKD will present in infancy and childhood with early-onset and rapidly progressive disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         The clinical features, diagnosis, screening, and management of ADPKD in children will be reviewed here. Discussions of other cystic diseases, including autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) are found separately in the program, as is discussion of ADPKD in adults. (See

         ADPKD (previously called adult polycystic kidney disease) is a dominant inherited disorder characterized by cystic dilatations in all parts of the nephron. Variants in one of two genes,
         <em>
          PKD1
         </em>
         or
         <em>
          PKD2
         </em>
         , account for most cases of ADPKD. These genes encode proteins localized to the primary cilia of renal epithelial cell, which are involved with intracellular calcium signaling and activation of cyclic AMP. How variants of these genes result in cyst formation, however, remains unclear.

         In affected individuals with ADPKD, renal involvement is characterized by cystic dilatations in all parts of the nephron, including Bowman's space and all tubular segments  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105908" href="/z/d/graphic/105908.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). In the early stages, there may be only a few macrocysts (&gt;10 mm) irregularly distributed. Approximately 17 percent of children with ADPKD will demonstrate unilateral renal findings at initial screening [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. It is possible that high-resolution ultrasound will reveal cysts as small as 2 to 3 mm, but there have been no studies documenting the number of cysts using high-resolution ultrasound in children [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Later, both kidneys become enlarged due to the formation of macrocysts in the cortex and in the medulla  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105909" href="/z/d/graphic/105909.html" rel="external">
          picture 2
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Cysts in the liver and pancreas are common in adults with ADPKD, but are infrequently observed in pediatric patients. Congenital hepatic fibrosis occurs in patients with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease and is extremely rare in patients with ADPKD; thus it may be used to differentiate between the two genetic polycystic diseases [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]. Cerebral vessel malformations have also been rarely described in children with ADPKD [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. An increased risk of mitral valve prolapse has also been reported in affected patients. (See

         Although most individuals with ADPKD remain asymptomatic until the fourth decade of life, increasingly, (asymptomatic) children with ADPKD are being identified after undergoing abdominal imaging for screening based on a family history or as an incidental finding of cysts for an unrelated condition. ADPKD in asymptomatic children may be detected due to hypertension and/or mild proteinuria [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. In addition, approximately 2 to 5 percent will present with early-onset and rapidly progressive kidney disease during childhood [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. It remains unclear why some children present with early onset of disease and others remain asymptomatic. Although siblings of affected children have a significant risk of early disease [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ], this relationship within families is not absolute, as some infants with severe disease can have a parent with milder form of ADPKD and stable renal function [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1678.html" rel="external">
          "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in adults: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis", section on 'Epidemiology'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         A proposed mechanism for early-onset disease is the inverse relationship with the level of polycystin function. Support for this theory is provided by the presentation of early and rapidly progressive disease in infants with a "contiguous gene" syndrome in whom there is a large deletion in both
         <em>
          PKD1
         </em>
         and the immediately adjacent gene for tuberous sclerosis [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Early-onset disease has also been associated with hypomorphic
         <em>
          PKD
         </em>
         or
         <em>
          PKHD1
         </em>
         variants (resulting in reduced PKD1 activity) from the unaffected parent in addition to the expected familial germ-line defect in the affected parent (resulting in no PKD1 activity) [

         Several case reports and series have reported severe ADPKD presenting in neonates with similar findings (oligohydramnios, massively enlarged kidneys, respiratory distress, and impaired kidney function) to those seen in neonates with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19-24
         </a>
         ]. These patients typically have rapidly progressive disease resulting in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in childhood. Although early-onset ADPKD was once thought to have a uniformly poor prognosis, newer data suggest that a relatively low percentage of patients diagnosed in the fetal or neonatal stage will progress to ESKD during childhood [

         Most children with ADPKD are asymptomatic and are identified by ultrasound screening because of a positive family history or incidentally when ultrasound is performed for an unrelated clinical condition as noted above. However, approximately 2 to 5 percent of affected children will present with early onset of disease with similar renal findings as those of affected adults [

         In children, the presentation of ADPKD varies, with a clinical spectrum ranging from rapidly progressive disease with large hyperechoic kidneys to asymptomatic children with renal cysts found either by chance during evaluation for nonrenal abdominal symptoms or by ultrasound screening of children with positive family history. In most pediatric case series, the diagnosis is made by the detection of cysts by renal ultrasonography in the setting of a positive family history [

         In the vast majority of children with ADPKD, kidney function (ie, GFR) is within the normal range with signs of decreasing GFR that typically do not start until adulthood. However, a subset of children with rapidly progressive disease who present before 18 months of age are at risk for developing ESKD during childhood [

        </p>
        <p>
         The frequency of symptoms increases with the severity of kidney involvement and disease progression independent of kidney function. A single center that prospectively followed children (&gt;90 percent with normal GFR) identified by radiologic screening in offspring of parents with ADPKD reported that the risk of flank or back pain and hypertension increased for children with severe disease, defined as those &gt;10 cysts compared with those with moderate disease [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29

         In children, the diagnosis of ADPKD is typically established by a positive family history and confirmed by ultrasonography by the detection of one or more cysts [

However, the reported rate of false negative result is 38 percent for children less than five years and approximately 20 percent in older children with

         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. Ultrasound-based criteria in patients greater than 15 years of age have been established for diagnosis or exclusion of ADPKD in patients with a positive family history  (

        </p>
        <p>
         Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are more sensitive modalities in detecting renal cysts, but are more expensive tests with known associated risks: radiation with CT and need for sedation with MRI in young children. As a result, ultrasound remains the preferred initial diagnostic modality as it is noninvasive, does not require sedation in young children, and is the most inexpensive imaging modality [

        <p>
         In affected neonates with a positive family history for ADPKD, enlarged and hyperechogenic kidneys detected by ultrasound are suggestive of the diagnosis of ADPKD. However, these findings are similar to those seen in neonates with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), diffuse cystic dysplasia, and other ciliopathies [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50
         </a>
         ]. Positive family history and absence of biliary dysgenesis make ADPKD a more likely diagnosis and differentiates it from ARPKD. (See

         Less frequently cysts suggestive of ADPKD are detected as an incidental finding on imaging performed for another unrelated condition in children with no apparent family history of ADPKD. In these children, renal ultrasounds should be performed on the parents and a diagnosis of ADPKD is made if renal cysts are detected in either parent. In families where the parents are young (under 30 years of age), ultrasound evaluation of the grandparents may be needed to establish the diagnosis [

         If the work-up for parents (or grandparents) does not reveal cystic renal disease, ADPKD is still a strong possibility (given the 10 percent rate of de novo mutations). Genetic testing is suggested if a definitive diagnosis is warranted.

         For children with a positive family history of ADPKD, routine screening for ADPKD in at-risk children less than 18 years of age is controversial. Although some advocate that screening not be performed in children because the adverse consequence of a positive diagnosis prior to symptoms in young individuals (eg, career, educational, emotional, and insurability issues) far outweigh any benefits (as there is a current lack of effective therapy), others suggest that early diagnosis provides an opportunity for maximal anticipatory care (eg, optimal blood pressure control) and the future opportunity to benefit from new therapies as they are developed [

         Ultrasonography is the preferred modality for screening in children at-risk for ADPKD. It is the least invasive and most cost-effective option. Sonographic detection of one or more kidney cysts is suggestive of a diagnosis of ADPKD in a child with a positive family history. However, as noted above, false negative results are reported in approximately 40 percent of children less than five years and approximately 20 percent of older children with
         <em>

         The diagnosis of ADPKD is relatively straightforward in a child with a positive family history, characteristic renal ultrasound findings, and extrarenal features. When no family history of ADPKD is present, but the sonographic findings are consistent with ADPKD, screening of parents should be performed. In patients without a family history of ADPKD, other cystic kidney diseases must be considered. However, given the relatively high rate of de novo mutations, the presence of multiple cysts in each kidney is very suggestive of ADPKD. Other genetic diseases (eg, tuberous sclerosis, von Hippel Lindau disease, autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease, HNF1B associated renal disease) can be associated with kidney cysts.

         In neonates with severe disease, the typical findings of enlarged, echogenic kidneys may be similar to those observed in cases with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). Infants with ARPKD also have congenital hepatic fibrosis and may demonstrate characteristic features of hepatomegaly, increased echogenicity of the liver, and dilatation of the peripheral intrahepatic ducts and the main bile ducts. However, these abnormalities are only present clinically in approximately 40 percent of affected neonates. Therefore, the absence of liver abnormalities does not preclude the diagnosis of ARPKD. (See

         Supportive care is provided to all children with ADPKD or at-risk for ADPKD in whom diagnostic testing has been deferred until legal age of medical consent. This entails management of blood pressure (BP), focus on reducing proteinuria, dietary measures, and anticipatory guidance to avoid and manage other complications of ADPKD. No specific agent for directed therapy that slows progression of renal disease is recommended, because there are no available data regarding benefit and safety of any drug in children with ADPKD.

         – Minor trauma increases the risk of cyst rupture. As a result, contact sports should be avoided in children with significant nephromegaly due to numerous and large cysts. The risks of contact sports in children with numerous and large cysts should be explained to the patients and they should be counseled to report any episode of cyst pain or gross hematuria.

         Kidney involvement is characterized by cystic dilatations in all parts of the nephron, including Bowman's space. Cysts in the liver and pancreas are common in adults with ADPKD, but are less frequently observed in pediatric patients. (See

         Most patients with ADPKD present in adulthood; however, a small percentage of patients present with early-onset and rapidly progressive kidney disease during childhood. Although it remains unclear why some individuals have early onset of disease and others remain asymptomatic, it has been proposed that early onset of disease is inversely related to the level of polycystin function. (See

         Severe ADPKD can present in the neonatal period with similar findings (oligohydramnios, massively enlarged kidneys, respiratory distress, and impaired kidney function) to those seen in patients with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). Neonates with recessive polycystic disease have congenital hepatic fibrosis and may demonstrate characteristic ultrasound features of hepatomegaly, increased echogenicity of the liver, and dilatation of the peripheral intrahepatic ducts and the main bile ducts, which may distinguish them from those with ADPKD. However, only 40 percent of ARPKD patients have clinical evidence of liver involvement as neonates, so the absence of liver findings does not exclude the diagnosis of ARPKD. (See

         Most pediatric patients with ADPKD are asymptomatic and are identified by detection of renal cysts by ultrasound screening because of a positive family history or incidentally when ultrasound is performed for an unrelated clinical condition. Although most pediatric patients with ADPKD are asymptomatic, those who present in childhood have similar renal manifestations to those seen in adult patients. These include hypertension, gross or microscopic hematuria, proteinuria, urinary tract or cyst infection, abdominal or back pain, urolithiasis, and, rarely, reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) during childhood.

         The diagnosis of ADPKD disease is typically established by a positive family history and kidney ultrasonography, which reveals cysts. However, ultrasonography is not as sensitive a diagnostic test for ADPKD in children compared with adults. The risk of reported false negative results is approximately 40 percent in children less than five years and approximately 20 percent in older children. As a result, repeat imaging may be necessary to make a diagnosis in younger children with a positive family history and an initial negative study [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Less commonly, cysts suggestive of ADPKD are detected as an incidental finding on imaging performed for another unrelated condition. In these children, kidney ultrasounds should be performed on the parents (in some cases, grandparents), and a diagnosis of ADPKD is made if kidney cysts are detected in either a parent or grandparent. Notably, approximately 10 percent of patients will not have a positive family history and have "de novo" mutations but demonstrate typical clinical features of ADPKD.

         In children (less than 18 years of age), screening for ADPKD is controversial. Although some believe the adverse consequences associated with a positive diagnosis prior to symptoms in young individuals (such as career, educational, emotional, and insurability issues) outweigh any benefits, others suggest that early diagnosis provides an opportunity for maximal anticipatory care (eg, optimal blood pressure [BP] control) and the future opportunity to benefit from new therapies.

         We offer screening to children if desired by the parents (legal guardians) after counseling family members about the inheritance of ADPKD and the potential harms and benefits of diagnostic screening. If appropriate, teenagers and competent younger children should be involved whenever possible in the discussion and decision-making process. Ultrasonography is the preferred modality for screening in children at risk for ADPKD. Sonographic detection of one or more kidney cysts is suggestive of a diagnosis of ADPKD in a child with a positive family history.

         The diagnosis of ADPKD is straightforward in children with a positive family history and characteristic renal ultrasound findings. In patients without a family history of ADPKD, other cystic kidney disease must be considered, such as ARPKD. (See

         , slows progression of renal disease in patients with a high likelihood of developing end-stage kidney disease. However, tolvaptan has significant adverse effects (eg, potential hepatic injury and polyuria) and is costly. There are no available data on its use in pediatric patients, including safety information. As a result, we do
         <strong>

         suggest using tolvaptan in pediatric patients with ADPKD until there are further data demonstrating it is a safe drug with significant benefit in children with ADPKD (

         Children who are diagnosed with ADPKD are likely to have preserved renal function until the fourth decade of life. However, a few symptomatic children are at risk for progressive disease that results in end-kidney renal disease that requires renal replacement therapy. (See
