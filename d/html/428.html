The increased incidence of Tay-Sachs disease and several other serious disorders  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80314" href="/d/graphic/80314.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) in people of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry is an example of this phenomenon and the reason genetic carrier screening programs have been successful and have had a high acceptance rate in this population [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. </p><p>This topic will discuss preconception and prenatal screening for disorders that are more common in people of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, have an identifiable carrier state, and are serious (ie, severely disabling, untreatable, and associated with a shortened life expectancy). It also addresses management of individuals with a family member with one of the genetic conditions prevalent in people of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. The <em>BRCA</em> pathogenic variant, which is also more prevalent in this population, does not meet the latter criteria as the development of breast or ovarian cancer in <em>BRCA</em> carriers is not certain and is potentially preventable and treatable. <em>BRCA</em> founder pathogenic variant screening is reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/753.html" rel="external">"Genetic testing and management of individuals at risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes", section on 'Population-based testing for those of Ashkenazi Jewish descent'</a>.)</p><p>New technologies using DNA sequencing and microarray hybridization analysis allow more comprehensive, general population-based carrier screening for a large number of pathogenic variants. Some commercially available genetic carrier screening tests screen for several hundred genetic diseases (using either saliva or blood) at approximately the same cost as screening for single gene pathogenic variants. The introduction of these new tests has shifted the screening paradigm from the traditional family medical history- or ethnicity-based risk for genetic disease (as in people of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry) to a population-neutral approach using panethnic expanded carrier screening. Some concerns with the panethnic approach have been the detection of genes with mild phenotypes, variable expression, low penetrance, and/or identifying diseases characterized by adult onset. An advantage of a panethnic- and population-neutral approach is that it may be a more accurate way to ascribe risk given increasing evidence that self-reported ethnicity has inaccuracies, which has the effect of underestimating risk of genetic disease [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/114595.html" rel="external">"Preconception and prenatal panethnic expanded carrier screening"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">SCREENING</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H335917662"><span class="h2">Rationale for carrier screening</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Carrier screening can identify asymptomatic individuals who carry pathogenic variants. If both parents are carriers of a pathogenic variant causing the same disorder, there is a one in four chance that their offspring will inherit two copies of the pathogenic variant (one from each parent) and will be susceptible to developing the phenotype. Identification of these couples gives them the opportunity to become informed about their risks and pursue reproductive options to avoid an affected pregnancy, prepare for the birth of an affected child, or terminate an affected pregnancy. Negative test results relieve some of the anxiety associated with pregnancy. (See <a class="local">'Posttest counseling and management'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H335918492"><span class="h2">Rationale for screening in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>One in four to one in five individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (descendants of Jewish people from Central and Eastern Europe [eg, Germany, France, Poland, Hungary, Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania]) carry a pathogenic variant for one of the autosomal recessive disorders included in the specific group of disorders listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80314" href="/d/graphic/80314.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Most of these disorders are severely disabling, untreatable, and associated with a shortened life expectancy. Some of the disorders (eg, Tay-Sachs disease) have a high incidence primarily among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and for many of the disorders (eg, familial dysautonomia), the pathogenic variant has been identified almost exclusively in these individuals [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Although the disorders can also affect people of Sephardic Jewish ancestry (descendants of Jewish people from Spain, Portugal, and North Africa), people without Jewish ancestry, and Jewish people from mixed backgrounds, they are less prevalent in these populations. </p><p>Laboratories offer carrier screening panels that test for several disorders as a group in a single multiplex assay. The number of disorders included in panels for individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent is variable (eg, 4, 9, 11, or more), based in part on the carrier frequency in this population and the severity of the phenotype. Some panels include disorders that are rare even in this population but are included because only a few pathogenic variants account for the majority of disease. Some laboratories offer an Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity-based panel that includes carrier screening for other autosomal recessive disorders more prevalent in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Routinely screening for Maple Syrup Urine Disease, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency, and Glycogen Storage Disease Type 1a is reasonable since the screening test has a &gt;90 percent detection rate or allele frequency ≥1 percent in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and the disorders are associated with significant morbidity and/or mortality.</p><p>Screening for autosomal recessive diseases with an allele frequency &lt;1 percent is controversial. While ACOG practice guidelines use an allele frequency threshold of 1 in 100 or greater, ACMG uses a threshold of 1 in 200 [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. For people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, diseases with allele frequency between 1 in 100 and 1 in 200 include nemaline myopathy (1 in 120), Usher syndrome type 1F (1 in 165), Usher syndrome type 3 (1 in 107), and Joubert syndrome (1 in 102). Testing for carrier status is indicated if a patient has a family member affected by one of these disorders or known to be a carrier of a gene responsible for one of these disorders and may be considered in all persons of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Allele frequency for Walker-Warburg syndrome has been reported to be 1 in 150 to 1 in 79 [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. It is not included among disorders in ACOG practice guidelines for screening in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, but if an allele frequency ≥1 percent is used as a threshold for offering carrier screening, then it would be reasonable to offer carrier screening for Walker-Warburg syndrome in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3562798448"><span class="h2">Strategy</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1892999636"><span class="h3">Panethnic approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The author of this topic uses a panethnic approach for genetic carrier screening consistent with the recommendations of ACMG [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. ACMG recommends routinely offering panethnic expanded carrier screening for tier 3 conditions to all pregnant patients and those planning a pregnancy [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. These conditions are described in <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acmg.net%2FPDFLibrary%2F41436_2021_1203_OnlinePDF.pdf&amp;token=IQxLzDq4doJGUgaZgeIY0we4mAxACG4FR5gdCA8q5dNDTiIEj4sCU0HhRbA8SmUac5n7wHWggVPQAnaaKqZOqK1gFAn9xn4VAFWHtv5TDk8%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=428" target="_blank">five tables</a> and consist of autosomal recessive conditions having a carrier frequency ≥1 in 50, 100, 150, or 200 in the general population or a carrier frequency that is highly represented in one or more patient populations (such as Ashkenazi Jewish descendants) and has the potential to be underrepresented in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) or genes with at least a 1/200 carrier frequency of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in a subpopulation that has at least 1 percent representation in the US including US territories. Tier 3 conditions include all 14 conditions more prevalent in Ashkenazi Jewish descendants. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/114595.html" rel="external">"Preconception and prenatal panethnic expanded carrier screening"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2476945760"><span class="h3">Ethnic approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ACOG Committee on Genetics recommends routinely offering all people of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry carrier screening for four of the most common disorders that are either lethal or associated with significant morbidity: Tay-Sachs disease, Canavan disease, cystic fibrosis, and familial dysautonomia, and considers offering an expanded panel an acceptable approach. The expanded panel would include these four disorders plus Bloom Syndrome, familial hyperinsulinism, Fanconi anemia group C, Gaucher disease, glycogen storage disease type I, Joubert syndrome, maple syrup urine disease, mucolipidosis IV, Niemann Pick disease type A, and Usher syndrome [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. In addition, ACOG recommends offering spinal muscular atrophy carrier screening to all pregnant people or people planning pregnancy, regardless of race or ethnicity [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6146.html" rel="external">"Spinal muscular atrophy"</a>.)</p><p>With this approach, the following is advised to identify candidates:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Review the personal and family history of individuals considering pregnancy or who are already pregnant to determine whether either member of the couple is of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry or has a relative with one or more genetic disorders more prevalent in this population  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80314" href="/d/graphic/80314.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Offer carrier screening to:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent – One grandparent of Ashkenazi Jewish descent is sufficient to justify testing. If Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry is more remote, it is still prudent to offer screening, but patients should understand that carrier screening has variable sensitivity and specificity in the setting of mixed ancestry because the frequencies and known pathogenic variants of most of these diseases are less well established.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Individuals unsure of their Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Individuals with a relative with one of the genetic conditions in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80314" href="/d/graphic/80314.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Individuals with an affected first-degree relative (parent, sibling, child) or second-degree relative (aunt/uncle, niece/nephew, grandparent, half-sibling) are at high risk of being a carrier. This risk can be 33 to 100 percent, depending upon which relative is affected.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Whether to screen patients with a more remote family history of disease is controversial. As an example, if a fifth-degree relative (eg, second cousin) is known to have been affected with one of the diseases of concern, a patient has a 1 in 16 chance of being a carrier and this risk is higher than the carrier frequencies of most of the genetic diseases in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Therefore, we believe any history of a blood relative with a confirmed autosomal recessive disease justifies offering carrier testing.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Partners of individuals who are screen-positive, whether or not they are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H335919924"><span class="h2">Consent</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Screening programs should be voluntary, confidential, and with informed consent. If a screening panel is ordered, the patient should be informed about and consent to all the diseases included in the panel. If a patient requests screening only for a particular condition for which testing is available, the requested test should be offered [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. </p><p>It may not be practical for a clinician to discuss each disease included in a multi-disease carrier screening panel. The ACMG suggests giving patients an informational pamphlet or referring them to an internet site where they can obtain a brief description of each disorder included in the test panel. Genetic counseling before testing should be available for patients who want more information [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Timing and testing sequence</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Before conception</strong> – Ideally, carrier testing of either partner of an Ashkenazi Jewish couple is initiated at a preconception counseling visit. If that partner tests positive, carrier testing can then be extended to the other partner (ie, sequential testing). If testing is negative, the other partner is not tested.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">When only one partner is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, that partner should be screened first [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>During pregnancy</strong> – If the patient is already pregnant and only one partner is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, that partner should be screened first. However, carrier testing of both partners can also be performed simultaneously at the first prenatal visit. Screening results are typically available in one to two weeks. This should allow ample time for further prenatal evaluation and diagnosis in the event that both partners screen positive.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Test requisition</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Carrier testing for each disease generally involves DNA sequencing for that disease. There are many different pathogenic variants associated with the various diseases; thus, the test requisition typically states "DNA sequencing for" and then lists the diseases/syndromes for which the patient has consented to be screened (eg, Tay-Sachs, Bloom, cystic fibrosis) rather than a specific pathogenic variant. </p><p>An exception is Tay-Sachs screening. In this case, biochemical analysis is preferred as the primary testing method because it is more sensitive than DNA sequencing [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. In people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, biochemical screening for hexosaminidase A activity detects 97 to 98 percent of carriers compared with 93 to 95 percent of carriers with DNA sequencing that tests for the three common pathogenic variants accounting for &gt;95 percent of disease alleles in this population (1278insTATC, G269S, 1421+1GC) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. In low-risk populations, biochemical analysis identifies 87 to 92 percent of carriers, while DNA sequencing may identify only 46 percent of carriers [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Tay-Sachs disease'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H335917741"><span class="h2">Posttest counseling and management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Posttest genetic counseling should be available for those with positive screening results and can also be helpful for those with negative results [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Posttest counseling should include test results for the patient and/or partner, a discussion of the risk to any current or future pregnancy, and a discussion of residual risk after testing. For example, the residual risk that the adult is a carrier after a negative test result in an individual of full Ashkenazi Jewish descent is 1/400 for cystic fibrosis, 1/2700 for Tay-Sachs disease, 1/2500 for Canavan disease, and 1/4900 for familial dysautonomia [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. It should be noted, however, that DNA sequencing has lower sensitivity in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, so residual risk may be higher.</p><p>If the carrier is pregnant and the partner is not available for testing, the risk of fetal disease can be estimated based on the carrier rate in the partner's ethnic group, and options for fetal diagnosis should be discussed.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H335917695"><span class="h3">Both partners positive</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If both parents are carriers, each offspring has a 25 percent chance of inheriting the disease, a 50 percent chance of being a carrier, and a 25 percent chance of not inheriting the affected allele. Posttest counseling should include an explanation of the pathogenic variant(s) detected; risk of disease; clinical manifestations, range of severity, natural history, and management of the disorder; options for fetal testing and reproductive decision making; and implications for other family members at risk for the disorder [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. This discussion is made easier by appropriate pretest counseling, during which many of these issues will have been introduced. When an individual is found to be a carrier, his or her relatives are also at risk for carrying the same pathogenic variant; the individual should be encouraged to discuss this information with them.</p><p>When carrier pathogenic variants are identified preconceptionally in both parents, they may choose to avoid pregnancy, use gametes from a donor who is a noncarrier, use preimplantation genetic testing with transfer of only unaffected embryos, or conceive naturally and undergo prenatal diagnosis if desired.</p><p>If pregnancy is already established, fetal DNA sequencing can be performed on chorionic villi at 10 to 14 weeks of gestation or on amniocytes/amniotic fluid at ≥15 weeks of gestation (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/449.html" rel="external">"Chorionic villus sampling"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5390.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic amniocentesis"</a>). Techniques for detecting such single-gene disorders by a noninvasive maternal blood sampling are being developed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/134618.html" rel="external">"Cell-free DNA screening for fetal conditions other than the common aneuploidies", section on 'Screening for monogenic disease'</a>.)</p><p>Pregnancy termination is an option, if desired. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1017964203"><span class="h3">One or both partners negative</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Genetic counseling should inform the couple of the residual risk for the disease. A negative screening test result for one or both partners significantly reduces the possibility of an affected offspring, but does not exclude it because not all pathogenic variants are known or included on the test and therefore not every carrier is identified. Sequencing approaches of the candidate genes will increase detection of pathogenic variants as well as variants of unknown significance. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H335917715"><span class="h4">Both partners negative</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When both partners screen negative for carrier pathogenic variants, they should be counseled that the risk for an affected child is very low but not zero. As an example, if both partners are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and they test negative for Tay-Sachs using DNA sequencing, the residual risk of having an affected fetus is &lt;1 in 1,000,000 [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H335917734"><span class="h4">One partner positive and the other negative</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If both partners are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and one tests positive as a carrier and the other tests negative, the residual risk of having an affected fetus depends on the carrier rate of the disease in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and the detection rate of the screening test for the disease. As examples, the residual risk that the fetus is affected is 1 in 6200 for Canavan disease, 1 in 11,000 for Tay-Sachs disease (using DNA sequencing), and 1 in 20,000 for familial dysautonomia [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].

In people who are not of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, DNA sequencing should also include testing for a fourth pathogenic variant, which accounts for 15 percent of pathogenic variants in this population.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Enzyme analysis – Enzyme assays can measure activity of Hex A and Hex B in serum or leukocytes. Tay-Sachs disease carriers have decreased Hex A activity and normal or increased activity of Hex B. Enzyme analysis can also be performed on amniocytes or chorionic villus cells.</p><p></p><p>Although the enzyme test is cost-effective, it has several limitations. First, there may be overlap in carrier and noncarrier range, making the test inconclusive in some cases. The test also can be unreliable in pregnant patients and in women on hormonal forms of contraception. In these instances, serum levels of Hex A can be falsely elevated, increasing the likelihood of false-negative screening test results (a positive test is a low level of Hex A). </p><p>If biochemical screening is performed in pregnant people or people taking systemic hormonal contraceptives, leukocytes must be used. Biochemical testing also may identify carriers of pseudodeficiency alleles, which are alleles that are associated with decreased Hex A activity, but are not associated with the disease. For these reasons, ambiguous or positive biochemical results should be confirmed by DNA sequencing for the most common pathogenic variants.</p><p>Because of the limitations of biochemical testing discussed above, DNA sequencing should be performed first in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent [<a href="#rid52">52</a>]. Biochemical analysis is recommended for people not of Ashkenazi Jewish descent or individuals with mixed ancestry (fewer than four grandparents of Ashkenazi Jewish descent) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. In a couple in which one partner carries a pathogenic variant causing Tay-Sachs disease, biochemical testing of the other partner may clarify whether they are a carrier with an unrecognized pathogenic variant. Gene sequencing can help identify rare pathogenic variants in individuals with a family history of Tay-Sachs disease, evaluate partners of known carriers of Tay-Sachs disease who have indeterminate enzyme analysis and negative common pathogenic variant analysis, and resolve ambiguous results from enzyme tests [<a href="#rid53">53</a>].</p><p>If both parents are carriers of known pathogenic variants, prenatal invasive testing via amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling with DNA sequencing for the identified pathogenic variants should be offered. When both parents are known to be carriers, but one or both do not carry a known pathogenic variant, fetal cells obtained via amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling should be tested for Hex A enzymatic activity [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].

For many of these genetic disorders, the pathogenic variant has only been identified in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Most of these diseases are severe, untreatable, and associated with a shortened life expectancy. Carrier testing can often identify individuals at risk for offspring with one of these conditions. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Panethnic approach</strong> – The author of this topic offers panethnic expanded carrier screening for disorders with a carrier frequency of ≥1/200 or a carrier frequency that is highly represented in one or more patient populations (such as Ashkenazi Jewish descendants), which is consistent with the ACMG approach. (See <a class="local">'Panethnic approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ethnic approach</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The ACOG Committee on Genetics recommends routinely offering all people of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry carrier screening for four of the most common disorders that are either lethal or associated with significant morbidity: Tay-Sachs disease, Canavan disease, cystic fibrosis, and familial dysautonomia, and considers offering an expanded panel an acceptable approach. The expanded panel would include these four disorders plus Bloom Syndrome, familial hyperinsulinism, Fanconi anemia group C, Gaucher disease, glycogen storage disease type I, Joubert syndrome, maple syrup urine disease, mucolipidosis IV, Niemann Pick disease type A, and Usher syndrome. (See <a class="local">'Ethnic approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If an ethnic approach is used, the personal and family history of individuals considering pregnancy, or who are already pregnant, should be reviewed to determine whether either member of the couple is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent or has a relative with one or more genetic disorders  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80314" href="/d/graphic/80314.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry is defined as any individual with one grandparent with known Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, or those who have a relative with one of the genetic conditions prevalent in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. If an individual is unsure of their Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, carrier screening is still offered. (See <a class="local">'Ethnic approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients of Ashkenazi Jewish descent who do not have a family history of genetic disease, it is reasonable to screen for disorders with carrier detection rates ≥90 percent and population carrier frequency of ≥1 percent  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80314" href="/d/graphic/80314.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).
