AS is present when the antegrade velocity across an abnormal valve is at least 2 m/s. The clinical stages of AS are defined by symptoms, valve anatomy, valve hemodynamics, and left ventricular function  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95224" href="/d/graphic/95224.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8123.html" rel="external">"Aortic valve sclerosis and pathogenesis of calcific aortic stenosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8164.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aortic stenosis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5295.html" rel="external">"Echocardiographic evaluation of the aortic valve"</a>.)</p><p><strong>Severe</strong> AS is defined as with a maximum aortic transvalvular velocity ≥4 m/s, typically with an aortic valve area ≤1 cm<sup>2</sup>  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95630" href="/d/graphic/95630.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Very severe AS is said to be present when the Doppler aortic jet velocity is ≥5 m/s  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95630" href="/d/graphic/95630.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8115.html" rel="external">"Aortic valve area in aortic stenosis in adults", section on 'Critical valve area and severity'</a>.)</p><p>The term "symptomatic AS" refers to AS that is causing cardiac symptoms. End-stage symptoms include heart failure, anginal chest discomfort, and syncope. However, the most common symptoms in patients who are followed prospectively are decreased exercise tolerance and/or cardiac dyspnea on exertion, both early symptoms of heart failure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8164.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aortic stenosis in adults", section on 'Symptoms'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H114086634"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGY OF AORTIC STENOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are three primary causes of valvular AS:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A congenitally abnormal valve, often with superimposed calcification (unicuspid or bicuspid). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8157.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of bicuspid aortic valve in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5775.html" rel="external">"Valvar aortic stenosis in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Calcific disease of a trileaflet valve.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rheumatic valve disease − Rheumatic valve disease is characterized by fusion of the commissures between the leaflets, with a small central orifice. Histologic studies show typical changes due to rheumatic disease. The rheumatic process typically involves the mitral valve as well; as a result, most patients with rheumatic AS also have mitral stenosis and/or mitral regurgitation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3151.html" rel="external">"Acute rheumatic fever: Epidemiology and pathogenesis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3177.html" rel="external">"Acute rheumatic fever: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Rare causes include metabolic diseases (eg, Fabry's disease), systemic lupus erythematosus, and alkaptonuria. Calcific AS presents at a younger age and progresses more rapidly in patients with Paget disease or end-stage kidney disease. Disturbances of mineral metabolism may contribute to calcific aortic valve disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1909.html" rel="external">"Valvular heart disease in patients with end-stage kidney disease", section on 'Valvular stenosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5601.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Paget disease of bone"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H114086658"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The relative frequency of the causes of AS varies geographically. Worldwide, rheumatic valve disease is most common and mitral valve involvement invariably accompanies rheumatic aortic valve disease. In North America and Europe, aortic valve disease is primarily due to calcific disease of a native trileaflet valve or a congenitally bicuspid valve.</p><p>The prevalence of AS increases with age, as demonstrated by a prospective population-based study of 3273 participants, including 164 subjects with AS. The prevalence of AS varied from 0.2 percent at ages 50 to 59 years to 1.3 percent at ages 60 to 69, 3.9 percent at ages 70 to 79 years, and 9.8 percent at ages 80 to 89 years [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Compared with the general population, mortality was not significantly increased in the asymptomatic AS group (hazard ratio [HR] 1.28), nor in those who received aortic valve replacement (HR 0.93).</p><p>The relative prevalence of trileaflet versus congenitally abnormal valves varies according to age as illustrated by a series of 932 adults who underwent surgery for isolated AS [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Patients with mitral valve replacement or mitral stenosis were excluded to ensure exclusion of rheumatic valve disease. Also excluded were patients with a previous aortic valvotomy, indicating severe valve obstruction due to congenital disease.</p><p>An anatomically abnormal valve was present in 54 percent: 49 percent had a bicuspid valve and 4 percent had a unicuspid valve, but the frequency varied importantly with age:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among the 7 percent of patients who underwent surgery at ≤50 years of age, approximately two-thirds had a bicuspid valve and one-third had a unicuspid valve. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8157.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of bicuspid aortic valve in adults", section on 'Valve disease'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among the 40 percent of patients who underwent surgery between the ages of 50 and 70, approximately two-thirds had a bicuspid valve and one-third a tricuspid valve; only rare patients had a unicuspid valve.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among the remaining patients over age 70, approximately 60 percent had a tricuspid valve and 40 percent had a bicuspid valve. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8147.html" rel="external">"Valvular heart disease in older adults", section on 'Aortic stenosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H114087755"><span class="h1">PROGRESSION OF AORTIC STENOSIS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H125740630"><span class="h2">Hemodynamics</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Serial hemodynamic examinations in patients with AS over years have revealed significant, though initially clinically silent, progression in most but not all patients. This progression is manifested by a reduction in the aortic valve area and an increase in the transvalvular systolic pressure gradient.</p><p>In individuals with normal aortic valves, the effective area of valve opening equals the cross-sectional area of the left ventricular outflow tract, which is approximately 3 to 4 cm<sup>2</sup> in adults. As aortic leaflet thickening and calcification develop, the antegrade velocity remains normal and there is a minimal valve gradient until the orifice area reaches less than half of normal. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8115.html" rel="external">"Aortic valve area in aortic stenosis in adults"</a>.)</p><p>When AS becomes hemodynamically significant, it results in an increased impedance or resistance to left ventricular ejection. The stenotic process is gradual in onset and progression, resulting in adaptive changes in the left ventricle. The increased systolic pressure in the ventricular chamber leads to concentric hypertrophy as a compensatory adaptive mechanism to maintain normal wall stress. With a compensated ventricle, the ejection fraction, the cardiac output, and the left ventricular end-diastolic volume remain normal for a prolonged period. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8127.html" rel="external">"Hemodynamics of valvular disorders as measured by cardiac catheterization"</a>.)</p><p>However, as stenosis severity and hypertrophy continue to progress, the left ventricle becomes less compliant and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure tends to increase. Abnormal diastolic function contributes to symptom onset and may persist after relief of stenosis due to persistent hypertrophy and/or interstitial fibrosis. Another contributing factor to the reduction in ventricular function is incoordinate contraction, resulting from regional wall motion abnormalities, fibrosis, or subendocardial ischemia [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H196135663"><span class="h2">Symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The natural history of AS begins with a prolonged asymptomatic period. In general, symptoms in patients with AS and normal left ventricular systolic function rarely occur until the stenosis is severe (valve area is &lt;1 cm<sup>2</sup>, the jet velocity is over 4 m/s, and/or the mean transvalvular gradient exceeds 40 mmHg)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95224" href="/d/graphic/95224.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Many patients do not develop symptoms until critical (very severe) valve obstruction is present, while some patients become symptomatic when the stenosis is less severe, particularly if there is coexisting aortic regurgitation. Thus, serial hemodynamic measurements alone do <strong>not</strong> identify the time of symptom onset. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8164.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aortic stenosis in adults", section on 'Symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>Many, if not most, patients with AS develop symptoms before the onset of left ventricular systolic dysfunction. However, in some patients, there is a reduction in systolic myocardial function and a decrease in the ability of the left ventricle to develop pressure and shorten against a load before the onset of symptoms. At this point, the left ventricle is transitioning to failure, resulting in reductions in stroke volume and cardiac output, and eventually signs and symptoms of overt heart failure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21854343"><span class="h2">Observational studies</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H196135109"><span class="h3">Overview</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Studies of patients undergoing serial cardiac catheterization have identified subgroups of patients with AS with distinctly different progression rates [<a href="#rid4">4-10</a>]. Serial echocardiography studies have provided data similar to that obtained in cardiac catheterization studies, although the time intervals between follow-up have been shorter and these studies are less prone to selection bias [<a href="#rid1">1,11-19</a>]. The average rate of progression has been similar in numerous studies, but the rate of progression varies widely among individual patients:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The average rate of increase in the mean systolic pressure gradient was 3 to 7 mmHg per year, but some patients showed an increase of as much as 15 to 19 mmHg per year.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Valve area declined at an average rate of 0.1 cm<sup>2</sup> per year, but some patients had little or no progression and others progressed more rapidly.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Aortic jet velocity increased by an average of 0.3 m/s per year, but this is also variable. (See <a class="local">'Medical University of Vienna'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Patients with mild disease (ie, aortic jet velocity less than 3.0 m/s) are unlikely to develop symptoms due to AS over the ensuing five years [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. A substantial number of patients with severe AS are not yet symptomatic, but most such patients have low event-free survival rates (56 to 63 percent at two years and 25 to 33 percent at four to five years) [<a href="#rid13">13,20</a>].</p><p>Data from observational studies of patients with asymptomatic AS suggest that peak aortic velocity and/or rate of progression of peak aortic velocity is associated with risk of death or aortic valve replacement. Studies at three different sites illustrate the range of predictive factors and rates of progression:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">University of Washington</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The importance of hemodynamic factors was demonstrated in a prospective study of 123 patients with AS in whom yearly echocardiography and exercise testing were performed for a mean of 2.5 years [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].

These relationships were illustrated in a study of 932 adults who underwent surgery for isolated AS [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Patients with mitral valve replacement or mitral stenosis were excluded to ensure that patients with rheumatic valve disease were not included. Also excluded were patients with a previous aortic valvotomy, indicating severe valve obstruction due to congenital disease.</p><p>An anatomically abnormal valve was present in 54 percent: 49 percent had a bicuspid valve and 4 percent had a unicuspid valve, but the frequency varied importantly with age:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among the 7 percent of patients who underwent surgery at ≤50 years of age, approximately two-thirds had a bicuspid valve and one-third had a unicuspid valve.

Mortality in patients with AS dramatically increases after the development of cardiac symptoms. This observation, along with improved survival rates following valve replacement, is the basis for the recommendation for prompt valve replacement in such patients (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8154.html" rel="external">"Indications for valve replacement for high gradient aortic stenosis in adults", section on 'Evidence'</a>). Poor clinical outcomes in symptomatic AS patients were documented in early studies [<a href="#rid9">9,29-31</a>] and have continued to be observed in later series of medically treated patients [<a href="#rid29">29,32-34</a>]. In later series, some medically treated symptomatic patients underwent balloon aortic valvuloplasty for palliation, but their clinical outcomes were not substantially changed by this procedure, which has been shown not to improve prognosis in adults with severe AS (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8141.html" rel="external">"Percutaneous balloon aortic valvotomy for native aortic stenosis in adults", section on 'Evidence'</a>). The high mortality rates observed in symptomatic patients who do not undergo valve replacement may be in part due to comorbidities that precluded surgery.</p><p>The following examples demonstrate the high mortality rate associated with severe symptomatic AS:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A review of studies performed between 1913 and 1970 found that mean survival after onset of heart failure ranged from 0.5 to 2.8 years, after onset of syncope ranged from 0.8 to 3.8 years, and after onset of angina ranged from 2 to 4.7 years [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].
