         Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). It is the most common of the clinically indolent NHLs defined as those lymphomas in which survival of the untreated patient is measured in years. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4716.html" rel="external">
          "Classification of hematopoietic neoplasms"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The initial treatment of FL depends on the stage of disease at presentation. Patients with early stage disease may be cured with radiation therapy, while patients with advanced stage disease are initially managed with an immunotherapy-based regimen (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">
          rituximab
         </a>
         plus chemotherapy).
        </p>
        <p>
         The use of either autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in FL is controversial. Autologous HCT may result in prolonged remissions and has a low treatment-related mortality rate. In comparison, allogeneic HCT may cure a higher percentage of patients with advanced stage FL but is associated with substantial treatment-related mortality.
        </p>
        <p>
         The use of autologous HCT in FL is reviewed below. The use of allogeneic HCT in FL and comparison with other treatment options are presented separately.

         Outside of a clinical trial, autologous HCT is reserved for patients with relapsed or refractory FL and for those with histologic transformation to a more aggressive histology. Novel cellular therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor T cells, may replace autologous HCT for this population in the future. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4755.html" rel="external">
          "Treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma", section on 'Chimeric antigen receptor T cells'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Interpretation of the trials that have investigated the relative value of autologous HCT versus combination chemotherapy alone for patients with FL is complicated by subsequent changes in the standard care of FL. Importantly, the routine incorporation of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies into the standard treatment of FL has improved survival rates among patients who do not undergo autologous HCT. Survival advantages seen in some early trials of autologous HCT may not have been evident had the combination chemotherapy treatment arms included anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. Conversely, a lack of survival advantage seen in other early trials may have been because the patients did not receive sufficient chemotherapy immediately before transplantation, leading to incomplete disease control and/or infusion of occult lymphoma cells contaminating the stem cell infusate.

         FL is a heterogeneous disease and approximately 20 percent of patients have an aggressive disease course with short remission durations, frequent relapses, and shortened survival. We recognize such patients as having early treatment failure defined as progression within 24 months of immunochemotherapy or within 12 months of single-agent

        </p>
        <p>
         Small retrospective studies suggest that autologous HCT may improve progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with early treatment failure if they are in complete remission or have minimal disease at the time of HCT. Larger studies are needed to confirm a benefit. Since the efficacy of autologous HCT depends on the response to chemotherapy, autologous HCT is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         appropriate for chemotherapy-resistant disease. (See

         Data regarding the use of autologous HCT for FL come from several retrospective analyses and a single randomized trial performed prior to the development of immunotherapy (eg,

         A European phase III randomized trial (the CUP trial) compared high dose therapy (

         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. At a median follow-up of 69 months, patients treated with high dose therapy followed by autologous HCT had the following significant outcomes:

        <p>
         The above study was performed before

          rituximab

         was available for the treatment of FL and during an era when the median survival of patients with newly diagnosed FL was much shorter than it is with modern therapy. This study has been criticized for the small number of patients in each arm of the trial. The tremendous responses seen with rituximab treatment have made clinicians question whether the benefit of autologous HCT still holds true in the rituximab era.

         The efficacy of autologous HCT likely differs according to the aggressiveness of disease:

         <a href="#rid2">
          2-4
         </a>
         ]. Several retrospective analyses focusing on this population suggest that autologous HCT improves survival when compared with chemoimmunotherapy alone [

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         As an example, a retrospective analysis used data from the National LymphoCare Study and the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research to report the outcomes of 349 patients who progressed within two years or did not respond to initial chemoimmunotherapy [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. When the population was analyzed as a whole, OS was similar whether or not autologous HCT was performed. However, in a planned subset analysis, when compared with those who didn't undergo HCT, the 123 patients receiving autologous HCT within one year of treatment failure had superior OS at five years (73 versus 60 percent). A mortality benefit for early autologous HCT was maintained when the analysis was matched for age and other known risk factors. These results suggest that early autologous HCT may benefit this high-risk population. Further studies of HCT in this population are described separately. (See

As an example, in a retrospective analysis of 254 patients with relapsed FL, patients treated with high dose therapy followed by autologous HCT had higher rates of five-year event-free survival (EFS; 51 versus 24 percent) and OS (70 versus 42 percent) when compared with patients who did not receive HCT [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10

         The determination of transplant eligibility should be made based on a risk-benefit assessment and the needs and wishes of the patient. Eligibility for HCT varies across countries and institutions, and depends on the type of transplantation (ie, allogeneic versus autologous) and the conditioning regimen (eg, myeloablative versus nonmyeloablative).

         Peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) are preferred over bone marrow harvested grafts for autologous HCT by most groups due to quicker engraftment and a potential for less contamination with tumor cells. (See

         Hematopoietic stem cells are mobilized using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) with or without

         . The method used is mainly dependent on institutional preference and experience. Often, G-CSF is used as a single agent initially. Plerixafor is then added for those who fail to mobilize adequate numbers of CD34+ cells with G-CSF alone. Apheresis is used to collect the PBPCs, which are cryopreserved until the day of infusion.

         A preparative (conditioning) regimen, consisting of chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy, is given to eradicate malignant cells prior to rescue of the hematopoietic system with a PBPC infusion. Selection of the preparative regimen is individualized and informed by institutional preference and physician experience. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3557.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         A choice among preparative regimens must take into account the center's experience, the short- and long-term toxicities of the regimen, and the patient's comorbidities. Historically, many of the trials that incorporated autologous HCT into the treatment of FL used preparative regimens with total body irradiation (TBI). A possible association between TBI and subsequent treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML) has led many centers to switch to chemotherapy-only preparative regimens  (

        <p>
         However, an increased risk of second malignancies with TBI in this setting has not been confirmed and data are conflicting.

         Autologous HCT has been performed in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Approximately 24 hours after completion of the preparative chemotherapy, peripheral blood progenitor cells are reinfused. A period of pancytopenia follows. Red blood cell and platelet transfusions are administered as necessary while hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors (ie, G-CSF) are used to speed neutrophil engraftment. Neutrophil engraftment usually occurs by day 12 and platelet counts are expected to recover to greater than 20,000 by day 16 [

          24

Rituximab resistance is assumed if a patient has relapse or progression of FL while on or within six months of receiving an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, either as a single agent or in combination. Rituximab maintenance is not expected to benefit patients with rituximab resistance.

        <p>
         Even though maintenance therapy is designed to have a low toxicity profile, a decision regarding the use of maintenance therapy in an individual patient must take into consideration both the potential benefit from attaining a deeper response and the likelihood that this patient will tolerate the prolonged therapy.

          Indications

         – The use of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in follicular lymphoma (FL) is controversial. HCT should be performed as part of a clinical trial whenever possible.

         High dose chemotherapy and autologous HCT (rescue) is generally reserved for patients with relapsed or refractory FL  (

          Eligibility
         </strong>
         – To be eligible for autologous HCT, the patient must have normal cardiac, liver, and renal function, and have a good performance status. In general, age is not considered to be a strict exclusion criterion. (See

         The decision of whether to proceed with autologous HCT should be based on the patient's preference, condition, and the expected disease course. For the latter, there is no definitive score or metric. Among patients with relapsed FL, we consider autologous HCT for patients with early treatment failure (eg, progression within 24 months of immunochemotherapy or within 12 months of single-agent

Maintenance rituximab improves progression-free survival. Toxicities are increased and the effect on overall survival is not clear. (See
