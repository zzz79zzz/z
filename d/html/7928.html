Recognition is often delayed because nonspecific symptoms are attributed to the patient's underlying diagnosis or another condition such as infection.</p><p>Unlike GVHD associated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), in TA-GVHD the lymphocytes from the transfusion attack the recipient's bone marrow, leading to bone marrow aplasia and profound pancytopenia, which is typically the cause of death. There are no highly effective treatments, so prevention is essential. This can be accomplished very effectively by treatment of the blood component to inactivate viable lymphocytes prior to transfusion.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the pathogenesis, presentation, diagnosis, management, and prevention of TA-GVHD.

Most commonly, HLA class II antigens are involved, although a case report has been published describing TA-GVHD in which a T cell clone against an HLA class I antigen was found [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Immune attack is mediated by the transfusion donor's T cells, either through direct destruction of host cells or via inflammatory cytokines that activate other immune cells including natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and other lymphocytes [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p>Viable lymphocytes are present in most blood components including whole blood, red blood cells (RBCs), platelets, and plasma that has never been frozen. Normally, lymphocytes present in the transfused component would be destroyed by the recipient's immune system before they can mount an immune response against the recipient. In TA-GVHD, the recipient's immune system either does not recognize the donor lymphocytes as foreign or is unable to mount an effective immune destruction.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The recipient may not recognize the donor lymphocytes as foreign if there is partial HLA matching, which is most common in ethnically homogeneous populations, such as Japan, or with directed (family member) donations. (See <a class="local">'Partial HLA matching'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The recipient's immune system may not mount an effective response against the donor lymphocytes if there is a deficiency in cell-mediated immunity, which can be due to an inherited or acquired immune deficiency state. (See <a class="local">'Immunodeficiency'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>The attack of recipient tissues affects all tissues that express HLA class II. These cells include the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), intestinal epithelium, and skin. As a result, the recipient develops profound pancytopenia from bone marrow aplasia as well as gastrointestinal effects (diarrhea, abdominal pain) and skin changes (generalized erythroderma that can progress to desquamation). (See <a class="local">'Host tissues targeted by donor lymphocytes'</a> below.)</p><p>The lethality of TA-GVHD is due to the bone marrow aplasia, which generally cannot be rescued by autologous or allogeneic HSCs due to lack of immediate availability of these HSC sources. In GVHD associated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), the donor T cells and donor HSCs come from the same individual and are thus compatible. (See <a class="local">'Treatment'</a> below and <a class="local">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Appropriate use of preventive strategies (blood product irradiation, pathogen inactivation, or other processes that inactivate lymphocytes) for at-risk transfusion recipients has reduced the incidence of TA-GVHD. (See <a class="local">'Prevention'</a> below.) </p><p>A case of mild TA-GVHD was reported in an individual who received a transfusion shortly after the birth of twins, and genotyping documented that the T lymphocytes were fetally derived [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See <a class="local">'"Mild" TA-GVHD'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1593201426"><span class="h2">Risk factors</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1338884455"><span class="h3">Immunodeficiency</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Immunodeficiency states can impair the ability of the transfusion recipient's immune system to destroy donor lymphocytes present in the transfused blood component. This includes hereditary and acquired immunodeficiency states associated with the following underlying conditions [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Primary immunodeficiency</strong> – A report from 1965 described two children with immunodeficiency who developed vaccinia infections following smallpox vaccination and whose treatment included transfusions (one of leukocyte-rich plasma and one of whole blood); both developed erythroderma, hepatomegaly, and pancytopenia, and both died [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Cases of TA-GVHD in individuals with various primary immunodeficiency syndromes have subsequently been described [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome are commonly represented in case series.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hematologic malignancy</strong> – Cases of TA-GVHD have been reported in individuals with Hodgkin disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and acute myeloid and acute lymphoid leukemias (AML and ALL). Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8452" href="/d/drug information/8452.html" rel="external">fludarabine</a> have also developed TA-GVHD. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4716.html" rel="external">"Classification of hematopoietic neoplasms"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Immunosuppressive drugs</strong> – Commonly used immunosuppressive drugs such as glucocorticoids and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> have not been associated with TA-GVHD. However, drugs that cause profound lymphocyte suppression such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8452" href="/d/drug information/8452.html" rel="external">fludarabine</a> have been implicated, both in individuals with hematologic malignancy as well as non-malignant conditions (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]) [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)</strong> – Allo-HSCT carries a risk of acute or chronic GVHD from the donor hematopoietic cells, but patients undergoing HSCT also receive cytotoxic therapy and numerous transfusions, which may include HLA-matched products. Thus, these individuals could potentially be at risk for TA-GVHD as well. One case report described TA-GVHD in four individuals who underwent autologous HSCT for solid tumors [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fetuses and neonates</strong> – Several case reports have described TA-GVHD in fetuses receiving intrauterine transfusions or exchange transfusions [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Only rare case reports have described TA-GVHD in preterm infants or neonates, and these may be explained by partial HLA matching, as they either occurred in Japan or in the setting of a transfusion from a related donor [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. There does not appear to be an increased risk in healthy, full-term infants.</p><p></p><p>In the largest case series, which included 348 cases of TA-GVHD, 19 percent had a hematologic malignancy and 7 percent had a congenital immunodeficiency [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>TA-GVHD has not been described in individuals with HIV infection or AIDS. Several explanations have been proposed, including the possibility that the lymphocytes in the transfused product become infected by HIV, the use of irradiated blood products in this population is already high, the diagnosis is missed, or these individuals have an intact CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response, which is critical for preventing TA-GVHD [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3814421150"><span class="h3">Partial HLA matching</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Partial human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching refers to a situation in which the transfusion recipient and the blood product donor share some but not all HLA antigens (haplotypes). </p><p>In TA-GVHD, the mismatch occurs in such a way that the recipient's immune system fails to identify donor T cells as foreign, and thus does not mount an immune response against them, but the donor T cells do recognize the recipient's tissues as foreign. This type of mismatch occurs when the transfusion recipient is heterozygous for an HLA haplotype for which the donor is homozygous, as illustrated in the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef121999" href="/d/graphic/121999.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). </p><p>In contrast, if the donor and recipient are perfectly HLA-matched (eg, identical twins), there is no recognition of HLA disparity or immune attack by recipient or donor lymphocytes.</p><p>A 2015 systematic review that included 348 cases of TA-GVHD identified between 1966 and 2013 found that in 84 individuals for whom HLA data were available, partial HLA matching was present in 60 (71 percent) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The frequency of partial HLA matching was higher than expected in those with an immunocompromised state, and partial HLA matching was seen in virtually all of those who were immunocompetent. The authors concluded that partial HLA matching appears to play an important role in the development of TA-GVHD in recipients with all levels of immune function, though possibly to a greater degree in those without impaired immunity.</p><p>The two most common settings in which partial HLA matching occurs is in ethnically homogenous populations, especially in Japan, and from related donors.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Genetically homogeneous populations</strong> – Genetically homogenous populations include island countries such as Japan as well as those in which there is a high rate of consanguineous marriage.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Japan</strong> – Cases of "postoperative erythroderma" have been described in Japanese literature since 1955; these were originally attributed to infection but were subsequently proposed to be TA-GVHD due to partial HLA matching [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. In a survey that included 122 cases of TA-GVHD in Japan, the most common underlying condition for which transfusion was administered was cardiovascular surgery (56 cases [46 percent]), followed by solid tumors in 32 percent [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. It has been estimated that the frequency with which blood from an individual homozygous for an HLA haplotype is transfused into a recipient heterozygous for that haplotype is approximately 1 in 659 in Japan compared with 1 in 500 to 1 in 7174 in the United States and 1 in 16,835 in France [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Because of this increased risk, blood products in Japan are routinely irradiated prior to transfusion, even for immunocompetent recipients. (See <a class="local">'Gamma irradiation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Consanguineous marriage</strong> – Consanguineous marriage increases the chance that certain HLA antigens will be highly prevalent in a population [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Directed donations</strong> – Directed donations are those in which one individual donates a blood product specifically for transfusion to another individual. This may be useful in selected cases in which the recipient has a rare blood type or a rare HLA type. However, when the donor and recipient are related as first- or second-degree relatives, they have a much higher chance of sharing some HLA antigens than would occur with a random donor, which puts them at increased risk for TA-GVHD [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In the largest case series, which included 348 cases of TA-GVHD, 14 percent were recipients of a blood component from a related donor [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2977086484"><span class="h2">Implicated blood products</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In principle, any blood product containing viable T-lymphocytes can cause TA-GVHD in an at-risk individual. This includes:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Whole blood</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Red blood cells (RBCs)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Platelets</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Plasma that has not been frozen</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Granulocytes</p><p></p><p>In the largest case series involving 348 cases, the implicated component was RBCs in 38 percent, whole blood in 26 percent, platelets in 6 percent, and plasma in one case [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. In the remaining cases, the component was not identified or multiple components were transfused. Granulocyte transfusions are rare and were not evaluated in this study. </p><p>While leukocyte reduction is not sufficient to prevent TA-GVHD, risk is highest with products that have not been leukocyte depleted [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Also, lymphocyte viability may decline over time during storage. In an analysis of the storage time in 158 cases of implicated components, the component was ≤10 days old in 148 (94 percent) and 11 to 14 days in the remaining 10 [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. No implicated components were stored for &gt;14 days. However, leukocyte reduction is not sufficient to prevent TA-GVHD.</p><p>Studies in animals suggest that the dose of lymphocytes correlates with the risk of TA-GVHD, with approximately 10<sup>7</sup> lymphocytes per kg of recipient weight required to produce disease in a susceptible host [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Data for humans are lacking, but there are likely sufficient lymphocytes in most blood products, including those that are leukoreduced, to lead to TA-GVHD. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3685072319"><span class="h2">Host tissues targeted by donor lymphocytes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Donor lymphocytes can attack any tissue in the recipient that expresses HLA class II. Typically affected tissues and the resulting findings include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hematopoietic cells – Pancytopenia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intestinal epithelium – Diarrhea</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Liver – Hepatomegaly and abnormal liver function tests</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Skin – Erythroderma or macular rash</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4071133665"><span class="h2">Mechanism of preventive procedures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Irradiation effectively renders dividing cells non-viable because it introduces significant damage to DNA and RNA, preventing cell proliferation and transcription, respectively. Thus, any product that has been properly irradiated prior to transfusion will not cause TA-GVHD. (See <a class="local">'Gamma irradiation'</a> below.)</p><p>As discussed below, certain pathogen inactivation (PI) procedures that are used prior to transfusion, or the freeze-thaw process, can also inactivate lymphocytes and serve as effective prevention for TA-GVHD [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Products that have been subjected to these procedures have not been implicated in TA-GVHD. (See <a class="local">'Pathogen inactivation techniques'</a> below and <a class="local">'Freeze-thaw'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1757781420"><span class="h1">INCIDENCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>TA-GVHD is an extremely rare transfusion complication. The true incidence is not known and is expected to vary by population and preventive strategies used. (See <a class="local">'Prevention'</a> below.)</p><p>In the 1980s, the overall incidence was estimated at 0.1 to 1 percent among at-risk individuals (see <a class="local">'Risk factors'</a> above), although this number has decreased considerably with greater recognition of risk factors and institution of preventive strategies [<a href="#rid18">18,20</a>]. As an example, the incidence was approximately 0.15 percent in Japan between 1981 and 1986, whereas there were no cases reported in Japan during 2000 or 2001 [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>In the largest series of cases, the countries with the most cases of TA-GVHD were Japan (146 cases), the United States (50 cases), and the United Kingdom (36 cases) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Smaller numbers (&lt;20 cases) were reported from Turkey, Lebanon, Germany, and India. Other countries reported fewer than 7 cases. More cases were reported in males.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2865925573"><span class="h1">PREVENTION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3544840868"><span class="h2">Overview of prevention</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Since TA-GVHD is highly preventable and very hard to treat, prevention is of primary importance. Prevention is best achieved by irradiating (or otherwise inactivating) lymphocytes in any blood components transfused to at-risk recipients. Leukodepletion may provide some protection but it is not sufficient to eliminate all viable lymphocytes. (See <a class="local">'Methods to inactivate viable T cells'</a> below.)</p><p>There are two approaches to the use of lymphocyte inactivation procedures:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Selective irradiation</strong> – Identifying at-risk individuals  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119039" href="/d/graphic/119039.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and ensuring that products they receive are properly treated is reasonable in populations in which the baseline risk of TA-GVHD is low.

In some cases, the recommendation to use a lymphocyte inactivation procedure lasts indefinitely (eg, Hodgkin lymphoma, congenital primary immunodeficiency syndrome). In others, there may be a time-limited recommendation (eg, for three months after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT] or for six months if total body irradiation was used; for as long as GVHD from the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells [HSCs] is present after allogeneic HSCT). The 2020 Guideline also provides information about newer immunosuppressive therapies including selected monoclonal antibodies (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8725" href="/d/drug information/8725.html" rel="external">alemtuzumab</a>) and newer patient populations (eg, CAR-T recipients, individuals with congenital hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [HLH]) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p>Neonates receiving exchange transfusions are included as at-risk in the 2020 Guidelines, whereas a general neonatal population is no longer included [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. However, some institutions continue to include all neonates as an at-risk population; institutions in the United States (US) generally consider very low birth weight infants and other neonates to be at risk [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Some health systems irradiate all blood components for children &lt;6 years old due to the rare possibility of potentially undiagnosed immunodeficiency states at these ages.</p><p>In the United States, every hospital transfusion service establishes its own policy as to which groups of patients should receive irradiated blood components [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. A 2014 survey of practices at approximately 2100 United States institutions performed by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) revealed substantial differences in which diagnoses were associated with the use of irradiated units [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Some institutions perform universal irradiation of all transfused cellular components, "block" irradiation for all patients on a given service or section of the hospital, or for all very young patients due to possible undiagnosed immunodeficiency.</p><p>Avoiding directed donations in populations at risk for partial human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching is also reasonable, especially if universal irradiation is not being used.

A 2020 BSH Guideline states that the minimum dose should be 25 Gy, and no portion of the product should be exposed to more than 50 Gy [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. This dose should result in effective lymphocyte inactivation, including a five to six log reduction in T cell response to mitogen, and complete inhibition of the mixed lymphocyte culture response.</p><p>Either a cesium-137 or cobalt-60 source can be used as a gamma source. The latter is usually present in radiation therapy departments and is less suited for irradiation of blood components. Thus, cesium-137 is the preferred source and is most often found in specifically designed, self-contained blood product irradiators. Due to bioterrorism concerns, the United States government is encouraging institutions to move to an X-ray source, which has similar impact on RBC membranes and potassium leakage as gamma irradiation [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. According to the 2020 BSH guideline, either gamma irradiation or x-irradiation is acceptable [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].

Data from preclinical testing suggest that PI techniques are at least as effective, and possibly more effective, than gamma irradiation in preventing TA-GVHD [<a href="#rid3">3,28,29</a>]. Data using this approach in humans are more limited than for gamma irradiation [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p>PI techniques are primarily used for plasma and platelets, but methods for inactivating pathogens in RBCs are also under development, and pathogen-reduced RBCs are available in some countries. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7929.html" rel="external">"Pathogen inactivation of blood products"</a>.)</p><p>Certain PI procedures can inactivate nucleated cells in much the same way that they inactivate pathogens. There are two methods by which PI procedures work, damaging nucleic acids or damaging cell membranes. Only the PI procedures that damage nucleic acids would be expected to prevent TA-GVHD; examples include amotosalen with UVA light (used for platelets and plasma), riboflavin with UV light (used for platelets and RBCs), or amustaline with glutathione (used for RBCs).</p><p>Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) can be damaged (adducts created and interstrand crosslinks formed) using a number of intercalating agents and ultraviolet (UV) light exposure. In principle, these types of methods can be used to inactivate lymphocytes as well, and they can be used with any blood product that does not require viable nucleated cells (ie, these types of methods can be used for RBCs, plasma, or platelets).</p><p>Due to the rarity of TA-GVHD, the efficacy of PI techniques for prevention have not been compared with gamma irradiation in a clinical trial. However, cell culture and mouse model studies show excellent efficacy in inactivating lymphocytes, perhaps greater than irradiation. As an example, treatment with the PI agents amotosalen and UVA or riboflavin and UV light resulted in full inhibition of T cell proliferation and cytokine production and the ability to fully prevent the classic findings of TA-GVHD in animals [<a href="#rid30">30,31</a>]. This effect was preserved even when the dose of the PI agents was reduced by several thousand-fold. In contrast, a reduced dose of radiation by only one-fifth resulted in failure to inactivate lymphocytes.</p><p>Institutions that routinely use pathogen-reduced platelets for all recipients are no longer treating these platelets with gamma irradiation, and no cases of TA-GVHD have been reported with this approach.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3946479906"><span class="h3">Freeze-thaw</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As noted above, the freeze-thaw process appears to be effective in inactivating lymphocytes, and TA-GVHD has not been reported with Cryoprecipitate, plasma that has been frozen (eg, Fresh Frozen Plasma [FFP], thawed plasma, Plasma Frozen Within 24 hours After Phlebotomy [PF24]) or RBCs that have been frozen (eg, frozen, deglycerolized RBCs). Thus, these products are not considered to confer an increased risk for TA-GVHD. However, freezing and thawing of RBCs is expensive, time consuming, and requires addition of an agent such as glycerol to prevent lysis of the cells. Thus, it is not an appropriate approach for prevention on a large scale.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1107616507"><span class="h3">Leukoreduction (not sufficient as an alternative)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Leukoreduction involves passing the blood product through a filter with a pore size small enough to prevent passage of white blood cells (WBCs); it is almost always done at the time of blood collection but can also be done at the bedside.

These may cause allergic reactions, non-allergic skin eruptions, or a severe syndrome of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Like TA-GVHD, drug reactions can cause fever, rash, pancytopenia, and abnormal liver function tests that are temporally separated from the transfusion. Unlike TA-GVHD, these drug reactions often have a temporal relationship to drug administration, and skin biopsy will show typical findings of the drug reaction rather than TA-GVHD.

Other non-infectious causes of liver failure include autoimmune and metabolic conditions. Like TA-GVHD, liver function may be severely impaired. Unlike TA-GVHD, patients with liver failure often do not have rash or pancytopenia; skin biopsy or liver biopsy will show typical findings of the specific disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3574.html" rel="external">"Acute liver failure in adults: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16142.html" rel="external">"Acute liver failure in children: Etiology and evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Underlying illness</strong> – The illness leading to the original indication for transfusion may include aplastic anemia, a hematologic malignancy, or an immunodeficiency syndrome. Some patients may also receive cytotoxic chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Like TA-GVHD, these conditions may be associated with pancytopenia and systemic illness. Unlike TA-GVHD, these conditions typically precede transfusions, whereas in TA-GVHD the transfusions precede the development of fever, rash, and pancytopenia. In addition, the underlying illness or malignancy will not cause typical findings of TA-GVHD on skin biopsy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>GVHD associated with allogeneic HSCT</strong> – GVHD associated with allogeneic HSCT may also cause fever, rash, diarrhea, and liver failure. Unlike TA-GVHD, GVHD from allogeneic HSCT does not typically cause bone marrow failure.

Like TA-GVHD, patients with HLH or MAS can be acutely ill with fever, rash, liver failure, and pancytopenia. Unlike TA-GVHD, HLH/MAS often are associated with other laboratory findings (eg, very high ferritin, coagulation abnormalities, hypertriglyceridemia), neurologic findings, and hemophagocytosis on bone marrow examination. Patients with HLH would not be expected to have either typical TA-GVHD skin (or organ) biopsy results or demonstrable microchimerism. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/87499.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h1">TREATMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is no effective treatment for TA-GVHD other than hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and HSCT is rarely a viable option because there is usually insufficient time to identify an appropriate donor, test them for suitability to donate, and obtain sufficient hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) for transplant. In some cases, immunosuppressive therapy has been effective in attenuating the course of the disease.</p><p>As soon as a diagnosis of TA-GVHD is confirmed (or strongly suspected), management should be guided, either directly or in close consultation, by an individual with experience in managing patients undergoing HSCT with GVHD. Early recognition may allow more time to institute supportive or immunosuppressive therapies, as well as to identify a potential hematopoietic stem cell donor.</p><p>There are no prospective trials or studies comparing different interventions for treatment. A systematic review from 2015 identified 348 cases of TA-GVHD and evaluated therapies used in the small number of individuals who survived as well as the large number of individuals (92 percent) who died [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. HSCT and immunosuppression were associated with slight increases in survival, as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation</strong> – HSCT could potentially provide a new source of HSCs that could repopulate the bone marrow and provide immune cells capable of destroying the T-lymphocytes responsible for TA-GVHD. Of the 29 (8 percent) from the systematic review who survived, 3 (10 percent of the survivors) were treated with HSCT [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. One of these was a person with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who developed TA-GVHD 10 days following transfusion of non-irradiated blood components [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. By coincidence, she had cryopreserved autologous peripheral blood stem cells available from a prior autologous HSCT.

The likelihood of surviving was higher in younger patients, those who received a leukoreduced product, and those whose product had a longer storage duration. These latter two features may be surrogates for a lower dose of donor T-lymphocytes. Survivors were more likely to have an underlying indication for irradiation and to have been treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Survival more than doubled from the pre-2000 era to the post-2000 era (from 8.2 to 19.7 percent), suggesting improvements in supportive care and perhaps greater access to HSCT.</p><p>Milder cases of TA-GVHD in which the condition resolves and the patient survives may go unrecognized and/or unreported.

Failure to recognize donor lymphocytes as foreign can occur when there is partial human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef121999" href="/d/graphic/121999.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Viable donor lymphocytes from the transfusion attack the recipient's skin, gastrointestinal tract, and hematopoietic system. (See <a class="local">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Epidemiology</strong> – TA-GVHD is extremely rare. The true incidence is not known and is expected to vary by population and preventive strategies. In the 1980s, the overall incidence was estimated at 0.1 to 1 percent among at-risk individuals (see <a class="local">'Risk factors'</a> above). Since then, this number has decreased considerably. At-risk individuals include those in a genetically homogenous population and those who receive directed donations from family members, as well as immunosuppressed individuals, including those with primary immunodeficiency syndromes and hematologic malignancies. (See <a class="local">'Incidence'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prevention </strong>– Since TA-GVHD is highly preventable and very hard to treat, prevention is of primary importance. Prevention is best achieved by irradiating (or otherwise inactivating) lymphocytes in blood products for all at-risk individuals  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119039" href="/d/graphic/119039.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Irradiation is done using a gamma or X-ray source in the blood bank. Pathogen inactivation techniques that damage nucleic acids are also effective in preventing TA-GVHD, perhaps more so than irradiation; pathogen inactivation is more common than irradiation for platelet products. Freezing and thawing typically prevents TA-GVHD but is not done expressly for this purpose. Leukodepletion may provide some protection, but leukodepletion is <strong>not</strong> sufficient to eliminate all viable lymphocytes or to prevent GVHD. (See <a class="local">'Prevention'</a> above and <a class="local">'Pathogen inactivation techniques'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Time course and presentation</strong> – TA-GVHD typically occurs within 2 to 30 days after transfusion. Typical findings include rash  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72825" href="/d/graphic/72825.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66097" href="/d/graphic/66097.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>), transaminase elevation, and pancytopenia. Affected individuals may also develop severe diarrhea, fever, and/or hepatomegaly. A milder form of the disease has also been reported. (See <a class="local">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – Recognition of TA-GVHD is often delayed, as patients are often ill from other conditions that led to transfusion in the first place. TA-GVHD is rare, and other diagnoses are considered first. It is important to maintain a high level of suspicion in any individual who develops fever, rash, gastrointestinal symptoms, or cytopenias following transfusion. The initial evaluation focuses on identifying other explanations for these findings such as infection, drug reaction, liver disease, malignancy, or other immune conditions (eg, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [HLH]) and in determining the bone marrow cellularity. Biopsy of affected skin is generally performed; clinical and histologic findings are used to make the diagnosis. Demonstration of white blood cell (WBC) chimerism is considered definitive proof, but this is not always performed. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong> – The differential diagnosis of TA-GVHD includes aplastic anemia, certain infections, drug reactions, malignancies, and HLH. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Separate topic reviews discuss other delayed complications of transfusion and the form of GVHD associated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

Most affected individuals do not have autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) available and do not have sufficient time to identify an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell donor. Immunosuppression is often tried but is rarely effective. (See <a class="local">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prognosis</strong> – Prognosis is poor, with a survival rate in the largest series of 8 percent and a higher rate (nearly 20 percent) in the post-2000 era. Cases of milder disease with higher survival rates have been reported. Survival also appears to be better in younger patients, those who received a leukoreduced product, and those whose product had a longer storage duration.
