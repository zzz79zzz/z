The role of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI; also known as transcatheter aortic valve replacement or TAVR) as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is established, and in 2019, the number of TAVIs exceeded SAVRs in the US for the first time [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. A multidisciplinary team approach is recommended in approaching patients with symptomatic AS. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83110.html" rel="external">"Choice of intervention for severe calcific aortic stenosis"</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review periprocedural management of TAVI [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Post-TAVI antithrombotic therapy, indications for AVR, choice of aortic valve intervention (TAVI versus SAVR), medical therapy for symptomatic AS, and percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty are discussed separately.

The indication for valve intervention (surgical aortic valve replacement [SAVR] or TAVI), and choice of therapy based upon potential risks (including absolute and relative contraindications for either procedure) and benefits of treatment options (including any TAVI access issues), should be discussed at a meeting of a multidisciplinary heart team. This should comprise interventional and noninterventional cardiologists (including imaging specialists) and cardiac surgeons and may include other clinicians with relevant expertise, including critical care, pulmonary specialists, and anesthesiologists [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Potential risk factors such as depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, coronary artery disease, kidney disease, prior stroke, and respiratory disorders should be considered. Potential TAVI access issues and likely delivery approach should be discussed since the access route may impact the risk-benefit analysis of treatment options. These issues are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8154.html" rel="external">"Indications for valve replacement for high gradient aortic stenosis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83110.html" rel="external">"Choice of intervention for severe calcific aortic stenosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H545195093"><span class="h2">Preprocedural management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Preprocedural management includes selection of the optimal clinical setting for the procedure, and preprocedural assessment.</p><p>The choice of the optimal clinical setting for the procedure is based upon regional clinical expertise and experience, as well as patient access. An inverse relationship between hospital TAVI procedural volume and mortality has been observed [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In an analysis of data from the Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry on 96,256 transfemoral TAVI procedures during 2015 to 2017 at 554 hospitals, adjusted 30-day mortality was higher and more variable in hospitals in the lowest volume quartile (mean annualized volume of 27 procedures; mortality 3.19 percent; 95% CI 2.78-3.67) than at hospitals in the highest volume quartile (mean annualized volume of 143 procedures, mortality 2.66 percent, 95% CI 2.48-2.85; odds ratio [OR] 1.21, 95% CI 1.03-1.41). An analysis of 8644 nontransfemoral TAVI cases at 486 sites also revealed an inverse relationship between volume of TAVI procedures and mortality with adjusted 30-day mortality of 10.13 percent in the lowest-volume quartile and 6.40 percent in the highest volume quartile (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.20-2.27).</p><p>Preprocedural testing should include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Routine blood tests (including complete blood count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An electrocardiogram.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Resting echocardiography (transthoracic and, in some cases, transesophageal).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If low gradient AS is suspected, low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9380" href="/z/d/drug information/9380.html" rel="external">dobutamine</a> stress echocardiography and/or computed tomography may also be indicated, as discussed separately.

A pulmonary artery catheter is seldom used during the procedure. Transesophageal echocardiography is commonly performed when general anesthesia is used.</p><p>A temporary pacing lead is commonly placed but use varies widely, and an increasingly common practice is to pace with the preshaped left ventricular TAVI wire.</p><p>Intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8518" href="/z/d/drug information/8518.html" rel="external">unfractionated heparin</a> (weight-adjusted with target activated clotting time between 250 and 300 seconds) is administered after placement of standard sheaths and prior to placement of the large sheath.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4232087102"><span class="h2">Access routes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The transfemoral arterial approach is the most common and most favored method of TAVI delivery, and nearly all (&gt;95 percent) cases can be performed via this route. When transfemoral access is not feasible, choice of alternative access route is based upon patient-specific anatomy and risk factors, operator and institutional practice and experience, and the type of valve delivery system used. Alternative (nontransfemoral) approaches include subclavian/axillary, transaortic, transapical, transcaval, and transcarotid access.</p><p>Preprocedural assessment for TAVI includes assessment of the iliofemoral system and aorta, generally by multidetector computed tomography with optional invasive angiography to detect contraindications to vascular (transfemoral, subclavian, or aortic) access such as plaques with mobile thrombi in the ascending aorta or arch, inadequate vessel size, extensive calcification, or tortuosity. For the transapical approach, severe pulmonary disease, severe left ventricular disease, or other conditions may render the left ventricular apex inaccessible. Extensive ascending aortic calcification is an infrequent contraindication to the direct aortic approach as a soft spot for catheter entry can usually be found.</p><p>When transfemoral access for TAVI is feasible, it is preferred to alternative access since there is greater experience and superior reported outcomes with transfemoral access. Furthermore, the benefits of TAVI over surgery in the PARTNER 2 trial and United States Pivotal Trial were greatest in the transfemoral cohorts. However, it is unclear how much of the excess mortality seen in patients undergoing alternative access TAVI is caused by the alternative access procedure per se and how much is caused by excess risk associated with the burden of peripheral vascular disease, mandating the need for alternative access. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83110.html" rel="external">"Choice of intervention for severe calcific aortic stenosis", section on 'By access site'</a>.)</p><p>Observational studies have found that patients undergoing transcarotid TAVI have lower transfusion rates and shorter lengths of stay compared with patients undergoing transapical or transaortic access [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. A systematic review of observational studies comparing outcomes with transcarotid access versus outcomes with other access types found that 30-day mortality was lower with transcarotid access versus transaortic access (2.6 versus 12.1 percent; relative risk [RR] 2.93, 95% CI 1.15-7.58) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3192089825"><span class="h3">Transfemoral approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The percutaneous retrograde femoral arterial approach via the aortic arch and through the diseased valve is the most common approach to TAVI delivery. The use of the transfemoral approach is favored and indeed feasible in &gt;95 percent of patients in some registries, reflecting smaller sheath sizes in newer generation devices. It is now rare for a transfemoral approach to be excluded due to access vessel size since the two major commercially available valve delivery systems are now 14 to 16 F equivalent. Vessel size of less than 5 mm together with circumferential calcium would represent a contraindication, as well as extreme vessel tortuosity. Peripheral artery imaging (computed tomography and, in some cases, invasive angiography) is performed to determine feasibility and risk of a transfemoral approach, as discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/86447.html" rel="external">"Imaging for transcatheter aortic valve implantation", section on 'Determining eligibility for peripheral vascular access'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with calcific iliofemoral vessels, transfemoral access may be facilitated by peripheral lithotripsy [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>Several types of stent-valve devices with various designs have been successfully implanted using the retrograde femoral approach. The most widely used types are balloon-expandable valves (SAPIEN 3 and SAPIEN 3 Ultra, which have replaced the Cribier-Edwards, SAPIEN, and SAPIEN XT valves) and self-expanding valves (eg, Evolut PRO/PRO-PLUS, ACURATE neo, and Portico) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. The SAPIEN 3 and SAPIEN 3 Ultra valves can also be delivered via the transapical or direct aortic approach as described below. The Evolut PRO/PRO-PLUS can also been delivered in a retrograde fashion from the subclavian/axillary artery [<a href="#rid10">10</a>], the carotid artery, and via direct aortic access via either ministernotomy or right anterior thoracotomy [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>Smaller delivery devices have resulted in an increasing rate of femoral delivery (eg, from approximately 50 percent to approximately 95 percent), as well as lower incidence of vascular complications, with standard use of a percutaneous vascular closure device and a shorter hospital stay. Protamine is routinely administered for heparin reversal after arterial sheath removal. An observational study of 873 patients undergoing TAVI, of whom 677 received protamine, found that protamine administration was associated with reduced rates of life-threatening and major bleeding complications with no increase in the risk of stroke [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3492121821"><span class="h3">Alternative approaches</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients who are not candidates for the transfemoral approach due to unfavorable iliofemoral artery characteristics, the most common current access alternatives are trans-subclavian access, two transthoracic approaches (transaortic retrograde and the transapical antegrade), and the transcarotid approach. The choice between these alternatives will depend upon which valve type is being selected as well as operator and hospital experience.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Trans-subclavian/axillary – The subclavian retrograde approach is performed by either surgical cut-down to the subclavian artery or percutaneous axillary artery access for insertion of the transcatheter heart valve (THV) delivery system.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Transaortic – The transaortic retrograde surgical approach is performed by direct insertion of the THV delivery system into the ascending aorta (eg, aortotomy) using a sheath placed into the aorta via a small median sternotomy or lateral thoracotomy at the second intercostal space.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Transapical – The transapical antegrade approach involves direct left ventricular apical puncture for insertion of the THV delivery system and antegrade aortic valve implantation via a small anterolateral thoracotomy without cardiopulmonary bypass or sternotomy.

While practice varies considerably, this approach encompasses performing the procedure under conscious sedation with local anesthesia, without transesophageal echocardiography, and with selective use of temporary pacing (including using the preshaped left ventricular wire for this purpose). Some operators have moved away from having any anesthesia support and most have dispensed with central venous access. Anesthetic management (including discussion of studies comparing anesthetic approaches) is discussed further separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/102860.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for percutaneous cardiac valve interventions", section on 'Transcatheter aortic valve implantation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2661570506"><span class="h2">Role of cerebral embolic protection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cerebral embolic protection (CEP) systems have been developed to capture or deflect debris released during TAVI to reduce the risk of stroke. However, a clinical benefit from CEP systems has not been established.</p><p>A meta-analysis of seven randomized trials included 2171 patients in the CEP group (using one of four different systems) and 1860 in the control group [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Stroke rates were similar in the groups with and without CEP (odds ratio [OR] 0.84, 95% CI 0.60-1.17) and rates of disabling stroke were also similar (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.24-1.36). Mortality rates were also similar (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.50-2.18).</p><p>In the largest included trial (PROTECTED TAVR), 3000 patients were randomly assigned to CEP (n = 1501) and control (n = 1499) groups [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Stroke within 72 hours after TAVI or before discharge occurred at similar rates in CEP and control groups (2.3 versus 2.9 percent; -0.6 percentage points, 95% CI -1.7 to 0.5). The rate of disabling stroke was lower in the CEP group (0.5 versus 1.3 percent; -0.8 percentage points, 95% CI -1.5 to -0.1). On the basis of this data, the number of patients needed to treat to prevent one disabling stroke would be 125. One patient (0.1 percent) had a major bleeding event at the CEP access site.</p><p>Despite these results, clinicians recognize that debris is captured in a significant proportion of embolic protection filters in cases where it is used and thus may reduce the risk of disabling stroke. On this basis, operators continue to believe that it has a role in selected patients. However, opinions vary as to when it is most appropriate to select CEP, ranging between younger (albeit lower risk) patients where stroke is to be avoided at all cost, and higher-risk patients (eg, bicuspid disease or degenerating xenografts) where stroke might be more commonly expected as a complication. The BHF PROTECT-TAVI Trial (British Heart Foundation Randomised Clinical Trial of Cerebral Embolic Protection in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) is currently randomly assigning over 7000 patients to TAVI either with or without CEP in all UK TAVI centers. This will provide further data on this question, and a prespecified meta-analysis with the recently reported PROTECTED TAVR Trial should provide a definitive answer.</p><p>The risk of stroke after TAVI is discussed further separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/110074.html" rel="external">"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation: Complications", section on 'Stroke and subclinical brain injury'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H152416871"><span class="h2">Implantation procedure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prior to the implantation, the available imaging of the aortic root (including preprocedural computed tomography angiography and echocardiography) should be obtained and displayed for the operators.</p><p>The implantation procedure consists of five phases:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The first is to obtain vascular access for delivery of the valve. (See <a class="local">'Access routes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Second, the operators use the available aortic root imaging to establish a clear coplanar view of the aortic annulus. The standard coplanar view has all three aortic cusps equidistant and aligned. However, for self-expanding valves, there is increasing use of the "cusp overlap" view, which isolates the noncoronary cusp (right and left coronary cusps overlap) and elongates the left ventricular outflow tract. This information is used to guide transcatheter heart valve (THV) size and placement. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/86447.html" rel="external">"Imaging for transcatheter aortic valve implantation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In selected cases, a balloon aortic valvuloplasty is performed prior to delivery of the THV [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].

The range of implantation techniques and methods varies widely as valve design and methods of expansion mandate different delivery approaches, although some principles are universal:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The valve should be correctly positioned in the aortic annulus, extending below the plane of the annulus by between 2 and 5 mm, depending upon the valve design.

Finally, the need for a postdeployment valvuloplasty should be considered to improve frame expansion if this is a concern.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H232515300"><span class="h2">Hemodynamic management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All procedures require early identification and treatment of volume depletion, low cardiac output, and greater than moderate pulmonary hypertension. Measures to avoid prolonged hypotension include maintenance of mean arterial pressure of &gt;75 mmHg prior to initiation of rapid ventricular pacing, with cautious use of intravenous vasopressor (metaraminol, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9709" href="/z/d/drug information/9709.html" rel="external">norepinephrine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/z/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a>, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9768" href="/z/d/drug information/9768.html" rel="external">phenylephrine</a>) therapy as needed while avoiding hypertension.
