Because of the difficulties in assessing well appearance, the clinical practice guideline (CPG) for well-appearing, febrile infants 29 to 60 days with which this topic is in general accord should <strong>not</strong> be applied when clinicians are uncertain as to whether an infant is well appearing [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should be obtained for testing, if not already performed, <strong>prior</strong> to antibiotic administration in these patients whenever possible.

Based upon studies that include febrile infants evaluated prior to widespread use of conjugate vaccines, the range of positive predictive values is wide for clinical features, basic laboratory tests alone, or a combination of the two (3 to 71 percent). More recent evidence indicates that the estimated baseline prevalence for IBI is low (approximately 1 to 2 percent for bacteremia and 0.25 percent for meningitis) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In a multicenter study of over 900 febrile infants, IBI occurred in approximately 3 percent of infants with an elevated C-reactive protein or absolute neutrophil count and in 8 percent of patients with an elevated procalcitonin [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>CSF pleocytosis</strong> – In patients who undergo lumbar puncture, those with CSF pleocytosis require empiric treatment for bacterial meningitis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef130047" href="/z/d/graphic/130047.html" rel="external">table 5</a>) and admission to a hospital with nurses and staff experienced in caring for young infants.

In addition, sterile CSF pleocytosis (usually fewer than 20 cells/microliter), occurs in up to 29 percent of infants with a UTI, which may complicate hospital management and lead to unnecessary and prolonged antibiotic therapy for patients who undergo a lumbar puncture for this indication [<a href="#rid5">5,7,8</a>]. Thus, many experts recommend <strong>not</strong> obtaining CSF in these patients if they are otherwise at low risk and regardless of results of inflammatory markers [<a href="#rid6">6,9-11</a>]. If the provider feels that CSF should be obtained, this should be a shared decision with the family after discussing risks and benefits of the procedure and incorporating their values and preferences.

If the social situation suggests that follow-up within 24 hours is problematic (eg, transportation problems, no phone, inability to assess severity of illness, or other concerns regarding parental adherence), then the infant should be admitted to the hospital for observation.</p><p>Some experts suggest that infants who are followed as outpatients receive empiric treatment with IM <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13136" href="/z/d/drug information/13136.html" rel="external">ceftriaxone</a> (50 mg/kg in a single dose) pending culture results. Observational evidence suggests that the risk of IBI in this population is approximately 0.4 to 1.4 percent [<a href="#rid2">2,12</a>]. Thus, approximately 71 to 250 infants would need to receive empiric antibiotics to prevent delayed treatment of one case of bacteremia or meningitis [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. However, delayed treatment is unlikely with automated blood culture techniques [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>In addition to ensured follow-up within 24 hours, caregivers must understand that worsening respiratory distress, ill appearance, or inability to feed warrant emergency return for medical care. As an example, rapidly progressive <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> pneumonia has been described in infants and children with influenza and should be suspected if other members of the family have had or have <em>S. aureus</em> infection.

However, the increased CSF testing was <strong>not</strong> associated with improved clinical outcomes for infants treated in hospitals with CPGs, and adverse events (including delayed diagnosis of meningitis) were <strong>not</strong> increased in hospitals where fewer lumbar punctures were performed (approximately 3 percent unadjusted adverse events for both groups, adjusted difference 0.3 percent [95% CI -0.2 to 0.9]).
