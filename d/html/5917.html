The cause of ITP remains unknown in most cases, although it can be triggered by a viral or environmental trigger or it may be secondary to an underlying immunologic defect [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. ITP was previously known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura or immune thrombocytopenic purpura. The current term <strong>I</strong>mmune <strong>T</strong>hrombocyto<strong>P</strong>enia preserves the widely-recognized acronym "ITP" and acknowledges the immune-mediated mechanism of the disorder, while allowing that patients may have little or no signs of purpura or bleeding [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>The treatment and prognosis of newly diagnosed and persistent ITP in children will be reviewed here. The management of chronic ITP and the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of ITP are discussed separately.

Secondary causes of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5930.html" rel="external">"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5921.html" rel="external">"Causes of thrombocytopenia in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Primary ITP is categorized into three phases, depending on the duration of the disease course [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Newly diagnosed ITP</strong> – ITP within 3 months from diagnosis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Persistent ITP</strong> – Ongoing ITP between 3 and 12 months from initial diagnosis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chronic ITP</strong> – ITP lasting more than 12 months</p><p></p><p>In this terminology schema, there is no "acute" ITP.

The management of chronic ITP is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/89225.html" rel="external">"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Management of chronic disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">General measures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We suggest the following measures for pediatric patients with ITP:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Activity restriction</strong> – Affected children should be restricted from activities that carry a risk of bleeding from traumatic injury. The emphasis is on prevention of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). There is no standard approach regarding the specific types of activity to restrict, and there is substantial variation in clinical practice. In general, there is arguably a tendency towards excessive restriction rather than too little. These decisions should be individualized and made in collaboration with the patient and family. In our practice, we suggest that children with platelet count &lt;30,000/microL avoid contact and collision sports (eg, football, boxing, lacrosse, and hockey) and also consider restricting other activities that have substantial risk for traumatic injury (eg, baseball, soccer, skiing, or gymnastics) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. For patients who elect to remain active in sports, certain modifications may be warranted (eg, wearing a helmet, avoid "heading" the ball in soccer). Protective helmets reduce but do not eliminate the risk of head injury.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Avoidance of antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications</strong> – Antiplatelet medications (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12829" href="/d/drug information/12829.html" rel="external">aspirin</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13371" href="/d/drug information/13371.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a>, other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) and anticoagulants (eg, heparin, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13270" href="/d/drug information/13270.html" rel="external">enoxaparin</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12886" href="/d/drug information/12886.html" rel="external">warfarin</a>, direct oral anticoagulants) generally should be avoided if the platelet count is very low (ie, &lt;20,000/microL). In our experience, the risk of clinically significant bleeding with ibuprofen is low. Nevertheless, because of the potential for severe bleeding with its use, we advise avoiding ibuprofen unless it is truly necessary.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If these medications are necessary, pharmacologic treatment of the ITP may be warranted to increase the platelet count to a safe level (eg, for patients requiring ongoing anticoagulant therapy, the platelet count usually is kept &gt;50,000/microL ). (See <a class="local">'Moderate to high bleeding risk'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For children with ITP who require antipyretic or analgesic therapy, we suggest starting with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13028" href="/d/drug information/13028.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a>. If the child does not have adequate symptom relief with acetaminophen, other agents can be tried such as a cyclooxygenase-2 selective NSAID (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12999" href="/d/drug information/12999.html" rel="external">celecoxib</a>) since these agents have less antiplatelet activity compared with <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13371" href="/d/drug information/13371.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a> and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12829" href="/d/drug information/12829.html" rel="external">aspirin</a>. However, ibuprofen is rarely dangerous if the child does not have active bleeding. Other measures for pain not adequately controlled with acetaminophen include nonpharmacologic measures and/or opioids, if appropriate. These are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6254.html" rel="external">"Pain in children: Approach to pain assessment and overview of management principles", section on 'Nonpharmacologic interventions'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6254.html" rel="external">"Pain in children: Approach to pain assessment and overview of management principles", section on 'Opioids'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Monitoring</strong> – All patients should have ongoing monitoring for development of bleeding symptoms and regular measurements of platelet count, the frequency of which depends on the degree of thrombocytopenia, bleeding symptoms, and other risk factors. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Control of menses</strong> – For postmenarchal female patients, hormonal therapy may be warranted to control or inhibit menses and prevent severe menorrhagia. Antifibrinolytics may also be of use. These therapies are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/117.html" rel="external">"Abnormal uterine bleeding in adolescents: Management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/89225.html" rel="external">"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Management of chronic disease", section on 'Adjunctive therapies'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Control of epistaxis</strong> – Measures for nose bleeding include keeping the nasal mucosa moist (eg, with a humidifier or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12796" href="/d/drug information/12796.html" rel="external">saline</a> nose spray), discouraging nose picking, and use of antiallergy remedies (if allergic rhinitis is thought to be contributing). Antifibrinolytics may be needed if bleeding is severe. These therapies are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/89225.html" rel="external">"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Management of chronic disease", section on 'Adjunctive therapies'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6484.html" rel="external">"Management of epistaxis in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Education</strong> – Educating the child and caregivers about the risks of ITP is an important aspect of management. In addition to reviewing activity and medication management, as discussed above, the clinician should inform patients and caregivers at the time of diagnosis about symptoms of severe bleeding (eg, severe headache, hematuria, melena, heavy menstrual bleeding) and they should be instructed to consult their clinician if bleeding occurs.

The degree of thrombocytopenia, other risk factors, impact of the ITP on quality of life, and values and preferences of the family are also important considerations  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115184" href="/d/graphic/115184.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Most patients with newly diagnosed ITP have mild or no bleeding symptoms. Such patients can generally be managed with "watchful waiting" in the ambulatory setting, provided that the child is discharged to a reliable caregiver and follow-up is ensured. Children with more significant bleeding symptoms may warrant pharmacologic intervention [<a href="#rid2">2,4-6</a>].</p><p>The management approach described in the following sections is based upon the available evidence, expert opinion, and usual practice. Many of these considerations are reflected in an international consensus report and guidelines published by the American Society of Hematology [<a href="#rid2">2,6</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Society guideline links'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1091048630"><span class="h3">Life-threatening bleeding</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Fortunately, life-threatening bleeding is rare in childhood ITP; ICH occurs in &lt;1 percent of children with ITP. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5930.html" rel="external">"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Intracranial hemorrhage'</a>.)</p><p>If life-threatening hemorrhage occurs (eg, ICH, major trauma, gastrointestinal bleeding with hemodynamic instability, pulmonary hemorrhage with cardiopulmonary compromise), immediate intervention is required. We recommend a combination of <strong>all</strong> of the following therapies [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Platelet transfusions – Platelet transfusions (as a bolus dose of 10 to 30 mL/kg, generally followed by a continuous infusion). Platelet count should be assessed immediately following the bolus (ie, 15 minutes after). Frequent testing thereafter is important to ensure that the patient maintains a hemostatic platelet count and to guide additional therapy. Patients with ITP generally require larger-than-normal doses of platelets in transfusion due to rapid destruction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7918.html" rel="external">"Platelet transfusion: Indications, ordering, and associated risks"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12601" href="/d/drug information/12601.html" rel="external">Methylprednisolone</a> – Methylprednisolone is given at a dose of 30 mg/kg per day (up to 1 g) intravenously (IV) for three to four days. (See <a class="local">'Glucocorticoids'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intravenous <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) – IVIG is given at a dose of 1 g/kg per day for one to three days (see <a class="local">'Intravenous immune globulin'</a> below).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12762" href="/d/drug information/12762.html" rel="external">Anti-D immune globulin</a> (anti-D) can be added to the regimen in Rh-positive, direct antiglobulin test (DAT)-negative patients; however, the additional benefit of this agent in this setting is uncertain. IV anti-D is administered at a dose of 75 micrograms/kg as a single dose. IV anti-D can be a useful part of combination therapy, even in splenectomized patients despite its relative lack of efficacy when used as the sole agent in these patients [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Anti-D should not be given if the patient's DAT status is unknown, which is often the case in emergency situations. However, DAT testing is usually resulted quickly, so once the DAT status is confirmed to be negative and the blood type Rh+, IV anti-D can be given at the end of the <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> infusion. (See <a class="local">'Anti-D immune globulin'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>In addition, we often administer a high dose of a thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA). We usually use subcutaneous <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="120812" href="/d/drug information/120812.html" rel="external">romiplostim</a> in this setting since the acutely ill patient may not tolerate oral medications. The appropriate dose of romiplostim in this setting is undefined; we typically use the highest dose (ie, 10 mcg/kg). The TPO-RA agent has little impact on the acute bleeding event (there typically is a five- to seven-day delay before a response is seen); however, it may boost and prolong the platelet response in the days following the bleeding event, which may reduce the risk of rebleeding. This practice is not standardized, and other experts may chose not to use romiplostim in this setting. Additional details about TPO-RAs are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/89225.html" rel="external">"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Management of chronic disease", section on 'Thrombopoietin receptor agonists'</a>.)</p><p>Combination treatment is more effective in immediately raising the platelet count than single-agent therapy [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. A more limited version of these four treatments may be used if there is a risk of such an event (eg, head trauma without evidence of ICH; unexplained headache; or gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or gynecologic bleeding that is heavy) but not such as to create a risk of immediate loss of life. (See <a class="local">'Severe, non-life-threatening bleeding'</a> below.)</p><p>Additional interventions that have been used in patients with life-threatening bleeding but for which supporting evidence is limited include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12916" href="/d/drug information/12916.html" rel="external">Recombinant human factor VIIa</a>.

Splenectomy may be challenging to perform in patients with active hemorrhage, who are inherently unstable, and should be performed by an experienced surgeon.

This is particularly relevant for patients with very low platelet counts (ie, &lt;10,000). For children with substantially impaired quality of life due to symptoms (especially fatigue), anxiety about bleeding risks, or for whom restriction of activity would be especially burdensome, pharmacologic therapy may be a reasonable option (after discussing with the patient and/or caregivers and carefully weighing the potential risks and benefits). Potential but unproven benefits of this approach include relaxing restrictions on activity, improving quality of life, and preventing sequelae from bleeding; however, these must be weighed against the risks of side effects from ITP medications.

Ideally, treatment is initiated two to three days prior to surgery to optimize the hemostatic effect. For emergency procedures, platelet transfusions are often required in addition to pharmacologic therapy. Depending upon the patient's past history of treatment, a TPO-RA may be a useful adjuvant in this setting if it is important to maintain a higher platelet count for a period of time postoperatively. These agents may require a longer "run in" to find the optimal dose for the patient without overshooting.

Thus, if possible, the preferred approach is to provide pharmacologic treatment preoperatively to increase the patient's own platelet count.

Hospitalized patients typically require more frequent monitoring (daily initially). The interval between testing can be gradually increased as the clinical picture stabilizes and the patient/family become more comfortable with the diagnosis. When recovery of platelet counts is detected, the interval between visits may be further lengthened, but monitoring should continue until the platelet count has returned to normal (&gt;150,000/microL) and is stable without treatment.

The risk of adverse reactions generally correlates with the dose of IVIG and the rate of infusion. Adverse effects may be lessened by administering IVIG in smaller doses over several days (eg, daily infusions for three to five days rather than one or two days). However, this likely results in a slower platelet rise, and it is more burdensome on the patient and the medical system. Most reactions are mild to moderate, transient, reversible events such as headache, chills, or flushing. Potentially serious reactions (which may include anaphylaxis, transfusion reactions, aseptic meningitis, thromboembolic events, renal impairment, or severe hemolysis) occur in 2 to 6 percent of patients [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. Headache is the most common side effect (30 to 70 percent, depending on a number of factors including brand) and is often delayed. Other common side effects include fatigue, abdominal pain, and myalgia. In some cases, very severe headaches may occur as a result of aseptic meningitis. Severe headaches and aseptic meningitis appear to be more common in patients with a history of migraine headaches. Additional hydration may help to reduce headaches. Transient neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &lt;1500/microL) develops in up to 30 percent of patients [<a href="#rid48">48</a>], but this effect is very short-lived and clinically unimportant. Adverse effects may be more pronounced in older patients. Adverse effects of IVIG are discussed in greater detail separately.

A meta-analysis of observational studies raised concerns that co-administration of methylprednisolone and IVIG is associated with increased risk of developing chronic ITP, but this finding was likely confounded by other factors [<a href="#rid49">49</a>].

There are many lines of evidence suggesting that the rapid increase in platelet count results from slowing of platelet destruction by inhibition of phagocytosis. Exactly how this occurs is still unknown. One hypothesis is that IVIG inhibits phagocytosis by upregulating the inhibitory IgG Fc receptor IIB (FCGR2B). Studies in ITP in adults with inhibitors of FcRn suggest that this contributes to the IVIG effect by reducing the level of antiplatelet antibodies.

(See <a class="local">'Life-threatening bleeding'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/89225.html" rel="external">"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Management of chronic disease", section on 'Thrombopoietin receptor agonists'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Severe bleeding</strong> – For children with severe mucosal bleeding or suspected internal hemorrhage that requires immediate medical attention but that is not life-threatening (eg, gastrointestinal bleeding without hemodynamic instability, pulmonary hemorrhage without cardiopulmonary compromise, severe prolonged epistaxis, muscle or joint hemorrhage), treatment is similar to that described above for life-threatening bleeding. However, rather than giving all three agents (<a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12601" href="/d/drug information/12601.html" rel="external">methylprednisolone</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">IVIG</a>, and anti-D) for up to four days, a measured approach using only one or two of these agents for fewer days may be sufficient. Platelet transfusion is usually not necessary if bleeding is not life-threatening but may be warranted in patients requiring surgery and those with ongoing hemorrhage. As with life-threatening bleeding, a single dose of a TPO-RA may increase the likelihood of a higher platelet response. (See <a class="local">'Severe, non-life-threatening bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Moderate to high risk for bleeding</strong> – For patients who currently lack severe bleeding symptoms but are deemed to be at moderate to high risk for bleeding complications (based on bleeding symptoms, platelet count, and other risk factors, as outlined in the algorithm and described above  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115184" href="/d/graphic/115184.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>)), we suggest pharmacologic therapy rather than watchful waiting (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). The choice of initial treatment depends on how rapid a response is desired  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115184" href="/d/graphic/115184.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>When a rapid rise in platelet count is desired, we suggest <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> or anti-D (the latter is used only in Rh-positive, DAT-negative, non-splenectomized patients without evidence of hemolysis) (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). IVIG is given as a single dose of 1 g/kg; IV anti-D is given as a single dose of 75 micrograms/kg. In our practice, we also administer a single dose of IV <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12601" href="/d/drug information/12601.html" rel="external">methylprednisolone</a> (30 mg/kg [up to 1 g]) to augment the platelet response and ameliorate the side effects of IVIG or IV anti-D. Others do not treat with concomitant methylprednisolone.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>For patients in whom a rapid rise in platelet count is not necessary, we suggest initial treatment with oral glucocorticoids (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Acceptable regimens include <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12725" href="/d/drug information/12725.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> 2 to 4 mg/kg per day (maximum 120 mg per day) orally for five to seven days or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13214" href="/d/drug information/13214.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a> 0.6 mg/kg per day (maximum 40 mg per day) orally for four days. The preference for these agents in this setting is largely based on cost considerations and ease of administration. IV steroids, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="83878" href="/d/drug information/83878.html" rel="external">IVIG</a>, and anti-D are reasonable alternatives.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Low bleeding risk</strong> – For children with no bleeding or mild bleeding symptoms (ie, cutaneous bleeding only, such as bruising and petechiae) without additional risk factors, we suggest "watchful waiting" rather than pharmacologic intervention (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). This option, in particular, requires extensive discussion with patients and their caregivers. (See <a class="local">'Low bleeding risk'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>General measures</strong> – Management of pediatric patients with ITP includes activity restriction, avoidance of antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications, regular monitoring of platelet count, and monitoring for clinical bleeding. (See <a class="local">'General measures'</a> above and <a class="local">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management of refractory ITP and relapses</strong> – For patients who do not have an adequate response to initial treatment (ie, ongoing moderate or severe bleeding symptoms in the setting of persistent thrombocytopenia), we generally change to another first-line therapy or use a combination of therapies. (See <a class="local">'Poor response to initial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Second-line agents (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12971" href="/d/drug information/12971.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> and TPO-RAs [<a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="108893" href="/d/drug information/108893.html" rel="external">eltrombopag</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="120812" href="/d/drug information/120812.html" rel="external">romiplostim</a>]) have traditionally been reserved for patients with ITP lasting ≥3 to 6 months whose symptoms and risks are not adequately controlled using first-line therapies. However, second-line therapies are increasingly used earlier in the treatment course, particularly in children who have persistent thrombocytopenia and those who remain dependent on glucocorticoid therapy to control symptoms. (See <a class="local">'Second-line therapies'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/89225.html" rel="external">"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in children: Management of chronic disease", section on 'Ongoing management (second-line therapies)'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Many patients experience recurrent severe thrombocytopenia after the therapeutic effects of these medications wane. In our practice, we treat recurrences according to the same indications used for initial treatment. If the patient initially had a robust response and subsequently requires retreatment, we generally use the same agent. However, long-term glucocorticoid use (ie, &gt;1 to 2 months) should be avoided and other options should be pursued in patients requiring prolonged or frequent courses of glucocorticoids. (See <a class="local">'Response to treatment'</a> above and <a class="local">'Relapses'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Disease course</strong> – Most children with ITP recover within three to six months of presentation, with or without treatment. Approximately 10 to 20 percent of affected children go on to have chronic ITP, which is defined as thrombocytopenia for &gt;12 months since presentation. Risk factors for developing chronic ITP include older age, less severe thrombocytopenia at the initial diagnosis, insidious onset of symptoms, and lack of preceding infection or vaccination prior to development of ITP. Early pharmacologic intervention does not appear to reduce the likelihood of developing chronic ITP.
