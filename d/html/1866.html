         This topic reviews the indications for chronic dialysis for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Indications for acute dialysis, as well as other issues related to the care of the patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including timely referral to a nephrologist, consideration of conservative kidney management, evaluation for kidney transplantation, and preparations for dialysis are discussed elsewhere:

         For patients with CKD, the decision to start chronic dialysis is made in collaboration between the nephrologist and patient. For patients with advanced CKD, advantages of chronic dialysis include potential improvement in uremic symptoms and volume overload (if present) that are not responding to medical management, and/or a lower risk of developing acute, life-threatening complications of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Disadvantages of chronic dialysis include the risks of dialysis-associated complications and a lifetime of episodic discomfort and inconvenience.
        </p>
        <p>
         The optimal time to initiate chronic dialysis is when the nephrologist and patient agree that the overall benefits of kidney replacement therapy likely outweigh the risks and substantial burdens.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unplanned dialysis initiation in patients with CKD is associated with increased hospitalizations, morbidity, and mortality [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Thus, planning for dialysis or its alternative, conservative kidney management, should be integrated into the overall care of patients with advanced CKD. Ideally, the decision to initiate dialysis is made long after the patient has undergone an evaluation for kidney transplantation, identified their preferred dialysis modality, and has a functioning dialysis access in place.

          Calculating the estimated glomerular filtration rate

         </span>
         Kidney function assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is an important factor in determining when patients with advanced CKD should initiate dialysis. The GFR estimating equations used by most clinical laboratories are the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula and the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula. These formulas give similar results at low eGFR ranges, and either may be used to monitor kidney function in the later stages of CKD. In one study that included 409 patients starting dialysis, the mean eGFR at dialysis initiation was 6 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         according to both estimating equations [

         There is no minimum estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) that provides an absolute indication to begin dialysis in the absence of symptoms. Some patients, especially those who are young and have few comorbidities, may remain relatively asymptomatic despite an eGFR &lt;10 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Although there is no minimum eGFR that defines an absolute need for dialysis, we and most nephrologists initiate dialysis when the eGFR decreases below 5 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         (see
         <a class="local">
          'eGFR &lt;5 mL/min/1.73 m2'
         </a>
         below). Most patients will be symptomatic at such a low eGFR. However, even in the absence of symptoms, at such a low eGFR there is increased risk of unplanned, emergent dialysis initiation [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In the Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL) study, the only trial in which survival was compared between patients initiating dialysis at two different thresholds of eGFR, survival was comparable between the two groups [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. In this study, 828 patients with an eGFR between 10 and 15 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         (as determined by the Cockcroft-Gault equation) were randomly assigned to start dialysis early (when the eGFR was 10 to 14 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         ) or late (when the eGFR was 5 to 7 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         ). Using the CKD-EPI equation, this would correspond to approximately 8 to 13 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         for the early-start group versus 3 to 5 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         for the late-start group. The median time to the initiation of dialysis was two and seven months in the early- and late-start groups, respectively. At a median follow-up of nearly four years, the survival was similar between the groups (62 and 63 percent), as were the number of cardiovascular events, infections, and dialysis complications.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, these results do not imply that the initiation of dialysis can be delayed until the eGFR is between 5 and 7 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         in all patients. The design of the IDEAL study permitted clinicians to initiate dialysis based on the presence of uremic symptoms and volume overload as well as on the eGFR. As a result, 76 percent of patients assigned to the late-start arm initiated dialysis earlier than planned. This resulted in a mean eGFR of 10 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         (7 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         with the CKD-EPI equation) at dialysis initiation for the late-start group, which was only 2 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         less than the mean eGFR at dialysis initiation for the early-start group (12 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         , or 9 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         with the CKD-EPI equation). Approximately 88 percent of all enrolled patients had initiated dialysis with an eGFR of approximately 7 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         (CKD-EPI) or more, either because of symptoms or enrollment in the early dialysis arm.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, in the absence of indications, patients with a CKD-EPI eGFR above 10 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         do not require dialysis, although many will be placed on dialysis prior to the eGFR falling below 5 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         The IDEAL study was rapidly accepted in the nephrology community. After publication of the IDEAL trial, observational data showed that, compared with prepublication, fewer patients had an early-start of dialysis postpublication (34 versus 39 percent) [

         The decision of when to initiate dialysis remains complex. Our approach is based upon the presence of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)-related signs and symptoms, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and, in some patients, the rate of eGFR decline  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef141361" href="/z/d/graphic/141361.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). These factors must be considered together. There is variability in the timing of dialysis initiation between patients because uremic symptoms are often nonspecific and because eGFR is an imperfect measure of kidney function. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2359.html" rel="external">
          "Assessment of kidney function", section on 'Estimation of GFR'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Our general approach is largely consistent with the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ], the 2014 Canadian Society of Nephrology guidelines [

          7

         The indications for starting dialysis are the same for patients starting hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Logistics surrounding the initiation of peritoneal dialysis are unique, however. (See

If the encephalopathic symptoms do not improve with dialysis, it can generally be discontinued.

         Uremic symptoms are often nonspecific and may be due to other conditions or to side effects of medications commonly used in patients with CKD. Our general approach to determining whether such symptoms should be an indication for chronic dialysis varies by eGFR:

          Evaluation and assessment
         </strong>
         – The evaluation of anorexia requires a careful history (including dietary protein intake), physical examination, and laboratory studies. It can be difficult to obtain an accurate history about poor appetite. Sometimes, patients and family members realize that anorexia is a key factor in the decision about dialysis, and they may not provide accurate information in order to delay or avoid dialysis.

         Following the patient's edema-free weight is helpful, especially when followed over a number of months. A decline in serum albumin also signifies worsening nutritional status. Some nephrologists may also follow urinary nitrogen excretion as a marker of protein intake although this is rarely done in clinical practice.

          Exclusion and treatment of other causes
         </strong>
         – Clinicians must be aware of a number of other potential causes of anorexia and/or nausea. As an example, diabetic gastroparesis should be diagnosed, evaluated, and treated, if present. (See

          Persistent volume overload
         </strong>
         – Persistent volume overload poorly responsive to diuretic management is another indication for the initiation of chronic dialysis. Sodium retention worsens as kidney function deteriorates. Volume overload can lead to refractory hypertension and recurrent hospital admissions for congestive heart failure. Diuretics should not be withheld to prevent a rise in the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine levels. Instead, the patient should be diuresed to euvolemia or at least to a volume status that, in the clinician's judgment, is well tolerated by the patient, and the BUN and serum creatinine levels evaluated at this volume status. Dialysis is appropriate if the target volume status cannot be achieved by optimizing diuretic therapy. (See

          Fatigue and malaise

         – Fatigue and malaise are common in patients with impaired kidney function, even at relatively early stages of CKD [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. However, these symptoms often have causes other than impaired kidney function. It is important for the clinician to rule out other etiologies of fatigue and malaise, such as sedating medications, anemia, or depression. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1952.html" rel="external">

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         If a thorough workup does not identify other causes of persistent fatigue and malaise, dialysis may improve symptoms. Improvements in fatigue after dialysis initiation, if they occur, are generally more pronounced in younger patients without comorbidities. Observational data suggest that chronic dialysis usually does not improve quality of life in older patients [

          Mild cognitive impairment
         </strong>
         – It is usually difficult to attribute cognitive impairment to advanced CKD. As GFR worsens in older patients with CKD, the development of mild cognitive impairment unrelated to lower GFR is common. It is vital to exclude progressive dementia in patients with advanced CKD since patients with significant cognitive impairment may not tolerate and are unlikely to benefit from dialysis. (See

         There is a theoretical concern that the increasing use of newer, creatinine-based GFR estimating equations that do not account for Black race may lead to inappropriately early dialysis initiation in some asymptomatic Black patients with advanced CKD. At eGFRs in the 5 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         range, the CKD-EPI creatinine equation without a race variable (adopted in 2021) tends to underestimate GFR by approximately 1 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         in Black patients. This amount is small in absolute terms but represents approximately 20 percent of residual kidney function. Although no convincing data suggest that the widespread adoption of these newer creatinine equations has led to an earlier initiation of dialysis in Black patients, it is reasonable for the nephrologist to discuss this issue with an asymptomatic Black patient with advanced CKD before starting dialysis based solely on eGFR criteria. Shared decision making in this setting may lead some patients to pursue additional assessment of GFR. (See

         The indications for starting dialysis are the same for patients starting peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. However, the timing of initiation of peritoneal dialysis is a complex decision that requires coordination between the nephrologist, the patient, and the dialysis center that will perform the training. Unlike a permanent hemodialysis access, which is preferably created weeks to months before dialysis is started, a peritoneal dialysis catheter is generally placed only 10 to 14 days before it is used. After the catheter is placed, however, the patient must be trained to perform dialysis, which is difficult to accomplish if they are uremic. As a result, among patients who require the acute initiation of chronic dialysis, hemodialysis is often initiated first using a temporary hemodialysis catheter, even if peritoneal dialysis is the preferred modality over the long term.
        </p>
        <p>
         The increasing availability of urgent-start peritoneal dialysis (defined as initiation of peritoneal dialysis less than two weeks after peritoneal dialysis catheter is placed), as well as earlier peritoneal dialysis catheter placement in selected patients, may ultimately reduce the number of patients who require hemodialysis before starting peritoneal dialysis.

         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. Another study of USRDS data showed that dialysis was initiated earlier in some geographic regions of the United States (in order of earlier start of dialysis): Mountain regions, Midwest, Pacific, Mid-Atlantic, South, and New England [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29

         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         compared with non-VA nephrologists (who usually received increased financial compensation for each patient on dialysis). This study could not exclude confounding factors [

         </strong>
         The timing of referral of patients with CKD to a nephrologist may have an impact on the timing of dialysis initiation. Referral occurs at variable levels of kidney function but often late in the course of progressive kidney failure, just before or even after the onset of symptomatic uremia. Late nephrology referral is a risk factor for unplanned dialysis initiation [

         Early referral is preferred because it affords the opportunity to assess the rate of progression of kidney disease, to exclude any reversible causes of a declining GFR, and to permit close follow-up and adequate advance dialysis planning. It may also improve patient outcomes. This is discussed in detail separately. (See

          Optimal timing of dialysis
         </strong>
         – The optimal time to initiate chronic dialysis is when the nephrologist and the patient with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) agree that the overall benefits of kidney replacement therapy likely outweigh the risks and substantial burdens. There is no minimum estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) that provides an absolute indication to begin dialysis in the absence of symptoms. Some patients, especially those who are young and have few comorbidities, may remain relatively asymptomatic despite an eGFR &lt;10 mL/min/1.73 m

          Indications for chronic dialysis
         </strong>
         – The decision of when to initiate dialysis remains complex. This is because uremic symptoms are often nonspecific and because the eGFR is an imperfect measure of kidney function. Our general approach is based upon the presence of signs and symptoms related to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and the eGFR  (

         <sup>

         and symptoms attributed to impaired kidney function can be treated medically. However, when other causes have been ruled out and medical management optimized, persistent malnutrition, volume overload, fatigue or malaise, and acid-base or electrolyte abnormalities are relative indications for dialysis.

          Patients with rapid kidney function decline
         </strong>
         – It may be reasonable to initiate dialysis in some asymptomatic patients with eGFR ≥5 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         who have rapidly declining kidney function. In such patients, delaying dialysis may increase the risk of emergent dialysis initiation in the future or the development of severe complications of ESKD. (See

          Patients planning peritoneal dialysis
         </strong>
         – The indications for starting dialysis are the same for patients starting peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. However, the timing of initiation of peritoneal dialysis is a complex decision that requires coordination between the nephrologist, the patient, and the dialysis center that will perform the training. (See
