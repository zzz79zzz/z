In the United States, there are approximately 12,400 cases and 3800 deaths due to laryngeal cancer annually [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Glottic, supraglottic, and subglottic cancers represent approximately two-thirds, one-third, and 2 percent of laryngeal cancers, respectively. Hypopharyngeal cancer is less common than laryngeal cancer, with approximately one-fourth as many cases. </p><p>Tumors of the glottic larynx commonly present with hoarseness and are most often diagnosed at an early stage. However, patients with supraglottic and subglottic laryngeal cancers, as well as hypopharyngeal cancers, usually present with advanced disease due to a paucity of symptoms, propensity for local extension (subglottis), and rich lymphatics resulting in a high incidence of lymph node metastases (supraglottis).</p><p>The management of locoregionally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer is presented here. The approach presented here is consistent with guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The treatment of early stage laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers is discussed separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3388.html" rel="external">"Treatment of early (stage I and II) head and neck cancer: The larynx"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3397.html" rel="external">"Treatment of early (stage I and II) head and neck cancer: The hypopharynx"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3583229981"><span class="h1">ANATOMY AND STAGING</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1949041869"><span class="h2">Larynx</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The larynx is divided into three anatomic regions  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58555 graphicRef72411" href="/d/graphic/58555.html" rel="external">figure 1A-B</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Supraglottis </strong>– Suprahyoid epiglottis, infrahyoid epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds (laryngeal aspect), arytenoids, and ventricular bands (false cords).

It contains the paired pyriform sinuses, the posterior pharyngeal wall, and the postcricoid area  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97306" href="/d/graphic/97306.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). Cancers arising in the oropharynx may appear to be hypopharyngeal; therefore, p16/HPV testing should be considered for those hypopharynx cancers contiguous with oropharyngeal sites, especially those arising in nonsmokers.</p><p>The eighth tumor, node, metastases (TNM) staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) is used to classify cancers of the larynx  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110769" href="/d/graphic/110769.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and hypopharynx  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110661 graphicRef110631" href="/d/graphic/110661.html" rel="external">table 2A-B</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. For laryngeal cancers, staging of the primary tumor (T) is defined separately for supraglottic, glottic, and subglottic tumors. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3393.html" rel="external">"Overview of the diagnosis and staging of head and neck cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H349830501"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All patients with advanced (stage III and IV) cancer of the larynx or hypopharynx should be seen prior to treatment by a multidisciplinary team with experience in the treatment of head and neck cancer, with the goals of education of the patient and family about surgical approaches and nonsurgical approaches, and evaluation by team members who would be involved in either a primary surgical or nonsurgical approach. A multidisciplinary tumor board can potentially change management and improve survival [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>].</p><p>The treatment approach depends on tumor extent and location, patient-specific factors (eg, age, performance status, comorbidity, psychosocial support), clinician expertise, and availability of rehabilitation services. Treatment-related toxicity associated with chemoradiation and surgery must also be considered. Patient selection should consider a patient's ability to actively participate in speech and swallowing rehabilitation, regardless of treatment approach.</p><p>Functional organ preservation is widely recommended and generally utilizes a combination of chemotherapy plus radiation therapy (RT). However, advances in surgical techniques, such as laryngeal preservation surgery and minimally invasive surgery, offer alternative options for larynx preservation in carefully selected patients. These surgical approaches have not been directly compared with chemoradiation [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Larynx preservation surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>Although functional organ-sparing approaches (ie, chemoradiation) can permit larynx preservation in patients with locoregionally advanced cancer of the larynx and hypopharynx, they do not provide a survival advantage over total laryngectomy. When feasible, most patients with locally advanced (T3, T4 disease) should be offered the option of organ preservation through combined chemotherapy and radiation (or radiation alone) to preserve the natural speech and swallowing function of the larynx, without compromising overall survival [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. However, for other selected patients with extensive T3 or large T4a lesions and/or poor pretreatment laryngeal function, better survival rates and quality of life may be achieved with total laryngectomy [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. This approach is consistent with clinical guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).</p><p>Preservation of the larynx is not the exclusive determinant of quality of life; maintenance of speech, swallowing, and airway patency are critical endpoints of any functional organ-preservation treatment. An international consensus panel has recommended that a new endpoint of laryngoesophageal dysfunction-free survival is a more useful objective [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. Events in this endpoint include death, local relapse, total or partial laryngectomy, tracheotomy at two or more years, and the presence of a feeding tube at two or more years. Salvage of a dysfunctional larynx with inadequate airway (requiring a tracheotomy) or swallow function (requiring a feeding tube) may not serve the patient well.</p><p>In addition, patients should be counseled about smoking cessation; ongoing tobacco use during RT has been associated with reduced survival in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H349830523"><span class="h1">COMBINED MODALITY THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most good performance status patients with potentially operable, locally advanced cancer of the larynx or hypopharynx, functional organ-preserving approaches using combinations of chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT) have replaced total laryngectomy plus postoperative RT. These approaches include chemotherapy given at the same time as RT (concurrent chemoradiation), induction chemotherapy followed by RT alone, or sequential therapy with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation. RT alone may also be considered an organ-preservation strategy for those who cannot tolerate chemoradiation or sequential chemotherapy, although this approach is associated with a lower rate of larynx preservation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3392.html" rel="external">"Locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: Approaches combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy"</a>.)</p><p>The choice of a functional organ-preserving alternative requires that the patient be able to withstand the prolonged course of treatment and associated toxicities and participate in rehabilitation, especially swallowing therapy, after treatment [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. These combined modality approaches are also used to provide definitive treatment for patients who are inoperable because of extensive locoregional disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3368.html" rel="external">"Speech and swallowing rehabilitation of the patient with head and neck cancer"</a>.)</p><p>While combined RT plus chemotherapy approaches usually maintain laryngeal function in patients with resectable disease, they are associated with considerable toxicity that, in some cases, may compromise the airway (edema or stenosis) or the patient's ability to protect the airway, and thus, may not achieve the goal of functional larynx preservation. </p><p>Organ function-preserving chemoradiation approaches are not appropriate for all patients with locoregionally advanced cancer of the larynx and hypopharynx. Examples include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Older adults and patients with poor performance status </strong>– Older adults and those with a poor performance status may not be suitable candidates for chemoradiation approaches because of the upfront morbidity associated with this treatment and/or the inability to rehabilitate from these potentially life-threatening toxicities. Definitive RT alone for organ preservation or total laryngectomy followed by postoperative RT may be preferable in this setting. Laryngectomy typically offers rapid control of symptoms and prompt swallowing recovery. (See <a class="local">'Older and poor performance status patients'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Vocal cord destruction </strong>– Patients with destruction of both vocal cords may not recover vocal or airway protective function with larynx-preservation approaches and may function better after total laryngectomy rather than chemoradiation. (See <a class="local">'Total laryngectomy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Outer</strong> <strong>cortex cartilage invasion </strong>– Tumors with cartilage outer cortex penetration or destruction (ie, T4a or T4b disease) should typically undergo total laryngectomy with postoperative RT or CRT. This operative approach provides better locoregional control and survival than nonsurgical approaches [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. In addition, cartilage destruction limits the likelihood of adequate functional recovery with larynx-preserving approaches and increases the probability of radiation-induced necrosis. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">By contrast, tumors with limited inner cortex cartilage invasion are classified as T3 in the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8<sup>th</sup> edition staging system and are appropriate to evaluate for nonsurgical treatment. Such patients were included in a randomized trial comparing various organ-function preserving chemoradiation approaches (RTOG 91-11), the results of which are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Comparison of combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy approaches'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H349830549"><span class="h2">Nonsurgical functional organ preservation versus surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The feasibility of nonsurgical functional organ preservation using induction chemotherapy prior to definitive RT was established by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Laryngeal Cancer Study Group larynx trial. Similar results were seen in a European Cooperative Group trial (EORTC 24891) of patients with cancers of the hypopharynx mostly (piriform sinus and some with hypopharyngeal aspect of the aryepiglottic fold).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the VA trial, 332 patients with stage III or IV laryngeal cancer were randomly assigned to three cycles of induction chemotherapy with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a> plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a>, followed by definitive RT or primary surgery (typically total laryngectomy), followed by postoperative RT [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Patients without at least a partial response and those with any evidence of disease progression during or after induction chemotherapy were treated with surgery and postoperative RT. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">At a median follow-up of 33 months, the two-year survival rate was equal in both treatment groups (68 percent), and the larynx was successfully preserved in 64 percent of patients treated with induction chemotherapy [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. A subsequent publication reported that the three-year survival rates were 53 and 56 percent for chemotherapy plus RT and surgery plus RT, respectively [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the European trial, 194 patients with stage II through IV squamous cell carcinoma of the pyriform sinus or aryepiglottic fold were randomly assigned to receive induction chemotherapy with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a> plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a>, followed by definitive RT or surgery (total laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy), followed by postoperative RT [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>]. Patients who failed to achieve a complete response to induction chemotherapy underwent salvage surgery and postoperative RT. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">At a median follow-up of 10.5 years, there were no significant differences in survival or patterns-of-failure outcomes. The 10-year progression-free survival probabilities for the chemotherapy plus definitive RT and for the surgery arms were 11 and 9 percent, respectively. Overall survival probabilities at 10 years were 13 and 14 percent, respectively. The 5- and 10-year probabilities of being alive with a functional larynx were 21.9 and 8.7 percent, respectively, on the larynx preservation arm; however, for those patients alive at 5 and 10 years, 59.5 percent (22/37) and 62.5 percent (5/8) maintained a normal larynx, respectively.</p><p></p><p>Following the demonstration of benefit with induction chemotherapy followed by RT, various subsequent trials evaluated the concurrent administration of chemotherapy with RT (concurrent chemoradiation), induction chemotherapy, and induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation (sequential chemoradiation). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3392.html" rel="external">"Locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: Approaches combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H177767476"><span class="h2">Concurrent chemoradiation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Concurrent chemoradiation administers systemic chemotherapy at the same time as definitive RT to improve the likelihood of disease control and laryngeal preservation. This approach is more effective in achieving locoregional control of disease as well as larynx preservation and may be preferable for medically fit patients. However, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 91-11 trial suggested that concurrent chemoradiation was associated with more unexplained deaths than induction chemotherapy followed by definitive RT, and induction chemotherapy had better survival and equivalent laryngectomy-free survival (LFS) as late outcomes [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Comparison of combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy approaches'</a> below.) </p><p>Data supporting the role of concurrent chemoradiation come from the 2011 update of the Meta-Analysis of Chemotherapy on Head and Neck Cancer (MACH-NC) Collaborative Group, which conducted a comprehensive analysis by tumor site [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. This analysis was based upon individual patient data for 3216 patients with laryngeal cancer. There was an overall benefit for the addition of chemotherapy to locoregional therapy (hazard ratio [HR] for death 0.87, 95% CI 0.80-0.96); this survival advantage was exclusively restricted to concurrent chemoradiation rather than induction or adjuvant delivery of systemic therapy.</p><p>In patients with laryngeal cancer, the survival benefit with concomitant chemoradiation versus RT alone was particularly robust (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71-0.90). However, very few of the induction studies included the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a> plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a> regimen, and none incorporated the contemporary standard, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9381" href="/d/drug information/9381.html" rel="external">docetaxel</a> plus cisplatin and fluorouracil (TPF)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65438" href="/d/graphic/65438.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Furthermore, the data on induction chemotherapy from the largest trial (RTOG 91-11) were not included in the analysis, which is particularly relevant because the update of this trial suggested a non-significant trend favoring the induction chemotherapy group over concomitant chemoradiation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3392.html" rel="external">"Locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: Approaches combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy", section on 'Concurrent chemotherapy'</a> and <a class="local">'Comparison of combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy approaches'</a> below.)</p><p>For the 2767 patients with hypopharyngeal cancer, a similar benefit in survival with chemotherapy was observed (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.96). In contrast to larynx cancer, there was no statistically significant interaction between chemotherapy timing and survival as the benefit of chemotherapy was similar in those given concomitant chemoradiation (HR 0.85) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (HR 0.88). However, only the HR for concomitant chemotherapy was statistically significant in comparison to local therapy alone, although the analysis may not have had adequate power to detect a difference in this disease site.</p><p>Based upon these results, concurrent chemoradiation is widely recommended for good performance status patients with resectable, locally advanced (stage III and carefully selected stage IV) laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer, with a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen, such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a> (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every three weeks). Induction chemotherapy is a reasonable alternative in some patients. (See <a class="local">'Comparison of combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy approaches'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H349830665"><span class="h2">Induction chemotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Induction chemotherapy followed by definitive RT is an alternative for the functional organ-preservation treatment of locally advanced cancer of the larynx and hypopharynx. Induction chemotherapy may also be preferable for patients with a relatively high risk of distant metastases, such as those with advanced nodal disease. Although this approach may not be as effective as concurrent chemoradiation in initial control of locoregional disease without salvage laryngectomy, induction therapy may decrease the incidence of distant metastases compared with RT alone and had a better, although not statistically significant, survival outcome versus concomitant chemoradiation in RTOG 91-11 [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. </p><p>This latter finding is particularly provocative since there were fewer locoregional recurrences in the concurrent arm without an increase in distant failures as first progression, and the study did not show a difference in treatment-associated death between the arms [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Patients treated with concomitant chemoradiation were significantly more likely to die from causes not related to the cancer in comparison to the induction arm (69.8 versus 52.8 percent at 10 years), raising the question of whether the study did not capture attribution of late deaths from treatment-associated morbidity (eg, aspiration pneumonia).</p><p>In earlier reports of the MACH-NC meta-analysis, there was no statistically significant survival benefit for induction chemotherapy versus definitive locoregional therapy alone when all head and neck subsites were analyzed, although there was a significant benefit for induction chemotherapy in the subset of trials using induction with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a> plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a> (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79-0.97) [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>].

The absence of a survival benefit in some analyses of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer may be due to salvage laryngectomy, and progression-free survival and LFS are more meaningful endpoints.

Interestingly, there was no difference in distant metastasis in the arms. The effect was graphically more robust in nonoropharyngeal carcinoma patients, approximately one-half of whom had a hypopharynx primary, although the statistical test for interaction was negative. Less than 25 percent of the patients in this trial had laryngeal or hypopharyngeal primary cancers, and the subset analysis on these patients was retrospective and preplanned.</p><p>Sequential therapy was studied specifically in patients with laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers in the phase II TREMPLIN trial [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

Selection of a treatment approach depends on tumor extent and location, patient-specific factors (eg, age, performance status, comorbidity, psychosocial support), clinician expertise, and availability of rehabilitation services. (See <a class="local">'Overview of management'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For most good performance status patients with locally advanced (stage III or IV) laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancer, we recommend a functional organ-preservation strategy rather than surgical resection (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). Organ-sparing approaches may permit larynx preservation but do not provide a survival advantage compared with total laryngectomy. (See <a class="local">'Overview of management'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Concurrent chemoradiation, induction chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy (RT) alone, and sequential therapy (ie, induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation) are all used as functional organ-preservation techniques. (See <a class="local">'Combined modality therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Concurrent chemoradiation may be preferable for medically fit patients, and induction therapy may offer advantages for patients with a relatively high risk of distant metastases, such as those with advanced nodal disease. Three cycles of TPF chemotherapy  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65438" href="/d/graphic/65438.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) are typically used for induction therapy. (See <a class="local">'Concurrent chemoradiation'</a> above and <a class="local">'Induction chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Sequential therapy may be particularly useful in patients with both large primary tumors (bulky T3 and select T4) and advanced nodal disease who are at high risk for distant metastases. (See <a class="local">'Sequential chemoradiation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Partial laryngectomy and minimally invasive surgery may be options for carefully selected patients, especially those with relatively small primary tumors combined with more extensive neck disease. Postoperative RT is generally required in these cases. (See <a class="local">'Surgery'</a> above and <a class="local">'Postoperative radiation therapy'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients who may not be candidates for an organ-preservation approach include patients with resectable tumors that have destroyed both vocal cords, older adult patients for whom the toxicity associated with chemoradiation or full-dose RT alone is problematic, and those with extensive cartilage destruction from the primary tumor. (See <a class="local">'Overview of management'</a> above and <a class="local">'Total laryngectomy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Older and poor performance status patients'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Management of the neck is complex and depends on disease extent, the treatment modality used to treat the primary tumor, and response to therapy. (See <a class="local">'Management of the neck'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/97170.html" rel="external">"Management of the neck following definitive radiotherapy with or without chemoradiotherapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients who are not candidates for a functional organ-preserving approach, total laryngectomy is a potential alternative. Definitive RT alone may be used as a functional organ-preserving approach for laryngeal cancer patients who are not felt to be candidates for chemotherapy, although there is a higher risk of recurrence and, thus, a need for salvage laryngectomy. (See <a class="local">'Total laryngectomy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Older and poor performance status patients'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For active smokers, the importance of smoking cessation must be continuously emphasized to support treatment success and to reduce the subsequent likelihood of second malignancies. Counseling services should be offered, if available. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16634.html" rel="external">"Overview of smoking cessation management in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/17024.html" rel="external">"Treatment of alcohol use and smoking for cancer survivors"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Adequate posttreatment surveillance and long-term follow-up are crucial to ensure adequate voice and swallowing rehabilitation and to monitor for disease recurrence or a second primary malignancy. Lifelong follow-up is also necessary to ensure that late complications of treatment are addressed to mitigate the risk of non-cancer causes of mortality.
