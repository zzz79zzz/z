Medical fitness should be re-evaluated prior to post-remission therapy because, for some patients, medical fitness improves with achievement of remission, whereas for others, fitness may have declined due to complications of treatment or the underlying leukemia. Evaluation of medical fitness is described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16661.html" rel="external">"Induction therapy for Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults", section on 'Medical fitness'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1196201078"><span class="h2">Transplant consultation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We obtain consultation regarding eligibility for transplantation for all patients, except those who are frail.</p><p>We do not consider age a barrier to obtaining transplantation consultation. Although age limits vary, many institutions restrict allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for Ph+ ALL to patients ≤60 years. Transplant eligibility also requires no severe lung, heart, liver, or kidney disease; a suitable graft source; and adequate social supports. Further details of eligibility for allogeneic HCT are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16870.html" rel="external">"Determining eligibility for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3940928608"><span class="h2">MRD assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Measurable residual disease (MRD) should be evaluated upon completion of remission induction therapy.

Treatment of Ph+ ALL continues to evolve with the introduction of new agents and approaches to therapy; participation in a clinical trial is the best way to ensure safe and effective treatment. </p><p>Patients with Ph+ ALL should be referred to a specialty center for care or must be treated by a clinician who has the necessary experience and resources to treat with strict adherence to a contemporary published protocol. Once a treatment regimen is selected, it is important to adhere to the published protocol, rather than selecting components from different treatment protocols.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4087170750"><span class="h2">Indications and exceptions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most patients with Ph+ ALL, we suggest consolidation therapy, rather than maintenance therapy alone or observation only. Consolidation therapy offers the greatest likelihood of long-term survival for patients with Ph+ ALL, but is associated with adverse effects that vary with the chosen approach. No randomized trials have compared consolidation therapy versus maintenance therapy alone or observation only and it is difficult to compare different studies because of various selection criteria and measures of outcomes. Most studies with maintenance therapy alone involved frail or less-fit patients or were from the pre-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) era. Observation alone is associated with relapse within months in virtually all patients. Selection of consolidation therapy is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Choices for transplant candidates'</a> below and <a class="local">'Not a transplant candidate'</a> below.) </p><p>Possible exceptions to treatment with consolidation therapy include: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Selected patients with undetectable measurable residual disease (MRD):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Transplant-eligible – For patients with undetectable MRD who are candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), some experts favor proceeding directly to maintenance therapy, whereas others favor allogeneic HCT, as discussed below.

Allogeneic HCT is associated with the most favorable long-term outcomes for Ph+ ALL, but this benefit must be weighed against substantial toxicity and treatment-related mortality (TRM), which vary with patient age and transplantation technique [<a href="#rid3">3-9</a>]. It is uncertain if the favorable balance of benefits and toxicity of allogeneic HCT applies to patients who have undetectable MRD after remission induction therapy. The role of MRD status on decisions about transplantation, timing of HCT, and pretransplant management are described below. (See <a class="local">'Pretransplant management by MRD status'</a> below.)</p><p>Studies that compared allogeneic HCT with other approaches generally used "genetic randomization," in which allogeneic HCT is offered to patients with a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donor, while other patients received either autologous HCT or chemotherapy.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In one study, 254 patients in hematologic complete remission (CR) underwent allogeneic HCT (if they had a matched donor) versus autologous HCT (if no suitable donor was available) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Allogeneic HCT was performed in 161 patients (76 matched sibling donors, 72 matched unrelated donors, 13 umbilical cord blood) and autologous HCT in 35 patients. Compared with autologous HCT, allogeneic HCT was associated with more favorable overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR] 0.64; 95% CI 0.44-0.93) and relapse-free survival (RFS; HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.49-0.98). However, OS or RFS did not differ between treatment arms among patients who achieved major molecular response (MMolR; <em>BCR/ABL1</em> &lt;10<sup>-3</sup> [MR3]) prior to transplantation. Allogeneic HCT was associated with more nonrelapse mortality (NRM; 26 versus 6 percent). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A multicenter study that used genetic randomization of 83 patients (median age 44 years) who achieved CR or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) reported that patients who underwent allogeneic HCT (41 patients) followed by TKI maintenance therapy had superior 12-month RFS (83 percent) compared with patients who proceeded directly to two years of maintenance therapy with a TKI, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10045" href="/z/d/drug information/10045.html" rel="external">vincristine</a> [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A retrospective study reported that for patients who received intensive chemotherapy plus a TKI, outcomes were similar for patients who subsequently underwent allogeneic HCT versus those who received indefinite TKI maintenance therapy [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].

We judge that the risk of relapse (ie, approximately one-quarter of patients with molCR who do not undergo HCT) [<a href="#rid8">8,12,13</a>] outweighs transplant-related toxicity and TRM. However, some experts favor omitting HCT for patients with a molCR, because they place greater weight on limiting toxicity for patients in whom an incremental benefit from transplantation cannot be demonstrated (ie, because <em>BCR/ABL1</em> is not measurable). Instead, they reserve allogeneic HCT for the possibility of a future relapse. The decision to omit HCT in a patient with a molCR is influenced by individual preference and should weigh the physical and emotional burden of allogeneic HCT against the greater uncertainty of outcomes without transplantation. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2403241141"><span class="h3">Donor source</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An HLA-matched related donor or matched unrelated donor is preferred because they are associated with the most favorable outcomes with allogeneic HCT.
