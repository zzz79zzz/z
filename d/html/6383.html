         Effective airway support is an essential component of successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Respiratory insufficiency leading to respiratory arrest typically precedes cardiac arrest for most children. Survival rates are much higher for children who have been resuscitated from respiratory arrest compared with children who develop cardiac arrest. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6384.html" rel="external">
          "Pediatric basic life support (BLS) for health care providers", section on 'Epidemiology and survival'

          ANATOMIC CONSIDERATIONS

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         A patent airway is a fundamental requirement for effective resuscitation. Anatomic features that make the airways of infants and children more susceptible to obstruction and that must be considered in order to maintain an adequate airway include the following (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6310.html" rel="external">
          "Emergency airway management in children: Unique pediatric considerations", section on 'Anatomic considerations'

         <strong>
          Larynx
         </strong>
         – The position of the larynx in infants and children is higher and more anterior than in adults (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50850" href="/z/d/graphic/50850.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). As a result, hyperextension of the neck may worsen obstruction of the upper airway.
        </p>
        <p>

        <p class="bulletIndent1">

         </span>
         <strong>
          Airway
         </strong>
         – Because the airways of infants and children are smaller, they are more susceptible to obstruction from secretions, mucous, blood, vomitus, other debris, or a foreign body. Suctioning of the oropharynx and nasopharynx is essential to clearing the airway in infants and children with respiratory distress and failure (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113570.html" rel="external">
          "Airway management for pediatric anesthesia"
         </a>
         ). Relief of airway obstruction by a foreign body in infants and children requires separate management. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6455.html" rel="external">
          "Emergency evaluation of acute upper airway obstruction in children"
         </a>

         <strong>
          Head
         </strong>
         – The relatively larger occiput of the infant and young child causes passive flexion of the cervical spine in the supine position, which contributes to a tendency for the posterior pharynx to buckle during resuscitation. This can be prevented by maintaining the head in the
         <strong>
          sniffing position
         </strong>
         , which extends the neck and aligns the pharyngeal and tracheal axes. Placing a rolled towel under the shoulders of the infant may help to maintain proper positioning for airway management (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78446" href="/z/d/graphic/78446.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In children over two years old and adolescents, a towel under the occiput provides the necessary alignment (

         Allow a spontaneously breathing child with upper airway obstruction to maintain an open airway with a position of comfort (

          Tongue
         </strong>
         – The tongue is relatively larger compared with the oral cavity in infants and children than in adults. In an infant or child with a decreased level of consciousness, the tongue commonly falls back against the hypopharynx, resulting in airway obstruction [

         infant or child to relieve airway obstruction caused by the tongue that has not been relieved by maneuvers (ie, head tilt-chin lift or jaw thrust). The OPA is optimally used as a bridge to recovery for a patient whose condition is expected to be temporary (such as a child who is postictal or recovering from sedation). However, prolonged tolerance of an OPA usually suggests the need for endotracheal intubation (ETI).

         The distance from the nostril to the tragus has been shown to correlate well with the length from the nostril to the vocal cords in most infants and children and is our preferred method for sizing [

          Oxygen delivery
         </strong>
         – The self-inflating bag requires an oxygen reservoir to reliably deliver oxygen concentrations above 40 percent. This is because room air is entrained in the system when the bag reinflates. A minimum oxygen flow rate of 10 to 15 L/min is required to maintain an adequate oxygen volume in the reservoir [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. With an oxygen flow rate of 15 L/min, oxygen concentrations between 95 and 100 percent can be delivered using a 2.5 L bag reservoir system [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25

         <strong>
          Pop-off valve
         </strong>
         – Self-inflating bags typically have a safety pop-off valve that reduces the risk of barotrauma by limiting peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) to between 35 and 45 cm H
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         O. However, higher levels of PIP may be required to provide adequate tidal volume and oxygenation when airway resistance is high or lung compliance is poor [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. In this setting, an automatic pop-off valve may result in delivery of insufficient tidal volume and can usually be disabled [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. Whenever possible, an in-line manometer should be used to monitor PIP when the pop-off valve is disabled.

         <strong>
          Mechanism
         </strong>
         – When the self-inflating bag is released, the bag recoil mechanism reinflates the self-inflating bag from room air or, if available, from an oxygen source. During bag reinflation, the gas intake valve opens and allows the bag to fill. During bag compression, the gas intake valve closes, and a second valve (fish-mouth or leaf-flap, non-rebreathing outlet valve) opens to permit gas flow to the patient. During patient exhalation, the outlet valve closes, and the patient's exhaled gases are released to the atmosphere to prevent rebreathing of carbon dioxide.

         <strong>
          Mechanism
         </strong>
         – Because the flow-inflating bag does not contain a non-rebreathing valve, the composition of inhaled gas is determined by the rate of fresh gas flow. The PEEP valve is adjusted to maintain volume in the reservoir bag necessary for appropriate positive pressure and allow an oxygen inflow rate sufficient to wash out exhaled gases. During ventilation, the fresh gas inflow is adjusted to at least 250 mL/kg/min. Increasing the oxygen inflow rate decreases the risk of rebreathing exhaled carbon dioxide.

          Procedure
         </strong>
         – For some patients, two rescuers may be required to provide effective bag-mask ventilation (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72516" href="/z/d/graphic/72516.html" rel="external">
          picture 12

         ). In this situation, one rescuer uses both hands (each hand in the "E-C" configuration on either side of the face) to maintain the airway and hold the ventilation mask, while another rescuer compresses the ventilation bag. The rescuer holding the mask may also provide a jaw thrust to maintain the airway during ventilation. (See

          'Jaw thrust maneuver'

          Effectiveness
         </strong>
         – The effectiveness of two-rescuer bag-mask ventilation was demonstrated in a prospective observational study in which greater peak pressures and mean tidal volumes per weight were generated in manikin models with two-rescuer, as compared with single-rescuer, bag-mask ventilation [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. In a randomized crossover study performed on 60 children aged one through eight years with obstructive sleep apnea due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy, a two-handed airway technique during inhalational induction of anesthesia provided superior airway patency that was not influenced by anesthetic depth compared with a one-handed technique [

         When providing bag-mask ventilation to children with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, health care providers should wear a respirator (eg, N95 mask) and other personal protective equipment (PPE) including eye protection (goggles or face shield), gloves, and gown and use an in-line high-efficiency particular air (HEPA) filter with a low dead space. Mouth-to-mouth/nose ventilation should be avoided [

          Indicators of adequate ventilation
         </strong>
         – Among the clinical parameters, which should be constantly monitored as indicators of the adequacy of ventilation, visible chest rise with each breath is foremost. It must be assumed that if there is no chest motion during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), there is no ventilation. Other parameters include oxygen saturation, exhaled carbon dioxide, heart rate, blood pressure, distal air entry, and patient response (eg, appearance, color, and level of agitation).

          Assisted ventilation

         <a class="local">
          'Bag-mask ventilation'

          Gastric insufflation
         </strong>
         – Minimize gastric insufflation by giving breaths slowly, so that an effective tidal volume is delivered at a lower inspiratory pressure. During bag-mask ventilation with two rescuers present, cricoid pressure is optional to compress the esophagus and reduce gastric distension. However, discontinue cricoid pressure if it hampers effective ventilation. (See
