         Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) includes herbal therapy, acupuncture, massage, and dietary therapy. These practices originated in China and have been used in East Asia for centuries as a part of mainstream medical care. TCM is beginning to play a role in Western health care as a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).

         This topic will discuss Chinese herbal therapy for asthma, atopic dermatitis (AD), and food allergy. These therapies are considered experimental from the standpoint of conventional medicine. Overviews of herbal medicine and use of CAM in pediatrics are presented separately. Acupuncture for the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis is also discussed separately. (See

          OVERVIEW
         </span>
         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The prevalence of allergic disorders such as asthma, atopic dermatitis (AD), and food allergy has increased dramatically in industrialized countries over the past several decades. Atopic diseases are a serious public health problem, particularly in children. Conventional therapies, such as glucocorticoids, are widely used in controlling asthma and AD. However, these therapies are not completely effective in all patients, and there are concerns about side effects, especially in children. In addition, there is no curative treatment for food allergy, just rescue treatment of reactions. These and other issues have led patients and their parents/caregivers to seek complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments.
        </p>
        <p>
         Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a long history of use in China and other Asian countries, such as Japan and Korea. TCM has several features that differ significantly from Western medicine:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         TCM practice does not focus only on the disease or a single organ. Rather, it also focuses on establishing and maintaining the balance of yin-yang (two opposite, but complementary forces), the homeostasis of organ systems in the body, and interactions with the environment [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The concepts and terminology of TCM cannot be easily translated to Western medicine.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Treatment is customized for each patient. As an example, a Chinese herbal formulation is a mixture of many herbs. The practitioner starts with one or two main ingredients that target the illness. Additional ingredients are included depending upon the patient's particular yin-yang conditions and possible need for a catalyst that makes the other components effective or an antidote that cancels out negative effects of other ingredients. Thus, the formulation used to treat a particular disease varies from patient to patient and even for an individual patient depending upon their changing needs.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         TCM has not been rigorously evaluated in randomized clinical trials. Sham acupuncture is difficult to perform, for example. In addition, the content of herbal formulations is often not standardized, and, even if it is, the quality and pharmacologic activity of individual herbs in the formulation can vary.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Practitioners of Western medicine have tended to avoid recommending use of TCM, particularly herbal therapies, for a number of reasons:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Western practitioners are unfamiliar with these therapeutic methods because they are not included in conventional medical training in Western countries.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The mechanisms of action of TCM are largely unknown, despite extensive clinical experience with these modalities in Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Randomized trials of TCM are lacking. In addition, studies published in Chinese are usually not translated into English or other languages, with the possible exception of the abstract.
        </p>
        <p>

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">

         Herbal therapies are not standardized, nor are the quality of the components consistent.

         Knowledge about side effects and drug-herb interactions is limited.

         Herbal therapies may contain undeclared conventional pharmaceuticals or heavy metal contaminants.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
         In the United States, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) supports clinical and basic research on CAM to help eliminate some of the gaps in knowledge about these therapies. In addition, the National Committee of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine offers a certificate in Chinese Herbology to increase the quality of practice of Chinese herbal medicine.
        </p>
        <p>
         Chinese herbal medicines are a major component in TCM practice and are prescribed in China both as monotherapy and in combination with conventional (Western) medicine. In the United States, Chinese herbs are categorized as dietary supplements by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As such, the efficacy, safety, and quality of these products do not need to be proven, nor do postmarketing adverse events need to be reported. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1392.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of herbal medicine and dietary supplements"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The US FDA has issued guidelines for investigation of botanical drug products, including complex formulas that contain several herbs, focusing on efficacy, safety, and consistency [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Thus, TCM products currently used as dietary supplements may be investigated as new botanical drugs. One of the major differences in US FDA requirements for investigation of synthetic versus botanical drugs is the Chemical, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) Data requirement for new botanical drugs [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Quality and safety data must be supplied at three levels (raw herbs, extracts, and final product) for botanical drugs.
        </p>
        <p>
         TCM views allergic disease as resulting from the loss of homeostasis in interactions between human organs, such as the lungs, skin, and gut, with the environment and foods. Asthma, allergic rhinitis, and AD are well documented in TCM literature. There are many widely used formulas for these disorders, although they have not been well studied [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. Food allergy has not been reported in the TCM literature.
        </p>
        <p>
         Research into the efficacy and safety of several herbal formulas for asthma and AD using standard methods is being actively pursued in some Western medical centers, and an herbal intervention for food allergy has been derived from TCM [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Standardization of these formulas is challenging because they contain many herbs and the active components are not clearly defined. Thus, the quality, potency, and consistency of formulas are standardized by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprinting of the molecular components. Chemical markers are also identified by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry.
        </p>
        <p>
         Consistent quality of each individual raw herb is key for reproducibility of efficacy of herbal therapies. Factors that affect quality include authenticity, geographic location, harvest time, preprocessing methods, and storage, according to the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Standard manufacturing procedure is important to further ensure the consistency and quality of the final product. Safety testing of the final product includes evaluation for contamination with heavy metals and pesticide and microbial limit testing. In addition, biologic analysis, including in vitro and in vivo models that represent asthma and food allergy, may be employed to ensure safety and efficacy prior to human clinical use. This combined approach has yielded satisfactory product quality control of antiasthma herbal medicine intervention (ASHMI) and food allergy herbal formula-2 (FAHF-2) [

         Chinese herbs have been used for centuries in Asia to treat asthma. There is increasing scientific evidence to support the use of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) herbal therapy for asthma [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8

         ]. Randomized trials of TCM herbal formulas for asthma have been published in the English-language literature [

Although results from these studies suggested potential benefits on symptoms and quality of life, larger-scale studies are needed. Other formulas have only been studied in China.
        </p>
        <p>
         A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials of herbal medicine as add-on therapy for adult asthma included 29 studies involving 30,001 participants published through May 2014 [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
         A systematic review of studies of Chinese herbal medicine for adults with cough variant asthma identified 28 randomized, controlled trials including 2079 subjects published up until April 2020 [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19

         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Patients in China were randomized 1:1 to receive ASHMI 3.6 g or prednisone 20 mg daily for four weeks. One patient (ASHMI group) withdrew from the study during the last week of treatment. This study found that ASHMI was nearly equivalent to prednisone in improving posttreatment lung function (forced expiratory volume in the first second [FEV

         The second randomized trial of ASHMI performed in China examined the safety, tolerability, and immunologic effects of standard therapy alone versus standard therapy plus ASHMI in children 5 to 14 years of age with persistent asthma, with or without allergic rhinitis [

Patients treated with both ASHMI and inhaled glucocorticoids showed significantly greater reduction of serum total IgE and serum eosinophil cationic protein and higher serum levels of IFN-gamma after three months of treatment compared with children treated with standard therapy alone [

Conversely, patients in the ASHMI treatment group showed increased levels of serum cortisol within the normal range. Thus, ASHMI restored adrenal homeostasis. This effect may be attributed to glycyrrhizin (a component of Gan-Cao), which affects the conversion of cortisol to cortisone by inhibition of 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme activity [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2

         Potential mechanisms of action of ASHMI have been suggested by studies in murine models of asthma. ASHMI exhibits a broad spectrum of therapeutic effects on the major pathogenic mechanisms of asthma. ASHMI blocks the IgE-mediated early-phase airway response, airway hyperreactivity, pulmonary inflammation, and airway remodeling [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,23,24
         </a>
         ]. These changes are accompanied by downregulation of Th2 responses and reduced histamine and leukotriene release. ASHMI also appears to directly modulate airway smooth muscle contraction by a beta-2 adrenergic receptor-independent mechanism that is associated with increased prostaglandin I2, a potent muscle relaxer [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Flavonoids in Gan-Cao inhibit eotaxin production by human fetal lung fibroblasts [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25

         <a href="#rid27">
          27

         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. Expression of the high-affinity IgE receptor, FcEpsilonRI, was decreased both in vivo and in vitro. Fraction 2 from FAHF-2 also inhibited rat basophil leukemic cell and human mast cell degranulation in vivo. Dose-dependent responses were seen to three major compounds in fraction 2 (jatrorrhizine, palmatine, and berberine).
        </p>
        <p>
         Enhancement of interferon (IFN) gamma production by CD8+ T cells may also be an important mechanism underlying the long-term protection produced by FAHF-2 [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30,31
         </a>
         ]. In this same murine model of peanut allergy, FAHF-2 suppressed histamine release, reduced serum IgE, and increased immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. The protective effect was associated with upregulation of Th1 and downregulation of Th2 cytokines, including an increased the number of IFN-gamma producing CD8+ T. Depletion of CD8+ T cells during FAHF-2 treatment attenuated FAHF-2-mediated IFN-gamma production, suppression of peanut-specific IgE, and clinical protection [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31
         </a>
         ]. Depletion of CD8+ T cells or neutralization of IFN-gamma significantly attenuated FAHF-2 suppression of IgE and Th2 cytokines. However, IFN-gamma neutralization did not significantly impact the ability of FAHF-2 to protect mice from symptoms of anaphylaxis immediately following treatment despite elevated IgE, although this protection was lost in a subsequent challenge four weeks later.

         In a dose-escalation phase I safety study of FAHF-2, 18 patients 12 to 45 years of age who had a history of peanut, tree nut, fish, or shellfish allergy were randomized to receive placebo (n = 6) or FAHF-2 (n = 12) at a dose of 2.2, 3.3, or 6.6 g three times daily for seven days [

         Oral and topical preparations of Chinese herbs have been used for centuries in Asia for the treatment of skin conditions, such as atopic dermatitis (AD; eczema). However, there have been only a few randomized trials, and these studies were methodologically flawed [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40,41
         </a>
         ]. Further clinical trials are needed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Several randomized, crossover trials of Zemaphyte, a 10-herb formula, were performed in the United Kingdom in children and adults with AD [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ]. Erythema and surface damage were reduced and sleep improved in two studies, but not in another. Abnormalities in liver function tests that resolved with discontinuation of the formula were reported with longer-term use. No serious adverse events were reported. Intention-to-treat analysis was not used despite withdrawal rates of up to 22 percent. Zemaphyte is no longer manufactured.
        </p>
        <p>
         A randomized trial of a five-herb formulation, PentaHerbs, was performed in China [
         <a href="#rid43">

         . Eighty-five children with chronic moderate-to-severe AD were randomized to PentaHerbs or placebo daily for 12 weeks. Only two children (placebo group) withdrew from the study. Intention-to-treat analysis was used. There were no significant differences in extent and severity of AD (SCORAD scores) between the treatment and placebo groups pre- and posttreatment, although there was greater improvement in quality of life and reduction in topical corticosteroid use in the PentaHerbs group. No serious adverse events were reported. PentaHerbs has been shown to have immunomodulatory effects [

         Xiao-Feng-San (XFS), a 13-herb formula, was studied in a randomized trial in Taiwan [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ]. Patients with severe, intractable AD were treated for eight weeks with oral XFS (n = 47) or placebo (n = 24). There was a significantly greater improvement in the total lesion, erythema, surface damage, pruritus, and sleep scores in the treatment group compared with placebo. These differences, except for the erythema score, were still significant four weeks after the completion of treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Preliminary observational studies suggested that the combination of Chinese herbal therapy and acupuncture was more effective than herbal therapy alone [

          46,47
         </a>
         ]. A subsequent meta-analysis of 20 randomized trials (1838 patients) up to June 2021 comparing topical Chinese herbal medicine to placebo reported an improvement in AD symptom scores [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. Limitations included the relatively high risk of bias and methodologic heterogeneity of the clinical studies. Additional controlled clinical studies are needed.

          History

         – Chinese herbs have been used for centuries in Asia as a part of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). However, lack of standardization and controlled clinical trials, among other issues, have hampered their use as conventional therapies in Western medicine. (See

          Chinese herbal therapies hold promise
         </strong>
         – There is potential for developing novel therapies for atopic diseases from Chinese herbs. Several herbal formulas show early promise for the treatment of asthma, food allergies, and allergic rhinitis in randomized trials. Work remains to determine the active components of each herb, their mechanisms of action, and potential synergistic effects. In addition, issues with consistency of herb quality and standardization still need to be addressed. (See
