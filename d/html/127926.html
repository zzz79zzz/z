Complement levels were higher in people with severe compared with moderate COVID-19 and in individuals who required mechanical ventilation. Signs of complement activation in tissue biopsies have also been reported [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>].

All 15 had elevated plasma viscosity as assessed by capillary viscometry (range, 1.9 to 4.2 centipoise [cP]; normal range, 1.4 to 1.8 cP). Hyperviscosity is thought to promote a hypercoagulable state. It is often associated with monoclonal gammopathies, especially Waldenström macroglobulinemia, but it can also be caused by polyclonal increases in gamma globulins and/or large increases in other proteins such as fibrinogen.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15147.html" rel="external">"Etiology and diagnosis of coagulopathy in trauma patients", section on 'Viscoelastic hemostatic assays'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4433.html" rel="external">"Platelet function testing", section on 'Viscoelastic testing (TEG and ROTEM)'</a>.)</p><p>Other studies have reported similar findings consistent with a hypercoagulable state, including very high D-dimer, VWF antigen and activity, and factor VIII activity [<a href="#rid14">14,23</a>]. One study that performed TEG on 44 ICU patients found a complete lack of clot lysis (LY30 of 0 percent) in 57 percent, referred to as "fibrinolysis shutdown" and associated with a high rate of kidney failure and thromboembolic events [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Another study suggested that patients with COVID-19 have higher platelet counts than patients with other coronavirus infections [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. A series from Ireland that included 50 patients on the regular medical ward reported similar findings to those in ICU patients, including high D-dimer and fibrinogen and normal platelet counts and clotting times [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Another study demonstrated changes in the ratio of VWF to ADAMTS13 depending on disease severity [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2496827149"><span class="h3">Prolonged aPTT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Early case series, including a series of 183 consecutive patients from Wuhan, China, suggested that thrombocytopenia and prolongation of the PT and aPTT were more marked [<a href="#rid28">28-31</a>]. It is not clear why these results differed somewhat from later findings of less severe PT and aPTT prolongation. One possible explanation is that these patients were sicker, perhaps because earlier in the pandemic the disease was not recognized as quickly, resulting in delays in patient presentation and/or treatment. </p><p>Another explanation for an isolated prolonged aPTT is the presence of a lupus anticoagulant (LA) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1368.html" rel="external">"Clinical use of coagulation tests", section on 'Causes of prolonged aPTT'</a>). Two studies have found a high rate of LA in patients with prolonged aPTT (50 of 57 tested individuals [88 percent] and 31 of 34 tested individuals [91 percent]) [<a href="#rid23">23,32</a>]. Another study that retested 10 LA-positive individuals with COVID-19 after one month found that 9 of the 10 had subsequently become negative [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. </p><p>The phenomenon of transient antiphospholipid antibody (aPL)-positivity is common in individuals with acute viral infections and does not constitute antiphospholipid syndrome. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4678.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome", section on 'Antiphospholipid antibody testing'</a>.) </p><p>However, LA-positivity may correlate with thrombosis in individuals with COVID-19 [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. The presence of an LA may lead to an artifactual prolongation of the aPTT but does not reflect an increased bleeding risk; patients with an LA should receive anticoagulation if indicated. (See <a class="local">'Management'</a> below.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3895904723"><span class="h3">ITP</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cases of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) associated with COVID-19 have been reported [<a href="#rid35">35-38</a>]. In a large series of critically ill individuals, approximately 7 percent had a platelet count &lt;50,000/microL [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. The causes of thrombocytopenia were not described in this study.</p><p>Management of ITP and safety of COVID-19 vaccination in individuals with ITP are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6677.html" rel="external">"Initial treatment of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6677.html" rel="external">"Initial treatment of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adults", section on 'COVID-19 vaccination'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2980556552"><span class="h2">Distinction from DIC</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The hypercoagulable state associated with COVID-19 has been referred to by some as a disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)-like state, especially because many affected individuals are acutely ill and meet criteria for probable DIC in a 2009 scoring system from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. The ISTH scoring system is based on laboratory findings and is only intended for use in patients with an underlying condition known to be associated with DIC [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. COVID-19 would qualify based on being a severe infection. However, the major clinical finding in COVID-19 is thrombosis, whereas the major finding in acute decompensated DIC is bleeding. (See <a class="local">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p>Laboratory parameters in COVID-19 are distinct from DIC. While both disorders can increase the D-dimer, in COVID-19, the typical findings include high fibrinogen and high factor VIII activity, suggesting that major consumption of coagulation factors is not occurring [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. In one of the largest series that reported on thromboembolic events in COVID-19, none of the patients developed overt DIC [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Coagulation abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p>The hypercoagulable state in patients with COVID-19 is more similar to compensated DIC than to acute DIC, consistent with the finding that the platelet count and aPTT are typically normal. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1306.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in adults", section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>Regardless of whether the differences or the similarities to DIC are emphasized, many of the basic principles of DIC management apply, including the importance of treating the underlying condition, basing interventions on the clinical picture rather than on laboratory testing alone, and providing anticoagulation for thrombosis and appropriate hemostatic therapies for bleeding. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1306.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in adults", section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1602916112"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The spectrum of thromboembolic manifestations is broad and appears to vary widely among different individuals and different clinical studies. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2168971709"><span class="h2">VTE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including extensive deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), was very common in acutely ill patients with COVID-19 early in the pandemic, seen in up to one-third of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), even when prophylactic anticoagulation was used [<a href="#rid42">42-44</a>]. </p><p>However, there has been a general trend over time from a higher VTE risk in hospitalized patients earlier in the pandemic towards a lower risk later in the pandemic, although VTE risk in hospitalized patients remains a serious concern [<a href="#rid45">45</a>].

The degree of hypercoagulability depends on the magnitude of the systemic inflammatory response. Fibrinogen and D-dimer may be increased. The prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) may be modestly prolonged, and mild thrombocytosis or thrombocytopenia may occur. A lupus anticoagulant (LA) is common in individuals with a prolonged aPTT. (See <a class="local">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thrombosis risk</strong> – Venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk in adults was markedly increased in the early pandemic, before vaccines and medical therapies were available, especially in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). In later studies, VTE risk has been approximately 5 to 10 percent in ICU patients and &lt;5 percent in hospitalized medical patients; rates may be lower with omicron and omicron subvariants. Pulmonary microvascular thrombosis and arterial thrombotic events such as stroke, myocardial infarction, and limb ischemia are increased to a lesser extent than VTE.
