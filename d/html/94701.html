More commonly, and typically as the result of more significant trauma, the LCL is injured along with other structures, often including those of the posterolateral corner of the knee but also possibly the anterior or posterior cruciate ligaments. The care of uncomplicated, minor LCL injuries can be supervised by primary care clinicians, but more severe injuries warrant orthopedic referral.</p><p>The presentation, evaluation, diagnosis, and nonoperative management of LCL injuries are reviewed here.

The primary posterolateral stabilizing structures are commonly considered to be the LCL, popliteus tendon, and the popliteofibular ligament (PFL). Other stabilizing structures include the biceps femoris and lateral gastrocnemius muscles and tendons; and the popliteal meniscal, fabellofibular, oblique popliteal, and arcuate ligaments [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>In addition, as an independent structure, the LCL acts as a barrier to varus instability throughout all angles of knee flexion [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The LCL may also act with the other primary posterolateral structures to prevent posterior translation [<a href="#rid4">4</a>] and external rotation of the tibia on the femur during early knee flexion (0 to 30 degrees) [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. As knee angles increase beyond 60 degrees, the LCL provides less restraint against external rotation compared to the PFL [<a href="#rid6">6</a>], and beyond 70 degrees, it does not provide significant resistance to external rotation [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8812767"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Injury to the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) represents approximately 8 percent of all knee injuries, making it the second least commonly injured knee ligament, with the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) being the least injured [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Of the knee injuries treated in this study of high school athletes, the LCL was involved in 2.5 percent of cases. In a large series of knee injuries with hemarthrosis, only 2 percent had isolated tears of the LCL or PLC, and 87 percent of involved multi-ligament injuries (eg, anterior cruciate ligament [ACL], PCL) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In a large retrospective study, approximately 48.9 percent of cases involving LCL injuries were treated with surgery; half of these cases involved multiple ligament injuries [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Approximately 25 percent of LCL injuries in the pediatric and adolescent populations also involve injury to the posterolateral corner [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. .</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8812773"><span class="h1">RISK FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is difficult to draw conclusions regarding which activities and sports pose the greatest risk, given the relative rarity of isolated lateral collateral ligament (LCL) injuries. However, several risk factors for knee injuries generally have been identified. Female gender, sports competition (versus practice), higher rates of player-to-player contact, and participation in sports that involve significant pivoting, jumping, and landing are associated with higher knee injury rates [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Among 20 popular high school sports in the United States, American football has the highest overall knee injury rate (6.29 per 10,000 athlete exposures). According to a large, retrospective Swiss study, soccer (football) and skiing accounted for the largest number of knee injuries, but tennis and gymnastics involved the largest number of LCL injuries, although such injuries were relatively uncommon [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Risk factors for soft tissue injuries of the knee of all types among United States Army soldiers include prior knee injury, increasing length of service, increasing age, prior combat deployment, infantry occupation, prior ankle injury, and prior hip injury [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8812779"><span class="h1">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The soft tissue structures about the lateral knee, often termed the "lateral complex," are arranged in layers that may appear indistinguishable. Layers of the lateral complex, from superficial to deep, include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>First layer</strong> – Iliotibial band, superficial portion of biceps femoris  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70825" href="/d/graphic/70825.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98262" href="/d/graphic/98262.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Second layer</strong> – Lateral collateral ligament (LCL)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70435" href="/d/graphic/70435.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98264" href="/d/graphic/98264.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Third layer</strong> – Joint capsule, arcuate ligament, popliteofibular ligament, popliteus tendon  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef142104" href="/d/graphic/142104.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Overall properties of the LCL</strong> – The LCL typically measures approximately 5.3 +/- 10 mm in width [<a href="#rid13">13</a>] and 60 mm in length, and is more cord-like and thicker than the fan-like medial collateral ligament (MCL) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Varus-oriented static alignment, older age, and heavier body weight are all factors associated with thicker LCLs [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The stiffness of the two collateral ligaments is comparable, although the tensile strength of the LCL is half that of the MCL [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Unlike the MCL, the LCL does not attach to the meniscus or joint capsule because of the intervening popliteus tendon.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Origin and insertion</strong> – The LCL originates on the lateral femoral condyle on the external tuberosity at a point just anterior to the lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. There are three known variations for the origin of the LCL:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Apex of the lateral epicondyle</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Fovea posterior to the lateral epicondyle</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Posterior and proximal to the lateral epicondyle, posterior to origin of popliteal tendon</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Injuries to the last two locations share equal prevalence [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. After traversing the posterolateral joint line extra-articularly, the LCL inserts on the anterior point of the fibular head as a component of the conjoined tendon along with the biceps femoris tendon [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Examination landmarks</strong> – The LCL can be palpated with the patient in the supine position and the knee flexed 90 degrees. The ligament becomes more prominent in the "figure four" position (knee flexed 90 degrees and hip externally rotated to place the ankle on the contralateral lower leg). Alternatively, the patient can be placed in a supine position with their knee flexed to 90 degrees and feet flat on the table without hip rotation. This alternative position can be useful in patients with limited hip or knee mobility.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Because of the potential difficulty differentiating among the LCL, biceps femoris tendon, and iliotibial band at the joint line, the examiner should begin palpation at the ligament’s origin on the external femoral condyle and follow the cord-like LCL distally as it courses across the joint line towards the fibular head.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Variations in pattern/shape</strong> – Although the most common morphology of the LCL is cord type, present in 69 percent of knees, there are multiple less-common variations. These include [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Band type: 26 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Mixed (band and cord): 2 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Y-shaped: 2 percent</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Anterolateral ligament (ALL)</strong> – In approximately 9 percent of individuals, the LCL is reinforced with an accessory ALL that helps to prevent excessive internal tibial rotation [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. The ALL originates at the lateral femoral epicondyle, with arms extending to the fibular head (fibular attachment) and posterior aspect of Gerdy's tubercle (tibial attachment).  </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Blood and nerve supply</strong> – Blood supply to the LCL is from the genicular network of arteries that arise from the popliteal artery, with primary contributions from the superior and inferior lateral genicular arteries  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94199" href="/d/graphic/94199.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). Innervation of the LCL varies among individuals. Both the tibial nerve and common peroneal (fibular) nerves  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef119268" href="/d/graphic/119268.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>) provide innervation [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8812829"><span class="h1">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Isolated injuries of the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) are relatively uncommon. Because of the close proximity of the second and third layers of the lateral complex, most LCL injuries occur in association with injuries to the posterolateral corner (PLC), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), and/or anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. The most common mechanism of injury producing multi-ligament knee injury involves a high energy force that combines hyperextension and varus moments (eg, knee forced laterally from a blow to the medial side) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Alternatively, injury may occur with an isolated varus hyperextension or external tibial rotation force. Typically, an isolated LCL injury, especially of lower grade, is caused by a primarily varus force.</p><p>Injuries that may occur in association with an LCL tear include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Soft tissue structures of the posterolateral corner</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anterior cruciate ligament (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/243.html" rel="external">"Anterior cruciate ligament injury"</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Posterior cruciate ligament</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lateral meniscus (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/186.html" rel="external">"Meniscal injury of the knee"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8812835"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND EXAMINATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8812842"><span class="h2">Common presentations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who have sustained a lateral collateral ligament (LCL) injury typically present following a blow to the medial or anteromedial aspect of their knee while it was fully extended, and report lateral or posterolateral knee pain. The prototypical example is of an American football player who, in the process of being tackled, is struck in the knee, which sustains a posterior varus shift while the foot is planted and knee hyperextended.</p><p>Alternatively, patients can sustain a noncontact LCL injury from a sudden varus moment (knee bending laterally) while the knee is hyperextending. Olympic weightlifters with poor lateral knee stability can sustain this type of injury during heavy lifts. Both contact and noncontact LCL injuries can involve varying degrees of tibial rotation as a component of the injury force. Patients often describe a sense of knee instability when ambulatory or stationary.</p><p>Following an LCL injury, patients may experience one or several mechanical knee symptoms, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Swelling</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Locking or catching with movement (if meniscal injury is also involved)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Giving out under stress or with any rapid motion while bearing weight (eg, moving from side to side, rotating the knee)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sense of instability with performing cutting movements (change of direction at speed)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8812848"><span class="h2">Examination findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>On initial inspection  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98262" href="/d/graphic/98262.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>), patients with an LCL injury (particularly those involving the posterolateral corner [PLC]) may demonstrate a "varus thrust gait" as the LCL fails to maintain stability and prevent excessive lateral opening. A varus thrust gait can be observed during foot strike when a gap develops in the lateral side of the knee and the patient shifts their weight to reduce their knee back to normal alignment.</p><p>Another compensatory gait pattern in which the patient maintains a flexed knee and does not allow it to reach full extension can be seen in the LCL injured patient. During the swing phase, the patient may demonstrate excess internal rotation of their tibia, and avoid complete extension of their knee in an effort to avoid a feeling of instability. During the stance phase, genu recurvatum from a hyperextended knee may be observed.</p><p>The most common examination finding in patients with an LCL injury is tenderness along the lateral knee  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89740" href="/d/graphic/89740.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). Localized soft tissue swelling may be appreciated at the site of injury.</p><p>Varus stress testing (described separately) at both full extension and 30 degrees of knee flexion is the most useful initial test to assess the severity of an LCL injury  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89745" href="/d/graphic/89745.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>). The clinician should assess for laxity relative to the contralateral knee and for focal pain provoked by the maneuver. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88813.html" rel="external">"Physical examination of the knee"</a>.)   </p><p>Additional special tests that can be used to help confirm the presence of a more complicated posterolateral soft tissue injury include the four listed below [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. The test characteristics of these maneuvers are not well studied, but when in agreement (ie, all positive or all negative) they can help to rule in or rule out PLC injury. However, for the patient in pain, it may not be feasible to perform all four maneuvers. Many experienced clinicians rely on the posterolateral drawer test and the dial test.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>External rotation recurvatum test</strong> – With the patient in a supine position, the examiner provides a stabilizing force to the femur by applying downward pressure at the level of the quadriceps tendon (suprapatellar). Next, the examiner uses their contralateral hand to lift the great toe upward while externally rotating the tibia. Excessive motion compared with the contralateral knee is indicative of posterolateral rotatory instability. A positive external rotation recurvatum test raises the possibility of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and the ACL should be carefully examined [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/243.html" rel="external">"Anterior cruciate ligament injury", section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Posterolateral drawer test</strong> – With the patient supine (with knee flexed 90 degrees, foot flat on table, and tibia externally rotated 15 degrees), the examiner introduces a combined posterior and external rotation force through the proximal tibia while observing the rotation of the tibial tubercle in reference to the femur  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef142280" href="/d/graphic/142280.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>) [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Excessive rotation compared with the asymptomatic side suggests a high-grade PLC injury, often with popliteofibular ligament and/or popliteal tendon involvement.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Reverse shift test</strong> – After placing the patient in the position described above for the posterolateral drawer test, the examiner extends the knee while applying a valgus and external rotation force [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. In the presence of a severe PLC injury, the iliotibial band can be seen reducing the posteriorly subluxed tibia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Dial test (30, 90 degrees)</strong> – With the patient prone, hold their feet and passively rotate the tibia externally, first with the knees at 30 degrees of flexion and then at 90 degrees of flexion  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93946" href="/d/graphic/93946.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>).

When the injury grade is unclear, we recommend 48 to 72 hours of rest, ice, compression, and protection with a knee immobilizer while awaiting definitive imaging and reevaluation. Optimally, however, an early determination of injury grade will provide prognostic information and allow early treatment.</p><p>Protection of the injured posterolateral structures from further injury is important for treatment.

In contrast, any injury with functional instability or associated injuries of the posterolateral corner (PLC), menisci, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), or posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) warrants timely referral to an orthopedic surgeon. Early surgical repair is usually required in such cases. In addition, orthopedic referral is recommended for all grade 3 LCL injuries because of the propensity for a poor outcome with conservative management [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. Of note, not all isolated grade 3 LCL injuries result in functional instability and necessitate surgical intervention, but repair of grade 3 injuries with PLC damage may be necessary and orthopedic referral is warranted [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p>Management of grade 1 and 2 injuries is nonoperative and should include relative rest from activities that place the injured ligament at risk of reinjury. This may require restriction from competitive play for 4 to 12 weeks and modification of occupational activities. Rehabilitative exercise may begin with gentle range of motion and isometric strength exercise, and progress to isotonic strength exercise and light aerobic activity as ROM and strength improve. Whenever possible, we suggest that patients perform their rehabilitation under the supervision of a knowledgeable physical therapist or athletic trainer.

Therefore, it is important to assess sensation and lower extremity strength (dorsiflexion, eversion) in all patients presenting with lateral knee injury. Clinicians should emphasize to patients that ice should be applied only intermittently for treatment, generally for no longer than about 15 minutes every two hours, in order to prevent this complication. There are multiple reports of foot drop following cryotherapy to the lateral knee.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8813160"><span class="h1">RETURN TO SPORT OR WORK</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Criteria for return to sport include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Full, painless knee motion</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Quadriceps and hamstring strength that is at least 90 percent of the unaffected lower extremity</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Absence of significant tenderness of the injured structures</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Absence of ligament laxity on examination </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ability to complete a functional activity involving physical demands similar to patient’s sport/work without significant pain</p><p></p><p>During activity, patients recovering from a lateral collateral ligament (LCL) injury may benefit from the added support provided by an elastic wrap or taping  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100203" href="/d/graphic/100203.html" rel="external">picture 11</a>).</p><p>In general, patients may return to play or work following LCL injury according to the following scheme:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grade 1: Approximately four weeks</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grade 2: Approximately 10 weeks</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Grade 3:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>No surgery – Approximately 10 to 14 weeks</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Surgery – Surgical recovery time plus approximately 10 weeks</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8813166"><span class="h1">PREVENTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>No high-quality evidence is available to help determine the effectiveness of common measures, such as knee braces, used to prevent lateral collateral ligament (LCL) or posterolateral corner (PLC) injuries.

(See  <a class="medical medical_society_guidelines" href="/d/html/119301.html" rel="external">"Society guideline links: Meniscal injury"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_society_guidelines" href="/d/html/113722.html" rel="external">"Society guideline links: Knee pain"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8813179"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Epidemiology and mechanism of injury</strong> – Isolated injuries of the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) are among the least common knee injuries but can occur when the joint is struck from the inside (varus stress). More commonly, the LCL is injured along with other structures, often including those of the posterolateral corner (PLC) of the knee, but also possibly the anterior or posterior cruciate ligaments, during more significant trauma. The most common mechanism of injury producing multi-ligament knee injury involves a high energy force that combines knee hyperextension and varus moments. (See <a class="local">'Biomechanics'</a> above and <a class="local">'Clinical anatomy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical presentation and examination</strong> – Patients typically present following a blow to the medial or anteromedial aspect of their knee while it was fully extended and report lateral or posterolateral knee pain. The knee may be swollen and the patient may describe mechanical symptoms, such as locking, catching, or giving out. Observation may reveal gait abnormalities as the patient attempts to compensate for lateral knee instability. Examination findings typically include tenderness along the lateral knee and widening of the lateral knee joint with varus stress testing  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89745" href="/d/graphic/89745.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>). (See <a class="local">'Mechanism of injury'</a> above and <a class="local">'Clinical presentation and examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Given how often LCL tears occur in association with other significant knee injuries, the clinician should examine all structures at risk of injury in any patient with lateral knee pain following trauma, except when this is not possible due to the extent of injury or degree of pain. These structures include the PLC, anterior and posterior cruciate ligament injuries, and the lateral meniscus. (See <a class="local">'Associated injuries'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88813.html" rel="external">"Physical examination of the knee"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – A preliminary diagnosis of LCL injury is made based upon a suggestive history and correlative physical examination findings. Clinicians facile with musculoskeletal ultrasound often use it to confirm the diagnosis. Although not always needed for mild injuries, a definitive diagnosis can be made with magnetic resonance imaging. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a class="local">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indications for orthopedic consultation</strong> – Indications for surgical referral in the acute setting include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>LCL tear with presence of functional instability (grade 3 injuries)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>LCL tear associated with other significant soft tissue knee injury (eg, posterior cruciate ligament tear, meniscal tear)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Posterolateral corner injury</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Mid-portion, compete LCL tears with or without associated injuries and functional instability</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Indications for orthopedic consultation in the follow-up setting include grade 1 or 2 injuries that fail to progress or that worsen after four weeks of conservative management.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong> – The differential diagnosis for acute LCL injury includes lateral meniscus tear, tibiofemoral dislocation, anterior and posterior cruciate ligament tears, popliteus injury, physis injury, bone contusion, and injury of the proximal tibiofibular syndesmosis. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong> – LCL injuries are treated initially with standard interventions, including rest, limited icing, compression, and analgesics. Weight-bearing status and the level of protection needed for the knee joint vary according to the severity of injury. The details of initial management and a plan for follow-up care are provided. Isolated, minor LCL injuries are typically managed with physical therapy; orthopedic referral is obtained for more complicated injuries involving the LCL alone or additional knee structures.
