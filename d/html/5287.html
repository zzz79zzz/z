We also treat other patients with moderate to severe symptoms and electrodiagnostic features consistent with mild or moderate CTS (without axon loss) with initial nonsurgical measures.</p><p>Nonsurgical interventions include splinting, glucocorticoids, physical and occupational therapy techniques (eg, carpal bone mobilization and nerve-gliding exercises), yoga, and therapeutic ultrasound. Up to two-thirds of patients with mild to moderate CTS symptoms have successful outcomes with nonsurgical therapy [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p>Patients with moderate to severe CTS and axonal loss on electrodiagnostic testing and those whose symptoms persist or worsen despite initial nonsurgical therapy are typically referred for surgical decompression. (See <a class="local">'Surgery for patients with severe or persisting symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H99455120"><span class="h2">General measures for all patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several patient-level factors may contribute to the etiology of CTS including heredity, size of the carpal tunnel, associated local and systemic diseases, and habits. Predisposing conditions include thyroid disease, diabetes, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, and other connective tissue diseases. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5258.html" rel="external">"Carpal tunnel syndrome: Pathophysiology and risk factors", section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Evaluation and management of these predisposing environmental factors and medical conditions is warranted, although it is uncertain whether treating these conditions will improve the symptoms or the course of CTS.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H741142583"><span class="h2">Initial therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We suggest nocturnal wrist splinting in the neutral position or a glucocorticoid injection as initial nonsurgical therapy. Splinting may be selected by patients who prefer a noninvasive approach. Glucocorticoid injection may be preferred by those who prioritize faster onset of symptom relief or who are unable to adhere to a regimen of wrist splinting. Either approach can reduce CTS symptoms and may delay or eliminate the need for surgery in mildly symptomatic patients [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1851906970"><span class="h3">Wrist splinting</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A wrist splint or brace maintains the wrist in a neutral position, thus preventing prolonged flexion or extension of the wrist. Splinting may limit activities that raise pressure within the carpal tunnel or reduce its cross-sectional area.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Regimen </strong>– Splints are usually worn at night, but they can be worn continuously. Night splinting alone can reduce symptom severity and improve median nerve conduction velocities [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>]. Full-time splinting has been reported to improve median nerve conduction in small studies, but it may not improve symptoms when compared with night-only splinting [<a href="#rid6">6,9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Splints can be purchased over the counter (OTC) or be custom made by an occupational therapist with subspecialty certification in hand therapy. There are no studies comparing treatment outcomes with custom splints versus OTC models.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Duration </strong>– A trial of one to two months is reasonable to assess the initial response to nocturnal splinting. Splinting may be continued longer or used continuously, if feasible, for patients who report improving symptoms. For those who report inadequate relief after an initial trial, additional therapies may be combined with splinting. (See <a class="local">'Combination therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>A 2023 systematic review found eight trials with 523 hands that evaluated nocturnal wrist splinting versus no treatment [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Splinting modestly improved short-term symptoms (&lt;3 months), but available evidence was of low certainty and longer-term benefit was uncertain. Clinical features that may favor a long-term clinical response to splinting are shorter duration of symptoms (one year or less) and less severe nocturnal paresthesias [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>Splinting and glucocorticoid injection appear similarly effective [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. This was demonstrated in an open-label trial of 234 patients with mild to moderate CTS of at least six weeks in duration who were randomly assigned to a single <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9639" href="/d/drug information/9639.html" rel="external">methylprednisolone</a> acetate injection (20 mg) or night splinting [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Patients in the glucocorticoid group had lower scores on the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) at six weeks compared with the splinting group (adjusted mean difference -0.32 points, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.16), but the clinical significance of this small difference is unclear. In addition, all outcomes were similar at six months, including pain scores, insomnia, functional measures, and the proportion of patients referred to surgery (19 and 12 percent for injection and splinting groups, respectively). Adverse effects were mild and transient. Approximately half of patients reported increased hand or wrist pain immediately after injection, one-third of whom reported that pain lasted for more than three days before subsiding. Six percent of patients in the splinting group could not wear the splints as instructed due to discomfort.</p><p>In a follow-up study at 24 months that assessed the durability of initial treatment regimens, patients assigned to initial glucocorticoid injection or splinting had similar overall response rates, BCTQ scores, and pain scale scores [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Subsequent referral for surgery was more frequent in patients assigned initially to a glucocorticoid injection (28 versus 20 percent), but the generalizability of this finding is limited by the variable use of repeat injections or prolonged splinting as well as crossover treatments following the initial six-week trial and by the &gt;30 percent loss to follow-up by 24 months.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2935002239"><span class="h3">Glucocorticoid injection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Injection of glucocorticoids into the region of the carpal tunnel is intended to reduce tissue inflammation and to aid recovery. For patients who are amenable to a minimally invasive option, injection is an alternative to splinting for short-term relief of symptoms.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Regimen </strong>– We typically use a single injection of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9639" href="/d/drug information/9639.html" rel="external">methylprednisolone</a> (20 to 40 mg) with 1% <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a>. Other glucocorticoids such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9139" href="/d/drug information/9139.html" rel="external">betamethasone</a> may also be used. The carpal tunnel may be identified by ultrasound guidance or anatomic landmarks [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. For injections proximal to the carpal tunnel, the wrist is extended and needle is typically inserted on the ulnar side of the palmaris longus tendon approximately 1 cm proximal to the wrist crease [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. The needle is repositioned before injection if aspirated blood indicates vascular penetration or if immediate paresthesias indicate nerve penetration.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Glucocorticoids can also be injected distal to the carpal tunnel. In one study of 131 CTS patients receiving either proximal or distal injections, distal injections were found more painful, but there was no difference between groups in functional or symptomatic outcome at three months [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Referral to an occupational therapist with subspecialty certification in hand therapy may improve outcomes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Adverse effects </strong>– Injections appear to be generally a safe procedure. However, injection therapy is associated with several risks, including exacerbation of median nerve compression, accidental injection into the median or ulnar nerves, and digital flexor tendon rupture [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Repeat injections </strong>– Although there is no clear consensus, we suggest limiting the frequency of glucocorticoid injections for symptom recurrence to no more than once every six months per wrist. For patients who report partial relief after an initial injection, additional therapies may be combined with a repeat injection. (See <a class="local">'Combination therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For other patients with symptoms unresponsive to glucocorticoid injection and for those whose symptoms recur after one to two injections, we suggest other nonsurgical treatments or surgical evaluation. (See <a class="local">'Additional nonsurgical options if initial therapy is ineffective'</a> below and <a class="local">'Surgery for patients with severe or persisting symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Glucocorticoid injections are effective for short-term (one to three months) relief of CTS symptoms compared with placebo [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>]. A 2023 systematic review that included 14 trials found that glucocorticoid injections provided greater improvement in both symptoms and hand function at three months than placebo [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. In one trial, 81 patients with CTS refractory to splinting were assigned to injection with glucocorticoid (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9139" href="/d/drug information/9139.html" rel="external">betamethasone</a> 6 mg in 1 mL and 1 mL of 1% <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a>) or sham (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> plus lidocaine) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Patients treated with glucocorticoids were likelier to report significant symptom relief at two weeks following the injection than those treated with sham injections (70 versus 34 percent, respectively). When nonresponders to sham injection subsequently received a betamethasone injection, the proportion reporting subsequent symptom improvement was 73 percent. In another trial, 111 patients with CTS were assigned to treatment with injections of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9639" href="/d/drug information/9639.html" rel="external">methylprednisolone</a> 80 mg, methylprednisolone 40 mg, or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Most patients were symptomatic for &gt;1 year and had symptoms unresponsive to splinting. At 10 weeks, improvement in CTS symptom severity score was significantly greater for the methylprednisolone 80 mg and methylprednisolone 40 mg groups compared with placebo.</p><p>Glucocorticoid injections also provide longer term symptomatic benefit and may reduce the need for surgery, but these data are less certain [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. In an uncontrolled extension of a trial using <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9139" href="/d/drug information/9139.html" rel="external">betamethasone</a> that reported benefit in 70 percent, only 4 of 46 patients (9 percent) whose CTS symptoms improved following an initial injection had good symptomatic control for up to 18 months [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Additional injections (two to seven) controlled symptoms in 13 others (28 percent); surgical referral was requested by 18 patients (43 percent). Similarly, in the trial assessing <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9639" href="/d/drug information/9639.html" rel="external">methylprednisolone</a> versus placebo at 10 weeks, the benefits of methylprednisolone were lost by assessment at one year [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. In a follow-up analysis of this study at five years, symptom severity remained similar between groups and most had undergone carpal tunnel release surgery (91 percent) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. However, treatment with methylprednisolone 80 mg and 40 mg was associated with a delay in the need for surgery compared with placebo (mean 180 and 185 versus 121 days). The generalizability of these results is somewhat limited by the inclusion of patients with prolonged symptoms (&gt;1 year). Additional data are warranted to assess the long-term effect of glucocorticoid injections for patients with recent-onset or milder symptoms.</p><p>The effectiveness of glucocorticoid injection appears similar to wrist splinting.

Nerve gliding is aimed at restoring normal movement of the median nerve. It is thought that nerve compression may lead to "tethering" of the median nerve, resulting in decreased nerve excursion and increased mechanical strain [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].

A 2013 systematic review concluded that the available data from clinical trials provide only low-quality evidence that ultrasound may provide symptom improvement in CTS [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].
