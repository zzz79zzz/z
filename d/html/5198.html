         Diffuse astrocytomas represent the most common group of infiltrative primary brain tumors in adults. They exist on a spectrum of biologic aggressiveness, but all are incurable and the vast majority are life limiting.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since discovery of the importance of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations in the pathogenesis and prognosis of diffuse gliomas, classification of astrocytomas has evolved, and treatment decisions are now considered separately for IDH-mutant astrocytomas and IDH-wildtype astrocytomas (eg, glioblastoma). Across all grades, the presence of an IDH mutation identifies a group of tumors with a more prolonged natural history and favorable prognosis than that of IDH-wildtype tumors. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5211.html" rel="external">
          "Classification and pathologic diagnosis of gliomas, glioneuronal tumors, and neuronal tumors"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Historically, management of patients with diffuse gliomas has been based on histologic subtype and tumor grade and informed by results from clinical trials in patients with both astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors, carried out prior to the recognition of the molecular and prognostic differences among these tumors. In some cases, tumor specimens were later assessed for IDH and 1p/19q status and data reanalyzed according to the modern World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Going forward, trials are increasingly being aligned with integrated molecular tumor diagnoses rather than historical groupings of low-grade glioma and high-grade glioma.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will review the initial management of IDH-mutant astrocytomas, grades 2, 3, and 4. Management of other diffuse gliomas is covered elsewhere:

         Maximal safe resection is the preferred initial approach to patients with suspected diffuse gliomas of all grades, even for tumors discovered incidentally. Depending upon the location and extent of the tumor, only a partial resection or even just a biopsy may be safely feasible. Surgical management of suspected diffuse gliomas should take place at high-volume centers with oncologic neurosurgical expertise whenever possible.

          Surgical planning
         </strong>
         – Preoperative neurosurgical evaluation may include tools such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging to help delineate the safety and feasibility of tumor resection. A variety of intraoperative techniques allow neurosurgeons to improve the extent of resection while minimizing damage to normal brain. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5228.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Timing of surgery
         </strong>
         – Surgery is typically performed at the time of initial presentation for patients with large or symptomatic astrocytomas as well as tumors with features concerning for high-grade histology (eg, enhancement, central necrosis, edema). For patients with small nonenhancing tumors and minimal symptoms, the role of immediate surgical intervention versus delayed resection has been debated [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. However, the field has generally moved to favor maximal safe resection at the time of diagnosis for these patients as well, based upon observational data and reviews of the literature that have found a trend toward improved survival with this approach, even in patients with asymptomatic, incidentally discovered tumors [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3-8
         </a>
         ]. In addition, because neuroimaging cannot establish grade or histology, early surgery permits a definitive histopathologic and molecular diagnosis, which informs treatment selection, urgency, and prognosis.

         </span>
         <strong>
          Extent of resection
         </strong>
         – In patients with tumors that are amenable to resection, observational studies provide support for a more extensive resection rather than partial resection or biopsy [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,9-14
         </a>
         ]. In such studies, the completeness of initial resection of a diffuse glioma is an independent predictor of both progression-free survival and overall survival [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         When molecularly defined subsets of diffuse gliomas are analyzed according to contemporary World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, the advantage of extensive resection exists across all molecular subtypes but appears to be most relevant for IDH-mutant astrocytomas. In these tumors, even limited residual disease on postoperative MRI (eg, ≤5 cm
         <sup>
          3
         </sup>
         ) may be associated with a negative impact on overall survival when compared with complete resection [

         </span>
         Surgery alone is not curative in patients with diffuse gliomas, even for grade 2 tumors, and additional therapy (eg, radiation and chemotherapy) is ultimately required in nearly all patients. While there is general agreement that most grade 3 and 4 IDH-mutant astrocytomas should be treated at the time of diagnosis with radiation and chemotherapy, the optimal timing of additional therapy for patients with grade 2 tumors is less certain, and the decision to proceed with immediate versus delayed postoperative therapy should be individualized. The approach is also evolving with the development of IDH-targeted therapies.

         Patients with a newly diagnosed IDH-mutant grade 2 astrocytoma will soon have three options for postoperative management, outside of clinical trials: watchful waiting, RT plus chemotherapy, and IDH-targeted therapy. Use of an IDH inhibitor in this setting is based on results of the INDIGO trial of vorasidenib (an investigational IDH1/2 inhibitor not yet approved by the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA]), presented at the 2023 American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting and discussed separately.

         Until vorasidenib becomes available for clinical use, the approach reviewed below continues to be applicable for most patients. This approach  (

         <strong>
          Our approach
         </strong>
         – For most patients who undergo gross total resection of an IDH-mutant grade 2 astrocytoma, we suggest initial observation after surgery, rather than immediate postoperative radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef135150" href="/z/d/graphic/135150.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). It is expected that these tumors will eventually recur and require additional therapy at the time of progression. As discussed below, supporting evidence indicates that delaying RT in this setting does not appear to detract from overall survival, while it does postpone the potential toxicities of therapy [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22-24
         </a>
         ]. Patients who are uncomfortable with the uncertainties surrounding observation may reasonably choose immediate postoperative therapy, even though this approach is associated with more toxicity in the short term. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Subtotal resection'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Of note, a variety of factors have been used or proposed to define a high-risk subgroup after gross total resection that warrants immediate treatment. The most common of these are older age (&gt;40 years, for example), large preoperative tumor volume (eg, ≥4 cm), and the presence of neurologic deficits. Use of these factors to support early therapy is complicated, however, because they are primarily prognostic indicators (rather than predictive), and they have not been tested in prospective trials to identify which patients may benefit from early treatment, particularly for a genetically uniform group of IDH-mutant tumors.

         Practice regarding the importance of individual risk factors varies among experts, including the authors of this topic.

         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Data from retrospective series of IDH-mutant astrocytomas suggest that the age limit that carries a worse prognosis is probably higher than previously thought (50 to 60 years) [

         – The outcomes of early versus delayed RT in low-grade glioma are illustrated by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 22845 trial, which randomly assigned 311 patients with low-grade gliomas to receive either immediate RT (54 Gy in six weeks) or no therapy until progression following initial biopsy or resection [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. At a median follow-up of almost eight years, immediate postoperative RT prolonged progression-free survival compared with initial observation (5.4 versus 3.7 years) but did not affect overall survival (7.4 versus 7.2 years). Seizure control was better in the early RT group. The majority of patients in the no-therapy group (65 percent) received RT at progression. Among patients who underwent surgery at the time of recurrence, approximately two-thirds of tumors were high grade in each group. The IDH mutational status of the tumors of patients in this study is unknown.

         The absence of a survival benefit for early RT compared with RT at the time of progression suggests that RT slows the progression of low-grade gliomas but does not prevent transformation into high-grade gliomas. These results are generally felt to justify postponing the potential toxicities of RT in patients who undergo complete resection of a newly diagnosed IDH-mutant astrocytoma, some of whom may not require further therapy for many years.

          Natural history after complete resection
         </strong>
         – The natural history of initial observation for completely resected diffuse astrocytomas is largely informed by older studies that enrolled a mix of astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors with unknown IDH status. In a prospective series of 111 patients with low-grade glioma who were felt to have a gross tumor resection based upon surgical assessment, the overall survival rates at two and five years were 99 and 93 percent, respectively [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. Approximately 50 percent of patients remained progression free at five years. Factors associated with earlier recurrence included large tumor size (≥4 cm), astrocytoma or oligoastrocytoma histology rather than oligodendroglioma, and residual disease ≥1 cm by MRI. In small retrospective series of patients with molecularly confirmed IDH-mutant grade 2 astrocytomas who are observed after initial surgery, five-year progression-free survival rates range from 30 to 40 percent overall, with higher rates after more extensive resections [

         Active surveillance after surgery alone typically involves MRI with contrast every three to four months [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. Some clinicians lengthen the follow-up interval to six months after one to two years of stable imaging, given the long progression-free survival in many of these patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         IDH-mutant grade 2 astrocytomas may recur locally at the margins of the resection cavity, and interpretation of small changes over time can be challenging. It can sometimes take several years for the clinician to become confident that minor changes or increases in nonenhancing T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal are definitively progressive and indicative of tumor recurrence. Not every minor change is an immediate reason for further treatment; especially in slow-growing lesions, it can be cumbersome to identify the right moment for further treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         In rare cases, tumor regrowth occurs more precipitously, with rapid change from one MRI to the next suggesting transformation to a higher-grade tumor. In addition to rapid interval growth, other clues of malignant degeneration include the development of new neurologic symptoms, enhancement, or peritumoral edema.

         Management of recurrent or progressive tumors in patients who have been observed following initial resection of an IDH-mutant grade 2 glioma is individualized. Decisions take into account the rate of change from one MRI interval to the next, the overall volume of tumor, its location in the brain and resectability, patient preferences with regard to more surgery, development of contrast enhancement, and histopathologic grade of the progressive tumor, when available.

         For patients with a relatively low volume of recurrent, nonenhancing tumor or those who are not eligible for or do not wish to undergo further surgery, we typically proceed with RT plus chemotherapy, per standard of care for IDH-mutant grade 2 astrocytomas. (See

         For patients with a large or rapidly progressive recurrence, reresection is often indicated for debulking, which may also provide tumor grade and a molecular diagnosis if that was not yet available. Postoperative management typically includes RT and chemotherapy, as described below for newly diagnosed patients. (See

         Immediate postoperative therapy is appropriate for most patients with a newly diagnosed IDH-mutant grade 2 astrocytoma who have significant residual or symptomatic tumor (apart from well-controlled seizures) after maximal safe resection  (

        <p>
         Of note, the amount of tumor that constitutes significant residual disease is not strictly defined. Modest amounts of residual grade 2 tumor after surgery, even measuring &gt;1 to 2 cm, may be reasonably observed in some cases, provided that the patient is asymptomatic from the tumor aside from well-controlled epilepsy [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16
         </a>
         ]. As discussed above, such patients should be followed with serial neuroimaging, and determining when to initiate therapy in the face of small and incremental changes in residual tumor can be challenging. (See

         – In the RTOG 9802 trial, 251 patients with a high-risk low-grade glioma were randomly assigned to postoperative RT (54 Gy in 30 fractions) with or without six cycles of adjuvant PCV chemotherapy [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25,34
         </a>
         ]. High risk was defined as age 18 to 39 years with subtotal resection or biopsy, or age ≥40 years with any extent of resection. Tumor histology was diffuse astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and mixed oligoastrocytoma in 26, 42, and 32 percent of cases, respectively. With a median follow-up time of 11.9 years, the combination of RT plus PCV improved both progression-free and overall survival compared with RT alone (median overall survival 13.3 versus 7.8 years, hazard ratio [HR] 0.59, p = 0.003) [
         <a href="#rid25">

         We generally do not offer chemotherapy alone as initial therapy for patients with IDH-mutant astrocytomas, as these tumors are not as chemosensitive as oligodendrogliomas. A potential exception is patients with extensive tumors, which would require a very large RT field, although progression-free survival is likely shorter with

All trials enrolled patients prior to the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) revised classification and therefore included a mix of grade 3 tumors with variable 1p/19q codeletion and IDH mutation status. Although temozolomide and PCV have not been compared head-to-head in this setting, temozolomide is more convenient and less toxic, and its use is supported by randomized data in IDH-mutant grade 3 astrocytomas.

Others favor 12 monthly cycles based on the CATNON trial results and the biologic similarity between grade 3 and 4 IDH-mutant astrocytomas. There is no evidence to support one regimen as "more aggressive" than another in terms of efficacy, and the risk of hematologic toxicity may be higher with concurrent therapy, particularly in females.

         – Brain MRI has traditionally been obtained two to six weeks after completion of radiation therapy (RT), before starting adjunctive chemotherapy. However, with a median progression-free survival of six to eight years in clinical trials of grade 2 and 3 IDH-mutant astrocytomas, early post-RT progression is unlikely, and postponing the first MRI scan until four months after the end of RT in these patients limits the risks of picking up pseudoprogression. During adjunctive chemotherapy, brain MRIs are typically obtained every two to three cycles.

          Post-treatment

         – After completion of initial RT plus chemotherapy, MRIs should be obtained at least every six months indefinitely for grade 2 and 3 tumors and every three to four months indefinitely for grade 4 tumors. Patients treated with RT alone or chemotherapy alone should be imaged as often as every three to four months but at least every six months until progression. Earlier MRIs should be obtained as clinically indicated in the event of a clinical change such as development of seizures or neurologic deterioration.

         Pseudoprogression refers to the phenomenon of progressive, radiation-induced enhancing lesions on MRI within a prior radiation field that spontaneously improve without treatment or, upon biopsy, are found to represent radiation necrosis rather than active tumor  (

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Pseudoprogression should always be considered on the differential diagnosis of tumor recurrence or progression when patients with a diffuse glioma develop new enhancement within a prior radiation field [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58-63
         </a>
         ]. In a retrospective study of 106 patients who received radiation therapy (RT) for low-grade glioma, pseudoprogression occurred in 23 percent of patients at a median of 8.8 months after RT completion [
         <a href="#rid63">
          63
         </a>
         ]. The cumulative incidence of pseudoprogression was 13 percent at one year, 22 percent at five years, and 28 percent at 10 years. The majority of cases were asymptomatic (83 percent). Mean lesion volume was 2.4 cm
         <sup>
          3
         </sup>
         . In a separate study, the median time to lesion resolution was six months (range 2 to 26) [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]. Some but not all studies have reported a predilection for periventricular and subependymal location.
        </p>
        <p>
         The characteristics of pseudoprogression may vary based on the type of RT (eg, photon versus proton). In a study of 57 patients who received proton RT for low-grade glioma, pseudoprogression was seen in 25 percent of patients at a mean of 15 months after RT [
         <a href="#rid64">
          64
         </a>
         ]. The pattern of enhancement tended to be multifocal, patchy, small (&lt;1 cm), and at the distal ends of the proton beam, where the radiobiologic effect is speculated to be higher. By contrast, no cases of pseudoprogression were seen among 43 low-grade glioma patients treated with photons at the same institution. It is unclear if the risk of pseudoprogression is driven by radiation modality (protons versus photons), net biologic dose delivered, or other factors.
        </p>
        <p>
         Distinguishing recurrent disease from radiation necrosis can be difficult using imaging procedures including MRI and positron emission tomography (PET), and biopsy may be required (although it carries a risk of sampling error). Most small enhancing lesions that arise after RT can be safely followed initially without a change in treatment or biopsy, especially if the location is subependymal. (See

         Following a complete course of RT (45 to 60 Gy), retreatment with conventional external beam RT is usually not feasible due to an increased risk of neurotoxicity and radiation-induced necrosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Occasionally, reirradiation can be safely delivered to the area of recurrence without undue risk of complications by limiting the volume of area of retreatment and minimizing the dose of radiation to normal structures. The possible role of radiation was illustrated by a series of 172 patients with recurrent gliomas, including 71 with grade 2 tumors and 101 with grade 3 or 4 lesions [
         <a href="#rid65">
          65
         </a>
         ]. All had previously received a definitive course of RT, with a median dose of 60 Gy. At recurrence, all patients received an additional 36 Gy in 18 fractions, using stereotactic radiotherapy to improve conformal delivery. Treatment was well tolerated, and median survival following reirradiation among patients with low-grade gliomas was 22 months.

        <p>
         Two historical studies, which included patients with both grade 2 astrocytomas and oligodendroglial tumors without information on IDH status, reported that the objective response rates to

          66,67

         Once tumors show high-grade transformation, response rates and duration of response are similar to those in relapsed anaplastic astrocytoma, with approximately two-thirds of patients alive and progression free at six months [

         IDH-mutant astrocytomas in adults are treatable but incurable tumors, and the vast majority are life limiting.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the pre-IDH era, diffuse astrocytomas were a heterogeneous group of tumors with a broad and somewhat unpredictable range of biologic behavior and prognosis. The molecular categorization of these tumors according to IDH mutation status has greatly improved prognostic accuracy compared with histologic categorization alone. Further, when IDH status is taken into account, the prognostic difference between grade 2 and grade 3 tumors becomes much less pronounced.
        </p>
        <p>
         For fully characterized IDH-mutant astrocytomas, median survival estimates range from approximately 2 to 12 years depending on the integrated diagnosis, including tumor grade [

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         For most patients with IDH-mutant astrocytomas, there will be a period of relative radiographic and clinical stability after initial therapy that may be as long as 5 to 10 years for grade 2 or 3 tumors and as short as one to two years for grade 4 tumors, especially in the presence of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B (
         <em>
          CDKN2A/B
         </em>
         ) homozygous deletion. Tumor growth eventually accelerates in nearly all patients, with shorter intervals between subsequent recurrences, heralding poor outcome [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinical and molecular prognostic factors for IDH-mutant astrocytomas are evolving, and some traditional factors, such as patient age, require reexamination in pathologically homogeneous cohorts. Among histologically lower-grade IDH-mutant gliomas, homozygous deletion of
         <em>
          CDKN2A/B
         </em>
         is a negative prognostic marker, and as of the 2021 revision of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, the presence of a
         <em>
          CDKN2A/B
         </em>
         deletion in an IDH-mutant astrocytoma established the tumor as grade 4, independent of histologic grade. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         In the pre-IDH era, a meta-analysis of four large phase III studies of patients with centrally confirmed histologically low-grade gliomas (astrocytic and oligodendroglial) found that both progression-free survival and overall survival were negatively influenced by the presence of baseline neurologic deficits, a shorter time since first symptoms (&lt;30 weeks), an astrocytic tumor type, and tumors larger than 5 cm in diameter [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. Age was not an independent prognostic factor in the adjusted analysis, and subsequent studies in IDH-mutant astrocytomas suggest that if older age is a risk factor, the cutoff is likely higher than previously thought (eg, 50 to 60 years) [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26,27
         </a>
         ]. Male sex is also a negative prognostic factor in IDH-mutant gliomas, for reasons that are not yet clear [
         <a href="#rid81">
          81
         </a>
         ]. Further study is needed to determine whether other prognostic factors remain valid in tumors with uniform IDH mutation status, or whether other factors are more important.

          Timing of additional therapy

         – For most patients who undergo gross total resection of an IDH-mutant grade 2 astrocytoma, we suggest observation after surgery, rather than immediate adjuvant therapy (

Patients who are uncomfortable with the uncertainties of observation may reasonably choose immediate postoperative therapy, even though this approach is associated with more side effects in the short term.

Although the two regimens have not been compared directly when given in combination with RT, supporting evidence for 12 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide is at least as good as that for six cycles of PCV for astrocytic tumors, and temozolomide is easier to administer and better tolerated.

          Recurrent disease
         </strong>
         – Surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy all can have a role in the management of patients who recur after initial therapy, and their application needs to be individualized based upon the site and extent of recurrence, along with the history of prior treatment. (See
         <a class="local">

          Prognosis
         </strong>
         – IDH-mutant astrocytomas in adults are treatable but incurable tumors, and the vast majority are life limiting. Median overall survival is approximately 3 years for grade 4 tumors, 7 to 9 years for grade 3 tumors, and more than 10 years for grade 2 tumors. (See
