The disorder is usually lifelong and causes disturbance in functioning (eg, family relations, school, and work) [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>Typical behaviors include criminality and failure to conform to the law, failure to sustain consistent employment, manipulation of others for personal gain, and failure to develop stable interpersonal relationships. Other features of ASPD include lacking empathy for others, rarely experiencing remorse, and failing to learn from the negative results of one’s experiences [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>].</p><p>This topic describes the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder. Treatment of antisocial personality disorder is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14643.html" rel="external">"Antisocial personality disorder: Treatment overview"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H335149157"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H335149164"><span class="h2">Antisocial personality disorder</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is characterized by behaviors constituting a pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others that begins in childhood or early adolescence and is manifested by disturbances in many areas of life, including family relations, schooling, work, military service, and marriage. Sociopathy is a lay term essentially synonymous with antisocial personality disorder that has been used less over time.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H335149172"><span class="h2">Psychopathy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Psychopathy has been described as a clinical construct distinct from ASPD. It is defined by a constellation of antisocial behaviors and psychological symptoms, such as lack of emotional connection with others and an incapacity for guilt or remorse [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. In contrast, except for “lacking remorse,” the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for ASPD mainly focus on observable behavioral manifestations. Psychopathy indicates a particularly malignant form of ASPD and appears to fall at the severe end of the antisocial behavior spectrum [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Most psychopaths meet criteria for ASPD, but not all persons with ASPD are psychopathic.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H335149180"><span class="h2">Conduct disorder</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ASPD overlaps conceptually and diagnostically with conduct disorder, a mental disorder of childhood and adolescence. Conduct disorder is diagnosed in children and adolescents with a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior violating basic rights of others or major societal norms or rules. While most children with conduct disorder do not develop adult ASPD, they are at risk to do so, with an estimated 25 percent of girls and 40 percent of boys eventually developing ASPD [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H31582471"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Large epidemiologic surveys conducted in the United States and United Kingdom have shown that 2 to 5 percent of the adult population met criteria for lifetime antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). Based on these data, males have greater risk of ASPD than do females [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. As an example, in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) study, the risk of ASPD was 3 times greater among men than women [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>The Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) survey of five United States cities found 2 to 4 percent of men and 0.5 to 1 percent of women met these criteria [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Two nationally representative surveys of United States adults, the National Comorbidity Study and the NESARC study, estimated prevalence rates of 3.5 and 3.6 percent, respectively; the latter survey found a rate of 5.5 percent for men and 1.9 percent for women [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. The British National Survey of Psychiatric Morbidity reported a prevalence of 2.9 percent for ASPD in the United Kingdom [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H237333"><span class="h2">Special settings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Survey results may underestimate the prevalence of ASPD in the general population because they lack data on institutionalized and incarcerated persons. A study conducted in the in the United States adult prison population in the 1970s found that as many as 80 percent of incarcerated men and 65 percent of incarcerated women had ASPD [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Data suggest that the prevalence of ASPD in prisons in the United States may have declined over the past decade as the prison population has increased and sentencing laws have become harsher. As an example, only 35 percent of prisoners assessed with a structured instrument in 2010 were diagnosed with ASPD [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>Studies have found a high prevalence of ASPD among certain patient groups. As examples, the prevalence of ASPD in persons with alcohol use disorder has ranged between 16 percent and 49 percent, and the prevalence for ASPD among individuals dependent on heroin and drugs is even higher [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Homelessness is associated with the presence of ASPD [<a href="#rid17">17</a>], which may reflect impoverishment related to a poor work record, inability to fulfill obligations (eg, rent payments), or because of co-occurring substance misuse [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H237326"><span class="h2">Socioeconomic correlates</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ASPD is associated with low socioeconomic status, which can be attributed in part to poor educational achievement, poor job performance, and frequent unemployment [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. In the NESARC study, respondents with lower educational levels and lower income levels were at increased risk for ASPD [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. People with ASPD are also more likely than those without ASPD to receive public assistance. Financial dependency persists even among those who have symptomatically improved suggesting the enduring consequences of ASPD affect future employability and self-sufficiency [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p>Surveys have found higher rates of ASPD among younger compared to older adults [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Findings on the association between racial/ethnic status and ASPD are mixed [<a href="#rid2">2,12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H237319"><span class="h2">Comorbidity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Persons with ASPD have high rates of other psychiatric diagnoses, including substance misuse, mood and anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), specific learning disorders, gambling disorder, and other personality disorders (eg, borderline personality disorder) [<a href="#rid8">8,20-24</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a large, nationally representative study in the United States, a current alcohol disorder was nearly five times more likely among individuals with ASPD than persons without ASPD, and the risk for a current drug use disorder was nearly 12 times expectation [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>On a lifetime basis, nearly 84 percent of antisocial persons surveyed in the ECA study had some form of substance use disorder [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the NESARC study, 23 percent of persons with pathological gambling also met criteria for ASPD [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a study of 797 persons in Iowa, 35 percent of persons with ASPD had a lifetime history of major depression and 27 percent had a phobic disorder [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a follow-up study of adult outcome of 85 hyperactive boys, the risk of ASPD was four times greater among those with ADHD than among controls [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H104021809"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The cause of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is unknown, but research suggests that both genetic and nongenetic factors are involved in its development.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H104021816"><span class="h2">Genetics</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Family, twin, and adoption studies support a genetic diathesis for ASPD [<a href="#rid27">27-31</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Family studies have shown that nearly 20 percent of first-degree relatives of patients with ASPD have the disorder themselves [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Data from twin studies have found monozygotic concordance of nearly 67 percent compared with 31 percent concordance for dizygotic twins [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Adoption studies have found that ASPD was more frequent in male adoptees with biologic relatives with ASPD, but that dysfunctional family life in the adopted family increased the likelihood of ASPD developing in the adoptee [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. Elements of family dysfunction in the studies included a member of the adoptive family with ASPD, divorced adoptive parents or caregivers, and low socioeconomic status in the adoptive home.</p><p></p><p>An analysis of data on 1,048 male and female twins found that three “externalizing disorders” (substance misuse, ASPD, and “disinhibited personality”) shared a common heritability, with a measure of heritability of 0.81 [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. A study of 2794 Norwegian twins found that a highly heritable (51 percent) common factor could account for the correlations among the seven section A ASPD criteria, thereby supporting its validity as a diagnostic construct [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Gambling disorder has been proposed as part the spectrum of externalizing disorders [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. This research supports the hypothesis that the disorders may share common genetic risks with environmental factors, influencing which, if any, disorder may develop.</p><p>A study of the molecular genetics of antisocial behavior examined variants of a gene influencing levels of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. In a large sample of abused children, 85 percent of children with a low-activity variant of the gene exhibited antisocial behavior in adulthood. In contrast, children who experienced similar abuse but had a high-activity variant of the gene rarely exhibited antisocial behaviors in adulthood. Another study, of male twins, found that low activity of the MAO-A gene increased the risk for conduct disorder in the presence of childhood adversity [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H104021823"><span class="h2">Neurodevelopment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Autonomic underarousal has been proposed as underlying psychopathy for a subset of individuals who experience ASPD with a poor prognosis [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. This model posits that psychopathic persons require greater sensory input to produce normal brain functioning than in normal subjects, possibly leading these individuals to seek potentially dangerous or risky situations to raise their level of arousal to more desired levels. Research findings supporting this theory include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Antisocial adults and youth with conduct disorder have low resting pulse rates, low skin conductance, and increased amplitude on event-related potentials [<a href="#rid37">37,38</a>]. Studies of individuals with ASPD have found nearly half to have electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>As an example, a study of 15-year-old English school children found that those who committed crimes during the subsequent nine years were more likely to have had at baseline a low resting pulse, reduced skin conductance, and more slow-wave EEG activity than the others [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Individuals with ASPD studied have high rates of minor facial anomalies, learning disorders, persistent enuresis, and behavioral hyperactivity [<a href="#rid39">39,40</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Subtle injury to the developing brain in utero has been proposed to predispose offspring to antisocial behavior. Potential causes of injury include maternal smoking during gestation, leading to fetal exposure to lower levels of oxygen and chemicals generated from tobacco [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. A sample of individuals exposed in utero to maternal starvation were more likely than a control group to exhibit antisocial behavior [<a href="#rid42">42</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H104021830"><span class="h2">Neurotransmission and neuroimaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Central nervous system (CNS) neurotransmitters are believed to have a role in mediating antisocial behavior.</p><p>Serotonin has been linked with impulsive and aggressive behavior and may mediate some antisocial behavior.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Low levels of cerebrospinal fluid 5-HIAA, a major metabolite of serotonin, have repeatedly been associated with violent or impulsive behavior, as have other measures of central serotonin system function [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Genetic disturbances in serotonin function may predispose to impulsive and aggressive behavior [<a href="#rid43">43</a>].<sup> </sup>One possibility is that<sup> </sup>serotonin serves to help dampen impulsive and violent behavior, which is released by its relative deficiency.</p><p></p><p>Other evidence suggesting abnormal CNS functioning in antisocial individuals comes from brain imaging studies. As a group, the studies implicate several brain regions including the prefrontal cortex, the superior temporal cortex, the amygdala-hippocampal complex, and the anterior cingulate cortex [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. Examples of these findings include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A positron emission tomography (PET) study of Marine and Navy personnel who had assaulted others or made suicide attempts found that the most aggressive men had low glucose metabolism in the right temporal lobe [<a href="#rid45">45</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A study that compared 21 individuals with ASPD with 34 control subjects using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) found antisocial subjects to have reduced prefrontal gray matter [<a href="#rid46">46</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A study of 18 men with ASPD and psychopathy found smaller orbitofrontal cortex volume using structural MRI compared to healthy controls [<a href="#rid47">47</a>].</p><p></p><p>While research points to evidence of subtle structural and functional deficits in the neural circuits that may help mediate antisocial behavior, the clinical significance of these findings is unclear [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. Data interpretation is complicated by the considerable heterogeneity among the studies both in terms of imaging method used and the study population. It is possible that frontal deficits (prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex) contribute to impulsivity, poor judgment, and irresponsible behavior, while dysfunction in the temporal regions (amygdala-hippocampal and superior temporal cortex) predispose to antisocial features such as inability to follow rules and deficient moral judgment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4178747586"><span class="h2">Testosterone</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Antisocial behavior has been associated with abnormal circulating levels of testosterone. Significant correlations have been found between risk-taking behavior, competition outcome, and aggression [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. High levels have been reported in youth with conduct disorder which could contribute to the development of ASPD. One study showed that high levels of plasma testosterone in boys age 12 to 14 predicted antisocial behavior at 16 years [<a href="#rid50">50</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H104021837"><span class="h2">Family and social factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The parents or caregivers of persons who develop ASPD often have poor parenting skills, or are abusive or absent [<a href="#rid3">3,5-8,10-13,20,51-54</a>].<sup> </sup>Parents or caregivers of behaviorally troubled children exhibit higher levels of antisocial behavior themselves; in comparison to parents or caregivers of children without such problems, they have higher rates of alcoholism, criminal records, divorce or separation, or absence from the child’s life [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. Erratic or inappropriate parental discipline and inadequate supervision have been linked with antisocial behavior in children [<a href="#rid55">55,56</a>]. Parents or caregivers with antisocial personality disorder may be unlikely to effectively monitor their child’s behavior, set rules and ensure that they are obeyed, check on the child’s whereabouts, or steer them away from troubled playmates.</p><p>Child abuse has been reported to contribute to the development of ASPD. People with ASPD are more likely than others to report histories of childhood abuse, consistent with findings that many grew up with neglectful and sometimes violent parents [<a href="#rid57">57</a>]. In one study, 14 to 21 percent of adults who reported abusing or neglecting their children were antisocial [<a href="#rid58">58</a>].</p><p>Disturbed peer relationships are an important and often overlooked factor associated with the development of antisocial behavior. This is referred to as the “birds of a feather” phenomenon wherein troubled youth seek the companionship of other similarly troubled youth. As an example, one study found that 98 percent of 500 delinquent boys had delinquent friends, compared with 7 percent of 500 nondelinquent peers [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. The delinquent boys were also more likely to report that they had been gang members (56 versus 1 percent). This pattern of association usually begins during the elementary school years.</p><p>Another study of over 200 middle school children found that youth who were attracted to antisocial peers engaged in antisocial behavior themselves in order to gain their acceptance [<a href="#rid59">59</a>]. While it is difficult to tease out cause and effect, these relationships can encourage and reward aggressive behavior. Gangs may be attractive to those who feel neglected by their families and peer group.</p><p>There has been concern that exposure to violent media or video games have a causal relationship with aggression and antisocial behaviors.

An estimated 25 percent of girls and 40 percent of boys diagnosed with conduct disorder eventually develop ASPD [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The more extensive the variety and severity of childhood antisocial behavior, and the earlier the onset, the greater the likelihood that the child will develop ASPD [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p>Most youth diagnosed with conduct disorder have been found to develop “adolescence-limited” antisocial behavior, which is less severe and typically arises in the context of teenage peer group pressure. These teens have little or no history of earlier antisocial behavior, and tend to spontaneously improve, explaining why most children with conduct disorder never develop adult ASPD. </p><p>Longitudinal studies of individuals diagnosed with ASPD suggest that while the most dangerous and destructive behaviors associated with ASPD may improve or even remit in some individuals, other troubling symptoms may remain [<a href="#rid20">20,21,63</a>]. As an example, involvement in criminal behavior among antisocial men has been found, on average, to peak in their late teens or early twenties; older antisocial persons participate in relatively fewer crimes [<a href="#rid8">8,64</a>]. Thus, while older individuals with ASPD may be less troublesome to their families and communities, many remain symptomatic, and some fail to improve at all [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. When improvement or remission occurs, it typically comes after years of antisocial behavior has stunted their educational and work achievement, possibly explaining why they continue to have low socioeconomic status [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. A small percentage of men (approximately five percent in one study) with ASPD have been described with earlier onset, more severe behavioral problems, and a greater variety of problems, which do not remit [<a href="#rid65">65</a>]. Examples of longitudinal studies follow:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 30-year follow-up of 82 individuals with ASPD, originally seen in a child guidance clinic, found the disorder to be a chronic condition [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].

In this study, the elevated death rate among antisocial persons from natural causes suggests that some antisocial persons may neglect their medical problems, fail to comply with medical treatment, or lack adequate health insurance.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H31582499"><span class="h2">Factors related to outcome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Longitudinal research has found that the variety and severity of childhood behavioral problems were the single best predictors of adult antisocial behavior [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 2015 study of 268 low income men followed from adolescence to early adulthood showed that aggressive symptoms (versus rule breaking) best predicted the development of ASPD compared with age at onset, the presence of callous-unemotional traits [<a href="#rid69">69</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A 30-year follow-up of 82 individuals with ASPD found that only patients with moderately severe antisocial behavior in childhood, as measured by having six or more kinds of antisocial behavior, four or more episodes of antisocial behavior, or an episode of such behavior serious enough that it might have led to a court appearance, were diagnosed with ASPD as an adult.</p><p></p><p>Among the few variables predictive of long-term adjustment in ASPD, longitudinal studies have found greater improvement to be associated with:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Older age at follow-up [<a href="#rid20">20,70</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Better family ties and community involvement [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Greater job stability [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Marital attachment [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]</p><p></p><p>Marriage may have a buffering effect on antisocial behavior.

A longitudinal study of 289 twin pairs enrolled in the Minnesota Twin Family Study found that those who had married engaged in less antisocial behavior than their unmarried co-twin [<a href="#rid71">71</a>].</p><p>Childhood socialization may be associated with outcome. A 10-year follow-up study of juvenile delinquents with conduct disorder found that socialized subjects (ie, children with the ability to develop group loyalty) were less likely to be convicted of a crime or to be imprisoned as adults compared to nonsocialized subjects [<a href="#rid72">72,73</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H31582534"><span class="h1">ASSESSMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The patient’s history is the most important basis for diagnosing antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].<sup> </sup>The diagnosis is made, in part, based on a history of chronic and repetitive behavioral problems beginning in childhood or early adolescence. In obtaining a thorough history, family members and friends can be helpful informants. One study<sup> </sup>showed that family members are more accurate in describing their relatives’ antisocial behavior than patients with the disorder [<a href="#rid74">74</a>]. Records for previous clinic or hospital visits can provide additional diagnostic clues.</p><p>The possibility of ASPD should be considered when patients present with drug-seeking behavior, signs of malingering, substance use disorder [<a href="#rid75">75</a>], injuries from reckless behavior [<a href="#rid76">76</a>], recurrent sexually transmitted disease [<a href="#rid77">77</a>], or if there is evidence of physical abuse of children for which they provide care. Comorbid psychiatric disorders, including depression, alcoholism, or substance use disorder, are frequently present.</p><p>Family history of any psychiatric disorder is important to gather, because families of individuals with ASPD have higher rates of depression, alcoholism, drug addiction, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder as well as ASPD. As an example, if the family history reveals a history consistent with ASPD in a relative, then that should raise the level of suspicion of ASPD in the patient.</p><p>Other aspects of the psychiatric examination warranting additional emphasis include the presence and history of substance use disorder. Because antisocial persons are at increased risk for suicide attempts and completed suicide, they should specifically be asked about current suicidal thoughts and past suicidal behaviors [<a href="#rid78">78</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H237270"><span class="h2">Psychological testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Psychological testing is usually unnecessary when sufficient history is available.

(See <a class="local">'Psychopathy'</a> above.)</p><p>Juvenile delinquents and criminals, groups that overlap with ASPD, generally score about ten points lower than people without ASPD on traditional IQ tests.
