         This topic reviews the association between antenatal depression and abnormal infant and child development. The association of antenatal depression with adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, as well as cognitive impairment and psychopathology in the offspring, are discussed separately, as are the risks of prenatal antidepressants, and the clinical features, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of antenatal depression:

          —
         </span>
         Information about the association between antenatal depression and adverse pregnancy outcomes and adverse outcomes in the offspring comes from low to moderate quality studies [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-10
         </a>
         ]. The evidence is based upon observational studies that can yield associations confounded by measured and residual (unmeasured) factors. These studies include retrospective case-control studies that carry the risk of recall bias, as well as population based registry studies, which may misclassify exposure. Other methodologic problems include incomplete assessment of maternal mental health, identifying depressed patients with screening questionnaires rather than structured clinical interviews, not assessing depression severity, not precisely defining outcomes, and grouping together different types of outcomes across a range of severity from mild to severe. Many studies use the mother’s report for both the independent variable (prenatal depression) and dependent variable (child outcome), and depressed mothers may perceive their children in a more negative light than other informants (reporting bias). In addition, some studies fail to use appropriate control (comparison) groups, and some observed associations between exposure and outcome are based upon a small number of exposed and affected infants.
        </p>
        <p>
         Associations between fetal exposure to antenatal depression and adverse outcomes that are found in observational studies may be confounded by many maternal factors [

         The lack of knowledge about the effects of depression upon pregnancy outcomes and outcomes in the offspring complicates our ability to understand the effects of antidepressants upon pregnancy. As an example, an association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use and an adverse outcome (eg, preterm birth) may be observed, because depression is associated with the outcome [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8,12,13
         </a>
         ], and pregnant patients who are severely depressed may be more likely to receive SSRIs than patients who are less depressed or not depressed.

          22

The results suggested that antenatal maternal depressive symptoms were associated with offspring physical health problems (eg, asthma, colic, diabetes, and/or diarrhea), independent of postnatal maternal depressive symptoms. However, maternal use of antenatal antidepressants was not reported.

         A study in a low-income country enrolled pregnant women with depressive disorders (n = 160, use of antidepressants was not reported) and pregnant women without depression (n = 160); the infants of all women were assessed at age 12 months [

The women were all physically healthy, and the analyses controlled for potential confounding factors (eg, infant birth weight and sex, socioeconomic status, and duration of exclusive breastfeeding). The risk of diarrhea was two times greater in the infants of depressed women. In addition, infants of depressed women had a small, increased risk of not receiving a full set of immunizations (relative risk 1.3). However, the analyses did not control for postpartum depression, which was observed in most of the women with antenatal depression.

After adjusting for potential confounding factors (eg, infant birthweight and sex, maternal age, and prepregnancy maternal smoking and body mass index [BMI]), the analyses found that allergic rhinoconjunctivitis was more likely to occur in the offspring of depressed women than nondepressed women (odds ratio 1.9, 95% CI 1.3-2.6).

         A prospective study assessed pregnant women (n = 157) for depressive symptoms and used a type of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) called diffusion tensor imaging to study white matter microstructures in the amygdala of neonates 6 to 14 days after birth [

         ]. The analyses controlled for potential confounding factors (eg, birth weight, infant age at time of imaging, and maternal age), and found that axial diffusivity (an indication of axonal integrity) and fractional anisotropy (coherence of brain fiber organization) were each lower in the neonates of women with depressive symptoms, compared with neonates of women without depressive symptoms.

         In another prospective study, women (n = 52, including one woman treated with an antidepressant during pregnancy) were assessed for depressive symptoms both during pregnancy and the postpartum period, and the children from these pregnancies underwent structural MRI of the brain; the mean age of the children at the time of scanning was approximately 3.5 years [

         ]. After adjusting for potential confounds (eg, child’s age and birth weight and maternal postpartum depressive symptoms), increased prenatal depressive symptoms were associated with decreased cortical thickness in the children. The findings suggest premature brain development and reduced plasticity in the children of women with antenatal depression.

         Associations between prenatal maternal depression and changes in brain structure may be sex-specific. One prospective study assessed women (n = 235) for depressive symptoms during pregnancy and again after delivery, and the offspring underwent structural MRI of the brain at approximately age 4.5 years [
         <a href="#rid30">

         ]. After adjusting for potential confounding factors (eg, maternal age and ethnicity, and child’s age at MRI), the analyses found that among girls (n = 122), antenatal depressive symptoms were associated with larger right amygdala volume, independent of postnatal depressive symptoms. In boys, antenatal depressive symptoms were not associated with amygdala volume.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, other studies suggest that antenatal depression is not associated with changes in brain structure. As an example, a prospective study included neonates (n = 41) of mothers with antenatal depression that was not treated with antidepressants, and neonates (n = 82) of women with no history of depression and no history of using antidepressants [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31

         ]. Propensity scoring was used to match the two groups of neonates with regard to potential confounders observed at baseline (eg, maternal age, neonatal sex, and neonatal gestational age at birth and MRI). Global and regional gray matter and white matter brain volumes were comparable for the two groups, as were white matter microstructures.

         Prenatal maternal depression may be associated with altered brain functioning in the offspring, including changes in the amygdala. As an example, a prospective study performed functional MRI in children of mothers with antenatal depression (n = 19), and children of nondepressed mothers (controls, n = 20) [

These studies have examined newborns of mothers with prenatal depressive disorders or symptoms and newborns of mothers with no prenatal depression or exposure to antidepressants; assessments were performed during the first postnatal month. The results show that multiple domains of neurobehavioral functioning are diminished in neonates of mothers with prenatal depression, compared with controls.

         Prenatal depression may be related to early childhood sleep problems, but the effect appears to be modest [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. A prospective study enrolled pregnant women (n &gt;10,000), who were asked about sleep problems in their children at age 30 months [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. Sleep disturbances included refusing to go to bed, difficulty going to sleep, and nightmares. After controlling for potential confounding factors (eg, birth weight, prenatal maternal smoking and use of alcohol, and postnatal maternal depression and anxiety symptoms), the analyses found that sleep problems were more likely in the children of women with antenatal depressive symptoms than the children of women who were not depressed (odds ratio 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.8). However, prenatal exposure to antidepressants was not reported.

         Antenatal depression does not appear to be associated with alterations in attachment behavior (the bond between the child and caregiver). One prospective study of pregnant women (n = 586) assessed attachment behaviors in their offspring at age 14 months, and found that prenatal depressive symptoms were not associated with attachment insecurity or with attachment disorganization [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. Although another prospective study of pregnant women (n = 79) found that antenatal depressive symptoms were associated with disorganized (insecure) attachment behaviors in infants at age 12 months, the effect was moderated by suboptimal postpartum maternal parenting [

         Antenatal depression is associated with impaired neonatal neurobehavioral functioning, including habituation, arousal and activity, attention, reflexes, excitability, and motor performance. In addition, prenatal depression is associated with disturbed/disorganized sleep and difficult temperament in neonates. (See
