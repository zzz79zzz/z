         Carcinoma in situ of the breast represents a heterogeneous group of neoplastic lesions confined to the breast ducts and lobules (ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS]). The diagnosis of DCIS increased dramatically following the introduction of screening mammography and now comprises approximately 25 percent of all newly diagnosed breast cancers. The goal of therapy for DCIS is to prevent the development of invasive breast cancer. Therapeutic approaches include surgery, radiation therapy, and adjuvant endocrine therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         The treatment of DCIS will be reviewed here. The pathology, epidemiology, and diagnosis of DCIS and microinvasive carcinoma of the breast are presented separately.

         Patients with DCIS undergo local treatment with breast-conserving therapy (BCT) or mastectomy. BCT consists of lumpectomy (also called breast-conserving surgery, wide excision, or partial mastectomy) followed in most cases by adjuvant radiation. Radiation therapy may be reasonably omitted in a select population of patients with low-risk disease. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Local treatment'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="local">
          'Omission of RT for low-risk disease'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         A sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) can be avoided in most women. However, it should be obtained in women with high-risk features for whom resection (mastectomy or BCT) may compromise the ability to perform a future SLNB. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Indications for SLNB'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         BCT is generally preferred as the local treatment, although mastectomy may be an option in some cases. The decision to administer endocrine therapy to reduce the risk of subsequent cancers depends upon the choice of local therapy and the tumor hormone receptor status (see
         <a class="local">
          'Endocrine therapy'
         </a>

         DCIS of the breast represents a broad biologic spectrum of disease. The best form of local therapy is debated.
        </p>
        <p>
         Local treatment for DCIS usually involves breast-conserving therapy (BCT), which consists of lumpectomy (also called wide excision or partial mastectomy) followed in most cases by adjuvant radiation therapy (RT). Alternatively, mastectomy may be considered. In some instances, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) may also be performed.

         Both mastectomy and breast-conserving therapy (BCT) are reasonable options for most women with DCIS, although not all women will meet the criteria for BCT. A choice between these is a personal one and should be made after discussion between patient and provider (see
         <a class="local">
          'Criteria for BCT'
         </a>
         below). BCT generally affords a better quality of life than mastectomy with reconstruction [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients found to have invasive or microinvasive disease at surgery should be managed accordingly. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/737.html" rel="external">

         Although mastectomy achieves excellent long-term survival with a local recurrence rate on the order of 1 percent, it provides overly aggressive treatment for many women. BCT has less morbidity but is associated with a higher risk of local recurrence [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In a 2015 observational study that included over 100,000 patients who received a diagnosis of DCIS in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, when compared with lumpectomy (with or without radiotherapy), mastectomy resulted in a similar 10-year breast cancer-specific mortality (multivariate hazard ratio [HR] for mastectomy versus lumpectomy 1.2, 95% CI 0.96-1.50) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. While this study did not report on morbidity associated with each surgery, information regarding the relative safety of each surgery comes from data of early breast cancer, which suggest that while postoperative complication rates associated with either surgery are low, they are more frequent with mastectomy [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Postoperative morbidities associated with mastectomy and BCT are discussed in more detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14981.html" rel="external">
          "Mastectomy", section on 'Complications'

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Together these data suggest that BCT for DCIS offers a low rate of recurrence with minimal complications. However, mastectomy is a reasonable alternative for women who wish to take all possible measures to minimize risk of recurrence and/or avoid radiation (if applicable).

         Multifocal disease (ie, two or more foci contained within a limited area and usually the same quadrant of the breast) is not necessarily a contraindication to BCT [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Multicentric disease (ie, two or more foci separated by significant distance and usually involving more than one quadrant) is a relative contraindication.
        </p>

         Histologically negative margins can be achieved with lumpectomy. Negative margins are defined by tumor-filled ducts separated by a measurable distance from the inked surface (ie, 2 mm). It is recognized that it may not be possible to obtain these margin widths, particularly with DCIS close to the skin or muscle [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. If the area of concern is close to the fascia, the dissection should be carried down to and include resection of the pectoral fascia [
         <a href="#rid13">

         Mastectomy is curative for over 98 percent of patients with DCIS [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16-20
         </a>
         ]. Disease recurrence is rare after mastectomy (1 to 2 percent) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,21-23
         </a>
         ]. Postmastectomy recurrences may be the result of unrecognized invasive carcinoma, inadequate margins, or incomplete removal of breast tissue at the time of mastectomy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Margin width'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Women treated with mastectomy are candidates for breast reconstruction; immediate reconstruction is usually preferred if the woman is eligible. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/801.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of breast reconstruction"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients undergoing mastectomy for DCIS may benefit from SLNB. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Indications for SLNB'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Women with unilateral DCIS are at a modestly increased risk of developing either invasive breast cancer or DCIS in the contralateral breast, approximately 1 percent for every year of life (and higher for genetic reasons) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,21
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, some women with DCIS choose contralateral prophylactic mastectomy to prevent a future breast cancer in the contralateral breast [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ] despite a lack of a proven survival benefit. Alternatively, women who have undergone unilateral mastectomy for DCIS may elect endocrine therapy as chemoprevention against a future primary breast cancer in the contralateral breast. For women who have undergone bilateral mastectomy, there is no role for adjuvant endocrine therapy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94744.html" rel="external">

         After a total mastectomy, the lymphatic drainage pattern will be permanently altered, making it impossible to accurately perform SLNB at a later date if invasive cancer is found unexpectedly in the mastectomy specimen. Patients who require a mastectomy have a higher likelihood of harboring an invasive cancer compared with women with a smaller focus of disease and therefore should undergo an SLNB at the time of surgery [
         <a href="#rid24">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         By contrast, our practice is not routinely to pursue SLNB in patients who are candidates for BCT yet opt for mastectomy, given that the likelihood of invasive cancer in such patients is low. We recognize, however, that practice patterns vary, and others may reasonably choose to perform SLNB routinely for all patients undergoing mastectomy for DCIS.

         BCT for DCIS refers to lumpectomy to remove the tumor with negative surgical margins, generally followed by RT to eradicate any occult residual disease [

         The goal of BCT for DCIS is complete resection with negative margins in a cosmetically acceptable manner. When DCIS is present on a core biopsy, needle, wire, reflector, or seed localization under image guidance prior to surgical excision may ensure complete resection. For larger areas of suspicious microcalcifications, bracketing of the area maximizes the likelihood of a complete excision with adequate margins on the first attempt, thereby diminishing the need for re-excision [

         For patients whose disease is associated with suspicious calcifications on preoperative mammography or in whom the adequacy of the margins is in question, a postexcision mammogram should be obtained prior to initiation of radiation. Residual suspicious calcifications warrant an image-guided (wire, reflector, tracer) approach to re-excision [

         In an observational cohort study of 140,366 patients with DCIS in the SEER database, the 15-year breast cancer mortality rate was 1.7 percent for those treated with lumpectomy and radiation versus 2.3 percent for patients treated either with lumpectomy alone (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67-0.88) or with mastectomy (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65-0.87), suggesting that BCT is at least equivalent, if not better, than mastectomy in this setting [

         Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is not indicated for most patients undergoing breast-conserving therapy (BCT) for DCIS. Omitting SLNB at the time of breast-conserving surgery for DCIS decreases perioperative morbidity [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31-33
         </a>
         ]. Because DCIS is a preinvasive lesion, axillary nodes are rarely positive in DCIS, even in cases of extensive multifocal high-grade disease [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24,34-40
         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
         If invasive breast cancer is identified after a breast-conserving surgery is performed for DCIS, SLNB can be performed as a second procedure. Upstaging to invasive carcinoma has been reported in 10 to 20 percent of excision specimens following a core biopsy diagnosis of DCIS [

         RT is the standard for patients treated with BCT, though it may be reasonable to omit in selected patients with advanced age, extensive comorbidities, or small foci of low-grade disease resected with wide negative margins. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Omission of RT for low-risk disease'

        </p>
        <p>
         RT after lumpectomy reduces the risk of local invasive and noninvasive recurrences. As described below, randomized trials have shown that adjuvant RT significantly reduces the risk of in-breast tumor recurrence by 50 percent or greater compared with excision alone. However, treating all women who undergo breast-conserving surgery for DCIS with adjuvant RT may be overtreatment for some [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42,43
         </a>
         ]. The majority of cases of DCIS do not recur when treated with excision alone, and there may be subgroups of patients with DCIS in whom the risk of local recurrence is so low that RT may be of no benefit. The difficulty, however, is in reliably predicting those patients who would not recur in the absence of RT. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Omission of RT for low-risk disease'

         RT significantly reduces the odds of in-breast recurrence but likely does not change the odds of distant recurrence or mortality, and therefore it should be discussed with each patient carefully.
        </p>
        <p>
         The benefit of RT for DCIS was shown in a 2009 meta-analysis of RT compared with no further treatment following lumpectomy [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. Compared with lumpectomy alone, RT resulted in a reduction in the risk of all ipsilateral breast events (pooled HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.41-0.58). This translated into a number needed to treat of nine women to prevent one ipsilateral breast recurrence.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, the risk reduction for local recurrence associated with RT appears to be long-lasting, though this is not associated with a survival advantage. This was shown in a report of the long-term follow-up of the National Surgical Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-17 trial [
         <a href="#rid8">

         As in the treatment of invasive breast cancer, the standard of care for patients undergoing BCT is to deliver adjuvant whole-breast radiation therapy (WBRT), typically within eight weeks of surgery. Conventionally dosed WBRT consists of 1.8 to 2 Gy daily fractions over 4.5 to 5 weeks to a total dose of 45 to 50 Gy, often followed by a boost to the surgical bed. Hypofractionated RT has gained acceptance for pure DCIS. Patient selection for hypofractionation is discussed elsewhere. (See

         <a href="#rid52">
          52

         As described above, radiation therapy (RT) reduces the odds of in-breast recurrence but likely does not change the odds of distant recurrence or decrease mortality. For patients with low-risk disease that has been fully resected with widely negative margins, and particularly if it is ER-positive and endocrine therapy will be administered, the absolute reduction of in-breast recurrence may not be large enough to justify the risks associated with RT [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ]. In such patients, it is reasonable to omit RT, especially in the setting of comorbidity, advanced age, or patient preference. We are less likely to omit radiation for young women, however, given some data suggesting RT is more likely to benefit these patients [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         While the results from the NSABP B-17 trial described above have been used to argue for RT in all women who undergo lumpectomy for pure DCIS, methodologic issues such as suboptimal pathologic evaluation and uncertainty about the completeness of excision may have led to an overestimation of the benefit of RT in this study. Moreover, RT is expensive, time consuming, and may be accompanied by significant side effects, and so omission for patients likely to derive the least benefit is reasonable. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/789.html" rel="external">
          "Radiation therapy techniques for newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Since RT reduces the risk of ipsilateral recurrence without changing the risk of developing contralateral disease, omission of RT would be a reasonable approach for patients with an ipsilateral recurrence risk approximately equal to the risk of developing contralateral disease. Among women diagnosed with DCIS, the long-term risk of developing a contralateral breast cancer or DCIS is approximately 3 to 10 percent [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55-57
         </a>
         ]. As described below, studies have tried to identify such a low-risk population using histopathologic and gene expression analysis. While it is difficult to identify a clear-cut low-risk population, the benefit of RT becomes less clear as the risk of ipsilateral recurrence approaches that of contralateral recurrence.

         While there are no strict criteria for "low risk," our approach has been to define low risk as DCIS that is low- or intermediate-grade, small (&lt;2.5 cm in size), and resected with widely negative margins (≥1 cm). (This negative margin cutoff is more conservative than that used in the studies described below). Omission of RT in such patients is reasonable, although associated with a small risk of ipsilateral recurrence.
        </p>

         Several studies suggest that clinical pathologic criteria may define a low-risk cohort of patients with DCIS for whom RT may be reasonably omitted given a low risk of recurrence. These studies are summarized below.

         The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (E5194) was an observational study that investigated excision without RT in women with low- to intermediate-grade versus high-grade DCIS [

        <p>
         These results suggest that patients with low- to intermediate-grade DCIS may be better candidates for local excision alone than those with high-grade lesions who have a higher risk of recurrence. However, a 10-year LRR approaching 15 percent in patients with low- or intermediate-grade DCIS may not be low enough to justify the routine omission of postexcision RT even in this patient population. This 10-year rate of LRR occurred despite a median tumor size of only 6 mm.

         Following local treatment, the decision to administer endocrine therapy to reduce the risk of subsequent cancers depends upon the tumor hormone receptor status and the choice of local therapy. While testing of DCIS for ER is recommended to determine potential benefit of endocrine therapies to reduce risk of future breast cancer, testing of DCIS for PR is considered optional [

         Compared with invasive breast cancer, DCIS more often expresses HER2. As an example, in a study of 708 malignant ductal lesions (59 with DCIS, 649 with invasive disease), the proportion that were HER2-positive was 56 and 15 percent, respectively [

         For patients treated with breast-conserving therapy (ie, prior wide local excision plus radiation therapy [RT]), we would perform a mastectomy rather than breast-conserving surgery because these patients are most likely not candidates for further RT. However, in some patients who initially received accelerated partial breast irradiation (PBI), whole-breast irradiation may be feasible, depending on how PBI was previously performed.

         With appropriate treatment, the prognosis for patients with DCIS is excellent. Advancements in screening for DCIS (allowing for early detection, prior to acquisition of high-risk features, and facilitating complete excision), more rigorous and standardized pathologic review and reporting of margins, and adjuvant endocrine therapy have improved outcomes [

        <p>
         In an analysis of over 100,000 patients with DCIS enrolled in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, the 20-year breast cancer mortality among women with DCIS was 3.3 percent [
         <a href="#rid3">

         </a>
         ]. The risk of ipsilateral invasive recurrence at 20 years was 5.9 percent, and the risk of contralateral invasive recurrence was 6.2 percent. In this study, predictors of a higher risk of death from breast cancer included young age at diagnosis (before age 35 years, hazard ratio [HR] 2.3, 95% CI 1.6-3.2), high grade (HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.38-2.55), and being from a Black population (HR 2.55, 95% CI 2.17-3.01). Estrogen receptor positivity predicted a lower risk of death (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.41-0.69).

        <p>
         A separate, prospective, observational study also suggested that risk of recurrence of DCIS decreased with age. Among 2996 patients with DCIS, the HRs for recurrence were as follows, with age &lt;40 years as a reference: for patients age 40 to 49 years, 0.82; 50 to 59 years, 0.46; 60 to 69 years, 0.50; 70 to 79 years, 0.56; and 80 years or greater, 0.21 [

          Introduction

         – Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast represents a heterogeneous group of neoplastic lesions confined to the breast ducts. The goal of therapy for DCIS is to prevent the development of invasive breast cancer. Therapeutic approaches include surgery, radiation therapy (RT), and adjuvant endocrine therapy. (See

         Local therapy for DCIS consists of mastectomy or breast-conserving therapy (BCT). BCT for DCIS includes lumpectomy, generally followed by RT, and results in breast cancer-specific survival rates comparable to mastectomy, although the rate of local recurrence is higher with BCT.

         Candidates for BCT include patients with DCIS whose disease is localized to an area within one quadrant and can be resected with negative margins in a cosmetically acceptable manner, taking into account the extent of disease relative to the breast size. Re-excision(s), mastectomy, or radiation boost should be performed if close or positive margins are present. (See

         However, for patients with very small foci of low-grade DCIS, and particularly if it is ER-positive and endocrine therapy will be administered, breast-conserving surgery only (ie, omission of RT) with widely negative margins (ideally 10 mm) is an option. However, prospective randomized evidence to support the omission of adjuvant radiation is limited, even in selected low-risk cases. (See

         For most patients with DCIS, we do not perform surgical evaluation of the axilla. However, we pursue sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients who do not meet criteria for BCT and thus require mastectomy. (See

         For women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive DCIS treated with breast-conserving surgery with or without RT, we suggest endocrine therapy rather than observation (

         In general, for women who undergo unilateral mastectomy for ER-positive DCIS, we suggest endocrine therapy rather than observation (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). For these patients, the use of endocrine therapy should be considered "chemoprevention" and not treatment to prevent recurrence for this diagnosis. In other words, it would be given with the intent to prevent a new primary contralateral breast cancer. In women having bilateral mastectomies for DCIS, we do not offer chemoprevention, as the risks/adverse events outweigh any potential benefit for risk reduction. (See

         as chemoprevention for women with ER-negative DCIS given that the benefit of endocrine therapy does not reduce the risk of recurrence in this population. Some women may opt to take tamoxifen, however, to decrease the risk of developing a new endocrine receptor-positive DCIS or breast cancer. (See

          Recurrent disease
         </strong>
         – The treatment for a patient diagnosed with a recurrence following original treatment for DCIS is based upon whether the disease is purely in situ or has an invasive component, the disease extent, location, prior surgical approach (ie, mastectomy versus lumpectomy), and whether RT or endocrine therapy was previously administered.
