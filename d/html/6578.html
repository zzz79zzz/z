         Bladder dysfunction, previously referred to as voiding dysfunction, is a general term to describe abnormalities in either the filling and/or emptying of the bladder. It is a common problem in children and constitutes up to 40 percent of pediatric urology clinic visits [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In some children, bladder dysfunction is a component of bowel and bladder dysfunction, previously referred to as the dysfunctional elimination syndrome, which involves abnormalities in both bladder and bowel function.
        </p>
        <p>
         Daytime urinary incontinence, a common feature of bladder dysfunction, can cause major stress in school-age children [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ] and negatively impact a child's self-esteem [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Thus, it is desirable to identify and treat these children as early as possible.

         The management of bladder dysfunction in children will be reviewed here. The etiology, clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis of bladder dysfunction and management of nocturnal enuresis in children are discussed separately. (See

          OVERVIEW

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         </span>
         The management of a child with bladder dysfunction is primarily directed at improving symptoms and avoiding kidney damage. Therapeutic considerations include the underlying cause of bladder dysfunction including behavioral and neurodevelopment etiologies, age of the patient, symptom duration and severity, motivation and attention span of the patient and family, and presence of potential risk factors for kidney injury such as recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) or vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6580.html" rel="external">
          "Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children", section on 'Dysfunctional voiding'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Data on effective treatment of bladder dysfunction in children are limited because of the following flaws in study design:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Most studies are observational in nature and without a control group. This is an important consideration because many studies use a reduction in the frequency of daytime wetting as the major outcome measure but do not take into account that the spontaneous resolution rate of daytime incontinence is estimated to be 14 percent per year [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ].

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         There are often confounding factors that make it difficult to determine which intervention, if any, was effective. As an example, a retrospective study that reported anticholinergic therapy was effective in reducing daytime incontinence failed to account for the effect of biofeedback therapy as a confounding variable [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">

         The study population has often not been well defined; as a result, it is difficult to compare the results of different studies. In 2006, the International Children's Continence Society (ICCS), a global multidisciplinary organization of clinicians involved in the care of children with lower urinary tract dysfunction, developed standardized definitions of bladder dysfunction to address this issue. In 2015, the ICCS updated and revised these definitions [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6580.html" rel="external">
          "Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children", section on 'Definition of bladder dysfunction disorders'

         There is a lack of consensus among experts on the definition of successful treatment for bladder dysfunction. The ICCS has defined treatment outcomes for research purposes [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. This stratified set of definitions has also been used clinically and is based on reducing the rate of symptoms, as follows:

         </span>
         In our practice, we use a stepped strategy moving from the least to most invasive therapy in the management of children with bladder dysfunction [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]. Conservative measures, such as voiding behavior modification and treatment of constipation (if present), are initially used before the use of medications or invasive interventions. Patients with significant behavioral and neurodevelopment issues (eg, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) are referred to a clinician with expertise in evaluation and treating these underlying conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
         If conservative therapy fails to significantly improve the symptoms of bladder dysfunction, directed therapy toward the underlying cause of bladder dysfunction is used. These interventions include pharmacologic agents, pelvic floor relaxation techniques, biofeedback, neuromodulation, or intermittent clean catheterization.

         Conservative management is generally the initial approach to treating children with bladder dysfunction. It primarily involves voiding behavior modification including timed voiding schedules and treatment of constipation, if present.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although no controlled trials have been conducted to study the effectiveness of this approach, retrospective studies have suggested reduction in symptoms in approximately 40 to 70 percent of patients treated conservatively [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,8,10,11
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         This was illustrated in a retrospective study from a single center of 63 children with daytime incontinence who were initially treated with voiding behavior modification that included a timed voiding regimen and treatment for constipation [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. At a mean follow-up of 8.2±3.2 weeks, one-third of patients had a partial response of a 50 percent reduction of incontinent episodes, one-third of patients had a slight response with 10 to 49 percent reduction of incontinent episodes, 20 percent had no change in symptoms, and four patients were dry (complete response).

         The goal of voiding behavior modification is to rehabilitate the bladder and sphincter function and return the child to normal voiding habits. It encompasses the following components [

         Provide information about normal voiding habits to the family and, if age appropriate, the child. (See

         Review the child's voiding habits, identify habits that deviate from the normal voiding process  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ), and clearly describe to the family the way in which their child's voiding differs from the normal process.

        <p>

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Set an individualized voiding regimen to establish regular voiding habits. This most often entails a timed voiding schedule with frequent voids scheduled every two to three hours during the day. Wristwatch alarms can assist the older child in remembering to comply with the timed schedule (timer watch) [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12

         ].

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Establishment of a fixed timed schedule is particularly important in a child with attention-deficit disorder. In some cases, working with the school system to create an environment conducive to frequent voiding can be helpful.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In a trial of 60 children initially treated with four weeks of standard routine care, patients who were randomly assigned to a timer-assisted regimen compared with those who remained on standard care were more likely to show improvement in the degree of incontinence (greater than 50 percent decrease in incontinent episodes, 60 versus 18 percent) [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Approximately one-third of the children on the timer-assisted regimen obtained complete and sustainable continence.

         Review the posture during voiding and the need to avoid holding maneuvers, such as forcefully crossing the legs, or squatting with a hand or heel pressed into the perineum (Vincent's curtsy)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75506" href="/z/d/graphic/75506.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). Children should be encouraged to urinate before they have a sense of urgency, empty their bladders completely, and avoid abdominal straining.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">

         </span>
         Document the voiding process in a diary after implementation of voiding behavior modification. This voiding diary should include the time and volume of each void, time of each incontinent episode, fluid intake, time of each bowel movement, and any episode of fecal soiling  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_form graphicRef102378" href="/z/d/graphic/102378.html" rel="external">
          form 1
         </a>
         ). Voiding diaries across the country vary in length (number of days) and are used both as a diagnostic tool and as a therapeutic tool. When the reliability of 24-, 48-, and 72-hour voiding diaries were evaluated, the 24-hour diary was reliable for recording the number of incontinent episodes but only marginally reliable for total voiding episodes, the 48-hour diary was reliable for both, and the 72-hour diary was the most reliable for both.
        </p>
        <p>

         Establish a reward system to improve the child's compliance and self-esteem [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. The system should focus on rewarding the child for following the recommended program and not for "being dry," as their incontinence is not something they can control.

        <p>
         Compliance with voiding behavior modification, especially timed voiding, can be labor intensive and requires a high degree of motivation from both the child and parents/caregivers. It is more successful in older children between the ages of 9 and 12 years who are more motivated because of social pressures and respond better to instruction compared with those eight years of age and younger [

         Anorectal and lower urinary tract function are interrelated. As a result, constipation is often associated with bladder dysfunction, with a reported frequency of constipation that ranges from 30 to 88 percent of children with bladder dysfunction. This relationship between abnormal bowel and bladder function is referred to as the bowel bladder dysfunction (BBD) or dysfunctional elimination syndrome and is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6580.html" rel="external">
          "Etiology and clinical features of bladder dysfunction in children", section on 'Bowel and bladder dysfunction'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with BBD, it is proposed that stool evacuation from the rectal vault relieves abnormal pressure of the overactive bladder (OAB). The importance of treating constipation is supported by the findings in a large retrospective study of 234 children with chronic constipation, 29 percent of whom had daytime urinary incontinence and 34 percent of whom had nighttime urinary incontinence [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Resolution of constipation by disimpaction and maintenance therapy was associated with elimination of wetting in 89 and 63 percent of children with daytime or nighttime urinary incontinence, respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
         Laxative use appears to be beneficial in children with BBD [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16
         </a>
         ]. In one observational study of 46 patients with BBD and daytime urinary incontinence, polyethylene glycol without electrolytes (Miralax) resulted in an overall increase in frequency of bowel movements and improved urinary continence [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Daytime urinary dryness was reported in 18 patients, a decrease in daytime urinary incontinence in 26, and there was no change in urinary symptoms in only two children. Laxative therapy was also associated with an increase in voided urine volumes and a decrease in postvoid residual volumes.
        </p>
        <p>
         The treatment of constipation consists of education, disimpaction, and bowel retraining including laxative therapy and is discussed in detail separately. (See

         Patients should be counseled to avoid bubble baths or cleaning the perineal areas with soap, which can result in (or worsen already existing) urethritis or, in girls, vaginitis. Poor perineal hygiene increases the possibility of perineal and genital irritation [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Discomfort from these disorders during urination may contribute to voiding postponement with low voiding frequency and long-time intervals between voids, resulting in overdistension of the bladder. With continued bladder overdistension, the detrusor muscle becomes overstretched and hypoactive, leading to a weak or absent contraction referred to as an underactive bladder. (See

         Vaginal voiding (reflux of urine into the vaginal vault during urination) can also lead to vaginitis. Girls suspected of having vaginal voiding should be instructed to sit for an additional one or two minutes after emptying their bladders to allow the drainage of urine that has refluxed into the vaginal vault to occur.

         started at an oral dose of 5 mg per day. If significant improvement is not noted after four weeks and there are no serious side effects, the dose is increased to 10 mg per day. Any side effect that is present should be tolerable to the patient before increasing the drug dose. In children who cannot yet take pills, oxybutynin elixir is used at a dose of 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg per dose given two or three times a day.

Despite limited evidence as discussed below, we use oxybutynin for children with OABs who fail to adequately improve with conservative management. We typically use the extended-release form of oxybutynin at 5 mg per day, which is approved for use in children five years and older, as bladder dysfunction is generally defined only in children five years or older since daytime urinary continence normally occurs by four years of age. If prescribed for younger children, the short-acting form of oxybutynin is given at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg per dose three times a day (or 1 mg per year of age per dose).

         These data suggest that there may be a role for alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists in children with bladder dysfunction. Because of their mode of action of blocking the alpha receptor resulting in smooth muscle relaxation of the bladder neck and proximal urethra, it would be expected that these agents would be particularly beneficial in children with non-neurogenic dysfunctional voiding and in those with primary bladder neck dysfunction. Further trials are needed to determine whether this class of medication is beneficial and safe in children with specific disorders of voiding dysfunction.

         Biofeedback therapy teaches children how to identify and control the muscle groups (pelvic floor muscle) involved in voiding [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52,53
         </a>
         ]. It can utilize noninvasive urodynamic monitoring, such as uroflow measurement and adhesive pads on the perineum to measure and record sphincter activity, and provide immediate feedback to the patient about their bladder function. The child observes real-time visual displays of urinary flow and electromyography activity [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54,55
         </a>
         ]. The visual or auditory feedback allows the child to become aware of and gain control over their bladder function by teaching them to learn how to voluntarily relax or contract their sphincter and pelvic musculature, thus modifying the observed measurements. Pelvic muscle (Kegel) exercises strengthen the pelvic floor musculature to provide a backboard for the urethra to compress on and to reflexively inhibit detrusor contractions (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6881.html" rel="external">
          "Female urinary incontinence: Treatment", section on 'Pelvic floor muscle (Kegel) exercises'
         </a>
         ). This is in contrast with pelvic floor relaxation, in which the child learns to relax the pelvic muscle groups involved with voiding without urodynamic monitoring feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
         Biofeedback programs can also be tailored to children by utilizing interactive computer games that are controlled by pelvic floor contraction and relaxation or by urinary flow rate [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56,57
         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
         Although biofeedback has been reported to help normalize the uroflow and electromyography pattern, decrease postvoid residual, and increase urinary flow rates, it remains unclear whether biofeedback is effective in early resolution of incontinence [

          13,54,56,58-63
         </a>
         ]. In contrast, a meta-analysis of four trials that assessed the effects of biofeedback in children with symptoms of nonneuropathic voiding disorders reported no difference in the likelihood of resolution of incontinence at six months between patients who received biofeedback and controls [
         <a href="#rid64">
          64

Both the authors and an accompanying editorial comment that data are sparse and further investigation is warranted to see if there is a specific group of patients with nonneuropathic voiding disorders who would benefit from biofeedback therapy. As noted above, previous reports have shown that biofeedback improved voiding bladder function and incontinence is considered a failure of the bladder's storage function, which may explain the lack of early benefit in continence demonstrated by the meta-analysis review, despite improvement in voiding parameters after biofeedback [

         In our practice, biofeedback is reserved for children with bladder and sphincter dyssynergia that is contributing to persistent daytime incontinence despite an adequate trial of conservative therapy and/or pharmacotherapy. It is also used for children with significant postvoid residuals who have recurrent UTIs and constipation.

         Although use in children with bladder dysfunction is limited, it is thought that electrical stimulation therapy would benefit patients with overactive bladder (OAB) by stimulating spinal inhibitory pathways that reduce detrusor (bladder muscle) contractions  (

         <a href="#rid78">
          78

          66-72,76,77,79-83

         In our practice, neuromodulation is used in a select group of children who have OAB refractory to behavioral and anticholinergic therapy. We use TENS sacral stimulation for 20 minutes twice daily as this is a regimen that appears to be safe and well tolerated in children.

         Botulinum toxin A is injected directly using cystoscopic guidance into the detrusor muscle or external urinary sphincter. It is thought to block neurotransmitter release from the peripheral afferent nerve terminals and inhibit efferent muscular contraction [

          81

         In children with a neurogenic bladder, surgery is commonly used to alter the urinary tract for safe storage of urine and/or to achieve continence. In contrast, patients with non-neurogenic bladder dysfunction rarely require surgical intervention. In rare cases of non-neurologic bladder dysfunction, when markedly elevated bladder pressure develops, a child may require enlargement of their bladder to reduce bladder pressure and thus prevent kidney damage. Bladder augmentation is usually achieved by adding an isolated segment of bowel to the bladder.

         Cystoscopy with urethral dilation is no longer routinely used to treat children with bladder dysfunction, as there are little data to support the utility of this intervention [

         In children who postpone micturition, the bladder becomes overdistended and the detrusor muscle becomes overstretched and hypoactive, leading to a weak or absent contraction, referred to as an underactive bladder, which was formerly called "lazy bladder syndrome" or myogenic failure. In these cases, bladder emptying is often incomplete, resulting in large postvoid residual volumes and an increased risk of UTI. Clean intermittent catheterization is an effective and safe intervention for bladder emptying [
         <a href="#rid90">
          90
         </a>
         ]. It allows patients to attain continence and reduces the rate of recurrent UTIs. Clean intermittent catheterization should be done in association with an established timed voiding schedule. (See

          Conservative management
         </strong>
         – Management of a child with bladder dysfunction, defined as any abnormality in either the filling and/or emptying of the bladder, is directed at improving the child's symptoms and avoiding kidney damage. In our practice, a stepped approach is used, starting with the least invasive therapy (ie, voiding behavior modification) and, if the patient remains unresponsive, moving to more invasive and/or costly interventions (ie, medications or biofeedback). The initial therapeutic measures include voiding behavior modification with timed voiding schedules and treatment of constipation, if present. (See
         <a class="local">

          Patients who fail conservative management

         – In patients who fail conservative treatment, directed therapy is focused on improving the symptoms of a specific cause of bladder dysfunction. Interventions include pharmacologic therapy, biofeedback, electrical stimulation therapy, surgery, and clean intermittent catheterization. The choice of interventions is based on the underlying condition and severity of symptoms, as follows.
