          Symmetry and shape
         </strong>
         – The normal chest is symmetric and, in the infant or young child, almost round. The transverse diameter increases with age. When a persistently round, barrel-shaped chest is seen in a child older than 12 to 24 months, the examiner should consider the possibility of an underlying chronic pulmonary disease, such as cystic fibrosis or chronic asthma.

          Rib cage and sternum
         </strong>
         – The width of the ribs and length of the sternum should be noted. A mild degree of pectus excavatum (funnel chest) or pectus carinatum (pigeon breast) is a common finding in an otherwise normal patient. Pectus excavatum frequently becomes accentuated with even mild degrees of airway obstruction. (See

          Shoulder and clavicles
         </strong>
         – The shoulders should be examined, especially in the newborn, for clavicular fractures and foreshortened or absent clavicles. Clavicular fractures in the newborn may be undetected in the immediate neonatal period; on subsequent examination, the clavicles may have swelling (callous formation) and tenderness. (See

         Shoulder alignment and level of the shoulder and scapulae in preadolescent and adolescent patients should also be evaluated because asymmetry of any of these may be a sign of scoliosis. (See

          Nipple alignment and distance

         – Nipple alignment and the distance between nipples should be noted. Accessory nipples along the milk line are a normal variant  (

          Chest movement
         </strong>
         – Inspiration normally results in expansion of the chest wall and depression of the diaphragm. Unilateral paradoxical movement (ie, contraction of the chest wall and elevation of the diaphragm with inspiration) may occur in patients with unilateral pneumonia, pneumothorax, atelectasis, or a foreign body lodged in one of the main stem bronchi. Bilateral paradoxical movement can be seen in patients with neuromuscular disease [

         Assessment of breast tissue development and size is best determined with the patient in the supine position. While the breast area is being examined, the patient's head should be in the midline resting on the palm of the ipsilateral hand. The pattern for examination should be in concentric circles proceeding peripherally from the infraclavicular and axillary areas toward the areola. (See

          Infants and prepubertal children
         </strong>
         – Infants often have transient breast tissue enlargement secondary to perinatal maternal estrogen stimulation; this enlargement may remain for several months before spontaneous regression occurs. In a prospective study in predominantly White European children &lt;27 months of age, palpable breast enlargement was greater and persisted longer in females than males; at &gt;10 months of age, 62 percent of females and 45 percent of males continued to have palpable breast tissue [

         After spontaneous regression of neonatal breast tissue, there is generally no discernable difference in the size and shape of the breasts between male and female prepubertal children. Premature thelarche may occur bilaterally or unilaterally during the first two years of life and then again at six to eight years and should be monitored to ensure it is not the start of true precocious puberty.

         In normal breast development, the areola is large, the nipple is raised, and the surrounding tissue is firm. Children with obesity may have pseudoprecocious breast area enlargement, in which the areola is small, the nipple is flat, and the surrounding breast tissue is soft.

         – Early in pubertal development, males may experience the development of a firm, tender-to-touch unilateral or bilateral subareolar nodule. In approximately two-thirds of individuals, these nodules occur as part of the developmental pattern of physiologic pubertal gynecomastia. They develop as a result of direct testicular secretion of estrogen and the peripheral conversion of prohormones to estrogen. These nodules decrease in size over one to two years, although residual nontender remnants may remain [

          Approach
         </strong>
         – An organized symmetric approach to auscultation of the lung fields should be used. Sequential auscultatory examination proceeds from one side of the chest to the other, comparing breath sounds in anatomically similar areas. Either the bell or the diaphragm of the stethoscope may be used, depending upon the size of the child; the diaphragm is more appropriate for listening to the lungs of larger patients.

         Auscultation of the lungs of young children can be difficult. They may be fearful of the examiner or uncomfortable due to illness. Being held by the caregiver may alleviate some of their anxiety. It also may be best to focus on the inspiratory phase, as little may be heard during exhalation.

          Abnormal findings
         </strong>
         – Auscultation may help localize a particular area of involvement or specific pathologic condition. Ordinarily, deep mouth breathing produces clear, soft breath sounds over the lungs. Atypical breath sounds in the form of crackles, rhonchi, or wheezes are heard most often in patients with underlying pulmonary disease. Upper airway congestion in small children often produces coarse sounds that, when transmitted through the larger airways, may give the impression of an underlying lung abnormality. Frequently, coughing and/or vigorous crying will clear a congested upper airway, helping the clinician distinguish between upper and lower airway sounds.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         In small children, an inspiratory high-pitched stridulous sound with or without significant respiratory distress may be the result of narrowing at or near the larynx or anywhere along the trachea. This condition can be caused by a croup-like illness, anatomical defect, mass lesion, foreign body, or external obstruction. Patients in severe respiratory distress with stridor may have epiglottitis or croup. (See

         When absent or decreased breath sounds are heard over a particular lung area, spoken words may sound muffled or the letter E may sound more like an A (egophony), especially in a child with a segmental or lobar consolidation.

Decreased breath sounds can also be heard with acute severe reactive airway disease and are usually accompanied by wheezing. (See

The bell is designed for listening to low-frequency sounds and the diaphragm for high-frequency sounds. Thorough evaluation necessitates auscultation of all areas of the precordium, as well as the back, neck, and axillary areas. The process includes noting the rate and rhythm and listening for the normal first and second heart sounds. Close attention should be given to detecting ejection clicks, systolic and diastolic murmurs, pericardial friction rubs, extra heart sounds, and diastolic rumbles.

         Abdominal auscultation often is difficult and unrewarding in the active, uncooperative child but may be of significant benefit in the child experiencing abdominal discomfort. Active bowel sounds often are heard in patients with gastroenteritis and usually are decreased or absent in patients with appendicitis or intestinal obstruction. Stenosis involving the aorta or iliac, femoral, or renal arteries may give rise to an audible abdominal bruit.

         Some examiners have employed an auscultatory technique to determine the inferior margin(s) of the liver and/or spleen by listening with a stethoscope over the patient's abdomen while gently scratching the abdominal skin surface with a blunt instrument. Starting in the ipsilateral lower abdominal quadrant of the organ being examined and advancing superiorly, the examiner is able to identify the lower border of the liver or spleen when a change in sound from tympany to dullness is heard.

         Percussion helps detect mass lesions and organ size and often can identify local areas of pain. Solid or fluid-filled structures, such as a urine-filled bladder, produce a dull sound to percussion; gas-filled loops of bowel produce tympany.
        </p>
        <p>
         Percussion can be used to help make the diagnosis when a distended abdomen is thought to be the result of ascites. The patient should be supine, and percussion should begin peripherally. At first dullness will be noted. As percussion advances centrally, the air-filled loops of intestine, forced to the midline by ascitic fluid, will emit a tympanitic sound. When the patient turns to one side or the other, the locations of tympany and dullness shift as the fluid moves into dependent areas. A fluid wave can be produced when the examiner strikes one flank area with the tips of the fingers of one hand and detects gentle pressure with the other hand on the opposite flank [

          10

         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. The most useful physical finding was flank dullness; if this was not evident (in the hands of an experienced examiner) the probability of ascites being present was less than 10 percent.

         Palpation is extremely beneficial for determining liver, kidney, and spleen size and for detecting abdominal masses. An examiner's warm hands and initial gentle, soft touch may go a long way in gaining the cooperation of the patient for deeper, more thorough palpation. The often-ticklish younger child may require a calm, reassuring touch, and no initial hand movement by the examiner. After a few moments, these children are instructed to take a deep breath and then exhale slowly while the examiner applies firm steady pressure to the abdomen. A fairly complete examination can be achieved by repeating the procedure in all four quadrants.
        </p>
        <p>
         The softer and less tense the abdominal musculature, the more easily organs and mass lesions can be felt. For the child who is obese, a two-hand technique with the fingers of one hand applying pressure on top of the fingers of the other hand may be required. When peritonitis is suspected, rebound tenderness may be elicited by pressing firmly and slowly on the abdomen and then quickly releasing pressure. Subsequent wincing by the patient or other audible or visual signs of pain confirms the examiner's impression.
        </p>
        <p>
         Abdominal organs are relatively easy to palpate in children because in general the abdominal wall is thin. The examiner should stand on the patient's right side when attempting to feel the liver, placing the fingers of the right hand over the right middle to lower quadrant in a somewhat oblique position. Palpation should progress in a superior direction until the lower edge of the liver is detected. Alternatively, with the left hand under the right flank applying minimal pressure, the examiner can place gentle, cephalad-directed pressure on the liver until the edge of the liver is felt with the right hand. A similar maneuver in the left upper quadrant and posterior flank helps determine the inferior margin of the spleen.
        </p>
        <p>
         The kidneys can be palpated in much the same way as the liver and spleen. Renal tenderness is determined easily in a cooperative child with pyelonephritis through percussion of the flank areas. A firm striking blow with the ulnar surface of the closed fist to the flank area will elicit discomfort in the patient with renal infection.
