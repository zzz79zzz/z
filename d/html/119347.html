         Systematic preparation for patient transport minimizes delays by ensuring that patient condition is optimal before transport, and that appropriate equipment is readily available, considering factors such as individual patient acuity and body size and weight  (

         ). This is true for routine, elective patients who will be transported to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), as well as for critically ill patients who may require transport to an intensive care unit (ICU) located further away from the operating room. In some cases, a checklist that is patient specific (eg, critically ill patients  (

         Personnel at the transport destination should be notified in advance, and preliminary handoff information is transmitted at the time of notification. (See

         A patient at high risk for developing clinical deterioration who is receiving continuous infusions of vasoactive medications may be transported by nursing staff familiar with that patient’s condition and ongoing treatment. Hemodynamically unstable patients are accompanied by a clinician or appropriately trained mid-level provider (eg, certified registered nurse anesthetist [CRNA], advanced practice nurse [APN], physician assistant [PA]).

         A mechanically ventilated patient receiving continuous infusion(s) of sedative agents or with residual effects of general anesthetic agents is transported to or from the operating room (OR) or interventional suite by a clinician expert in airway management and mechanical ventilation (eg, anesthesia provider, intensivist, respiratory therapist) [

         Similarly, critically ill patients who are receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or mechanical circulatory support (eg, with a ventricular assist device [VAD]) require the presence of specialized personnel who are familiar with the operation of the device during transport and to ensure that monitoring is continued in the OR.

         The need for various types of airway equipment is dictated by the patient’s current need for respiratory support and risk for deterioration of respiratory status. In a multicenter cohort study of mechanically ventilated adult patients in an intensive care unit (ICU), complications occurred at a higher rate during transport, highlighting the need for both vigilance and preparedness [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>

         cylinder are mandatory emergency equipment even for patients with stable respiratory status and for those who are already intubated (since accidental extubation may occur during the transport process). For many patients, it is necessary to have immediately available equipment to secure the airway, including different types of direct laryngoscopes (MacIntosh and Miller blades), indirect videolaryngoscope, various ETT sizes, as well as end-tidal carbon dioxide detector for verification of correct tracheal intubation if performed. For high-risk patients, an assortment of oral and nasopharyngeal airways may also be included [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,5,6

         Precautions are necessary in surgical patients with potential or documented communicable diseases (airborne, droplet or contact) to prevent spread of infection to staff or other patients during intra-hospital transport. Institutional guidelines should be used to dictate personal protective equipment (PPE) worn by staff caring for infected patients, including those on isolation precautions (eg, use of gloves, surgical mask, eye protection).

For intubated patients, a high-quality heat and moisture exchanging filter (HMEF) should be inserted between the self-inflating (Ambu) bag or the transport ventilator and the patient. Clinicians who contact the patient should not touch environmental surfaces such as elevator buttons; this should be done by a security officer or another helper. COVID-19 patients should ideally be transported directly to the operating room (OR) or interventional suite, bypassing any holding area. (See

However, if urgent or emergency transport is necessary for diagnosis or treatment of a primary source of instability (eg, treatment of bleeding in a patient with hemorrhagic shock, urgent imaging to prevent organ or limb damage), then actions to stabilize the patient must proceed concurrently with preparations for transport. Non-urgent transport for a diagnostic intervention or elective procedures may be delayed to optimize the patient’s condition.

         Prior to transport from an OR, optimal patient condition is ensured as surgery concludes (eg, hemodynamic stability, control of bleeding and coagulopathy, adequate oxygenation and ventilation). An arterial blood gas may be obtained to assess PaO

         and base deficit, and point-of-care tests can further check hemoglobin, potassium, and calcium levels. Data from other hemodynamic monitors such as pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) values or echocardiography examination can be used to evaluate ventricular function and volume status so that appropriate adjustments in inotropic, vasodilator, or fluid therapy can be made.

         If there is concern for ongoing hemodynamic instability, ECG changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia, malignant arrhythmias, or worsening hypoxia or acidosis, every effort is made to stabilize the patient in the OR before transport. Information gleaned from diagnostic bloodwork, hemodynamic monitors, and/or point-of-care ultrasound may be useful to achieve optimal pre-transport status. It is critically important to notify ICU personnel regarding the patient’s clinical condition and any ongoing organ support (eg, vasoactive medications) to facilitate appropriate preparations in anticipation of patient admission.

         Manual ventilation is typically accomplished by using a manual resuscitator with a self-inflating bag. This offers the advantage of simplicity without a requirement for additional bulky equipment.

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         However, manual ventilation can lead to either hypoventilation or hyperventilation. Furthermore, alveolar derecruitment has been associated with loss of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) with deleterious effects on oxygenation. For this reason, a PEEP valve should be used with manual bag ventilation, with close attention to respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (TV), and overall minute ventilation. In addition, use of large TV can have deleterious effects on patients with lung injury and hypoxic respiratory failure.

         Standard ICU ventilators – ICU ventilators are equipped to deliver precise TV and high RR with close monitoring of airway pressure, allowing use of a variety of ventilator modes that can be personalized to patients with significant lung disease. ICU ventilators should be considered for the transport of patients with particularly high acuity of respiratory pathology. However, anesthesiologists and other clinicians outside of the ICU may be unfamiliar with their management. In some cases, a respiratory therapist or intensivist who is familiar with the patient’s ICU ventilator should accompany the patient during transport to avoid complications related to mechanical failure, oxygen failure, or incorrect ventilator settings.

          Chest tubes
         </strong>
         – Chest tubes and other thoracostomy catheters are frequently present in patients undergoing airway or thoracic surgery, or other procedures for traumatic injuries or other pathology (eg, pneumothorax, hemothorax, pleural effusion). Insertion of a chest drain prior to transport is prudent for documented or likely pneumothorax in a critically ill patient. Considerations that determine whether portable suction is necessary during transport include the indication for the chest tube, drainage system in use (including level of ongoing suction), and amount of drainage measured. This information should be included in the handoff before and after patient transport to a new location. Notably, chest tubes are not routinely clamped since this may lead to respiratory and hemodynamic compromise if pleural or pericardial air or fluid reaccumulates during transport. (See

          Cerebrospinal fluid drainage devices

         – Patients with neurologic injury may have an external cerebral ventricular drain (EVD) placed for both monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP) and for therapeutic drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to optimize cerebral perfusion pressure. These patients often require transport to or from an OR, neuroimaging or neurointerventional suite, or ICU or stepdown unit. (See

          Preparations

         – Systematic preparation minimizes delays by ensuring that the surgical patient’s condition is optimal and that appropriate equipment is readily available  (

          Medications
         </strong>
         – Medications necessary to accomplish endotracheal intubation (ie, sedative-hypnotics, a neuromuscular blocking agent) should be available for patients who received anesthetic or sedative agents. For critically ill or unstable patients, medications required for resuscitation should be available in a standardized transport kit. Adequate intravenous (IV) access and supply of IV fluids must be ensured. (See

         – Continuous pulse oximetry is standard when anxiolytics or analgesics have been administered, and postoperative transport after administration of general anesthetics, sedatives, analgesics, and/or neuromuscular blocking agents. In selected critically ill patients, capnography may also be used to facilitate rapid recognition of cardiac arrest and respiratory decompensation (see
         <a class="local">
          'Respiratory monitoring'
         </a>

          Hemodynamic monitoring
         </strong>
         – Electrocardiography (ECG) and blood pressure (BP) monitoring are standard, and additional cardiovascular monitoring is appropriate for selected critically ill patients (eg, intra-arterial catheter, pressures obtained from a previously inserted central venous or pulmonary artery catheter).

          Indwelling catheters and drains

         – All indwelling intravascular catheters, the urinary catheter, and surgical drains should be appropriately labeled and secured prior to transport to avoid dislodgement. (See

         Chest tubes should not be routinely clamped. The indication for the chest tube, drainage system in use, and amount of drainage measured determine whether portable suction is necessary during transport. While cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drains are often clamped during transport to avoid overdrainage, this decision should be individualized. (See

         Patients who are intubated and mechanically ventilated may be transported using assisted or controlled ventilation with an ICU or transport ventilator. In the OR setting, a continuous infusion of an IV sedative is initiated in the final minutes before leaving an OR to ensure that the patient remains adequately sedated during transport. (See
