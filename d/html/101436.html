         Hypercapnia, defined as an elevation in the arterial carbon dioxide tension, is commonly encountered during the evaluation of patients with dyspnea and/or altered sensorium. Understanding the mechanisms, causes, and effects of hypercapnia is critical to its management.

         The relevant physiology of ventilatory control, mechanisms, causes, and effects of hypercapnia are presented in this topic review. The evaluation and treatment of patients with acute hypercapnia are presented separately. (See

Respiratory drive is also uniquely responsive to behavioral and cognitive inputs from the cortex (eg, anxiety and pain). These signals are integrated centrally into a combined output to the muscles of respiration to ultimately affect V

         Muscles of respiration - The muscles of respiration (eg, diaphragm, intercostal muscles, sternocleidomastoids, scalenes, trapezii) can affect V
         <sub>
          E
         </sub>
         by altering RR as well as depth and duration of inspiration (affects V
         <sub>
          T
         </sub>
         ). In the presence of muscular weakness, patients typically adopt a rapid shallow breathing pattern. This leads to increased VD/VT and, while total ventilation may be the same or even increased compared to normal, alveolar ventilation is reduced.

         Thoracic cage compliance - Minute ventilation is also influenced by thoracic cage compliance such that despite adequate central respiratory drive and peripheral muscle function, limitations in lung expansion (which reduce V
         <sub>
          T

         ) can occur in patients with thoracic cage dysfunction (eg, thoracoplasty). While initially RR will increase to compensate for a reduction in V
         <sub>
          T
         </sub>
         (to maintain resting alveolar ventilation), eventually RR will fall as fatigue ensues (eg, during times of stress or exercise) due to the mechanical work of breathing at a given load or disease progression; similar consequences of muscle fatigue may occur in patients with severe airway resistance (eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) who cannot increase ventilation sufficiently in the setting of acute changes in airway resistance to maintain a normal partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO
         <sub>
          2

         Thus, reduction in either central respiratory drive (won't breathe) or peripheral muscle, nerve, airway, and thoracic cage function (can't breathe) will affect V

         production may lead to hypercapnia. (See

         In contrast to respiratory rate, tidal volume and total ventilation cannot be readily estimated at the bedside. When a patient hypoventilates, PaO

          2
         </sub>
         is the fraction of oxygen in the inspired gas, Patm is barometric pressure, Pwater vapor reflects the fact that the gas that reaches the alveolus is fully humidified by the airways, and R is the respiratory quotient (ie, the ratio of CO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         produced for each molecule of oxygen consumed by metabolism). The first part of the equation reflects the partial pressure of oxygen in inspired gas. As an example, at altitude the barometric pressure is reduced and PAO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         is consequently reduced, which will lead to hypoxemia. The second part of the equation represents alveolar ventilation, given the relationship between PaCO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         and alveolar ventilation noted above. If alveolar ventilation is reduced, the oxygen diffusing into the blood from the alveolus is not rapidly replenished (nor is the CO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         diffusing into the alveolus from the blood being removed normally); consequently, there is less oxygen in the alveolus (and more CO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         ), and less oxygen in the blood. As CO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         rises in the alveolus, the diffusion gradient for CO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         between the pulmonary capillaries and the alveolus diminishes, which means less CO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         is removed from the capillary blood, which is returned to the left heart and pumped out to the body; the result may be hypercapnia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, when a patient presents with hypoxemia, it is important for the clinician to consider the possibility of hypoventilation as a cause of hypoxemia before starting supplemental oxygen. Consequently, high level of clinical suspicion for global hypoventilation is necessary to prompt an arterial blood gas for the early detection, prevention, and treatment of hypercapnia. The clinical evaluation and treatment of hypercapnia is discussed in detail separately. (See

         Thoracic cage disorders are also a frequently forgotten cause of hypercapnia and include kyphoscoliosis and thoracoplasty, flail chest, ankylosing spondylitis, and pectus excavatum. Although hypoventilation, typically as a consequence of reduced compliance of the chest wall or disruption of the linkage between chest wall and lung motion, is one mechanism through which hypercapnia can occur in patients with thoracic cage disorders, the etiology is likely multifactorial and may involve central control of breathing as well as ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch.

          Alveolar dead space
         </strong>
         – The alveolar dead space reflects reduced perfusion to alveoli that are ventilated. Thus, dead space (positive ventilation but no perfusion) is on the opposite spectrum of V/Q mismatch from shunt (no ventilation but positive perfusion). An increase in alveolar dead space is the main mechanism that underlies hypercapnia in patients with parenchymal lung disease (eg, COPD, pneumonia, interstitial fibrosis) and pulmonary vascular disease. Conditions that increase dead space to result in hypercapnia are discussed below. (See

         Rapid shallow breathing can contribute to hypercapnia by increasing the dead space to tidal volume ratio, because the anatomic dead space in the central airways comprises a larger proportion of the smaller tidal breath. Increased alveolar dead space is mostly seen in patients with intrinsic lung disease that affects the gas-exchanging component of the lung  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef103091" href="/z/d/graphic/103091.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Increases in alveolar dead space can be due to pulmonary capillary compression (extrinsic obstruction) from overinflated lung (eg, too much positive pressure with mechanical ventilation) or destruction of pulmonary capillaries (emphysema, interstitial fibrosis, pulmonary vasculitis). In most cases, the initial increase in dead space stimulates minute ventilation in an attempt to normalize PaCO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         , so that many patients with these disorders are initially normocapnic. It is only when this compensatory mechanism is impaired (usually because of problems with the ventilatory pump, such as muscle weakness or increased airway resistance) or because the extent of the disease is so great that hyperventilation of the remaining normal alveoli is inadequate to compensate for the dead space, that increased dead space will result in clinically relevant hypercapnia (eg, patients with severe or endstage lung disease).

Other patients with COPD will develop hypercapnia with an exacerbation or in response to supplemental oxygen, which reverts to normal once the exacerbation resolves (reversible hypercapnia) or oxygen is weaned, respectively. The mechanisms that explain hypercapnia in COPD are as follows:

         Factors contributing to the increased dead space (increased ventilation relative to perfusion) and the consequent development of hypercapnia in COPD at baseline or during exacerbations (in the absence of oxygen) include destruction of capillaries by emphysema, airflow obstruction leading to hyperinflation, and reduced lung compliance at high lung volumes [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. In addition, the breathing pattern in patients with COPD and hypercapnia is different from that found in their normocapnic counterparts; hypercapnic patients tend to have lower tidal volumes and an increased respiratory rate, which increases V

         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. However, during an exacerbation, patients with COPD exhibited an increased respiratory rate, lower tidal volume, and increased respiratory drive (as measured by mouth occlusion pressure) when compared to normal controls.
        </p>
        <p>
         The lower tidal volumes in patients with COPD are the consequence of several factors. Respiratory drive, as measured by mouth occlusion pressure or inspiratory flow rate appears to be high [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,7
         </a>
         ]; this may result in a shortened inspiratory time. Because of increased expiratory resistance, expiratory time must be prolonged to allow the individual to return to functional residual capacity (ie, relaxation volume, when the outward recoil of the chest wall is equal and opposite to the inward recoil of the lung)  (

         Some (but not all) patients with COPD develop hypercapnia when given supplemental oxygen, the mechanism of which has been clarified since the early 1980s. Importantly, the potential development of hypercapnia should not preclude the administration of oxygen to patients with COPD who are hypoxemic, since withholding it can be potentially harmful (the combination of an acute respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and myocardial dysfunction). The mechanism of oxygen-induced hypercapnia in COPD is discussed in this section. The safe administration of oxygen to this population is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1458.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         It was originally thought that patients with COPD rely on their hypoxemic ventilatory drive due to a blunted sensitivity to CO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         (ie, pH), and that hypercapnia in this setting resulted from "removal" of hypoxemic drive with a consequent reduction in alveolar ventilation. In general, the control of breathing is dependent upon central drive (inspiratory neurons in the medulla) when asleep, and the reticular activating system when awake (see

          "Control of ventilation"

         when supplemental oxygen is administered is relatively minor. Decreased binding affinity of hemoglobin for carbon dioxide (the Haldane effect) in the presence of oxygen also contributes [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,9
         </a>
         ]. The following studies support this theory [

         </a>
         ]. When patients were given supplemental oxygen at 5 L/min during an exacerbation, minute ventilation dropped by only 14 percent due to a small decrease in respiratory rate without a change in tidal volume. However, this reduction in minute ventilation could not account for the entire increase in PaCO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         ; further analysis led to the conclusion that hypercapnia was primarily due to an increase in the dead space to tidal volume ratio. Although ventilatory drive decreased in response to supplemental oxygen, it remained three times greater than in normal controls, suggesting that respiratory drive is not eliminated by the administration of supplemental oxygen in this population.

All patients had an initial decrease in minute ventilation of approximately 18 percent, which then returned to approximately 93 percent of baseline after 12 minutes, despite continued oxygen administration. The initial decrease in minute ventilation was due to reductions in both tidal volume and respiratory rate. After 15 minutes of oxygen administration, the PaCO

         increased by an average of 23 mmHg, which was due to three components:

          Increased dead space
         </strong>
         – The largest component of acute hypercapnia (11 mmHg, 48 percent) was due to an increase in dead space ventilation (ie, areas of high V/Q). This probably reflects worsening of V/Q matching due to a loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) (ie, redirection of blood flow from relatively well-ventilated units to poorly ventilated units). HPV normally serves to improve the matching between blood flow and ventilation. This compensatory response improves V/Q matching and decreases physiologic dead space. The effect of loss of HPV is most pronounced in patients with a low initial PaO

          2
         </sub>
         for any given flow rate because the individual is entraining larger volumes of "room air" thereby diluting the supplemental oxygen; alternatively, with lower minute ventilation, the supplemental oxygen comprises a greater portion of the inspired gas). In addition, the stimulation of flow receptors by inspiratory gas in the nasopharynx reduces respiratory drive independently of changes in PaO

        <p>
         The anxiolytic and anti-dyspneic effects of supplemental oxygen can promote sleep, particularly in patients who arrive in the emergency department sleep-deprived. The onset of sleep is associated with loss of the drive to breathe associated with the reticular activating system. When the awake and behavioral influences on breathing present during wakefulness are absent, respiration is sustained solely by metabolic control mechanisms. This can result in progressive hypercapnia [

         The effects on consciousness are poorly understood but may be due to increases in brain glutamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), as well as reductions in glutamate and aspartate. These changes may negatively impact the level of consciousness and depress minute ventilation and inspiratory drive [

         The degree of acute hypercapnia required to provoke these responses is variable. Eucapnic individuals do not exhibit a depressed level of consciousness until the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO

         ) is greater than 75 to 80 mmHg (10 to 10.6 kPa), while patients with chronic hypercapnia may not develop symptoms until the PaCO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         rises acutely to greater than 90 to 100 mmHg. In addition, patients with chronic hypercapnia have a compensatory loss of hydrogen ions from the kidney, associated with a rise in the plasma bicarbonate concentration. As a result, a larger elevation in PaCO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         is required to produce the same reduction in pH. This feature can be used during arterial blood gas analysis to distinguish acute from acute-on-chronic and chronic hypercapnia, the details of which are discussed separately. (See

         . Importantly, serum bicarbonate levels rise slightly with an acute respiratory acidosis because of the carbonic acid reaction. This reaction occurs within red blood cells and is an important means by which the body buffers an acute respiratory acidosis; the proton formed binds to the negative charges of the hemoglobin and the bicarbonate ion exits the red cell. Bicarbonate is not an effective buffer for a respiratory acidosis. Administration of bicarbonate to a patient with acute hypercapnia leads to an increase in CO

         Hypercapnia is due to factors that reduce minute ventilation, increase physiologic dead space, and/or increase CO

         production. Intrinsic lung diseases that increase dead space are responsible for most cases of hypercapnic respiratory failure, while a smaller proportion are due to extra pulmonary conditions (eg, sedatives, neuromuscular or thoracic cage disorders). Unless a patient has limited pulmonary reserve, conditions that increase CO

         Acute hypercapnia may produce a depressed level of consciousness, increased cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure, and reduced myocardial and diaphragmatic contractility. Other effects include increased release of oxygen to tissues and a respiratory acidosis. Severe hypercapnic acidosis eventually results in coma, cardiac or respiratory arrest, and death. Normal individuals do not exhibit a depressed level of consciousness until the PaCO
