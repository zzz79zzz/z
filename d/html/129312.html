         The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in a growing population of individuals recovering from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Accumulating observational data suggest that these patients may experience a wide range of symptoms after recovery from acute illness, referred to by several terms including "long COVID," "post-COVID conditions," and "postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection." Some aspects of this recovery may be unique to COVID-19, but many appear to be similar to recovery from other viral illnesses, critical illness, and/or sepsis [

        <p>
         In this topic we will discuss the evaluation and management of adults during the postacute and chronic recovery phase from COVID-19, which is based upon evolving evidence. The management of adults with acute COVID-19 is reviewed elsewhere:

         The recovery process from COVID-19 exists on a continuum; early in the course of acute COVID-19, management is focused on detecting and treating acute COVID-19-related complications, while after recovery from the acute phase, some patients require evaluation and management for persistent or new symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although there are no widely accepted definitions of the stages of COVID-19 recovery, we generally agree with the following categories as proposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) [

         – Broad range of symptoms (physical and mental) and symptom clusters that develop during or after COVID-19, continue for ≥2 months (ie, three months from the onset of illness), have an impact on the patient's life, and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis.

         These stages reflect symptomatic recovery and are not related to active viral infection and infectivity. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Several other terms have been used to describe prolonged symptoms following COVID-19 illness, such as "long COVID," "postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection," "postacute COVID-19," "chronic COVID-19," and "post-COVID syndrome" [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9-13

         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. However, as of October 1, 2021, there is a new International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10) for unspecified post-COVID conditions, which is U09.9, which was approved by the CDC.

         The United States Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice released a guidance statement on "long COVID" as a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. These acts provide protections for individuals with disabilities to allow for full and equal access to civic and commercial life. This statement classifies "long COVID" as a disability if it substantially limits, either physically or mentally, one or more major life activities. An individualized assessment is needed to determine whether a person's symptoms fit these criteria [

         Whether the constellation of symptoms and persistent issues experienced by patients represents a new syndrome unique to COVID-19 or if there is overlap with the recovery from other infectious and critical illnesses has not been determined. In addition, it is important to note that many studies evaluating the prevalence and severity of persistent post-COVID-19 symptoms have significant methodologic limitations, such as lack of a control population, selection and reporting bias, and lack of standardized assessment protocols.

         The most effective means by which to prevent post-COVID conditions also is to prevent COVID-19 (eg, vaccination, masking, social distancing, hand hygiene). It is likely that any measure that decreases the incidence or severity of acute COVID-19 infection will in turn decrease the incidence and severity of post-COVID conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Several studies report lower rates of post-COVID-19 symptoms in patients who are vaccinated [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17-19
         </a>
         ]. A case-control study found that both symptom intensity in the first week of illness and persistent symptoms, defined as symptoms at 28 days or more, were significantly less common among those who developed postvaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with unvaccinated cases [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. In addition, those who were vaccinated were more likely to be asymptomatic. Another large observational cohort study from nine Italian centers totaling 2560 patients with mild COVID-19 reported that compared with unvaccinated individuals, the prevalence of postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) decreased in vaccinated individuals in a dose-dependent fashion: 42 percent in unvaccinated patients versus 30 percent in patients with one vaccine dose, 17 percent in patients with two vaccine doses (odds ratio [OR] 0.25, 95% CI 0.07-0.87), and 16 percent in patients with three doses (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.03-0.84) [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Older age, higher body mass index, and comorbidities such as allergies and obstructive lung disease were associated with increased risk of PASC.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another prespecified analysis of a trial examining several therapies for COVID-19 also reported reduced prevalence of disability in patients treated with select agents [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. For example, interleukin-6 receptor antagonists had a 93 percent probability of reducing disability. In contrast,

         The true prevalence of long COVID is unknown due to varying definitions and methods of analysis. Nonetheless, in the largest study to date, a meta-analysis of 54 studies and two medical record databases from 22 countries estimated that between March 2020 and January 2022, at three months 6.2 percent of individuals who had symptomatic COVID-19 infection experienced at least one of a predetermined set of three long COVID symptom clusters (persistent fatigue with bodily pain or mood swings [3.2 percent], cognitive problems [2.2 percent], or ongoing respiratory problems [3.7 percent]) [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. These data did not include patients who were infected with the omicron variant.
        </p>
        <p>
         Females ≥20 years were more likely to have long COVID symptoms than males ≥20 years (10.6 versus 5.4 percent) [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. Both males and females &lt;20 years of age had lower rates of symptomatic long COVID (2.8 percent).

         Persistent physical symptoms following acute COVID-19 are common and typically include fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, and cough. Patients recovering from COVID-19 may also have additional psychological (eg, anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) and cognitive (eg, poor memory and concentration) symptoms, similar to the syndrome experienced by patients recovering from other critical illnesses known as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). This syndrome is discussed in detail separately. (See

         Whether symptoms can develop after initial asymptomatic infection is unknown. Limited data from self-reporting questionnaires, subgroup analyses of larger observational studies, and health care claim databases (some of which are not peer-reviewed), suggest that a small proportion of patients with asymptomatic COVID-19 subsequently report post-COVID symptoms (eg, fatigue) [
         <a href="#rid72">
          72-74

         Limited data suggest a lower prevalence of persistent symptoms in children, although data are sparse. One retrospective study of children and adolescents (median age 11 years) described at least one symptom lasting beyond 12 weeks in 4 percent of the study cohort [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45

          "COVID-19: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis in children", section on 'Post-COVID-19 condition ("long COVID")'

        </p>
        <p>
         Observational data suggest that persistent symptoms are unlikely to worsen and may stay the same or even improve following the administration of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53,75-77
         </a>
         ]. This was illustrated in one study of 163 patients who had a heavy burden of post-COVID symptoms at eight months and who subsequently received the Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) or Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1nCoV-19) vaccine [
         <a href="#rid75">
          75

        </p>
        <p>
         The prevalence of persistent symptoms may also vary depending on the COVID-19 variant. As an example, among over 97,000 vaccinated individuals in the United Kingdom, subsequent infection with the Omicron variant was associated with a lower risk of developing persistent symptoms compared with the Delta variant (4.5 versus 10.8 percent) [
         <a href="#rid78">
          78
         </a>
         ]. Data were consistent regardless of the interval between vaccination and infection. However, methodologic issues, including self-reporting through an electronic application and a shorter duration of follow-up for Omicron- versus Delta-infected patients, limit the interpretation of these findings, and further research is needed. Similarly, another observational study of nonhospitalized health care workers with COVID-19 reported that the prevalence of persistent symptoms waned with each successive COVID-19 wave (48 percent in wave 1 [wild-type variant], 36 percent in wave 2 [alpha variant], and 17 percent in wave 3 [Delta and Omicron]) [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18

        <p>
         Reinfection may increase the risk of postacute sequalae of COVID-19 (PASC; hazard ratio 2.10, 95% CI 2.04-2.16) [

        <p>
         Several organizations have developed guidelines to address the evaluation and management of patients recovering from COVID-19, and many institutions have established dedicated, interdisciplinary outpatient COVID-19 recovery clinics to address the long-term needs of patients after recovery from acute illness [

          6,10,107-119

Given the unknown long-term sequelae of those with persistent symptoms following COVID-19, clinic protocols generally include a comprehensive physical, cognitive, and psychological assessment. High quality data on the outcomes of these evaluation and management strategies are lacking. Care should not be delayed if patients experience a long wait time for evaluation in a dedicated COVID-19 recovery clinic; referral to pulmonary, neurology, and/or physical medicine and rehabilitation specialists may be appropriate if referral to a COVID-19 recovery clinic is unavailable.

The recovery process exists on a continuum; follow-up early in the course of acute COVID-19 is focused on detecting and managing acute COVID-19-related complications, while later follow-up focuses on the evaluation and management of persistent symptoms after recovery from the acute phase (see
         <a class="local">
          'Terminology and stages of recovery'

         In addition, there is no clinical utility in obtaining SARS-CoV-2 serology (antibodies) in patients who had their acute infection documented by a positive molecular test (ie, nucleic acid amplification test [NAAT], reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] test) or antigen test. However, for patients with prior COVID-19 based upon symptoms but without a documented positive molecular or antigen test, the value of obtaining SARS-CoV-2 serology is unclear. Regardless, we sometimes obtain serology to guide additional testing or decision-making (eg, convalescent plasma donation, evaluation of unexplained symptoms). (See

         Following the acute illness, we encourage patients to resume their daily activities as tolerated. While most patients, particularly those with mild illness, are expected to have resolution of symptoms over the first few weeks following acute illness, some may experience a slower than expected recovery course or develop new or progressive symptoms. Patients who have failure of their symptoms to resolve or new or progressive symptoms should be evaluated promptly (see

         – For most patients, chest radiography is sufficient.

Based upon accumulating data in patients recovering from COVID-19, we expect lung damage (ie, ground glass opacities, consolidation, interlobular septal thickening) to resolve in two to four weeks, but full resolution may require 12 weeks or longer with some studies suggesting changes up to a year, especially in those with severe disease [

         <strong>
          chest radiography

For patients with suspected neuromuscular weakness, maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure (maximal inspiratory pressure [MIP], maximal expiratory pressure [MEP]) measurements can be used to assess respiratory muscle strength.

         The optimal timing to obtain PFTs in the recovering patient is unknown. However, based upon accumulating data from COVID-19 patients and indirect evidence from the non-COVID-19 ARDS population (in whom PFTS are indicated), we typically obtain the studies at 6 to 12 weeks following hospital discharge. For patients with COVID-19-related ARDS, if PFT abnormalities are detected, we advise obtaining follow-up PFTs at six months and yearly thereafter for five years. (See

          Evaluating exercise capacity and oxygenation
         </strong>
         – For any patient with unexplained respiratory symptoms after initial cardiopulmonary evaluation, including evaluation of venous thromboembolic disease and heart disease, as well as in patients who were hospitalized due to acute COVID-19, we typically obtain a six-minute walk test  (

         ). Although not designed to be an oxygen titration study, it is a good index of physical and respiratory function and may identify any oxygenation issue to help explain a patient's dyspnea. Nocturnal oximetry measurement is typically not needed unless the patient is symptomatic during sleep (eg, recurrent awakening, chest pain, dyspnea) or if severe underlying heart or lung disease is suspected.

          Orthostasis
         </strong>
         – For patients with orthostasis and dysautonomia (eg, unexplained sinus tachycardia, dizziness on standing) following COVID-19, we initially treat conservatively with compression stockings, abdominal binder, hydration, physical therapy, and behavioral modifications. (see

          "Treatment of orthostatic and postprandial hypotension"

         ). For those with evidence of postural tachycardia on orthostatic testing and failure of conservative management, we sometimes consider medications. (See

         For patients with neurologic complications of acute COVID-19 (eg, stroke, seizures, hypoxic encephalopathy, neuromuscular weakness related to critical illness [

         ], Guillain-Barré syndrome, encephalitis), we perform a complete neurological history and examination and evaluate the degree of residual deficits and their impact on the patient's functional status. We do not typically obtain neurological imaging unless there is an unexplained neurologic deficit or concern for a focal lesion or other condition.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with neurologic complications following COVID-19 should be managed in the same way as with other patients. For example, for patients with unexplained muscle weakness or sensory complaints, evaluation with electromyography and nerve conduction studies are appropriate. These issues are discussed separately.

         Many patients with COVID-19 demonstrate laboratory evidence of hypercoagulability during the acute illness and some develop venous and arterial thromboses, especially those with severe or critical acute illness. We evaluate all patients for signs and symptoms of deep venous thromboses (DVT) of the upper and lower extremities, pulmonary embolism, or arterial thromboses (eg, digital ischemia). For patients taking anticoagulants, we review the duration and indication for anticoagulation, confirming appropriateness and safety as we do in any patient on anticoagulation.

Patients should be screened for fatigue patterns to help guide activity and monitor the response to initiating and escalating activity as well as monitor the effects on daily functioning (eg, activities and instrumental activities of daily living such as feeding, dressing, bathing, toileting, driving, housekeeping, and grocery shopping).

        <p>
         To inform the patient's rehabilitation plan, we compare their current symptoms with their preillness functional status (eg, decline in exercise tolerance, weakness, or reduced mobility). As part of the evaluation, we also determine whether the patient has any conditions that may exacerbate or lead to fatigue, including medication use/polypharmacy, deconditioning, weakness, muscle atrophy, pain, sleep disturbances, endocrine disorders, mood disorders, and/or cardiopulmonary symptoms.

         For the majority of patients, we advise an individualized and structured, titrated return-to-activity program based on the level of fatigue. These programs are based on identifying the level of activity that the patient is comfortable with and slowly progressing it, if tolerated. If the patient is unable to tolerate progression or experiences worsening symptoms or malaise following activity, we recommend maintenance at the previously tolerated level. For patients having difficulty advancing activity, we refer to a rehabilitation specialist (ie, physical therapy or physiatrist) to help guide an individualized rehabilitation program. We do not have patients undergo a structured graduated/progressive exercise program. Those with fatigue or poor exercise performance due to cardiopulmonary pathology may be more likely to benefit from a specialized cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation program. (See

         Although in most patients with non-critical COVID-19 the kidney and liver injury generally self-resolve, those with kidney or liver injury during acute illness require appropriate follow-up laboratory testing to assess for organ recovery.

          Prescription

         – It has been postulated that graded exercise therapy is not appropriate for patients with COVID-19-related fatigue and debility given concern for worsening postexertional malaise [
         <a href="#rid166">
          166

         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ] and our initial experience with patients recovering from COVID-19, we generally use a cautious approach to initiating a comprehensive therapy program (eg, two to three days per week). We find that a structured and supervised program can improve endurance and reduce fatigue and dyspnea. In addition, this approach gives patients confidence and provides reassurance that they are safely resuming activity. We advise patients that if they feel worse (instead of better) after participation, they may need to cut back on their therapy to the previous level or stop all together. The development of concerning symptoms (eg, new chest discomfort) or symptoms that are disproportionate to the degree of underlying system dysfunction may warrant additional evaluation by specialty clinicians (eg, pulmonary, cardiac, neurology).

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         We generally start with a progressive aerobic and strength training rehabilitation program. We begin with breathing exercises, gentle stretching, and light muscle strengthening prior to any targeted cardiovascular program. Once the patient is able to tolerate light stretching and strengthening, we introduce an aerobic training program. For aerobic training, we begin at one to three metabolic equivalents (METs) and slowly increase activity as tolerated, often over multiple sessions. We monitor vital signs and initially maintain the heart rate (HR) at &lt;60 percent of the maximum predicted HR (MPHR). We also monitor pulse oximetry and blood pressure before, periodically during, and after therapeutic activities. (See

         Some patients recovering from COVID-19 require postacute care services, including admission to a long-term acute care facility (LTAC), an inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF), or a skilled nursing facility (SNF). Prior to hospital discharge, patients should be assessed for any functional impairment that would require inpatient rehabilitation services. One report suggested that among 1250 patients with COVID-19 who were discharged from a hospital, 12.6 percent required admission to an IRF or SNF [

         The initial evaluation of recovering COVID-19 patients who are admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation facility are similar to that described in the outpatient population. This involves a detailed assessment of the hospital course, complications, evaluation of current symptoms, and appropriate follow-up testing and management. Further details are provided above. (See

However, inpatients discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU) to LTACs commonly have a tracheostomy, and most suffer from post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), which includes physical impairment from ICU-acquired neuromuscular weakness, cognitive, and neuropsychological impairment. For such patients, in the early stages of rehabilitation, there is a heavy emphasis placed on ventilator weaning, physical therapy for improving muscle strength and endurance, and optimizing nutrition. For these patients, non-urgent medical issues and testing are often deferred until the patient has been weaned from mechanical ventilation. Further details regarding these issues are provided separately.

         – Patients recovering from COVID-19 who are being discharged from the hospital and have met criteria for discontinuing precautions do not require additional isolation precautions upon discharge to SNFs and IRFs. This includes those who met criteria using a non-test-based strategy  (

         stated that "persons with more severe to critical illness or severe immunocompromise likely remain infectious no longer than 20 days after symptom onset." However, given the severity of COVID-19 that may include compromised patients, many LTACs request test-based strategies (eg, two negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR] tests performed 24 hours apart) before accepting a patient with COVID-19.

         Weaning patients with COVID-19 from mechanical ventilation is similar to weaning non-COVID-19 patients, the details of which are discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1638.html" rel="external">
          "Management and prognosis of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation"

        </p>
        <p>
         However, appropriate precautions should be taken in patients
         <strong>
          who are considered infectious
         </strong>
         particularly during aerosol-generating procedures.

         Initial weaning trials of pressure support ventilation (PSV) are typically performed through a closed-loop system, which is considered non-aerosol-generating. This system is sufficient for patients undergoing spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) with incremental periods of prolonged PSV which typically occur over a few days or a few weeks. This practice is similar to that in non-COVID-19 patients.
        </p>

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Once the patient can breathe spontaneously for 16 to 24 hours on PSV, they typically progress to SBTs through a tracheostomy collar. However, an SBT using a tracheostomy collar is an open system. As a result, some institutions consider tracheostomy collar an aerosol-generating procedure (AGP), although it remains controversial. At our institution, given the available evidence, if flow is less than 15 liters per minute, we do not consider it an AGP, and at higher flow, deem it a low-risk procedure. Regardless, once the tracheostomy collar SBT is completed, closed-loop ventilation should be resumed.

          ●
         </span>
         Given the potential need for tracheal suctioning, ideally, a tracheostomy collar SBT should be performed in an airborne isolation room. An alternative includes using a portable HEPA filter to generate negative pressure in a room during a tracheostomy collar SBT. A surgical mask over the tracheostomy itself may also theoretically limit droplet spread but is not ideal.

         Once the patient can breathe for 24 hours on a tracheostomy collar (or modified T-piece), they can undergo trials of a speaking valve and "capping" with the balloon deflated. Placing a speaking valve and capping would be considered aerosol-generating, so airborne precautions are warranted. However, once a speaking valve is in place or the tracheostomy is capped, aerosolization is less of a consideration and is the equivalent of a patient with a cough and on low-flow oxygen; in such cases, the patients may wear a mask over their nose and mouth.

        </p>
        <p>
         Tracheostomy placement, bronchoscopy, and decannulation (ie, removal of the tracheostomy) are each considered aerosol-generating procedures, and provided the patient remains infectious, all the usual airborne precautions should be taken. (See

         Outcome data for patients with a tracheostomy and undergo weaning are limited but suggest the outcomes may be better than patients without COVID-19. One retrospective study of 158 patients who required tracheostomy for prolonged mechanical ventilation reported successful weaning in 71 percent and a mortality of 10 percent [
         <a href="#rid170">
          170
         </a>
         ]. Weaning duration was 8 days. By the end of the study period, 19 percent were discharged home while 70 percent were discharged to other facilities (eg, rehabilitation facilities [46 percent], acute care hospital [17 percent], or nursing facility [7 percent]). In another retrospective study of patients who underwent tracheostomy for COVID-19, 90 percent were alive 90 days later, 2.7 percent still had the tracheostomy, 33 percent still had a PEG, and almost two-thirds were at home [
         <a href="#rid171">
          171

          Terminology
         </strong>
         – The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a growing population of individuals with a wide range of persistent symptoms after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. This comprises patients with symptoms that develop during or after COVID-19, continue for ≥4 weeks, and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis. Several terms have been used to describe prolonged symptoms following COVID-19 illness, such as "post-COVID conditions," "long COVID," "postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection," "postacute COVID-19," "chronic COVID-19," and "post-COVID syndrome." Whether the constellation of symptoms represents a new syndrome unique to COVID-19 or if there is overlap with the recovery from similar illnesses has not been determined. (See

         While most patients with mild acute COVID-19 disease are expected to recover quickly (eg, two weeks), a longer recovery should be expected in those with moderate to severe acute disease (eg, two to three months, sometimes longer in those who survive critical illness). The wide variability in time to symptom resolution likely also depends upon premorbid risk factors as well as illness severity during acute COVID-19. (See

         We assess the patient's symptom severity to determine the timing of follow-up evaluation. In patients with mild to moderate disease not requiring hospitalization, we do
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         routinely schedule a COVID-19 follow-up visit unless the patient requests it or has persistent, progressive, or new symptoms. For patients with more severe acute COVID-19 disease requiring hospitalization (with or without the need for postacute care such as inpatient rehabilitation), we ideally follow-up within one week but no later than two to three weeks after discharge from the hospital or rehabilitation facility.

         During the initial follow-up evaluation, we obtain a comprehensive history of the patient's COVID-19 illness, including the illness timeline, duration and severity of symptoms, types and severity of complications, COVID-19 testing results, and any management strategies. The need for laboratory testing is determined by illness severity, prior abnormal testing during their illness, and current symptoms. We do
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         routinely retest patients for active infection with SARS-CoV-2 at the time of follow-up outpatient evaluation. Instead, we follow a non-test-based approach to removing infectious precautions. (See

         For all patients who had a pulmonary infiltrate or other abnormality identified on imaging during the acute course of COVID-19 illness, we obtain follow-up chest imaging, typically chest radiography, at 12 weeks. For patients with new or progressive symptoms, earlier imaging is indicated. Chest computed tomography (CT) is preferred for patients in whom another etiology (eg, malignancy) is suspected, and high resolution CT (HRCT) is an appropriate imaging study for patients with suspected interstitial lung disease from severe pulmonary involvement (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]).

         For patients with intermittent or persistent cardiopulmonary symptoms, including palpitations, or those with generalized, constitutional complaints such as weakness or fatigue, we typically perform a 12-lead electrocardiogram. We do not routinely perform transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). However, we have a low threshold to obtain a TTE in patients with a history or biochemical evidence of myocardial injury or myocarditis or in patients with dyspnea and other signs and symptoms suggestive of a potential cardiac disorder.

         <strong>
          Outpatient rehabilitation
         </strong>
         – When rehabilitation services are indicated, we typically refer patients within 30 days of recovery from initial infection. All patients should be screened for cardiac symptoms prior to beginning any exercise program; if necessary, a full cardiac evaluation may be warranted before commencing rehabilitation therapy. While we prefer in-person rehabilitation programs that last six to eight weeks, outpatient and web-based programs are also available, although the latter are less well-validated. (See

         <strong>
          Inpatient rehabilitation
         </strong>
         – The evaluation and management of patients recovering from acute COVID-19 who are admitted to a long-term acute care facility (LTAC), an inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF), or a skilled nursing facility (SNF) are similar to those described in the outpatient population. In addition, such patients commonly have a tracheostomy and most suffer from post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), which includes physical impairment from intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired neuromuscular weakness, cognitive, and neuropsychological impairment. If there is a delay in transferring the patient to an inpatient facility, ventilator weaning should begin in the acute care facility. If the patient remains infectious, appropriate precautions should be taken during tracheostomy collar weaning. Most patients in inpatient facilities require venous thromboembolism prophylaxis until the acute illness fully resolves and/or the patient becomes fully mobile. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Additional considerations for the inpatient rehabilitation patient'

         <strong>
          Return to work/exercise
         </strong>
         – The ability of patients to return to work or exercise should be assessed on an individual basis and will likely vary depending upon their baseline pre-COVID-19 functional status, the severity of their illness and any complications, and the intensity of planned activity. In general, patients planning to return to strenuous activity or a physically demanding occupation following myocarditis should be first evaluated by a cardiologist. (See
