         Patients with symptoms suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction (MI) and those who have electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of an acute MI manifested by ST elevations (&gt;1 mm in two contiguous leads or true posterior infarct after

Patients with typical symptoms in the presence of a new or presumably new left bundle branch block are also considered eligible. (See

         Coronary reperfusion with PPCI or fibrinolytic therapy improves outcomes in patients with acute ST-elevation MI (STEMI), an MI with a new or presumably new left bundle branch block, or a true posterior MI. If performed in a timely fashion, PPCI is the reperfusion therapy of choice, compared with fibrinolysis, because it achieves a higher rate of TIMI 3 flow (more than 90 percent) (

        </p>
        <p>
         The time to onset of reperfusion therapy is a critical determinant of outcome with both PPCI and fibrinolysis [

         The total time between the onset of symptoms and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) or fibrinolytic therapy, termed the treatment delay, has the following components [

         – For patients taken to a percutaneous coronary intervention center (PCI center), this is the time between the EMS call and the arrival at the PCI center and is equivalent to the time of EMS evaluation, prehospital electrocardiogram obtainment (if any), and transportation to the hospital. For patients transferred from a local hospital to a PCI center, this is sum of the time between the EMS call and arrival at the local hospital, the time at the local hospital, and the time between hospitals (second transfer time).

         With regard to fibrinolytic therapy, the benefit (myocardial salvage and functional improvement) is greatest when fibrinolytics are given within the first two to three hours after the onset of symptoms, particularly within the first 70 minutes (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53374" href="/z/d/graphic/53374.html" rel="external">

         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. However, many patients with STEMI present late after the development of symptoms. In different registries of patients, the time from symptom onset to hospital presentation was ≥4 hours in 50 percent (a value that changed little from 1987 to 2000) [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ], more than six hours in 40 percent [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ], and more than 12 hours in 9 to 31 percent [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. Data from an observational study found a lower percentage of late presenters (32 percent) in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Delay is greatest in females, older adults, and in those with symptoms that occur between 6 PM and 6 AM [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6,9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Initial studies primarily evaluated outcomes with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) without stenting, which is no longer the standard procedure. The data were conflicting as to whether there is [
         <a href="#rid10">

         ] or is not [

        </p>
        <p>
         Although outcomes are improved with PTCA plus stenting compared to PTCA alone, published data are limited on the prognostic importance of the time from symptom onset to reperfusion with stenting and the evidence is inconclusive:

         Two small cardiovascular magnetic resonance studies, which evaluated the relationship between the time from symptom onset to PPCI with stenting and MI size, came to differing conclusions [

         </span>
         The best available data come from a study of 6209 patients in a Denmark registry who underwent PCI with stenting between 2002 and 2008 [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. In the multivariable analysis, there was no significant relationship between onset of symptoms and PPCI (treatment delay) and long-term mortality. However, components of the treatment delay were significantly related to outcome. The impact of the components of treatment delay on mortality is discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Time from contact with the health care system (system delay)'

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Possible explanations for the absence of clear evidence to support a relationship between better outcomes and shorter time between symptom onset and PCI include the fact that patients are poor informants about the onset of symptoms, the period of intermittent thrombotic obstruction of the artery associated with stuttering of symptoms before total occlusion (lack of clarity as to what percent of the time is unstable angina), the improved effectiveness of PPCI versus fibrinolytics in late presenters (see below), the use of more aggressive antithrombotic therapies in the era of stenting, and patients with later presentation being less ill (survivor cohort effect) [
         <a href="#rid2">

         ].

         The interaction between time from symptom onset to PPCI and the interval between hospital arrival and PPCI (door-to-balloon time) is discussed below. (See

         In contrast to fibrinolysis, revascularization after 12 hours with PCI could be beneficial in the 9 to 31 percent of patients with STEMI who present more than 12 hours after the onset of symptoms [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         It has been estimated that, in the absence of reperfusion therapy, the infarct-related artery is still occluded at 12 to 24 hours in 65 percent of these patients [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. The establishment of TIMI 3 flow, as discussed below, may be of benefit in these patients. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Prognosis after primary PCI'
         </a>
         below.) The randomized trials that have evaluated routine late PCI have included patients at different time periods after symptom onset, ranging from more than 12 hours to up to 28 days. Some have demonstrated an improvement in left ventricular function with intervention, but none have demonstrated a significant benefit on hard clinical outcomes. The role of late PCI to open an occluded artery is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         In contrast to the uncertain relationship between mortality and the time from symptom onset to balloon inflation, the time from hospital arrival to balloon inflation (the door-to-balloon time [D2B time]) has been relatively well studied and is predictive of in-hospital mortality [

         In a systematic evaluation of 1440 STEMI patients who received primary PCI (PPCI) during 2006 to 2007 in Quebec, Canada, D2B times exceeded 90 minutes in 68 percent; death or readmission for MI or heart failure at one year occurred in 13.6 percent [

         Despite the evidence supporting the concept that longer D2B times lead to worse outcomes, improvement in D2B times has not lead to improvement in survival rates. In a study of nearly 100,000 STEMI patients in the United States CathPCI Registry of the National Cardiovascular Data Registry who underwent primary PCI between July 2005 and June 2009, median D2B times fell from 83 to 67 minutes, comparing the first to the last 12 months of the time period [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Despite this significant improvement, there was no change in risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality (5.0 versus 4.7 percent, respectively; p = 0.34).
        </p>
        <p>
         While there is a direct relationship between increasing mortality and longer D2B time, and while we support efforts to support D2B time, it may be difficult to demonstrate further improvements in survival with shorter times, particularly if they are on the order of magnitude of minutes. This is in part related to the impact of total ischemic time on mortality. In addition, the results of studies with longer follow-up may be illuminating.

         The door-to-balloon delay represents only a portion of the total time that the STEMI patient is managed by the healthcare system. This longer time interval, referred to as system delay, is the sum of the prehospital system and door-to-balloon delays. For patients first brought to a hospital without percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) capability, the system delay has multiple components. (See
         <a class="local">

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The associations between healthcare delays and mortality were evaluated in a study of 6209 patients with STEMI from 2002 to 2006 who were included in large, public medical databases in Western Denmark [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Approximately one-third of these patients were field-triaged to a PCI center and two-thirds were admitted to a local hospital and then transferred to a PCI center. In this cohort, the median follow-up time was 3.4 years and the cumulative one-year mortality was 9.3 percent. The following findings were noted:

         In the univariable analysis of the components of delay (system, prehospital system, door-to-balloon, treatment, and patient), system delay had the strongest association with mortality (hazard ratios [HR] 1.22, 1.19, 1.13, 1.054, and 1.042, respectively). All hazard ratios were significant.

         For system delays of 0 to 60 minutes, 61 to 120 minutes, 121 to 180 minutes, and 181 to 360 minutes, the long-term cumulative mortality was 15.4, 23.3, 28.1, and 30.8 percent, respectively.

         In the multivariable analysis, treatment delay and patient delay were not associated with mortality, but system delay was independently associated with mortality (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.16 per one-hour delay). The main components of system delay, prehospital system delay, and door-to-balloon delay were similarly associated with mortality (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.18 and 1.14, 95% CI 1.05-1.24, respectively).

         While this study demonstrates the negative impact of increasing system delay on mortality, it does not allow any firm conclusion regarding the time at which an alternative strategy using a fibrinolytic agent would be preferable. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Transfer from a non-PCI center'

        </p>
        <p>
         We believe that the earlier a patient presents (and thus a higher baseline risk), the less door-to-balloon delay that is acceptable. Thus, fibrinolytic therapy is an important option for patients who present within the first three hours and who are at a low risk of bleeding.

         STEMI patients diagnosed with a prehospital ECG should be transferred directly to the catheterization laboratory of a PCI-capable hospital (bypassing the emergency department) if the following two criteria are met: The patient is hemodynamically stable, and the patient is received by personnel (including one physician) qualified to care for critically ill patients. Transfer to the catheterization laboratory should occur in less than 120 minutes, if possible, in stable patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         As pointed out by the authors of the Western Denmark study discussed above, one implication of worse outcomes with longer door-to-balloon times is that mortality may be improved with direct transfer to a PCI hospital compared with evaluation and treatment at a closer hospital without PCI capability. The feasibility and impact of this strategy on door-to-balloon delay was evaluated in a nonrandomized comparison of 344 patients with chest pain of less than 12 hours duration and ST-segment elevation characteristic of acute MI in 2005 and 2006 [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. In this study, 135 patients were referred directly from the field by paramedics trained in ECG interpretation and 209 patients were referred directly from regional emergency departments. The median door-to-balloon time, defined as the time between arrival at the first hospital to first balloon inflation, was significantly shorter in patients referred from the field (69 versus 123 minutes) and the percent of patients with door-to-balloon times of less than 90 minutes was significantly higher (80 versus 12).
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with STEMI diagnosed with a prehospital ECG who are transported to a PCI-capable hospital, one way to shorten the time to reperfusion is to bypass the emergency department (ED) and take the patient directly to the catheterization laboratory. The efficacy of this approach was addressed in a study of 12,158 STEMI patients, 10.5 percent of whom bypassed the ED [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27

         The worse outcomes seen with longer door–to-balloon times are of particular concern for patients with acute MI who are initially evaluated at hospitals without on-site PCI capability. The time spent at the first hospital, the subsequent transfer time, and the time spent at the receiving hospital prior to arrival in the catheterization laboratory are sources of longer door-to-balloon times. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Time from hospital arrival (door-to-balloon time)'

         Diagnostic dilemmas, including nondiagnostic initial ECGs, led to the greatest delay, but these had limited or no impact on mortality. The door-in to door-out (DIDO) time is defined as the duration of time from arrival to discharge at the first (STEMI referral) hospital. The DIDO time is probably modifiable, as opposed to the non-modifiable delay caused by an additional ambulance ride. As a result, the DIDO time has become a performance measure of the United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29

         Significant improvement in D2B time as a result of the ability to transmit the prehospital electrocardiogram has been demonstrated in two studies [

         <a href="#rid45">
          45

        </p>
        <p>
         The strong evidence supporting better outcomes of PCI with multiple performance improvement strategies has led to the inclusion of shorter D2B time as a quality indicator in practice guidelines and the development of pay for performance reimbursement by insurers to hospitals [

         An important question is whether the results from controlled clinical trials at major centers can be applied to community practice. The ability to perform emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on a 24-hour basis requires a complex organization and the firm commitment of the catheterization laboratory staff. These logistic issues make primary PCI (PPCI) less available, especially at smaller, low-volume hospitals (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80948" href="/z/d/graphic/80948.html" rel="external">

         Some of the variation in results among institutions can be attributed to differences in the annual volume of PPCI at an individual hospital [

          14,47-50

         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. PPCI was associated with reduced mortality compared to fibrinolysis in high-volume (≥49 procedures, 3.4 versus 5.4 percent) and intermediate-volume hospitals (17 to 48 procedures, 4.5 versus 5.9 percent); the degree of benefit was similar to that seen in the large randomized trials. In contrast, there was no mortality benefit with PPCI in low-volume hospitals (≤16 procedures, 6.2 versus 5.9 percent), but the total stroke rate was significantly reduced (0.4 versus 1.1 percent).

         The 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association/Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions guideline for PCI recommended that PPCI be performed by experienced operators (&gt;75 elective PCI procedures per year, of which at least 11 are ideally for ST elevation MI [STEMI]) at high-volume centers (&gt;400 PCI procedures per year, of which at least 36 are ideally for STEMI) [

         In the early days of PCI, it was thought that on-site cardiac surgery might be required to best treat complications, particularly abrupt closure. This concern has diminished with the use of stents, which has largely eliminated the problem of acute vessel closure in nearly all cases. The following three studies support the performance of PCI in hospitals without on-site backup:

         The outcome with these two strategies in hospitals without on-site cardiac surgery was addressed by the C-PORT trial in which 451 fibrinolysis-eligible patients with an acute MI seen within 12 hours of symptoms were randomly assigned to PCI or fibrinolysis [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53

         ]. Patients undergoing PPCI had a significantly lower incidence of the composite end point (death, recurrent MI, and stroke) at six months (12.4 versus 20 percent for fibrinolysis); the difference in outcome was primarily due to a lower rate of recurrent MI (5.3 versus 10.6 percent).

         The 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF)/American Heart Association (AHA)/Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) guideline for PCI made a weak recommendation for PPCI at institutions without on-site cardiac surgery that met certain institutional and operator criteria (

         Electrocardiographic markers can successfully predict outcome in the broad range of patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction. In the first prospective evaluation of electrocardiographic markers in patients undergoing PPCI, the prognostic utility of six different methods for evaluating the extent of ST-segment elevation resolution after PCI was assessed in 4866 patients enrolled in the APEX-AMI trial [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58

One of these, the measurement of the residual, absolute ST elevation in the single, most affected (worst) lead 30 minutes after PCI, performed as well as the more complex methods. Data from additional therapeutic trials are needed before this marker can be considered a reasonable surrogate for clinical outcomes. (See

         Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) with stenting, if performed in a timely manner, is associated with better outcomes than fibrinolysis. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/80.html" rel="external">

         The time from symptom onset to PCI has not been shown to be an important determinant of outcome. At the least, the benefit from PPCI is less dependent upon the time from symptom onset than is fibrinolysis (

         The time from hospital arrival to PCI (door-to-balloon time) is an important determinant of benefit, with the best outcomes occurring when the time to PCI is 90 minutes or less. (See
         <a class="local">

         Increasing system delay is associated with worse outcomes. (See

         Patients who are transferred to a PCI center have better outcomes than those treated with fibrinolysis at the presenting hospital if PPCI is delivered according to guideline standards. Most of the benefit in these trials is due to a lower rate of reinfarction after PCI, which is unrelated to the time required for transfer. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Transfer from a non-PCI center'

         Destination protocols for emergency medical system that bypass non-PPCI-capable hospitals and thereby shorten system delays to PPCI have been associated with improved outcomes in ST elevation myocardial infarction. (See
         <a class="local">

         Hospitals should adapt strategies to reduce door-to-balloon times and thereby improve outcomes in STEMI patients treated with PPCI. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Hospital performance'
         </a>
         above.) All hospitals should meet American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association criteria for institutional and operator volumes in hospitals with or without on-site cardiac surgery. The door-to-balloon time should be less than two hours. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Importance of local expertise'

         Late PCI to open an occluded artery should be considered in patients with severe heart failure, hemodynamic or electrical instability, or persistent ischemic symptoms. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Late PCI to open an occluded artery'

         PPCI should not be performed in hospitals without on-site cardiac surgery unless they meet specific criteria, including having a proven plan for rapid transport to a cardiac surgery operating room in a nearby hospital and having appropriate hemodynamic support capability for transfer. (See
         <a class="local">
