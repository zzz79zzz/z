Patients with orthopedic injury may require anesthesia for emergency repair or damage control surgery, or for semielective procedures after evaluation and stabilization.</p><p>This topic will discuss the general approach to anesthesia for adult patients with orthopedic injuries, anesthesia for specific categories of orthopedic injury, and options for both regional and general anesthesia for these cases. Initial management of trauma in adults, damage control surgery and resuscitation, anesthesia for patients with spinal cord injury, anesthesia for patients with traumatic brain injury, and management of the difficult airway are discussed separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13854.html" rel="external">"Initial management of trauma in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94581.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for adult trauma patients"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/91915.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for adults with acute spinal cord injury"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90615.html" rel="external">"Management of the difficult airway for general anesthesia in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94283.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for patients with acute traumatic brain injury"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15151.html" rel="external">"Severe pelvic fracture in the adult trauma patient"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4227921497"><span class="h1">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Preanesthesia evaluation of patients with orthopedic trauma should be as thorough as the urgency of the situation allows. Initial assessment should be guided by advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocols. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13854.html" rel="external">"Initial management of trauma in adults", section on 'Primary evaluation and management'</a>.)</p><p>When possible, the full extent of the patient's injuries, course since injury, medical history, allergies, medications, and last oral intake should be reviewed. An airway assessment and directed physical examination should be performed. The patient may be unable to provide an accurate medical history because of head trauma, alcohol or illicit drug use, dementia, or severe pain.</p><p>Results of laboratory testing should be reviewed, including electrolytes, glucose, hemoglobin, platelet count, coagulation parameters, and lactate. Hemoglobin may be normal in patients who are hypovolemic, and may drop as the patient is resuscitated.</p><p>Other diagnostic studies, dictated by the patient's other injuries, should be reviewed as well. Preoperative cardiac evaluation should be guided by the patient's clinical status and cardiac risk factors. In general, preoperative cardiac testing beyond an electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed only if it will change anesthetic or medical management. The authors have a low threshold to order a preoperative echocardiogram in older patients with suspected valve disease or dyspnea of unknown origin (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6616.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94539.html" rel="external">"Preoperative evaluation for anesthesia for noncardiac surgery", section on 'Cardiovascular disease'</a>).</p><p>Signs and symptoms of severe associated injuries may be delayed in patients who have sustained multitrauma. The anesthesia and surgical teams should maintain a high index of suspicion for pneumothorax, internal bleeding, brain injury, and pulmonary or cardiac contusion throughout the perioperative period.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1523129593"><span class="h1">TIMING OF SURGERY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with orthopedic trauma should be managed according to advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocols, which include initial evaluation, stabilization, resuscitation, and determination of the extent of injury and need for further treatment.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Multitrauma</strong> – Unstable patients with severe trauma impacting multiple organs may be treated according to damage control protocols. For patients with orthopedic injury, this may mean initial quick application of external fixation, rather than definitive repair. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15148.html" rel="external">"Overview of damage control surgery and resuscitation in patients sustaining severe injury"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16732.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of severe lower extremity injury", section on 'Damage control surgery'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Orthopedic emergencies</strong> – Fractures that result in neurovascular compromise are true emergencies. Vascular injury can be limb-threatening and, in proximal vessels, life-threatening. Decompressive fasciotomy for compartment syndrome is also an emergent, limb-saving, and potentially life-saving procedure. Open fracture debridement should be considered an urgent but not emergency procedure. Early debridement (ie, within six hours) has not been shown to reduce the risk of infection compared with intravenous (IV) antibiotics and delayed debridement [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7659.html" rel="external">"Osteomyelitis associated with open fractures in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nonemergent injury</strong> – For those whose initial or definitive surgery can be delayed, the patient should be physiologically stabilized and medically evaluated prior to entering the operating room. This includes older patients with hip fracture. In general, we perform surgery for hip fracture within 24 to 48 hours for patients who are medically stable, without significant comorbid illness. We wait up to 72 hours for surgery in patients with active comorbidity who would benefit from preoperative medical evaluation and management. Medical evaluation for patients with hip fracture is discussed more fully separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4813.html" rel="external">"Hip fracture in older adults: Epidemiology and medical management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Surgery that is urgent should not be delayed to allow the stomach to empty. Pain and opioid medications slow or stop gastric emptying; the fasting interval should be the time between last oral intake and the injury. Therefore, most patients with orthopedic trauma are at risk for aspiration during induction of anesthesia and should be managed with rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94214.html" rel="external">"Rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII) for anesthesia"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3267713854"><span class="h1">SURGICAL COORDINATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Preoperative multidisciplinary communication among the anesthesia and surgery teams should be comprehensive and include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The planned procedure or procedures, and sequence of procedures, including the early placement of continuous peripheral nerve blocks for pain control prior to definitive procedure</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Urgency of surgery</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intraoperative positioning</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Expected blood loss</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Expected duration of surgery</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use of tourniquet</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H432171082"><span class="h1">CHOICE OF ANESTHETIC TECHNIQUE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The choice of anesthetic technique (ie, general anesthesia, neuraxial anesthesia, or peripheral nerve block) depends on the planned procedures and patient factors, including comorbidities. As examples, neuraxial and regional anesthesia may be beneficial for patients with severe reactive airway disease in order to avoid airway manipulation for general anesthesia. In contrast, the sympathectomy that results from spinal anesthesia may cause severe hypotension for patients with aortic stenosis or unresuscitated hypovolemia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/89517.html" rel="external">"Overview of neuraxial anesthesia", section on 'Physiologic effects of neuraxial anesthesia'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94358.html" rel="external">"Anesthesia for adult patients with asthma", section on 'Choice of anesthetic technique'</a>.)</p><p>Regional anesthesia may be beneficial, even if it is not the primary surgical anesthetic, as part of a balanced anesthetic along with general anesthesia to reduce intraoperative and postoperative opioid requirements. Regional anesthesia for specific categories of injuries is discussed below and is shown in a table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108491" href="/d/graphic/108491.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Anesthesia for upper extremity trauma'</a> below and <a class="local">'Anesthesia for lower extremity trauma'</a> below and <a class="local">'Pelvic fracture'</a> below.)</p><p>General concerns related to the choice of anesthetic technique for orthopedic trauma include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Multiple injuries</strong> –<strong> </strong>General anesthesia is used for most cases of emergent severe multitrauma and for surgery on more than one area of the body. If RA is employed, multiple sites of orthopedic injury may increase the risk of a wrong-sided block. Generally, the use of continuous RA to control pain in a single extremity is inappropriate when high-dose opioids are required for other injuries.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient cooperation</strong> –<strong> </strong>Patients who are intoxicated, under the influence of illicit drugs, or in severe pain may be unable to cooperate with placement of neuraxial or regional anesthetic blocks. If deep sedation is required either to perform regional anesthesia or during surgery, the risk of aspiration may be high; general endotracheal anesthesia may be preferred for such patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Positioning</strong> – Pain or potential for aggravating an injury may make positioning for block placement impossible or inadvisable. However, peripheral nerve block may be used for pain relief to allow positioning for neuraxial anesthesia (eg, femoral block to allow positioning for spinal anesthesia for hip or femur fracture).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In addition, the position for surgery may be uncomfortable and may require deep sedation or general anesthesia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hypovolemia</strong> –<strong> </strong>Preoperative hypovolemia or the expectation of significant intraoperative blood loss may preclude the use of neuraxial anesthesia. Neuraxial techniques cause a sympathectomy that can result in severe hypotension, especially in hypovolemic patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/105456.html" rel="external">"Spinal anesthesia: Technique", section on 'Hemodynamic management'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Coagulopathy</strong> –<strong> </strong>Neuraxial anesthesia and some regional anesthesia techniques are relatively contraindicated for patients with coagulopathy, which can be the result of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication, medical disorders, or coagulation abnormalities related to their injuries. Patients may be coagulopathic because of hypothermia or hemodilution from initial trauma resuscitative measures, or due to aggressive deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis in these high-risk patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14930.html" rel="external">"Neuraxial anesthesia/analgesia techniques in the patient receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Use of antifibrinolytics, most commonly <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10011" href="/d/drug information/10011.html" rel="external">tranexamic acid</a> (TXA), early after major trauma (eg, pelvic, hip, or femur fracture) may help reduce blood loss and transfusion. This is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15147.html" rel="external">"Etiology and diagnosis of coagulopathy in trauma patients"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94347.html" rel="external">"Perioperative blood management: Strategies to minimize transfusions", section on 'Antifibrinolytic agents'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/117817.html" rel="external">"Ongoing assessment, monitoring, and resuscitation of the severely injured patient", section on 'Management of acute traumatic coagulopathy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The plan for postoperative anticoagulation should be coordinated with the surgeon when regional anesthesia is considered.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Postoperative pain control</strong> – RA may be placed for postoperative pain control, even if general anesthesia is used for the primary surgery. Single-injection nerve block can provide pain control for positioning or for the immediate postoperative period, but generally, continuous techniques with epidural or peripheral nerve block catheters are indicated. Patients with a single site of severe pain may benefit from continuous RA techniques while awaiting surgery, to improve mobility and reduce the sympathetic response to pain [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The use of opioid and nonopioid analgesics for perioperative pain control (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a> infusion, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8588" href="/d/drug information/8588.html" rel="external">ketamine</a>, gabapentinoids, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/133187.html" rel="external">"Nonopioid pharmacotherapy for acute pain in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Trauma-related nerve injury</strong> – Orthopedic trauma may cause nerve injury, which should be documented preoperatively. If regional anesthesia is considered, the potential for masking trauma-related nerve injury or intraoperative nerve injury due to surgery should be discussed with the patient and the surgeon.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tourniquet pain</strong> –<strong> </strong>Tourniquet pain is a potent stimulus that increases over time and can break through otherwise adequate sensory peripheral nerve block or neuraxial anesthesia [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Beyond 90 minutes of tourniquet time, supplementation with systemic opioid or general anesthesia may be required.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intraoperative monitoring </strong>– Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may help guide fluid therapy and can be used to monitor for embolic phenomena associated with the fracture itself, debris from placement of a prosthesis or intramedullary rod, and air embolism from open venous sinuses. General anesthesia is required for the use of TEE.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3638349782"><span class="h1">ANESTHESIA FOR UPPER EXTREMITY TRAUMA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Upper extremity injury may include trauma from the clavicle to the wrist.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1713072465"><span class="h2">Proximal upper extremity fractures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Proximal upper extremity orthopedic injuries include clavicle fractures, acromioclavicular joint injuries, shoulder dislocations, and proximal humerus fracture.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Choice of anesthetic technique</strong> – General anesthesia is required for surgery for proximal and mid clavicle fracture. Peripheral nerve blocks can provide anesthesia for surgery on the distal clavicle, though in practice, general anesthesia is often preferred by patients and clinicians because the surgical field is very close to the face and airway  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108491" href="/d/graphic/108491.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The distal clavicle and the anterior superior shoulder are innervated by both the cervical plexus and the brachial plexus. Interscalene block (ISB) can be used for anesthesia and postoperative analgesia for distal clavicle or shoulder surgery, since it may include the supraclavicular branch of the superficial cervical plexus. If a very low volume of local anesthetic (LA) solution is used for ISB to avoid phrenic nerve block, the superficial cervical plexus may be missed, and a separate injection may be required.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The recently introduced clavipectoral block provides analgesia for midclavicular and distal fracture with motor sparing effects. For this block local anesthetic is deposited on both sides of a clavicle fracture deep to the clavipectoral fascia compartment. The superficial cervical plexus is also missed with this block and may require supplementation  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108491" href="/d/graphic/108491.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/100069.html" rel="external">"Upper extremity nerve blocks: Techniques", section on 'Brachial plexus blocks'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Associated injuries</strong> – Some proximal upper extremity injuries are associated with specific nerve damage, which should be documented preoperatively. Trauma of the clavicle and/or first rib may be associated with brachial plexus injury. Severe acromioclavicular joint separation can result in mechanical stretch injury of the brachial plexus, and humeral neck fractures are associated with axillary nerve trauma.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Clavicle fracture is also associated with injury of the subclavian artery. Screws used for plating of the proximal clavicle may be placed near the subclavian artery. Significant hemorrhage may occur intraoperatively, either during fracture manipulation or hardware placement.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Shoulder dislocation</strong> –<strong> </strong>Immediate relocation of a shoulder can often be performed using shoulder manipulation techniques without the use of sedatives, analgesics, or LAs. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/258.html" rel="external">"Shoulder dislocation and reduction", section on 'Reduction procedure'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Procedural sedation or intraarticular injection of LA may also be used. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/258.html" rel="external">"Shoulder dislocation and reduction", section on 'Analgesia and sedation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If anesthesia is required, options include short acting ISB (eg, with 1% <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a>) or a brief general anesthetic. Prolonged dense regional block is not advised, as the dislocation may recur with the muscle relaxation associated with the block, and prolonged pain relief is not required. Once the shoulder is relocated, pain dissipates quickly.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are not usually required for shoulder relocation during general anesthesia. If necessary, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9952" href="/d/drug information/9952.html" rel="external">succinylcholine</a> should be used, or a small dose of a <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10041" href="/d/drug information/10041.html" rel="external">vecuronium</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9872" href="/d/drug information/9872.html" rel="external">rocuronium</a> reversed with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="105866" href="/d/drug information/105866.html" rel="external">sugammadex</a>, to avoid prolonged neuromuscular block after this brief procedure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94535.html" rel="external">"Clinical use of neuromuscular blocking agents in anesthesia", section on 'Succinylcholine'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94535.html" rel="external">"Clinical use of neuromuscular blocking agents in anesthesia", section on 'Sugammadex'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4059330700"><span class="h2">Midhumerus fracture</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most proximal and midshaft humerus fractures are nondisplaced and are treated conservatively. However, there are a number of indications for surgery for these injuries, including open fractures, neurovascular compromise, and excessive angulation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/221.html" rel="external">"Midshaft humerus fractures in adults", section on 'Orthopedic consultation or referral'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Choice of anesthetic technique</strong> –<strong> </strong>Either general or regional anesthesia may be used for isolated midhumeral shaft fracture. Brachial plexus block using an interscalene, supraclavicular, or infraclavicular approach may be used, supplemented with an intercostobrachial nerve block  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108491" href="/d/graphic/108491.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Continuous supraclavicular or infraclavicular block may be performed for postoperative pain control.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Phrenic nerve block is almost universal with standard dose interscalene block, common with supraclavicular block, and less likely but possible with infraclavicular block.

The choice of anesthetic technique should be based on patient comorbidities and the anticipated procedure; for patients in whom either general or neuraxial anesthesia would be appropriate, we suggest neuraxial anesthesia. Compared with general anesthesia, neuraxial anesthesia may allow earlier return to baseline mental status in the immediate postoperative period due to lower doses of systemic anesthetics and reduced need for postoperative mechanical ventilation, which may improve postoperative outcomes.

Compartment syndrome is a condition whereby tissue ischemia can occur as a result of elevated pressures within a closed, osteofascial compartment that can lead to muscle necrosis and loss of limb. The incidence has been quoted to be 4 to 5 percent in patients with tibial fractures, particularly complex, proximal/midshaft open fractures of the tibia. Compartment syndrome should be suspected with increasing pain, decreased pulses, and tense swelling of affected muscles. Use of regional anesthesia for patients at high risk for compartment syndrome has been controversial due to concerns of masking symptoms of compartment syndrome such as paresthesia and paralysis. Low concentration and stable doses (ie, <strong>avoiding boluses</strong>) of LAs can be used for continuous nerve block for postoperative pain [<a href="#rid42">42-46</a>]. However, the use of regional anesthesia in these patients requires vigilance for early detection of compartment syndrome.
