         Sarcomas are malignant tumors that arise from skeletal and extraskeletal connective tissues, including the peripheral nervous system. The majority of soft tissue sarcomas (STS) present in the extremities; however, many other sites can be affected, including the retroperitoneum.

         This topic review will cover management of a locally recurrent retroperitoneal sarcoma (RPS). A general discussion of the diagnostic evaluation and staging of STS; the clinical features, evaluation, and initial treatment of RPS; local and systemic therapy for metastatic STS; and treatment of locally recurrent desmoid tumors (which may present in intra-abdominal and abdominal wall sites) are presented elsewhere:

         Surgical resection has traditionally been the only potentially curative treatment for localized RPS. In contrast to extremity soft tissue sarcoma (STS), for which the most common site of first recurrence (at least for intermediate- or high-grade tumors) is a distant site, the primary pattern of treatment failure after resection of RPS is local, although this also depends upon the histologic subtype. As an example, in one multicenter series of 1007 patients undergoing resection of a primary RPS, 408 patients developed recurrent disease during follow-up, including 219 patients (54 percent) with a local recurrence alone, 146 patients (36 percent) with distant metastases alone, and the remainder (10 percent) with both a local and distant recurrence [
         <a href="#rid1">

         </a>
         ]. (See

        <p>
         Locoregional recurrences can occur in the tumor bed, and they may also be multifocal or multicentric. In an analysis of 247 patients with well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma arising in the retroperitoneum, 66 of 142 well-differentiated liposarcomas recurred locoregionally, and of these, 33 (50 percent) were unifocal and the remainder were multifocal (defined as the presence of two or more tumors in the retroperitoneum) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Of the 33 multifocal recurrences, 11 (33 percent) were multicentric and outside field (defined as development of at least one tumor in a compartment remote from the index tumor). Patients with multifocal recurrent disease had an inferior survival rate compared with those with unifocal recurrent disease. Of the 105 patients with dedifferentiated liposarcomas, 48 recurred locoregionally, and one-half of these were unifocal recurrences. Of the 33 multifocal recurrences, seven were multicentric and outside field. Survival was not significantly worse for those with multifocal recurrent disease.

         Several factors contribute to a high rate of local recurrence for RPS compared with extremity STS [

         RPS are typically large at the time of diagnosis and are anatomically situated such that a wide resection is often not achievable. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/116605.html" rel="external">
          "Surgical resection of retroperitoneal sarcoma", section on 'Determination of resectability'

         The radiation tolerance of adjacent normal tissues (eg, liver [30 Gy], kidney [20 Gy], gastrointestinal tract [small bowel 50.4 Gy], and spinal cord [50 Gy]) is below the radiation dose levels for postoperative radiation therapy (RT), where doses of &gt;60 Gy have typically been used for extremity sarcomas.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         An important point is that local recurrences after complete resection of a primary RPS may be delayed [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]:

         </span>
         In several series, local control rates range from 41 to 55 percent at five years but are only 18 to 40 percent at 10 years [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6-9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>

         </span>
         In a report of 198 adult patients with RPS who were eligible for ≥5 years of follow-up, 40 percent of the 48 patients who were alive and disease free at five years recurred by 10 years [
         <a href="#rid7">

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, long-term follow-up, even beyond 10 years, is mandatory following initial treatment of RPS. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Risk factors for local recurrence include tumor size, histologic subtype and grade, status of the surgical margins, and whether adjunctive RT was administered [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,5,10-12

         In a single-institution prospective database of 675 patients treated surgically for primary nonmetastatic RPS from 1982 to 2010, the five-year cumulative incidence of local recurrence was 39 percent, and the independent factors for local recurrence were incomplete resection, tumor size, and histologic type [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The highest local recurrence rates were in liposarcomas of all subtypes (approximately 60 percent by 15 years), but early recurrences were especially pronounced with the dedifferentiated, round cell, and pleomorphic liposarcoma subtypes (the majority recurred within five years). Rates of local recurrence were lowest in leiomyosarcoma (approximately 22 percent) and solitary fibrous tumor (approximately 10 percent). Patients undergoing a macroscopically incomplete (R2) resection were 2.5 times more likely to have local progression compared with those with a complete or microscopically complete (R1/R0) resection.

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The influence of histologic type on patterns of recurrence was further shown in a series of 1007 consecutive patients with localized primary RPS who underwent resection between January 2002 and December 2011 at eight international centers [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Local recurrence rates were highest (&gt;30 percent) with liposarcoma (especially the dedifferentiated type) and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, and were lowest (&lt;15 percent) with leiomyosarcoma and solitary fibrous tumor.

         There are no randomized trials of surgery with and without postoperative (adjuvant) external beam RT. In retrospective series, the addition of postoperative RT reduced the risk of local recurrence and lengthened the recurrence-free interval. However, it has been more difficult to demonstrate a survival benefit.

         The largest uncontrolled single-institution experience included 145 French patients who presented with a localized RPS [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. The median tumor size was 15 cm (range 2 to 70 cm), 31 percent presented with neurovascular or bone involvement, 39 percent had grade 3 lesions, and 30 percent had liposarcoma subtype. Complete (macroscopic) excision had been carried out in 94, and 60 of these patients received postoperative RT (median dose 50 Gy). Among the patients who underwent complete excision, the five-year actuarial local recurrence-free survival was significantly greater for the 60 irradiated patients compared with the 34 who did not receive it (55 versus 23 percent).

         Radiographic imaging is a key component of the evaluation of a patient with a suspected local recurrence of RPS. All relevant imaging studies performed prior to resection of the primary RPS should be obtained and reviewed, as should all subsequent imaging studies, including the initial postoperative baseline imaging to determine the initial disease stage and whether residual gross disease remained after the initial resection. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7736.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical presentation and diagnosis of retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma", section on 'Imaging studies'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The current extent of local and distant disease should be determined using an oral and intravenous contrast-enhanced thin slice (2.5 to 5 mm [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]) multidetector row computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis to evaluate the primary site, as well as a chest CT to rule out metastatic disease to the lungs. The lungs are the first site of metastasis in the majority of cases. Imaging obtained at the time of recurrence should be compared with all prior imaging to ascertain the extent and progression of recurrent disease, with attention to the pattern of relapse (locoregional versus peritoneal versus distant to other sites), whether there is evidence of invasion into adjacent organs/critical structures, and the rate of progression. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14259.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma", section on 'MRI and CT'

         and
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14259.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although not required in most cases, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be a useful ancillary modality in selected situations to define the extent of local invasion into adjacent organs/structures that is not clear on CT. Specifically, MRI may be helpful for patients with a serious contrast allergy or another contraindication to CT, and for operative planning for pelvic tumors that may abut/involve musculoskeletal structures (eg, vertebrae, psoas muscle) [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) may be useful in selected cases. Integrated PET/CT scanning can achieve whole body imaging and is widely considered to be more sensitive than CT for the detection of occult distant metastases in a variety of solid tumors. One reported benefit in soft tissue sarcomas (STS) as a group is to detect sites of extrapulmonary metastatic disease. However, the risk is so low with most STS (including RPS) that routine use of PET for this purpose is unlikely to change the therapeutic plan. However, imaging with PET/CT may have a role in patients with clinical suspicion of recurrent RPS if the results on cross-sectional imaging are difficult to interpret. As examples, PET/CT may help clarify the situation if the extent of active abdominal disease is difficult to evaluate. PET/CT may show peritoneal implants, help distinguish postsurgical change from tumor, and/or delineate multifocal lesions [

         The histopathology of the primary RPS should be reviewed by a pathologist specializing in the evaluation of soft tissue tumors, and molecular subtyping should be performed where appropriate. (See

         Percutaneous core biopsy confirmation of a suspected recurrence is often useful to provide a definitive diagnosis because a variety of other entities can be mistaken for recurrence of the original primary RPS, which might be treated differently (eg, desmoid fibromatosis, radiation-induced osteosarcoma, or an angiosarcoma in the resection bed of an original liposarcoma).

         Locally recurrent RPS is best managed by an experienced multidisciplinary team in a specialized referral center. Although the best chance for cure is at the time of primary presentation, some patients with locally recurrent disease have prolonged disease control, and this is most likely to be optimized when care is delivered by an expert multidisciplinary team.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although surgical resection may be considered in patients with isolated metastases to the lung and liver, resection of locally recurrent tumor is generally not appropriate for patients who have synchronous distant metastatic disease [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14

         The most significant predictor of outcome following local recurrence is surgical resectability. Where feasible, reresection should be attempted for an isolated local recurrence. Approximately 60 percent of such tumors are potentially resectable, and five-year survival rates after reresection may be as high as 50 percent. Patients most likely to benefit from resection are those with a longer disease-free interval, no history of tumor rupture at primary resection, low-grade tumors (especially well-differentiated liposarcomas), and unifocal rather than multifocal disease. Multifocal intra-abdominal disease is difficult to resect completely, will almost certainly recur again, and carries a poor prognosis, particularly with resection alone. Because the oncologic benefit of surgery is likely to be limited and the risk of morbidity substantial, a very careful approach to patient selection for surgical intervention is required [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. The surgeon will need to weigh all factors, including the age and functional status of the patient, the tumor biology (ie, the strategy for a recurrent well-differentiated liposarcoma will be very different from that for a dedifferentiated liposarcoma or a leiomyosarcoma), the likelihood of achieving a complete resection, and the anticipated surgical morbidity.

         For patients who did not receive radiation therapy (RT) as part of initial therapy for their sarcoma, we suggest preoperative RT. Intraoperative RT (IORT) may also be an option. Postoperative RT is discouraged. (See

         Although not used in the United States, preoperative regional hyperthermia with systemic chemotherapy is another therapeutic option for locally recurrent tumors in parts of the world where it is available (mainly Europe), especially for previously irradiated patients. Whether this approach is superior to surgery, with or without RT, or chemoradiation is not clear. (See

         For patients with an unresectable recurrence (ie, due to involvement or encasement of critical structures such as aorta, superior mesenteric vessels, porta hepatis, or major nerve roots), the role of surgical debulking is unclear. Debulking surgery may be a reasonable option for some patients with low-grade (ie, well-differentiated) liposarcomas, although complete resection is preferred, if feasible. In most other situations, debulking surgery does not improve long-term survival, and it should not be attempted except for palliation of symptoms. Some RPS that is unresectable may be controlled long term with the use of high-dose charged-particle irradiation. However, availability of this technology is limited to a few specialized centers.

         Where feasible, reresection should be considered for an isolated locally recurrent tumor. Approximately 60 percent of such tumors are potentially resectable, and five-year survival rates may be as high as 50 percent. Patients most likely to benefit from resection are those with a longer disease-free interval, no history of tumor rupture/piecemeal resection at primary resection, low-grade tumors (especially well-differentiated liposarcomas), and unifocal rather than multifocal disease. Surgery should not be undertaken for patients with a multifocal recurrence and those with a poor performance status  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57945" href="/z/d/graphic/57945.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The addition of IORT may improve the local control rate in patients undergoing an operation for recurrent RPS, although the available data are limited [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17-19
         </a>
         ]. In one series of 32 such patients, 20 of whom had locally recurrent disease, patients received maximal tumor resection, IORT, and postoperative RT where feasible [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. The local control rate was 54 percent for patients with recurrent disease. The most common posttreatment complications were gastrointestinal obstruction (18 percent) and fistula formation (9 percent). Wound complications occurred in 3 percent. Preoperative RT is an option to improve local control.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some patients, particularly those with well-differentiated liposarcoma, may benefit from a period of initial observation followed by reimaging to select patients who are most likely to benefit from resection (ie, those who have a truly isolated local recurrence).
        </p>
        <p>
         Reresection may also be feasible for selected patients with a second and third local recurrence. However, with each local recurrence, there is a greater need for more complex en bloc resections, and tumor resectability dramatically diminishes with each reoperation. In one series, resectability rates were 80 percent for primary tumors compared with 57, 33, and 14 percent for first, second, and third recurrences, respectively [
         <a href="#rid20">

         Data suggest that a surgical approach to recurrent RPS is safe, as the rates of postoperative morbidity and mortality are comparable to those seen with surgery for primary RPS. As an example, one study conducted by the Trans-Atlantic Australasian Retroperitoneal Sarcoma Working Group (TARPSWG) evaluated 681 patients with a first local recurrence of RPS treated with resection. In this study, the 90-day postoperative mortality rate was 0.4 percent and the major complication rate was 16 percent. A transfusion requirement was predictive of major complications and worse overall survival (OS), but having a major complication was not associated with worse OS or a higher incidence of local recurrence or distant metastasis [

The five-year OS rate after resection was 43 percent, compared with 11 percent for those who were not resected.

         For patients who have not previously received RT, management of a local recurrence should be the same as for a de novo RPS. Preoperative RT is preferred over postoperative RT. (See

         There are no published guidelines for the RT fields to be employed in this situation. Some consideration should be given to treating both the area of recurrent disease as well as the site of the original tumor to a dose of 45 to 50.4 Gy at 1.8 to 2 Gy daily, although the target volume encompassing the area of original disease may need to be limited to the posterior abdominal wall tumor margin because of bowel that is often found in the prior resection cavity.
        </p>

         There is anecdotal experience with intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) to deliver an escalated dose of 57.5 Gy (similar to that reported in the setting of primary disease [

          Patterns of local recurrence
         </strong>
         – Surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment for localized retroperitoneal sarcoma (RPS). However, in contrast to extremity soft tissue sarcomas (STS), the primary pattern of treatment failure after resection of RPS is local. Recurrences may be delayed beyond five years. Factors that determine the frequency of local recurrence include tumor size, histologic subtype and grade, status of the surgical margins, and whether adjunctive radiation therapy (RT) was administered. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Frequency of local recurrence, time course, and risk factors'

          Pretreatment assessment
         </strong>
         – Radiographic imaging is a key component of the evaluation of a patient with a suspected local recurrence of RPS. The current extent of local and distant disease should be determined using an oral and intravenous contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to evaluate the primary site, as well as a chest CT to rule out metastatic disease to the lungs. Imaging obtained at the time of recurrence should be compared with all relevant imaging studies performed prior to resection of the primary RPS and with the initial postoperative baseline imaging.

         <strong>
          Reresection
         </strong>
         – The most significant predictor of outcome following local recurrence is the resectability of the recurrent disease. Where feasible, reresection should be attempted for an isolated locally recurrent tumor; approximately 60 percent of such tumors are potentially resectable, and five-year survival rates may be as high as 50 percent. A surgical approach to recurrent RPS is safe, as the rates of postoperative morbidity and mortality are comparable to those seen with surgery for primary RPS. Patients most likely to benefit from resection are those with a longer disease-free interval, no history of tumor rupture at primary resection, low-grade tumors (especially well-differentiated liposarcomas), and unifocal rather than multifocal disease.

         <a class="local">

          Predictive nomograms

         – Nomograms to predict disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates for patients undergoing surgery for first relapse of locally recurrent RPS can provide individualized, disease-relevant survival estimations and may prove helpful in clinical decision-making  (

          No prior radiation therapy

          Prior radiation therapy
         </strong>
         – An option for patients who have received prior RT is preoperative systemic chemotherapy with or without regional hyperthermia. Although not used in the United States, preoperative regional hyperthermia with systemic chemotherapy is used for locally recurrent tumors in parts of the world where it is available (mainly Germany). Whether this approach is superior to surgery, with or without RT, or chemotherapy alone will require a randomized trial. (See

Repeated debulking surgery may be a reasonable option for some patients with low-grade liposarcomas, although complete resection is preferred, if feasible. For other patients, debulking surgery does not improve long-term survival, and it should not be attempted. (See
