         Syncope is a clinical syndrome in which transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) is caused by a period of inadequate cerebral blood flow and oxygenation, most often the result of an abrupt drop of systemic blood pressure. Typically, the inadequate cerebral nutrient flow is of relatively brief duration, and, by definition, syncope is self-limited.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unfortunately, the term "syncope" is often misapplied to encompass other forms of abrupt collapse such as seizures or accidents, which may or may not be accompanied by TLOC. Such broader, less-specific usage of the term "syncope" should be avoided, as imprecise usage impairs accurate diagnosis and undermines comparison of clinical study outcomes. [

         Syncope is a transient, self-limited loss of consciousness caused by transient, self-terminating, inadequate nutrient flow to the brain. Syncopal episodes may or may not be preceded by prodromal symptoms, which are described below. (See

         Presyncope (or near-syncope) is a clinical manifestation that is suggestive of an impending syncope often occurring in conjunction with a similar set of prodromal symptoms (see

          'Onset/prodrome'

         The initial evaluation of patients with transient loss of consciousness (TLOC), some with suspected true syncope, serves both diagnostic and prognostic purposes  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131146" href="/z/d/graphic/131146.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). This evaluation enables the clinician to ascertain whether the episode was true syncope or another type of event, determine whether the affected patient should be admitted to the hospital or can be safely managed in the outpatient environment (ie, risk stratification)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118883" href="/z/d/graphic/118883.html" rel="external">

         Obtaining a detailed medical history is the first step in determining whether apparent transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) episodes are true syncope or the result of some other cause of collapse. If the history obtained is thorough, the story provided by the patient (and witnesses, if any) will often reveal the most likely cause(s) of syncope and will provide a means of focusing subsequent testing and treatment. Identifying any common threads with regard to associated symptoms, "downtime," or circumstances of onset can be helpful in suggesting an etiology.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, history taking is highly dependent on the experience of and time available to the clinician and whether the patient and witnesses can convey an accurate account of events, which may be limited due to communication barriers (eg, language barrier or cognitive dysfunction) or patient discomfort or intoxication. Also, in stressful circumstances, time periods (ie, duration of the event) may be difficult to accurately estimate. Even under ideal circumstances, the sensitivity of the history taking alone has not been well established. Consequently, confirmatory testing (with focus based upon the clinical evaluation) may be required to establish a diagnosis.

          Number and frequency of episodes
         </strong>
         – The frequency of episodes due to benign causes (such as vasovagal faint) is variable; many patients may experience only single or very rare episodes, but others will have multiple episodes over many years, leading to an impaired quality of life and predisposing to injury.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Of note, the patient with multiple episodes occurring over a short period of time (ie, several days or weeks) is more likely to be suffering from a serious underlying disorder (eg, intermittent high-grade atrioventricular [AV] block, paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia [VT], etc) and requires aggressive evaluation. However, it is unusual for multiple syncope episodes to occur in a single day. In particular, while reflex vasovagal faints may recur immediately if the affected individual tries to stand up prematurely, it is unusual for multiple vasovagal events to occur on the same day.

         Individuals having many episodes of apparent "syncope" each day and/or episodes lasting many minutes in duration may be suffering from nonsyncope psychogenic disorders ("psychogenic pseudosyncope" or "psychogenic pseudoseizures") which are considered to be conversion reactions rather than true syncope.

         – Reflex syncope may be triggered by emotional or orthostatic stress, fear, or intense pain, or by a warm and/or crowded environment. However, in many instances, it may not be possible to confidently identify the trigger. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1050.html" rel="external">

         Carotid sinus syndrome (CSS) is suggested by syncope occurring immediately following abrupt neck movements. Carotid sinus hypersensitivity triggered during carotid sinus massage (CSM) may suggest this susceptibility, but should not be relied on to establish the diagnosis of CSS unless other possible causes have been considered and excluded and CSM reproduces syncope symptoms. Carotid sinus syncope is usually a condition of older patients (generally &gt;60 years of age with male predominance) or patients with prior head and neck surgery or irradiation. (See

          Patient position
         </strong>
         – Assessing the patient's position (ie, supine, sitting, or standing) at the time of syncope, along with any recent changes in position during the preceding few minutes prior to syncope, provides clues to the etiology.

          While in an unprotected position (eg, prolonged standing)
         </strong>
         – Reflex syncope most commonly occurs when the patient is upright (standing or seated) and almost never when supine. Syncope resulting from orthostatic hypotension is frequently associated with a change from a supine to erect posture, although several minutes may pass between the patient arising and the subsequent collapse.

          While supine

         – Syncope that occurs when the patient is supine or recumbent suggests a cardiac arrhythmia and is therefore worrisome. Even if the arrhythmia persists, the TLOC is often brief given the body's adaptive hemodynamic compensatory responses (eg, vascular constriction).

          Relation to exercise
         </strong>
         – The timing of syncope in relation to exercise is very important, as syncope during full-flight exercise may be indicative of a serious condition (eg, exercise-triggered tachyarrhythmia or hypotension), while syncope immediately after exercise tends to be more innocent and reflex in origin. Syncope that occurs during exertion suggests a potentially life-threatening etiology (eg, aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or other channelopathy) and should be taken very seriously. On the other hand, syncope occurring soon after termination of exertion (eg, during cooling-off period) is more likely reflex in origin, similar to the vasovagal faint.

         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3

         ]. Most patients who experience syncope have a warning premonition period of at least a few seconds or longer prior to losing consciousness. This is particularly the case for reflex faints. On the other hand, some patients will suddenly lose consciousness without apparent warning or, due to retrograde amnesia, may not recollect a warning symptom.
        </p>
        <p>
         Extended symptoms with a classic prodrome are more commonly associated with the vasovagal form of reflex syncope, while sudden onset of syncope with minimal or no prodrome is more common among patients with cardiac syncope. However, some patients with impaired memory may be amnestic following the event and unable to recall any prodrome, and may therefore report sudden TLOC without warning. (See

         The following are classic prodromal (presyncopal) symptoms associated with imminent syncope and presyncope. These are particularly common in younger patients with the vasovagal form of reflex syncope but less so in older vasovagal fainters or those with syncope from other causes:

         Prodromal symptoms may be very disconcerting and are often described by patients as "nearly blacking out" or "nearly fainting." Distinguishing true presyncope from more nonspecific complaints such as "lightheadedness," "brain fog," or other conditions such as "vertigo" may be difficult but is important. (See

         If the syncopal event was observed, the witness should be asked to provide as much information as possible in addition to the history obtained from the patient. A mobile phone video can be very helpful if the witness is capable of obtaining one. Witnesses should be asked to describe the following features:

         Loss of postural stability is inevitable with TLOC, and, consequently, syncope is generally associated with physical collapse. Physical collapse may cause injury due to a fall (such as may occur if the person is standing) or other type of accident (eg, if syncope occurs while driving or while in a high-risk environment such as working on a ladder or with machinery). The injury risk, of course, applies not only to the "fainter" but may affect others who are injured secondarily (eg, motor vehicle accident) [

         The duration of the loss of consciousness – True syncope of any etiology is usually brief since the loss of postural tone (and the subsequent gravitationally neutral position) generally restores brain blood flow.

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Longer periods of real or apparent loss of consciousness (especially if &gt;5 minutes) suggest that the event is not syncope or is not syncope alone. A prolonged event could be syncope resulting in a fall complicated by head injury (concussion may prolong TLOC), a seizure, or psychogenic pseudosyncope (a collapse deemed secondary to a conversion reaction or dissociative episode [
         <a href="#rid2">

         Estimates of the duration of a TLOC episode by patients or witnesses are generally imprecise.

         Persistence of nausea, pallor, and diaphoresis in addition to prolonged fatigue (lasting minutes to hours) after a syncope episode suggest a reflex event (particularly a vasovagal episode). These findings are helpful in distinguishing reflex syncope from syncope due to an arrhythmia.

         Neurologic changes or confusion during the recovery period may suggest a stroke or seizure. However, postevent confusion may also occur with syncope and may complicate accuracy of recall of the event, including time estimates.

          Orthostatic vital signs
         </strong>
         – Pulse and blood pressure should be obtained with the patient supine, seated, and standing (the last immediately upon standing as well as after standing at least five minutes). These measurements may detect susceptibility to orthostatic hypotension (OH). A drop of ≥20 mmHg (&gt;30 mmHg in hypertensive patients) in systolic pressure and/or a drop of ≥10 mmHg in diastolic pressure is considered diagnostic of OH. However, such numbers should only be used as touchstones, and should not be considered definitive proof of the etiology of syncope unless it is consistent with the patient's clinical presentation, such as syncope triggered immediately (immediate form) or three to five minutes (delayed or classic form) after standing or occurring after prolonged upright posture in absence of other explanation. A noninvasive system for continuous beat-by-beat blood pressure and heart rate monitoring (eg, Nexfin) that avoids multiple inflations of a sphygmomanometer cuff is preferred. Conventional blood pressure cuff pressures may not be taken rapidly enough to avoid missing the transient blood pressure fall often associated with immediate OH during change of posture. (See

         Most focal neurologic conditions do not cause true syncope. Exceptions are those with major autonomic dysfunction components, such as pure autonomic failure, Parkinson disease, or, occasionally, temporal lobe seizures that may trigger "ictal asystole." Signs of focal neurologic disease, such as hemiparesis, dysarthria, diplopia, vertigo, or signs of Parkinsonism, are suggestive of (but not diagnostic of) a neurologic cause of impairment of consciousness, warranting a full neurologic evaluation. In general, however, while neurologic disease may be responsible for other forms of TLOC, such as generalized epilepsy, true syncope is not indicative of a primary neurologic condition. On the other hand, syncope or accidental falls with secondary head trauma leading to concussion may necessitate neurologic evaluation.

         When structural heart disease is known or is suspected based on the results of the history, physical examination, and ECG, a transthoracic echocardiogram should be performed to evaluate for structural heart disease [

        <p>
         In general, echocardiographic findings are used to identify the presence of structural heart disease, but they do not usually provide a specific causal diagnosis in syncope patients, as more than one potential diagnosis may be contributing. However, certain findings are highly suggestive of a cause of syncope, including left atrial myxoma, severe aortic valvular stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with significant left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, marked pulmonary arterial hypertension, certain forms of congenital heart disease, such as abnormal aortic origin of a coronary artery, and pericardial tamponade [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8

         Of note, many patients have multiple comorbidities that can contribute to TLOC, and, consequently, there may be multiple plausible causes of syncope that require careful assessment. An observed abnormality should not be assumed to be the cause of collapse without first giving careful consideration to alternative diagnoses and interactions among various coexisting conditions. For example, orthostatic hypotension is common among older patients, but susceptibility to syncope may be the result of medications that the patient has been prescribed, an intercurrent illness, a previously unrecognized neurologic disease (eg, Parkinson disease), or even a previously unsuspected arrhythmia that undermines the individual's hemodynamic stability. Similarly, carotid sinus hypersensitivity (CSH) is a common finding in older patients, but only infrequently is CSH the cause of syncope (in which case the condition is termed carotid sinus syndrome).

          Definition
         </strong>
         – Syncope is a transient, self-limited loss of consciousness caused by transient, self-terminating, inadequate nutrient flow to the brain; episodes may or may not be preceded by prodromal symptoms. Presyncope (or near-syncope) is a manifestation of prodromal symptoms reflecting the same conditions that might lead to syncope in the same individual at other times. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Definitions'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Initial evaluation
         </strong>
         – The initial evaluation of patients with transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) and suspected syncope should focus on differentiation of true syncope from other events  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131146" href="/z/d/graphic/131146.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ), risk stratification  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118883" href="/z/d/graphic/118883.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ), and assessment of potential causes  (

          table 2

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The evaluation should generally include a comprehensive history (including information about events, preexisting conditions, medications, and family history), witness observations if available, a physical examination (which may include careful carotid sinus massage in older patients), and review of ECGs. Documentation of medications that the patient is taking is an important element of the initial evaluation. A transthoracic echocardiogram is useful to evaluate for structural heart disease if this is suspected. (See

         <strong>
          Clinical features
         </strong>
         – The clinical features associated with a syncopal event may be diagnostic  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118883" href="/z/d/graphic/118883.html" rel="external">

          table 2
         </a>
         ). Key features of events include the frequency and duration of events, triggers and circumstances, presence and types of prodromal symptoms, witnessed signs during episodes, and features of recovery. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical features'

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Classic prodromal symptoms associated with syncope and presyncope, particularly the vasovagal form of reflex syncope, include lightheadedness, a feeling of being warm or cold, sweating, palpitations, pallor, nausea, visual blurring, and diminution of hearing and/or occurrence of unusual (often "whooshing") sounds.

         <strong>
          Physical examination
         </strong>
         – A number of findings on physical examination can aid in the identification of some of the common causes of syncope, including abnormalities in the vital signs, orthostatic blood pressure changes, cardiovascular abnormalities, and, less frequently, neurologic signs. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Electrocardiogram
         </strong>
         – A 12-lead ECG should be obtained in all patients with suspected syncope, and an ambulatory ECG is warranted in many cases. The 12-lead ECG only rarely identifies a specific arrhythmic cause of syncope, although certain findings (eg, persistent bradycardia &lt;40 beats per minute, high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block, ventricular or supraventricular tachycardia with rapid ventricular rate, pacemaker malfunction, etc) are considered diagnostic.

          Differential diagnosis
