Pulmonary artery thromboendarterectomy (PTE), variably referred to as pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) is the only definitive and potentially curative therapy for CTEPH. However, PTE is a major thoracic surgery and selecting ideal candidates is critical for its success. Medical therapy is noncurative and is generally reserved for those who are not operative candidates or patients who fail or decline PTE.</p><p>The approach to initial management, evaluation, and selection of patients with CTEPH for surgical or medical therapy are reviewed here. Guidelines set forth by the 6<sup>th</sup> world symposium on pulmonary hypertension (PH) are in general followed in this topic [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and administration and outcomes of surgical and medical therapy are described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8254.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8255.html" rel="external">"Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16628.html" rel="external">"Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: Pulmonary hypertension-specific therapy"</a>.)</p><p>The approach outlined in this topic is, for the most part, consistent with guidelines set out by several international societies [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19764128"><span class="h1">ANTICOAGULANT THERAPY (INDEFINITE)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The <strong>first</strong> step in the management of CTEPH is the immediate initiation of anticoagulant therapy, provided the patient is not at a high risk of bleeding. In those who are at high risk of bleeding, we typically place an inferior vena cava filter until the bleeding risk is resolved and adequate anticoagulation can be provided. Our approach is based upon the biologic rationale that anticoagulant therapy prevents further thromboembolism and indirect data from patients who undergo anticoagulation for acute thromboembolism [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. In our experience recurrent thromboembolism is rare and most often due to subtherapeutic anticoagulation.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Agent</strong> – Once a diagnosis of CTEPH is in place, we immediately treat patients with anticoagulant therapy using intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8518" href="/z/d/drug information/8518.html" rel="external">unfractionated heparin</a>, subcutaneous low molecular weight (LMW) heparin, or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC; eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9498" href="/z/d/drug information/9498.html" rel="external">rivaroxaban</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="85642" href="/z/d/drug information/85642.html" rel="external">apixaban</a> can be used without a short course of LMW heparin).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For long-term management, we typically choose either a vitamin K antagonist (VKA; <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a>) or a DOAC. Historically, warfarin was the agent of choice, although DOACs are now often used based upon their efficacy in patients with acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95395.html" rel="external">"Venous thromboembolism: Anticoagulation after initial management", section on 'Direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors'</a>). Data regarding the efficacy of DOACs in patients with CTEPH are limited and conflicting. While retrospective data demonstrated a possible higher rate of thromboembolic recurrence associated with use of DOACs compared with warfarin [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>], other retrospective data demonstrated that <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9498" href="/z/d/drug information/9498.html" rel="external">rivaroxaban</a> was a safe alternative to warfarin without an increase in recurrent venous thromboembolism [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Bleeding rates appear to be similar with both agents [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a>, the target International Normalized Ratio (INR) is 2 to 3. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95395.html" rel="external">"Venous thromboembolism: Anticoagulation after initial management", section on 'Warfarin'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients in whom DOACs are chosen, the risk of drug-drug interaction mediated by P-glycoprotein and cytochrome 3A4 should be taken into consideration. Among the available DOACs, no one agent is preferred. Agent choice and dosing are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95395.html" rel="external">"Venous thromboembolism: Anticoagulation after initial management", section on 'Direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Factors that influence the choice of anticoagulant  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107541" href="/z/d/graphic/107541.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) are discussed separately.

Interruption and resumption of anticoagulation for procedures or surgery is discussed separately.

The rationale for anticoagulant therapy is based upon the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Our clinical experience and the assumption that the thromboembolic event resulting in CTEPH represents a "pro-thrombotic" state.

The referral should <strong>not</strong> be delayed even if the symptoms, hemodynamic abnormalities, or ventilatory impairment seem mild. The purpose of the evaluation is to reconfirm the diagnosis of CTEPH, obtain further testing, if necessary, and develop an appropriate therapeutic approach whether it be PH-specific medical therapy, balloon angioplasty, or pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE). If PTE is delayed, the development and progression of a secondary vasculopathy may result in a sub-optimal hemodynamic outcome from PTE and may increase the mortality risk associated with the procedure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>CTEPH referral center</strong> – At minimum, the center should have experience in evaluating and treating patients with CTEPH. The evaluation in specialist centers is undertaken by a multidisciplinary team that typically consists of a surgeon with experience in performing PTE (ideally &gt;50 cases/year with a mortality rate of &lt;5 percent), PH experts with experience in the treatment of PH, radiologists with experience in imaging CTEPH (eg, digital extraction pulmonary angiography), and intensivists who are adept at managing these patients in the critical postoperative period. CTEPH centers are now also gaining expertise in percutaneous pulmonary artery balloon angioplasty (BPA), mostly performed by interventional cardiologists, although experience in BPA is not yet a prerequisite for defining CTEPH center expertise.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Data needed for referral</strong> – Useful data for a referring PH center to include are the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Documentation of a comprehensive clinical history and examination supporting PH and CTEPH</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patient’s functional class  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62080" href="/z/d/graphic/62080.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) and six-minute walk test</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Relevant comorbidities</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pulmonary function tests</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Transthoracic echocardiography report</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Results from investigative laboratory reports (eg, HIV status, liver function tests)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Radiology imaging documenting anatomic assessment from at least two imaging modalities (eg, ventilation/perfusion scanning, computed tomography [CT] of the chest or CT pulmonary angiography, magnetic resonance pulmonary angiography or invasive pulmonary angiography)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) results (if available)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">These data are typically performed as part of the diagnostic investigation for PH and for CTEPH.

We evaluate patients even if the symptoms, hemodynamic abnormalities, or ventilatory impairment seem mild because early surgery may prevent the development of a secondary, small-vessel vasculopathy, which may make the patient less likely to be suitable for surgery or may contribute to post-PTE residual PH [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>The decision to proceed to PTE in a patient with CTEPH involves complex decision-making, which involves an interplay among the answers to the following questions:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Is there significant hemodynamic or exercise impairment?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Are the chronic thromboemboli accessible to surgery?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>What is the anticipated postoperative hemodynamic outcome?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Are there comorbid conditions affecting surgical candidacy?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Are there patient preferences that impact the decision?</p><p></p><p>The main focus of the evaluation is to determine whether removal of thromboembolic material would sufficiently reduce the pulmonary artery vascular resistance (PVR). The latter assessment is critical since outcomes are dependent upon the effect of PTE on PVR. Outcomes are favorable when PVR decreases. In contrast, failure of the PVR to decrease following PTE is associated with poor short-term outcomes (inability to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass, early postoperative hemodynamic instability, early postoperative death) and poor long-term outcomes (eg, residual PH) [<a href="#rid9">9-11</a>]. This is particularly true among patients with severe PH and right ventricular dysfunction. Since routine objective parameters are lacking [<a href="#rid12">12</a>], this assessment should only be undertaken at specialized CTEPH centers by clinicians familiar with the disease process and its management, thereby ensuring optimal patient selection.</p><p>In a European registry, approximately one-third of patients with CTEPH were deemed inoperable based upon several factors including the distal nature of their pulmonary artery obstruction, an imbalance between the severity of PH and the radiographically visible morphologic lesion, a PVR greater than 1500 dynes-sec/cm<sup>-5</sup> (&gt;19 Wood units), older age, or the presence of a comorbidity prohibiting surgery [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. With improvements in imaging technology, surgical techniques, and postoperative management, the number of patients deemed inoperable at expert centers has fallen.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H999849195"><span class="h2">Is there significant hemodynamic or exercise impairment?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In order to assess the hemodynamic impairment from CTEPH, we re-examine pulmonary artery catheterization (PAC) data  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131060" href="/z/d/graphic/131060.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients with substantial hemodynamic abnormalities at rest</strong> – Patients in this category are most likely to benefit from PTE. Most patients undergoing evaluation for PTE have hemodynamic abnormalities at rest that almost invariably warrant surgery (eg, PVR of 160 to 1200 dynes-sec/cm<sup>-5</sup> [2 to 15 Wood units] with the majority falling into the range of 600 to 1000 dynes-sec/cm<sup>-5</sup> [7.5 to 12.5 Wood units]).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although the perioperative mortality risk increases with the level of the preoperative PVR, we still consider PTE in those with very high PVR, as long as the anticipated reduction in PVR based on the hemodynamic and angiographic findings obtained in the evaluation process will result in a postoperative PVR ≤500 dynes-sec/cm<sup>-5</sup> (6.25 Wood units).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">This estimate of PVR reduction is a subjective one involving an evaluation of the degree of PH, the extent of surgically accessible thrombus, and the contribution of a secondary vasculopathy to the elevated PVR and is best obtained by those with considerable expertise in the disease process.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients without substantial hemodynamic impairment at rest</strong> – In patients without substantial hemodynamic impairment at rest, we test the pulmonary hemodynamic response to exercise during PAC (eg, PVR &lt;160 dynes-sec/cm<sup>-5</sup> [&lt;2 Wood units]) using either cycle ergometry or the repetitive lifting of hand weights intended to increase the cardiac output (varies among centers).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients in whom exercise-induced PH is found, we still consider PTE as potentially beneficial. An increase in pulmonary artery pressures with exercise suggests that the patient's right ventricular workload increases during their activities of daily living, thereby resulting in exercise limitation, which may result in long-term progression of their PH, thereby justifying PTE.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients without a substantial increase in pulmonary hemodynamics with exercise, the benefits of PTE are less clear. In such cases we consider PTE when the patient’s exercise intolerance and quality of life dissatisfaction is of sufficient magnitude that the patient is willing to accept the risk of surgery.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1018811728"><span class="h2">Are the chronic thromboemboli accessible for surgery?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with CTEPH, we use imaging to determine whether chronic thromboemboli are accessible for surgery. Only thromboembolic disease located proximally in the main, lobar, or segmental pulmonary arteries are amenable to surgical removal while distal disease is not typically surgically accessible  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131060" href="/z/d/graphic/131060.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Digital subtraction pulmonary angiography (DSPA) is considered the gold standard in defining the extent and location of the thromboembolic obstruction. However, with improving expertise at experienced centers, an increasing number of patients with distal disease (ie, segmental or subsegmental thromboemboli) may undergo surgery with acceptable hemodynamic and functional outcomes [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>].</p><p>In patients with profound right ventricular failure and shock, the risk of DSPA may be prohibitive to this assessment. In such patients, we use less invasive imaging studies such as computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or magnetic resonance pulmonary angiography (MRPA).</p><p>In patients with suspected CTEPH who have a known contrast allergy or renal insufficiency, every attempt should be made to perform contrast-enhanced studies. If absolutely contraindicated, then CTPA and MRPA can be used.
