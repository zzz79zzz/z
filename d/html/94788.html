         The use of any anticoagulant is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, and bleeding complications can be life-threatening. Management of bleeding in individuals who are receiving a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) can be challenging because routine coagulation tests cannot generally be used to determine the degree of anticoagulation, and some of the reversal agents are difficult to access and may be prothrombotic.

         This topic discusses our approach to managing bleeding in patients receiving DOACs.

         </span>
         Bleeding is a spectrum, and bleeding that is initially minor can sometimes become more significant or even life-threatening. Thus, clinical judgment is required in all cases of bleeding to determine the risk to the patient and the appropriate degree of concern regarding whether the bleeding is resolving or worsening.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is worth remembering that the initial presentation of bleeding may be misleading; what appears to be massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding may in retrospect be less serious than initially suspected, while many forms of "occult" bleeding may present innocuously but ultimately lead to major morbidity or death; retroperitoneal bleeding is an example.
        </p>
        <p>
         Bleeding severity cannot initially be measured with hemoglobin determinations; development of anemia will be delayed until after fluid resuscitation or re-equilibration from body water, which may take several hours.
        </p>
        <p>
         We define serious/major bleeding as bleeding that is associated with a risk of blood transfusion or bleeding into a critical closed space (eg, intracranial bleeding, compartment syndrome). Major bleeding may also include bleeding requiring an intervention for management (eg, surgery, interventional radiology procedures, endoscopic treatments). Major bleeding has a significant risk of immediate morbidity, regardless of the cause. Some major bleeding may be life-threatening and patients with major bleeding events are at high risk of death during the hospitalization prompted by that bleeding.
        </p>
        <p>
         Minor but still clinically significant bleeding includes bleeding requiring a healthcare assessment or less invasive treatment, such as heavy menstrual bleeding, ecchymosis, or epistaxis. All types of bleeding are important to the patient; however, minor bleeding usually will not require interruption of anticoagulant therapy.

         More severe bleeding will require more aggressive interventions than minor bleeding. Bleeding is assessed according to the site, rate of hemorrhage, and amount of blood loss. This includes a thorough physical examination with serial measurement of vital signs. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Bleeding severity'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Serial measurement of the hemoglobin level may be appropriate if there is concern about significant blood loss; of note, a fall in hemoglobin level is likely to be delayed with acute massive blood loss. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Other limited laboratory testing'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Imaging studies (eg, computed tomography scanning for intracranial or retroperitoneal hemorrhage) and/or endoscopy to visualize the bleeding site may also be required.
        </p>
        <p>
         Many patients presenting with minor bleeding, slow blood loss, or simple anemia without evidence of bleeding may not require DOAC reversal. Given the short half-lives of these drugs, even short-term but unneeded interruption of therapy could result in avoidable thrombosis. Occasionally, bleeding that appears significant in fact is not (eg, some epistaxis or hemorrhoidal bleeds); in such cases, observation and local measures such as ice and pressure may allow resolution of the bleeding without requiring aggressive treatments that might expose the patient to the risks of reversal strategies and potential thrombosis due to withdrawal of anticoagulants.

         The degree of anticoagulation is important both for predicting the course of the bleeding episode and for determining which interventions will be required. The anticoagulation status depends on the specific agent, dose, time since the last dose, and renal (and to a lesser extent hepatic) function.

         Coagulation testing is not used for determining the anticoagulation status of a patient receiving a DOAC. Prolonged coagulation times can be helpful in determining residual anticoagulant effect  (

Clinicians should check with their local laboratory to determine whether (and which) rapidly available assay can exclude the presence of a significant DOAC effect.

         If the relevant laboratory has determined that the PT or aPTT (or a modified version of these tests) is reliably prolonged by even low concentrations (eg, 30 to 50 ng/mL) of the agent in question, a normal value may be reassuring; this requires consultation with laboratory personnel regarding institution-specific testing that has been validated for use in assessing DOAC effect [

         Specialized testing has limited availability but may be of use if it is available with a rapid turnaround time from a laboratory that is familiar with such testing. This testing may include anti-factor Xa heparin level (useful as a guide to the presence of a direct factor Xa inhibitor), quantitative factor Xa inhibitor levels, and quantitative

         levels (eg, as determined using a dilute thrombin time). These tests may be of particular use when use of a reversal agent is being considered. Impairment of holistic coagulation tests, such as the TEG, may indicate the presence of a DOAC, but there is no evidence that these tests are changed in a way that predicts the amount of drug present.

         – Although we treat patients with persistent bleeding in the setting of normal basic coagulation testing as if they remain anticoagulated, an exception is a patient receiving dabigatran who has a normal TT; we consider this sufficient to eliminate the possibility of continued dabigatran effect. However, the TT is extremely sensitive to the effects of dabigatran and can be prolonged even by trivial amounts of the drug. If available, a calibrated dilute TT is preferable since it correlates linearly with dabigatran concentration.

         Increased anti-factor Xa activity may reflect the presence of continued anti-factor Xa anticoagulant effect; however, unless the assay used has been calibrated for the specific anticoagulant the patient is taking, the amount of anticoagulant effect present cannot be reliably determined. Thus, it is important to consult with laboratory personnel regarding how the assay behaves in the presence of each of the different factor Xa inhibitors.

         We do not use thromboelastography (TEG) or related point-of-care coagulation tests to manage DOAC-associated bleeding. DOACs have been demonstrated to affect the results of TEG and similar tests; however, data correlating these tests with drug concentration, clinical bleeding, and/or anticoagulant effect are lacking [

         However, depending on the severity of bleeding, we often perform a complete blood count (CBC) to assess the serum hemoglobin level and platelet count because transfusions of red blood cells and/or platelets may be indicated in some patients.

        <p>
         It may also be appropriate in some patients (eg, trauma, incomplete history) to evaluate for other causes of prolonged coagulation times, including liver disease, nutritional depletion of vitamin K, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or the use of a non-DOAC anticoagulant. Assessment of abnormal renal or hepatic function is important because these conditions could affect bleeding directly (by causing impaired platelet function or coagulopathy, respectively) or indirectly (by reducing metabolism of the anticoagulant).

         Early involvement of appropriate specialists is vital for definitive interventions at the site(s) of bleeding, which can be both diagnostic and therapeutic.

          Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)

         – ICH is of great concern because bleeding increases intracranial pressure, and expansion of the hematoma is common. Importantly, the diagnosis of ICH is confirmed by noncontrast computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), whichever is fastest; however, empiric treatment for suspected ICH in the absence of intracranial imaging is appropriate in some cases (eg, when the time delay in obtaining intracranial imaging could be life-threatening).

         High-quality evidence from randomized trials is lacking for these strategies; thus, our practice is based on clinical experience and data from case series [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,11
         </a>
         ]. Our practice attempts to balance the risk of life-threatening bleeding with the risk of thrombosis, which may be increased based on the underlying condition for which anticoagulation was prescribed and/or prothrombotic effects of some therapies (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="117811" href="/z/d/drug information/117811.html" rel="external">
          andexanet alfa
         </a>
         , PCCs). This balance depends on the assessment of bleeding severity (eg, life-threatening versus major versus clinically significant but non-major) and such assessments are inherently subjective requiring clinical expertise and close examination of the patient by the treating clinician; input from other specialists (eg, neurologist, gastroenterologist, hematologist) may be especially helpful. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Bleeding severity'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In most cases of major (life-threatening or uncontrolled) DOAC-associated bleeding, we suggest the use of a pro-hemostatic agent (eg, PCC or a specific antidote [if available]), an antifibrinolytic agent (for all anticoagulants), and/or

          PCC or antidote
         </strong>
         – We reserve PCCs and specific antidotes for the most serious/life-threatening cases of DOAC-associated bleeding when there is high confidence that the anticoagulant effect is present (based on knowing when the last dose was taken) and a specific antidote is not available or ineffective, such as ongoing bleeding that is likely to lead to death or permanent disability if not stopped immediately  (

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         PCCs and some antidotes may have the potential to cause thrombosis at doses used to treat bleeding, and their impact on patient-important outcomes is not well established. Available data consist largely of non-bleeding volunteers, case reports, and preclinical models [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12-21
         </a>
         ]. Thus, we avoid pro-hemostatic agents in patients with less severe bleeding. Importantly, use of these products should not be considered routine or "standard of care," and the clinician should be aware of the potential to precipitate thrombosis. (See

          Therapies we avoid
         </strong>
         – We generally avoid the use of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa), plasma, or cryoprecipitate in DOAC-associated bleeding because there are no data to support the use of these products, and there are associated risks (eg, thrombosis, volume overload, transfusion reactions). An exception is the use of plasma, PCC, cryoprecipitate, or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9082" href="/z/d/drug information/9082.html" rel="external">
          fibrinogen concentrate
         </a>
         to correct a coexisting coagulopathy (eg, from trauma or other settings with decreased levels of clotting factors and/or fibrinogen due to consumption or dilution). (See

         Abnormal coagulation testing is consistent with continued DOAC effect, but normal testing does not necessarily eliminate the possibility of clinically important concentrations of these agents. Therefore, with the exception of the thrombin time (TT) in patients with suspected dabigatran-associated bleeding, the results of coagulation tests, or their trends over time, do not meaningfully inform reversal of DOAC-associated bleeding. Management is based on the patient's presentation, the timing of the last DOAC dose (if known with certainty) and change in their status over time rather than on the results of coagulation testing in most cases.

         Unactivated prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) and activated PCCs (aPCCs) both contain clotting factors purified from human plasma. They differ in their composition (eg, 3-factor PCCs contain factors II, IX, and X; 4-factor PCCs contain factors II, IX, X, and VII) and in whether the coagulation factors are in their inactive/zymogen form or whether a fraction of the clotting factors have been activated by proteolytic cleavage to the active enzyme (PCCs contain unactivated factors; aPCCs contain factor VIIa [factor VII in the activated form]). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7925.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Several mechanisms may contribute to the potential efficacy of these products; none have been definitively demonstrated to work by these mechanisms in the setting of DOAC-associated bleeding. Clotting factors circulate in an unactivated form and become activated at the site of vascular injury. Thus, administration of the unactivated products might be effective primarily by "overwhelming" the anticoagulant rather than by promoting hemostasis; however, this argument is hard to rationalize given that DOACs do not bind to zymogen (unactivated) clotting factors. At the site of bleeding, there is vascular injury and local thrombin generation; thus, the unactivated PCCs will become activated and enhance the local pro-hemostatic effect. By contrast, the activated products may promote hemostasis directly by providing much higher levels of activated factors than normal at sites of bleeding, which could theoretically overwhelm the local inhibitory effect of the DOAC.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thrombosis is a potential risk with any pro-hemostatic agent. We generally regard aPCC as having a higher likelihood of precipitating a thrombotic event than unactivated PCC. However, there is little or no high-quality evidence that can be used to estimate the risk of thrombosis after the use of different PCC products, and it is not possible to quantify the degree to which an aPCC increases thrombosis risk (or promotes hemostasis) compared with an unactivated PCC.
        </p>
        <p>
         As with andexanet, the evidence that PCCs will improve the outcome of a patient with DOAC-associated bleeding is weak and the risk of thrombosis is challenging to quantify. Thus, we would use one of these products only in life-threatening circumstances. For factor Xa-inhibitor reversal using a PCC, we have a weak preference for an unactivated PCC rather than an activated PCC because, in our opinion, it is less likely to cause harm (eg, it is less likely to cause a thrombosis). For dabigatran-associated bleeding, if we use a PCC, we have a weak preference for using an aPCC based on a theoretical role in bypassing thrombin and very limited clinical data, as discussed below.

This systematic review found that the proportion of patients with overall successful bleeding management with PCC was 0.69 or 0.77, depending on the criteria used. The mortality rate was 0.16 and the rate of thrombosis was 0.04. The authors concluded that it was difficult to determine whether addition of PCC to anticoagulant discontinuation improved outcomes relative to anticoagulant discontinuation alone. These observations support a treatment plan where, if PCCs are administered, they are only administered to patients with life-threatening bleeding or bleeding likely to be associated with significant long-term morbidity.

         The optimal dosing for PCCs is uncertain. Fixed dose and weight-based dosing have not been compared in a randomized trial.

Observational studies have shown fixed dosing to be effective [

Some reports have used doses as low as 25 units/kg. Units refer to international units of factor IX activity. The use of fixed dose versus weight-based dose is individualized based on hospital protocols and the clinical scenario.

         Unactivated PCCs and aPCCs are potentially prothrombotic, and clinical judgment is required in determining the individual bleeding and thrombotic risks of each patient on a case-by-case basis. The US FDA-approved product information for the use of unactivated PCCs to reverse

This dose cap is reasonable for warfarin because the prothrombin time and international normalized ratio (PT and INR) can be measured following administration, and additional doses can be administered if repeat INR testing suggests that the warfarin effect has been incompletely reversed.
        </p>
        <p>
         By contrast, the use of unactivated PCCs to treat factor Xa inhibitor-associated bleeding is off-label, and there is no measure such as the PT/INR that can be used to determine the need for further doses and no high-quality data to inform risk-benefit calculations for different doses. The product information notwithstanding, we are not aware of any clinical evidence or strong biologic rationale that would support a dose cap for PCC.

         Minor bleeding (eg, epistaxis, bruising, slow gastrointestinal bleeding) can usually be managed conservatively using local hemostatic measures (eg, mechanical pressure). Decisions to temporarily discontinue the anticoagulant must balance bleeding and thrombotic risks for each patient on a case-by-case basis  (

        <p>
         The use of antifibrinolytic agents may occasionally be appropriate in individuals with less serious bleeding if the patient has ongoing bleeding or other comorbidities that increase bleeding risk; however, these agents generally are not required for minor bleeding. We do not administer prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) for minor bleeding.

         Given the short half-lives of the DOACs, it is often possible to delay a procedure long enough to allow most or all of the anticoagulant effect to dissipate spontaneously in patients with normal renal or hepatic function (depending on the specific drug and its means of elimination). However, if urgent or emergent surgery is required and there is insufficient time to allow the anticoagulant effect to dissipate, reversal strategies discussed herein may be appropriate. Decisions regarding the need for reversal are individualized based on the urgency and bleeding risk of the procedure. (See

         In all patients, a plan to decide about restarting the anticoagulant should be put in place; resumption should be delayed until the risk of rebleeding is minimized and may be permanently deferred in selected patients with a very high risk of recurrent bleeding.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most patients can have their anticoagulants restarted [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]. Several studies have suggested that failure to restart the anticoagulant is associated with increased risks of thrombosis and death [

          59-61
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         As an example, a large database study from 2021 involving nearly 7000 adults &gt;65 years of age who had a bleed while receiving an anticoagulant found that, compared with not resuming the anticoagulant, resuming the anticoagulant was associated with [

         Approximately 80 percent of patients were receiving anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation; approximately one-half were receiving a DOAC and one-half

         ; and the most common sites of bleeding were gastrointestinal and intracranial bleeding [
         <a href="#rid62">
          62
         </a>
         ]. Approximately 70 percent of patients resumed their anticoagulant, with a median time to resuming the anticoagulant of 46 days (interquartile range, 6 to 550 days). Individuals with a previous bleed (prior to the index bleed that led them to be enrolled into this study) were excluded.
        </p>
        <p>
         The finding that restarting anticoagulation is associated with reduced thrombosis, reduced death, and increased recurrent bleeding has been known for some time and supports our practice of restarting anticoagulation after recovering from a bleeding episode, except in individuals with an ongoing risk for major or life-threatening recurrent hemorrhage or those who no longer require anticoagulation [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         We are less likely to restart the anticoagulant in an individual with a low risk of first or recurrent thromboembolism or whose underlying lesion strongly predisposes to recurrent bleeding, such as a patient with an intracerebral bleed and "congophilic angiopathy" on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Each decision regarding resumption of anticoagulation following a bleed is individualized based on the risks and benefits for the specific patient as well as the patient's values and preferences  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111237" href="/z/d/graphic/111237.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The choice of anticoagulant also depends on a number of patient and bleed-related features, as discussed separately. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         If anticoagulants are to be restarted, this can generally be done sooner than was identified in the study mentioned above [
         <a href="#rid62">
          62
         </a>
         ]. The optimal time for restarting anticoagulation after a gastrointestinal bleed appears to be 7 to 14 days, although details depend on the cause and site of bleeding and the risks of rebleeding and thrombosis. Additional information related to the site of bleeding or the underlying indication for anticoagulation are presented in topic reviews that address these considerations:

          Evaluation
         </strong>
         – We assess the severity of bleeding and the degree of anticoagulation through the patient history and physical examination. The degree of anticoagulation depends on the dose and the interval since the last dose; in some cases coagulation testing may be helpful in determining residual anticoagulant effect, but normal coagulation testing does not necessarily eliminate the need for aggressive interventions. Other limited laboratory testing includes a complete blood count (CBC) and tests of renal and hepatic function. (See

         – In most cases of DOAC-associated bleeding, including major bleeding, we discontinue the drug; transfuse blood products if necessary; address the hemorrhage anatomically (eg, surgery, endoscopy, local measures); and administer pro-hemostatic therapies such as antifibrinolytic agents  (
