The ultimate goal of therapeutic approaches to food allergy is to induce permanent tolerance to the food, where allergic reactions will not recur upon reexposure after a period of abstinence. However, none of the available treatments or those under investigation appear to achieve permanent tolerance in a substantial number of treated patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2406.html" rel="external">"Management of food allergy: Avoidance"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2401.html" rel="external">"Food-induced anaphylaxis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/392.html" rel="external">"Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment"</a>.)</p><p>Oral immunotherapy (OIT), an allergen-specific approach to the treatment of food allergy, is reviewed in this topic [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Experimental food allergen-specific therapies, as well as nonspecific therapies for food allergy, are reviewed separately  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80640" href="/d/graphic/80640.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2410.html" rel="external">"Experimental therapies for food allergy: Immunotherapy and nonspecific therapies"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3867382441"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>OIT to food is a major focus of investigation in the treatment of food allergy. However, studies have yet to demonstrate the ability to cure food allergy (and induce true tolerance). Furthermore, allergic reactions to OIT are common and occur at higher rates in patients on OIT than those avoiding the food. Many unanswered questions remain, and additional long-term follow-up data are needed to help determine in which patients the benefits may outweigh the risks.</p><p>The 2014 Updated Food Allergy Practice Parameter advised against performing OIT in routine clinical practice [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The 2017 European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EEACI) Task Force on Allergen Immunotherapy and the 2016 guidelines from the Japanese Society of Pediatric Allergy and Clinical Immunology recommended conducting OIT in medical facilities with expertise in allergen immunotherapy and management of anaphylactic shock [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. The Japanese guidelines additionally stated that OIT should not be recommended as standard treatment. The Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (CSACI) proposed comprehensive guidelines for clinical implementation of OIT in 2020 [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved of the first biologic drug for peanut OIT in children 4 to 17 years old in January 2020, with the indication of "the mitigation of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis that may occur with accidental exposure to peanut." Revised guidelines regarding the use of OIT are anticipated.</p><p>Despite these limitations and remaining concerns, OIT is increasingly adapted in clinical practice. Many real-world studies reported favorable results of OIT safety and efficacy for desensitization to various foods using commercial food products. This is driven by the clinical need to provide therapies to patients with multiple food allergies for whom no US FDA-approved drugs are available or those who are outside the age indication for the approved peanut commercial product. In addition, a significant subset of patients may be "high-threshold reactors" who might not need to undergo desensitization over multiple visits since they are already above the maintenance dose of the approved product and would benefit from an alternative approach.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2700883942"><span class="h2">Rationale and mechanisms of action</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The rationale for using the oral route to treat food allergy is that ingestion of a food antigen by someone not allergic to that food preferentially results in an active immune system response that does not trigger an allergic reaction towards that antigen (ie, oral tolerance) [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. Oral tolerance is thought to be mediated by induction of regulatory T cells with low-dose antigen exposure or lymphocyte anergy or deletion with high antigen doses  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef117287" href="/d/graphic/117287.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2408.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of food allergy", section on 'Factors influencing sensitization or tolerance'</a>.)</p><p>The humoral immunologic changes associated with OIT include a gradual increase in serum levels of specific immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin A2 (IgA2) [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. In addition, an initial increase in serum levels of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies is seen in the first 12 months, followed by a subsequent decrease. Specific T regulatory cells increase and peak at approximately 12 months, with a subsequent decrease. Increased antigen-induced regulatory T cell function is associated with hypomethylation of forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>Basophil reactivity, skin prick test responses, and serum levels of T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines decrease gradually, whereas interferon (IFN) gamma, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) 1 alpha, and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP) 1 increase over the course of OIT [<a href="#rid11">11-14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1838577622"><span class="h2">Goals</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ultimate goal of treatment for food allergy is to induce permanent tolerance to the food, such that there can be periods of abstinence that do not lead to a recurrence of clinical reactivity upon reintroduction of the food  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117286" href="/d/graphic/117286.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1,7</a>]. However, because achieving permanent tolerance to the food with OIT has proved elusive in most studies of food allergy treatments, the goal of most available treatments is to increase the amount of food persons with food allergies are able to consume before they experience symptoms. Increasing the allergic threshold may prevent reactions that occur due to accidental exposures to that particular food. Additionally, burdensome lifestyle changes as well as anxiety about the possibility of anaphylaxis and death are some of the main causes of morbidity in food allergy. Important goals for patients and their caregiver(s) are to reduce this anxiety and improve quality of life (QOL) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2411.html" rel="external">"Food allergy: Impact on health-related quality of life"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/116872.html" rel="external">"Management of food allergy-related anxiety in children and their parents/caregivers"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H353544423"><span class="h2">Tolerance versus desensitization</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Oral tolerance is a permanent state of antigen nonresponsiveness, even when exposure is infrequent  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117286" href="/d/graphic/117286.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). However, it is unclear what time period of food allergen elimination followed by subsequent safe reexposure defines permanent tolerance to that food. Thus the surrogate for permanent tolerance used by many clinical trials is "sustained unresponsiveness" (SU) to the food after an interval of sustained treatment followed by removal of the food from the diet over a defined period of time, typically weeks to months. Desensitization, in contrast, is defined as an increase in reaction threshold to a food allergen while receiving active therapy, similar to that achieved with drug desensitization. The primary outcomes typically measured in OIT studies are desensitization and sometimes SU. Desensitization to an arbitrarily chosen dose of food, ranging from a small portion (eg, 300 mg) to a regular serving size of the food, is tested with an oral food challenge (OFC) while continuing maintenance dosing. SU is tested with an OFC to the food following discontinuation of OIT for a period of time, varying from 2 to 52 weeks (usually 4 to 16 weeks).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3777584189"><span class="h2">General protocol</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients are typically started on a very small daily dose of the food (eg, 3 to 6 mg of food protein) and advanced periodically (usually every two weeks) to a maintenance dose (eg, 300 mg or, depending on the food and goals, 1 to 2 g of food protein daily) over several months. The initial dose and each dose increase are given under clinical supervision (usually with a 60-minute observation period following the dose administration), whereas the remainder of the daily doses during the dose advancement phase and maintenance therapy are administered at home. OIT doses are typically administered at the same time of the day (evening is preferred for home administration), following a meal or large snack. The food included in OIT is almost always otherwise strictly avoided in the diet for the duration of OIT. Each patient treated with OIT is also prescribed an <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a> autoinjector, instructed in its use, and given a detailed emergency anaphylaxis treatment plan.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1973638325"><span class="h2">Minimizing risk of systemic reactions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A number of general and specific measures are recommended to minimize the risk of systemic reactions related to OIT dosing. Cofactors that increase the risk of an allergic reaction include exercise or hot water exposure (hypermetabolic state with elevation of body temperature), intercurrent illness (eg, viral infection), fasting or dosing on an empty stomach, menstruation, sleep deprivation, and use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [<a href="#rid16">16-19</a>]. Timing of dosing is adjusted to avoid these cofactors. Hot showers or baths, for example, should be avoided immediately prior to or within three hours of taking the dose, and physical activity should be restricted for one to two hours after dosing.</p><p>If avoidance of any of these cofactors is not possible, the dose is temporarily withheld, as in the case of active illness, or decreased. However, reactions may occur during a prodromal phase of an infection before any symptoms of an illness become apparent. Dosing is also adjusted, or the treatment discontinued, in patients with chronic or recurrent allergic gastrointestinal symptoms or anaphylaxis. Additional indications for discontinuation of therapy include inability to tolerate less than a 3 mg dose, nonadherence with daily dosing, suspected eosinophilic esophagitis, recurrent asthma exacerbations, or persistent loss of asthma control.</p><p>When dosing is temporarily withheld or one or more doses are missed, dosing is either resumed at the same dose at home or under supervision in the office, or the dose is reduced and gradually escalated to pre-illness level, depending upon the number of missed doses.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3641357582"><span class="h2">Efficacy and adverse effects</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>None of the available evidence shows that OIT can induce permanent tolerance, and, for most allergens, only a minority of children treated with OIT appear to achieve SU  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117286" href="/d/graphic/117286.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). In addition, most studies have shown no difference in improved health-related quality of life (HRQL) or only improvement in parental, but not child, HRQL.</p><p>Approximately 40 to 75 percent patients treated with OIT pass a supervised challenge to a larger amount of the food allergen while on maintenance therapy than at baseline and are considered at least partially "desensitized." Desensitization in this setting is defined as a state of temporary food allergen hyporesponsiveness with an increased threshold for reactions compared with the pre-OIT threshold. The cut-off for an increased threshold (eg, percentage or amount tolerated compared with baseline) that defines hyporesponsiveness is not standardized and varies from study to study.</p><p>Theoretically, this desensitization should protect against reactions to accidental ingestion of similar or lower amounts of the food that were tolerated in the supervised challenge. However, despite the ability of OIT to induce desensitization, significant acute allergic reactions to the therapy and/or accidental exposures are still common in treated patients and can occur even on maintenance dosing. Higher rates of anaphylaxis and use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a> are consistently seen in the treatment groups compared with avoidance alone [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. In addition, rates of other types of allergic reactions (eg, gastrointestinal symptoms, angioedema, wheezing, and eosinophilic esophagitis) are common and are typically higher in patients treated with OIT.</p><p>It is possible that OIT does provide some protection against reactions due to accidental ingestion, but the effect may be negated by reactions to daily OIT dosing due to a lowered reaction threshold (eg, illness, exercise) or reactions to larger accidental exposures if avoidance is not as careful due to the perceived protective effect of OIT. In addition, limited long-term follow-up data suggest that desensitization may not be maintained in a number of patients, even with daily exposure.</p><p>Most of the above data are from peanut OIT trials, with fewer data for other allergens. OIT outcomes for individual foods are discussed in greater detail below. (See <a class="local">'Single-food OIT'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1503083217"><span class="h1">SINGLE-FOOD OIT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Multiple OIT protocols have been reported for peanut, cow's milk, and hen's egg, with more limited studies for wheat [<a href="#rid21">21-26</a>] and sesame [<a href="#rid27">27</a>] and only case reports for other foods such as fish [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>], apple [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>], orange [<a href="#rid28">28</a>], and celery [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. The most extensively studied foods are reviewed here.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1926997741"><span class="h2">Peanut</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the available clinical trials, peanut OIT consistently increased the rate of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis requiring treatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a>. This occurred despite OIT increasing supervised food challenge thresholds (ie, inducing at least partial desensitization to peanut) in a clinical setting, a surrogate measure of preventing reactions to accidental exposures in a real-world setting. Many patients are unlikely to be good candidates for peanut OIT, either because they already have a threshold that is high enough to make accidental ingestion reactions unlikely [<a href="#rid31">31</a>] or because the adverse effect profile and daily commitments required for therapy outweigh any potential benefit of increasing the reaction threshold. (See <a class="local">'Efficacy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Adverse events'</a> below.)</p><p>Despite the increased risk of anaphylaxis and other adverse effects, some patients may be highly motivated to try OIT in the hope that it may alleviate some of the anxiety and fear of experiencing a severe allergic reaction in the event of accidental peanut ingestion. For such patients, it is important to provide accurate information on the anticipated effects of OIT, the logistics, time commitment, lifestyle restrictions, and potential for side effects, including anaphylaxis and gastrointestinal symptoms.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H364489268"><span class="h3">Efficacy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several randomized trials [<a href="#rid32">32-38</a>] and a number of uncontrolled studies [<a href="#rid10">10,39-44</a>] have demonstrated that peanut OIT is highly effective in inducing desensitization in a clinical setting, but it increases, rather than decreases, the rate of allergic reactions in the real-world setting (see <a class="local">'Adverse events'</a> below). Short-term sustained unresponsiveness (SU) after discontinuing OIT is much less common than desensitization. Data suggest that the development of SU is dose and duration dependent and may also be influenced by the severity of peanut allergy and how early in life OIT is started [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Longer-term SU is even rarer, and data suggest that ongoing exposure is necessary to maintain the protective effect [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. The available evidence also suggests that peanut OIT does not improve quality of life (QoL) for the patient. In addition, there are considerable burdens and costs associated with peanut OIT.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Desensitization, sustained unresponsiveness, and quality of life</strong> – In a meta-analysis of 12 trials (1041 patients), peanut OIT increased the likelihood of passing an in-clinic food challenge compared with an elimination diet alone (40 versus 3 percent; relative risk [RR] 12.4, 95% CI 6.8-22.6) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. However, OIT increased the risk of anaphylaxis during the maintenance phase (22 versus 7 percent; RR 3.1, 95% CI 1.8-5.6), increased need for <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a> (8.2 versus 3.7 percent; RR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3-3.8), increased the frequency of vomiting and other gastrointestinal symptoms (33 versus 19 percent; RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4-2.4), and increased other adverse events (see <a class="local">'Adverse events'</a> below). In the four trials that assessed QoL, parent/caregiver- and patient-reported QoL scores were similar in both groups. The trials included in the meta-analysis varied with respect to the OIT formulation and dosing protocol used. However, in subgroup analysis, the findings were consistent irrespective of OIT protocol and whether or not a proprietary formulation or readily available peanut flour was used.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>US FDA-approved form of peanut OIT</strong> – A specific preparation of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="127037" href="/d/drug information/127037.html" rel="external">peanut allergen oral immunotherapy powder</a> containing consistent quantities of the major peanut (<em>Arachis hypogaea</em>, Ara h) proteins (Ara h 1, Ara h 2, and Ara h 6) was approved in 2020 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients 4 to 17 years of age with a confirmed peanut allergy (patients who start therapy at ≤17 years of age may continue therapy as an adult) [<a href="#rid46">46,47</a>]. US FDA approval was based upon the largest trial of this therapy, which included 499 children aged 4 to 17 years and 56 adults aged 18 to 55 years [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. This trial was included in the above meta-analysis. Patients were considered to have passed the exit peanut challenge even if they had mild symptoms. Of the children randomly assigned to active treatment (ie, 300 mg/day of peanut protein), 77 percent tolerated the 300 mg dose, and 67 percent were able to ingest ≥600 mg of peanut protein (equivalent to approximately two peanut kernels) with no more than mild symptoms at the exit peanut challenge compared with 4 percent in the placebo group. Nearly all patients reported adverse events during the study. Moderate-to-severe exit challenge-associated symptoms were lower in the treatment group compared with placebo. However, the rate of serious or severe adverse events during the study was higher in the active treatment group compared with placebo (6 versus 2 percent, respectively), as was the rate of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a> administration (14 versus 6 percent, respectively). In addition, considerably more patients in the OIT group withdrew from the trial due to adverse events compared with the placebo group (16 versus 2 percent). One patient in the treatment group was diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis. Changes in QoL were not examined.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Efficacy in younger children</strong> – Limited randomized trial and observational data suggest that OIT may be better tolerated and perhaps more effective in young children than it is in older children. As part of a larger trial, 146 children &lt;4 years of age (median age 39.3 months) were randomly assigned to peanut OIT (n = 96; minimum daily maintenance dose target 250 mg, maximum 2000 mg) or placebo (n = 50) [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. After 104 weeks on maintenance therapy, 68 of 96 (70.8 percent) and 1 of 50 (2 percent) in the peanut OIT and placebo groups, respectively, passed the 5000 mg peanut double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) at week 134 and were considered desensitized (risk difference [RD] 69 percent, 95% CI 59-79 percent). The mean peanut dose tolerated in the DBPCFC was 5005 mg in the peanut OIT group and 5 mg in the placebo group.

The median peanut dose tolerated in the DBPCFC was 755 mg in the peanut OIT group and 0 mg in the placebo group. In a prospective study of 40 young children (ages 9 to 36 months) treated with either high- or low-dose peanut OIT (ie, 300 mg or 3000 mg peanut protein), both groups demonstrated high rates of short-term SU (78 percent overall) after four weeks of avoidance following the maintenance dosing phase [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].

It has demonstrated good efficacy and safety for the treatment of allergic disorders that are frequently comorbid with food allergy, including atopic dermatitis, persistent asthma, eosinophilic esophagitis, and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis [<a href="#rid75">75</a>]. Dupilumab is also a potential therapeutic agent for food allergy. An ongoing large, multicenter clinical trial (<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT03682770&amp;token=Rti1NBSWdX%2F%2FH%2FlCKGrzlGu03gYcMJXuTK3xOgZRWSwePAQIO3DJ8IYYE%2FZ3z7e%2F5RRk83A%2B%2Bh0ImeJ0k1C8yA%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=113421" target="_blank">NCT03682770</a>) is evaluating efficacy and safety of dupilumab as an adjunct to peanut OIT in children.

Longer duration of therapy may be a means to induce SU, as described above (see <a class="local">'Efficacy and adverse effects'</a> above and <a class="local">'Single-food OIT'</a> above), but adding an immunostimulatory adjuvant, such as a probiotic or unmethylated CpG motifs, are other options under investigation.</p><p>The efficacy and safety of OIT using CpG-coated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles containing peanut extract (CpG/PN-NPs) was evaluated in a murine model of peanut allergy [<a href="#rid76">76</a>]. Peanut-allergic mice treated with CpG/PN-NPs, but not vehicle or other treatment components, were significantly protected from anaphylaxis to all five oral peanut challenges. CpG/PN-NP treatment did not cause anaphylactic reactions. These preclinical findings suggest that peanut OIT with CpG/PN-NPs is worth investigating in human subjects.</p><p>OIT in combination with a probiotic is also under investigation. In one randomized trial of 62 children (mean age six years) with peanut allergy randomly assigned to probiotic <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9541" href="/d/drug information/9541.html" rel="external">Lactobacillus</a> rhamnosus CGMCC 1.3724 and peanut OIT (probiotic and peanut oral immunotherapy [PPOIT]) or placebo, higher rates of desensitization and SU after two weeks of avoidance were achieved in patients receiving PPOIT (90 and 82 percent, respectively) than placebo (7 and 4 percent, respectively) [<a href="#rid77">77</a>]. However, in a follow-up study four years after cessation of treatment, 23 percent achieved SU after eight weeks of avoidance if all enrolled in the initial trial treatment group are included in the analysis, a rate similar to that seen in previously reported studies of OIT without probiotic adjuvant [<a href="#rid78">78</a>]. In addition, there was no difference in the numbers of serious reactions between the two groups during this follow-up period. Furthermore, there were several other significant flaws in study design that limit the conclusions that can be drawn from these results [<a href="#rid79">79</a>]. In another study of PPOIT in children ages 1 to 10 years assigned at a 2:2:1 ratio to PPOIT (with <em>Lactobacillus rhamnosus </em>ATCC 53103), peanut OIT with placebo probiotic, or placebo OIT-placebo probiotic, respectively, no difference in SU was seen between PPOIT and peanut OIT (46 and 51 percent, respectively) [<a href="#rid80">80</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2331940233"><span class="h2">OIT with modified allergens</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Approximately 60 to 80 percent of persons with milk or egg allergy can tolerate extensively heated or baked forms of these foods. In addition, including extensively heated milk or egg in the diet may accelerate the development of tolerance. Humoral and cellular immunologic changes seen in children with a history of milk and/or egg allergy who passed OFCs to milk and/or egg in baked goods parallel the changes reported in OIT trials [<a href="#rid81">81-84</a>]. This approach, allowing ingestion of extensively heated forms if tolerated, might be conceived as similar to OIT in that the exposure may have an immunotherapeutic effect that could lead to higher thresholds of the foods in forms that are not extensively heated. However, for the 20 to 40 percent who are unable to ingest the baked forms, there are insufficient studies addressing the use of extensively heated milk/egg for escalating doses in desensitization regimens. OIT with extensively heated milk or egg is under investigation, so far with limited success. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2390.html" rel="external">"Egg allergy: Management", section on 'Extensively heated (baked) HE'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2391.html" rel="external">"Milk allergy: Management", section on 'Extensively heated (baked) cow's milk'</a>.)</p><p>As an example, OIT with baked milk was attempted in 14 patients who failed native milk OIT [<a href="#rid85">85</a>]. Only three patients (21 percent) achieved the full daily dose of baked milk (1.3 g baked milk protein) after 12 months of OIT, whereas eight patients developed frequent, immediate systemic reactions to baked milk OIT. The results of this study confirm prior observations from baked milk trials that patients with a more severe phenotype of milk allergy are likely to react to baked milk. In contrast, 8 of 15 children with IgE-mediated egg allergy (aged 6 to 17 years) in another study responded favorably to gradual home-based introduction of baked egg and tolerated an open OFC to one whole hard-boiled egg after 12 months [<a href="#rid86">86</a>]. These children had not previously failed standard egg OIT. In a small trial of OIT with low allergenic hydrolyzed egg (HydE) in young children, the pass rate on the final OFC to one boiled egg at six months was not significantly different between HydE versus placebo (36 versus 21 percent, respectively) [<a href="#rid84">84</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3031057935"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

This would require induction of permanent tolerance to the food, where the allergy will not recur upon reexposure after any period of abstinence. However, achieving permanent tolerance to a food with oral immunotherapy (OIT) has proved elusive in most studies of food allergy treatments. Thus, the goal of most available treatments is to increase the amount of food persons with food allergies are able to consume before they experience symptoms (increased allergic threshold). Additional goals for patients/caregivers may include reduction in anxiety and improve quality of life (QoL). (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above and <a class="local">'Goals'</a> above and <a class="local">'Tolerance versus desensitization'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2410.html" rel="external">"Experimental therapies for food allergy: Immunotherapy and nonspecific therapies"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2411.html" rel="external">"Food allergy: Impact on health-related quality of life"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/116872.html" rel="external">"Management of food allergy-related anxiety in children and their parents/caregivers"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management approaches</strong> – Management of food allergy consists of strict avoidance of the food allergen and treatment of accidental exposures with medications. OIT involves daily feeding of gradually increasing doses of the food allergen until a daily maintenance dose is reached. One of the appeals of this therapy is that much of the dosing can be done at home. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above and <a class="local">'General protocol'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2406.html" rel="external">"Management of food allergy: Avoidance"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/392.html" rel="external">"Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Efficacy</strong> – A majority of patients treated with OIT are at least partially desensitized (have an increased threshold for a reaction). However, this desensitization does not translate into overall decreased allergic reactions in the real-world setting, when reactions to the treatment product are included. In addition, only a minority of patients treated with OIT achieve sustained unresponsiveness (SU) that is independent of regular food intake and is maintained even if the food is eliminated from the diet for long periods of time. Thus, for most allergens, it appears that OIT would need to be continued indefinitely to maintain a protective effect. (See <a class="local">'Efficacy and adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Adverse effects</strong> – Allergic reactions to OIT are common, particularly during the build-up phase of dosing, and occur at higher rates overall in patients on OIT than those avoiding the food. Thus, appropriate safety precautions are critical if OIT is undertaken. Oral and gastrointestinal symptoms are the most common, followed by lower respiratory symptoms (eg, wheeze). Anaphylaxis is uncommon but occurs more frequently in patients on OIT than in patients who avoid the food. Systemic reactions may occur at previously tolerated doses, particularly in the setting of exercise or viral illness. Some patients have been diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis after undergoing OIT. (See <a class="local">'Efficacy and adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Single- versus multi-food OIT or combination therapy</strong> – Most studies of OIT have involved treatment with only a single food. However, many children have multiple food allergies. Thus, researchers are beginning to explore OIT with multiple food allergens. Additional approaches include OIT with modified food allergens and OIT combined with immunomodulatory biologic agents such as anti-immunoglobulin E (anti-IgE) or immunostimulatory adjuvant, such as a probiotic or unmethylated CpG motifs. (See <a class="local">'Single-food OIT'</a> above and <a class="local">'Other OIT protocols'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Peanut OIT</strong> – For most patients with peanut allergy, we suggest <strong>not</strong> using peanut OIT as the routine approach to management (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). While peanut OIT is effective at increasing supervised in-clinic food challenge thresholds (ie, desensitization), it increases the risk of anaphylaxis, other allergic reactions, and need for <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a>. In addition, there are considerable burdens and costs associated with peanut OIT, including clinic visits for supervised dose escalations, an indefinite period of treatment, the continued need to avoid peanut in the diet, costs of the standardized peanut OIT powder, dosing restrictions (eg, timing, type of food it can be ingested with), and the need to avoid potential triggers of an allergic reaction (eg, hot showers). Many patients are unlikely to be good candidates for peanut OIT, either because they already have a threshold that is high enough to make accidental ingestion reactions unlikely or because the adverse effect profile and daily commitments required for therapy outweigh any potential benefit of increasing the reaction threshold. Accumulating evidence suggests that peanut OIT in infants and toddlers may have better efficacy and safety outcomes and improved adherence compared with older children.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Despite the increased risk of anaphylaxis and other adverse effects, some patients may be motivated to try OIT, rather than continue avoidance alone, in the hope that it may increase the reaction threshold to add a measure of safety in the event of an accidental exposure and to alleviate some of the anxiety and fear of experiencing a severe allergic reaction in the event of accidental peanut ingestion. For such patients, it is important to provide accurate information on the anticipated effects of OIT, particularly that it increases rather than decreases risk of anaphylaxis and that, based upon the available data, it does not appear to improve QoL. If OIT is undertaken, appropriate safety precautions are critical. (See <a class="local">'Peanut'</a> above and <a class="local">'General protocol'</a> above and <a class="local">'Minimizing risk of systemic reactions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other single-food OIT</strong> – For patients with other food allergies (eg, cow's milk, hen's egg, wheat, sesame), we suggest <strong>not</strong> using OIT routinely (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). The limited clinical trial data on other single-food OIT (eg, milk, egg, wheat, sesame) suggest these therapies may achieve desensitization, but they have not been shown to reduce the risk of anaphylaxis and, in fact, may increase the risk. In addition, there are no approved preparations of these allergens and no standardized desensitization protocols.
