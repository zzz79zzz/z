As awareness of human trafficking has evolved, victims have been identified and assisted in leaving exploitative situations within a variety of industries including agriculture, manufacturing, hospitality, health care, domestic service, and commercial sex work. The illegal nature of human trafficking makes it particularly difficult to identify and therefore aid victims. Health care providers have a unique opportunity to assist trafficked persons, as medical visits may be one of the few times they are in contact with individuals in a position to help.</p><p>This topic will review the identification, evaluation, and management of persons suspected of being trafficked. Topics specific to sexual abuse and intimate partner violence are presented separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6605.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6607.html" rel="external">"Management and sequelae of sexual abuse in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15294.html" rel="external">"Intimate partner violence: Diagnosis and screening"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15306.html" rel="external">"Intimate partner violence: Intervention and patient management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In this topic, when discussing study results, we will use the terms "woman/en" or "patient(s)" as they are used in the studies presented. We encourage the reader to consider the specific counseling and treatment needs of transgender and gender-expansive individuals.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1674223225"><span class="h1">DEFINITION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In 2000, the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (the Palermo Convention) defined human trafficking as "the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude, or the removal of organs" [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The crime of human trafficking can be divided into three components, "the act, the means, and the purpose" [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], though evidence of malevolent means may not be required in some countries to satisfy the legal definition of human trafficking when children under the age of 18 are concerned.</p><p>Human trafficking does not require the movement of persons [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]; many victims are trafficked in their own homes, communities, or in cities within their countries of origin [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Additionally, human trafficking is different from migrant smuggling. While smuggling can evolve into the crime of human trafficking during transit or on arrival at the destination, migrant smuggling is a crime whereby persons gain illegal entry into a country with the assistance of individuals (smugglers) they contracted to help them navigate the journey [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2772033276"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Reliable figures on the incidence and prevalence of human trafficking are difficult to obtain because of the illegal, and therefore clandestine, nature of this problem; the range and severity of trafficking activities; and the variation in the definitions used [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Up from 40 million in 2016, the United Nations International Labor Organization (ILO) estimated that approximately 50 million individuals were living in modern slavery in 2021, with 28 million individuals trapped in forced labor and another 22 million in forced marriage [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. </p><p>The broad scope of the problem is further highlighted by the following statistics:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The ILO estimated that, of the 27.6 million persons trapped in forced labor, 17.3 million (63 percent) were enslaved in private sector industries, 3.9 million (14 percent) in state-imposed forced labor, and 6.3 million (23 percent) in forced commercial sexual exploitation. Women and girls account for 10.9 million (43 percent) of those in forced labor. Children comprise more than 3.3 million (12 percent), with over half of these children exploited for forced commercial sex [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Of the 22 million people in forced marriage in 2021, 75 percent of forced marriages occurred in low- and low- to middle-income countries. While men and boys comprise 32 percent of those forced into marriage, 14.9 million (68 percent) are women and girls. Of the 22 million trapped in forced marriage, approximately 9 million (41 percent) were children under the age of 18 years at the time of marriage [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In 2016, the United States Department of Labor identified 139 goods from 75 countries produced by "child labor or forced labor" [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In 2022, the United States National Center for Missing and Exploited Children estimated that one in six children reported missing to the center were likely forced into sex trafficking [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In 2015, the United States National Human Trafficking Resource Center published that human trafficking had been reported in all 50 states and the District of Columbia [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H191035201"><span class="h1">RISK FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Risk factors are elements that drive or entice the individual toward trafficking [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Risk factors can be identified at all four levels of the socioecological model: the individual, the individual's relationships, the community, and society at large. Of note, poverty increases the risk of trafficking at all four levels. Additional risk factors for being trafficked include young age (12- to 16-year-old girls are at greatest risk), increased psychiatric complexity, racial/ethnic minority status, rural location, lack of education, disability, inadequate family support and protection, and migration, including labor migration and migration due to mass displacements as a result of political unrest, armed conflict, and natural disasters [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. Marginalized individuals are also at increased risk and include lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning persons; runaway or "throwaway" youth; migrant workers; and indigenous people [<a href="#rid8">8,17</a>]. Multiple studies suggest that a history of childhood abuse is a risk factor for later sexual exploitation. In a survey study of nearly 200 female survivors of sex trafficking, approximately 60 percent reported physical and/or sexual abuse prior to being trafficked [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p>However, while there are risk factors for trafficking, trafficking is not limited to any one group of individuals. Victims can be of any age, gender, group, or status. In the United States, trafficked individuals come from all socioeconomic levels and include both citizens and noncitizens and documented and undocumented individuals [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>The National Human Trafficking Resource Center utilizes the AMP model (Action, Means, and Purpose) to outline the various mechanisms traffickers utilize to coerce and manipulate others [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1236516459"><span class="h1">HEALTH IMPACT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2577616849"><span class="h2">General</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For people who are trafficked, the experiences of recruitment, travel, detention and exploitation, and reintegration can negatively impact health and well-being and often have cumulative effects  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108417" href="/d/graphic/108417.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. At every stage, women, men, and children can encounter abuse (psychological, physical, and/or sexual abuse); mandatory or coerced use of substances; social constraints; emotional manipulation; and economic exploitation, inescapable debts, and legal challenges  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108419" href="/d/graphic/108419.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>]. The long-lasting mental and physical health consequences of trafficking can make engaging and retaining survivors in the health-care system a challenge, which further adds to their marginalization [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H950047202"><span class="h2">Mental</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As a result of trafficking, survivors carry a significant burden of mental health symptoms that can include depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders, suicidal ideation, and somatic conditions [<a href="#rid23">23-25</a>]. In addition, victims may be forced to use drugs and alcohol as a form of control, or victims may use these substances as a means of coping [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Once an addiction is established, the trafficker may use access to the drug as a means of reward, punishment, and even re-trafficking.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2497440059"><span class="h2">Sex trafficking</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The majority of available studies tend to focus on female survivors of sex trafficking. Representative findings from such studies include that the vast majority of women report physical and/or sexual abuse and subsequent physical and mental health issues [<a href="#rid18">18,26</a>]. Nearly half of survivors have reported attempted suicide [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection vary by global region and have been reported as high as between 30 and 60 percent [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>]. Reproductive health issues include multiple sexually transmitted infections, pregnancies, miscarriages, and pregnancy terminations (a portion of which are forced) [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p>The true extent of the health impact of sex trafficking cannot be fully appreciated, however, as these cases are likely underreported [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Additionally, while the focus has been on females, data indicate that males, boys, and persons of nonbinary genders are also trafficked for commercial sex, though the extent to which this occurs is unknown and likely underappreciated. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1096297302"><span class="h2">Labor trafficking</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Persons trafficked for nonsexual labor are vulnerable to industry-specific environmental and occupational risks and exposures that negatively impact health. Risks can include unsafe ventilation and sanitation, extended hours, repetitive-motion activities, limited or no training in use of heavy or high-risk equipment, hazards (chemical, electrical), lack of protective equipment, extremes of temperature, and infectious contaminants [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Subsequent health outcomes include exhaustion, dehydration, heat stroke or stress, hypothermia, frostbite, accidental injuries, repetitive-motion syndromes, respiratory problems and infection (eg, tuberculosis), and skin infections [<a href="#rid20">20,24,29,30</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2206971997"><span class="h2">Drug trafficking</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Trafficking of drugs and humans often overlaps. Drug trafficking, including body packing and body stuffing, are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/327.html" rel="external">"Internal concealment of drugs of abuse (body packing)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13845.html" rel="external">"Acute ingestion of illicit drugs (body stuffing)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2113775653"><span class="h1">IDENTIFICATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H129764772"><span class="h2">Barriers to disclosure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A major challenge for health care providers is the difficulty in identifying victims. Victims rarely self-identify because of multiple factors including fear of the trafficker, distrust of authorities, feelings of shame and hopelessness, trauma bonds (ie, Stockholm syndrome), and threats [<a href="#rid25">25,31,32</a>]. Threats used by traffickers can include acts of retribution against children or other family members, deportation, or criminal prosecution, in addition to psychological and physical harm. Further, some victims may not fully understand the nature of their situation and may not realize they are being trafficked because they receive housing, food, or clothing [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Similarly, when human trafficking is carried out under the guise of romance, trafficked persons may believe they are simply involved in a troubled romantic relationship and fail to recognize their exploitation.</p><p>In addition to being potentially dangerous, disclosure can also be emotionally difficult and is an act demonstrating significant courage [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. One interview study of 17 survivors of childhood trafficking reported that patients do want clinicians to ask about trafficking, clinicians should emphasize confidentiality and privacy, and that, when done with appropriate privacy, being asked about trafficking is not retraumatizing [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Some victims may make multiple visits to a health care setting before deciding if they can safely reveal their situation. Lastly, discussing trafficking may be easier for the individual when the provider is of the same sex, ethnicity, or age range.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1507166124"><span class="h2">Warning signs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Red flags, indicators, and warning signs that a patient may be a victim of trafficking are described in the tables  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108340" href="/d/graphic/108340.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108607" href="/d/graphic/108607.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Providers should proceed with a more comprehensive assessment for potential trafficking when red flags emerge in the presentation, history, or physical examination. Health care providers are uniquely poised to identify human trafficking victims because they often present to emergency departments, reproductive health units, and family planning clinics [<a href="#rid26">26,34</a>]. In a retrospective survey of 173 survivors of trafficking in the United States, 68 percent were seen by a health care provider while trafficked, with 56 percent seeing emergency or urgent care providers [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].</p><p>Specific warning signs can often include late presentation, discrepancy between the verbal history and clinical findings, and signs an individual is being controlled (eg, not being able to carry one's own identification or not being allowed to answer questions) [<a href="#rid2">2,36-40</a>].</p><p>Warning signs specific to sex trafficking victims of any age or gender include reports of multiple sexual partners and/or recurrent or untreated sexually transmitted infections [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In addition, sex trafficked women and girls often have multiple pregnancies, miscarriages, or pregnancy terminations. Cases of sex trafficking may often appear, on the surface, to be instances of intimate partner violence (IPV).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1850443139"><span class="h2">Approach to assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We take a stepwise approach to the evaluation and treatment of patients with warning signs of human trafficking  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108343" href="/d/graphic/108343.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). The goal of the clinical visit is not to obtain a disclosure or carry out a rescue but rather to provide medical care and create a climate that allows "every patient to feel safe, secure, cared for, validated, and empowered to disclose, if he or she so chooses" [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Before beginning any conversation with a patient, the clinician should assess the potential safety risks that may result from asking the patient sensitive questions and ensure privacy for the patient. Interactions with potential trafficked patients should be honest and nonjudgmental [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Transparency about the limits of confidentiality is recommended for mandated reporters to avoid fracturing the patient-provider relationship.</p><p>There is no consensus on the optimal content, length, or format of screening questions for identifying victims of human trafficking [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. Similar to interviewing victims of IPV, clinicians should not begin by asking outright if individuals have been beaten or retained against their will. Rather, the clinician should start with indirect questions that touch upon aspects of the patient's life, job, and general sense of safety. Suggested screening questions for adults and minors are listed in the tables  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108639" href="/d/graphic/108639.html" rel="external">table 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108342" href="/d/graphic/108342.html" rel="external">table 5</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef126641" href="/d/graphic/126641.html" rel="external">table 6</a>).

Patients are more likely to disclose their experience of violence when the following are addressed [<a href="#rid39">39,42,43</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Privacy</strong> – Questioning is done in private. Others present should be asked to leave for the interview and examination. Resistance to leave may be important diagnostic information. To potentially improve privacy, one study reported successful use of an electronic tablet to administer a validated six-item screening tool as a means of identifying at-risk minors [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Interpreter</strong> – Providers should engage the services of an in-person or telephonic professional interpreter when indicated. Accompanying persons should never function as the sole means of communication when language barriers exist since they may be responsible for or involved in the patient's exploitation.

If the victim does not feel prepared to disclose during the immediate clinical visit, disclosure may occur at a future visit. Therefore, each contact is a step on a potential pathway to safety for at-risk patients. Similar to patients for whom IPV is suspected but not acknowledged, clinicians should ask suspected victims of trafficking about their situation at every visit and respect their decisions to forego disclosure or decline additional services. For victims of IPV, some data suggest that patients are more likely to disclose information after they have been asked repeatedly in the health care setting about experiences of violence because the inquiries become normalized [<a href="#rid45">45,46</a>].

Approaches to reducing retraumatization include examining patients only after obtaining their permission, having them remain clothed and in a comfortable place until the examination is performed, ensuring a sense of predictability by informing patients of what they should expect, and offering aids to allow individuals to observe procedures (eg, a handheld mirror). Providers should ask patients what their expectations are regarding the visit and how the provider can potentially make them more comfortable during the encounter, even if that means leaving the door slightly ajar. Some authors suggest identifying a "signal" patients can utilize to indicate if they are feeling distressed during the visit [<a href="#rid57">57</a>].

The hotline helps clinicians determine if they have encountered victims of human trafficking without requiring patient identification or other breach of patient confidentiality; identifies local, state, and federal resources; and helps arrange local social services to aid victims. Alternatively, Polaris operates a reporting text line. <strong>Text HELP or INFO to BeFree (233733)</strong>. (See <a class="local">'National human trafficking hotline (NHTH)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Definition</strong> – Human trafficking is considered a modern form of slavery in which one person exerts control over another person for the purpose of exploitation. Human trafficking comprises sex and labor trafficking, forced criminality, and sale of human organs. Human trafficking does not require movement of the victim; many people are enslaved in their own communities or in cities within their country of origin. (See <a class="local">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk factors</strong> – Risk factors include elements that drive or entice the individual toward trafficking. Risk factors can be identified in the individual, the individual's relationships, the community, and society at large. Of note, poverty increases the risk of trafficking at all four levels. (See <a class="local">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Potential harms to trafficked individual</strong> – At every stage of the trafficking experience, adults and children can encounter abuse (psychological, physical, and/or sexual abuse); mandatory or coerced use of substances; social constraints; emotional manipulation; and economic exploitation, inescapable debts, and legal challenges  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108419" href="/d/graphic/108419.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'General'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Barriers to disclosure</strong> – A major challenge for health care providers is the difficulty in identifying victims. Victims rarely self-identify because of multiple factors including fear of the trafficker, distrust of authorities, feelings of shame and hopelessness, trauma bonds (ie, Stockholm syndrome), and threats. Providers should screen patients for potential trafficking when red flags emerge in the presentation, history, or physical examination  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108340" href="/d/graphic/108340.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108639" href="/d/graphic/108639.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). (See <a class="local">'Barriers to disclosure'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Warning signs</strong> – Specific warning signs can often include late presentation for care, discrepancy between the verbal history and clinical findings, and signs an individual is being controlled (eg, not being able to carry one's own identification or not being allowed to answer questions). Additional warning signs are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108607" href="/d/graphic/108607.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Warning signs specific to sex trafficking include reports of multiple sexual partners, sexually transmitted infections, pregnancies, miscarriages, or pregnancy terminations. (See <a class="local">'Warning signs'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Questions to help identify victims</strong> – There is no consensus regarding the optimal questions for identifying victims of human trafficking. The clinician should conduct a conversational assessment that starts with indirect questions that touch upon aspects of the patient's life, job, and general sense of safety. Suggested questions for adults and minors are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108639" href="/d/graphic/108639.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). (See <a class="local">'Approach to assessment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Medical evaluation</strong> – The initial evaluation of a suspected or confirmed trafficking victim includes assessing acute medical needs and screening for medical conditions common in trafficked persons  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108341" href="/d/graphic/108341.html" rel="external">table 8</a>). Victims of sex trafficking have additional needs including forensic examination and evidence collection, treatment of sexually transmitted infections, possible pre-exposure prophylaxis to prevent HIV acquisition, and provision of emergency contraception or pregnancy care. In addition, the options for highly effective and concealable contraception, such as the intrauterine device or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8870" href="/d/drug information/8870.html" rel="external">etonogestrel implant</a>, are discussed with the patient. (See <a class="local">'Medical evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Provision of trauma-informed care</strong> – Clinicians working with victims should provide trauma-informed care, also known as trauma-sensitive or trauma-aware care. The basic goals are to avoid reinjury, emphasize survivor strengths and resilience, aid healing and recovery, and promote the development of survivorship skills. A 16-minute online video is available from the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpolarisproject.adobeconnect.com%2F_a983384736%2Ftrauma-screenings%2F&amp;token=dR3woejQ%2BFhGunlg8qJYgof2eYkq62MnrChQmzUpb8e7oLvzdfqXibyorkBE5AinhNMCj9%2BFG3ad1%2BFeCxHkJW1UyG8litvdnF1wHXFbNGI%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=106947" target="_blank">NHTH</a> to educate providers on trauma-informed human trafficking screenings. (See <a class="local">'Trauma-informed care'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Documentation</strong> – Written documentation should be recorded in an unbiased manner and include the language used directly by the patient. Wording that could be used against the patient is avoided (eg, prostitute or drug dealer). Prior to taking any photographs, the planned images are discussed with the patient and consent is obtained and documented. (See <a class="local">'Tips for documentation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Reporting requirements</strong> – Clinicians in many countries are required to report all cases of suspected or known child abuse, sexual or otherwise. However, laws vary across countries, states, and regions regarding the definition of suspected child abuse, personnel who are mandated to report, and the agency (or agencies) to which the report is made (eg, Child Protective Services, Department of Social Service, the local police department). In the United States, information on mandatory reporting statutes by state can be found at the Child Welfare Information Gateway <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.childwelfare.gov%2Ftopics%2Fsystemwide%2Flaws-policies%2Fstate%2F&amp;token=DLatbqbbQHFKrmZAJtK4UEQtEr0Qyf8eztIIcyRKD68rfnYdCQ0I9Ad4%2FpLpZExrL1BAL7l0AhpIFnJgDRRFhsHJJq2Fe1ifeRDAGUM33Og%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=106947" target="_blank">State Statutes Search</a>.
