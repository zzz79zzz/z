         A failed airway occurs when the clinician is unable to oxygenate or ventilate the patient during attempts at airway management. Promptly recognizing a failed airway and rapidly restoring airway access in this critical scenario is imperative for reducing the risk of potentially serious airway-related morbidity and mortality. This topic reviews the approach to management of the failed airway and techniques for invasive airway access during anesthesia.

         A failed airway in the operating room occurs when there is a failure to maintain adequate alveolar oxygenation in a patient by facemask, supraglottic airway (SGA), or endotracheal intubation despite optimal attempts at these techniques. This is also referred to as a "cannot intubate/cannot oxygenate" (CICO) or "cannot intubate/cannot ventilate" scenario.
        </p>
        <p>
         Difficult airway guidelines recommend a maximum of three best attempts at oxygenation with each noninvasive airway management techniques [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. The 2021 American Society of Anesthesiologists Difficult Airway guidelines recommend a maximum of three attempts, plus one by a more experienced clinician (

         ) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Repeated attempts without changing the technique are not likely to be effective [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Multiple attempts also increase the risk of airway trauma and obstruction, and may decrease the effectiveness of subsequent attempts and other techniques [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>

         Facemask oxygenation is considered unsuccessful after additional maneuvers have been attempted including a two-handed, two-person technique and insertion of oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airways.

         Endotracheal intubation is considered unsuccessful when a maximum of three optimized intubation attempts have failed in securing airway access, plus one more by a more experienced clinician. Each attempt should have a significant variation in the technique by using a different clinician, a different laryngoscope blade, video-assisted laryngoscopy, or flexible scope intubation through an SGA.

         When best attempts at noninvasive SGA techniques have failed, a failed airway or CICO emergency must be declared and a prompt transition to an invasive technique must be initiated.

         The Fourth National Audit Project (NAP4) in the United Kingdom found that serious airway events requiring emergency invasive airway access occurred in 1 in 50,000 general anesthetics. Seventy four percent of cases of cannot intubate/cannot oxygenate (CICO) occurred in patients who were undergoing head and neck surgery [

         Good crisis management principles must be utilized to optimize the chances of success in managing a difficult or failed airway [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Clinicians involved in airway management should ideally participate in regular training exercises or simulations. Human factor failures contribute to unsuccessful emergency airway management [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,6
         </a>
         ]. These factors must be considered when developing airway management strategies at an individual, team, and institutional level [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Help should be requested at the earliest opportunity when a difficult airway is encountered to mobilize additional skilled personnel and equipment [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Guidelines for difficult airway management emphasize the importance of limiting repeated procedural attempts, promptly recognizing failure, and transitioning to the next step in airway management to minimize delays and avoid task fixation [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3,14
         </a>
         ]. With respect to cannot intubate/cannot oxygenate (CICO), this means making an immediate decision to proceed to a surgical airway.
        </p>
        <p>
         The failed airway is a high-acuity scenario in which clinicians and teams can become cognitively overloaded, leading to suboptimal management. Cognitive aids can be helpful in providing a shared mental model to facilitate decision making and communication, and avoid fixation errors [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. One such aid is called the Vortex approach, a circular or cone shaped visual aid that divides airway management into a green zone of safety (ie, adequate oxygenation) at the outer edge, surrounding a vortex that culminates in emergency front of neck access [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. For the

          Vortex approach
         </a>
         , face mask ventilation, placement of an SGA, and intubation are called lifelines. If a best attempt using any one of the three lifelines is unsuccessful (≤3 attempts at each), management circles through the other two lifelines, and if unsuccessful, proceeds to the center of the vortex, which requires emergency surgical access.
        </p>
        <p>
         Difficult airway management equipment should be standardized at an institutional level, and should be readily available in every anesthetizing location. Some authors have suggested that invasive airway equipment should be packaged as a kit that is easily identifiable and contains all of the necessary equipment [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Clinicians and teams involved in airway management should be familiar with the location and use of this equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
         We agree with guidelines from the Difficult Airway Society in the UK, which state that anesthesiologists should be trained in both the technical procedure for performing scalpel cricothyrotomy and decision making aspects of the failed airway, with regular reinforcement and practice [
         <a href="#rid1">

         Rescue of the failed airway should be directed towards emergency invasive airway access techniques, rather than attempts at awakening the patient. In a failed airway scenario, recovery of airway patency and spontaneous ventilation by awakening the patient after the induction of general anesthesia represents a potential rescue pathway [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,4,17,18

          19
         </a>
         ]. The primary limitation to awakening the patient with a failed airway is the time required to reverse neuromuscular block and/or the respiratory depression caused by induction agents.

         Options for invasive airway access include surgical (scalpel) cricothyrotomy, percutaneous (needle) cricothyrotomy with a narrow-bore or wide-bore catheter, or surgical tracheostomy. The choice of technique depends on the expertise of the operator, availability of equipment, and technical patient factors. For invasive airway access performed by anesthesiologists when cannot intubate/cannot oxygenate (CICO) occurs in the operating room, we suggest using a scalpel cricothyrotomy for most patients. We use the scalpel-bougie-tube technique described below, an approach that is consistent with recommendations from the Difficult Airway Society in the United Kingdom [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Other authors feel that with appropriate training and immediate availability of the necessary equipment, anesthesiologists can safely perform percutaneous techniques as first line techniques for rescue from CICO [

         When a surgeon who can perform a surgical tracheostomy and necessary equipment are readily available, a surgical tracheostomy can be performed as effectively and safely as a scalpel cricothyroidotomy [

          7,10

         ]. Advantages and disadvantages of these techniques are discussed in the sections here.

        <p>
         Needle cricothyrotomy is preferred rather than scalpel cricothyrotomy in children younger than 10 to 12 years of age due to anatomic differences of the airway. (See

         This technique involves placing a narrow-bore catheter (&lt;4 mm) through the cricothyroid membrane into the trachea, using an over-the-needle technique. A disadvantage is that this technique requires a high-pressure ventilation device and catheter connection equipment to allow transtracheal jet ventilation, equipment that is not readily available in many anesthetizing locations (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6313.html" rel="external">

         ). In addition, a narrow-bore cannula is not a secure airway and does not protect against aspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
         This technique may be attractive to anesthesiologists given their familiarity with over-the-needle techniques. However, needle cricothyrotomy is associated with high incidences of complications and failure.

         This technique involves placing a wide-bore catheter (≥4 mm) in the trachea, using a Seldinger technique (catheter over a guidewire) and dilator, or by using a rigid cannula-over-needle device. The wide-bore catheters used for this technique have standard endotracheal tube connectors and can be connected to the anesthesia breathing circuit or bag-valve-mask to allow low pressure ventilation and capnography. Some catheters have cuffs and protect from aspiration (

         Surgical tracheostomy is typically performed between the first and second or second and third tracheal rings, lower in the trachea than cricothyrotomy (see

         ). Thus, in cases where there is an obstruction or anatomic disruption in the infraglottic larynx (eg, tumor, laryngeal fracture, or laryngotracheal disruption), a tracheostomy is preferred over a cricothyrotomy. Tracheostomy is more familiar to surgeons and is a reasonable option when a surgeon with expertise and the necessary equipment are immediately available during a CICO event. However, tracheostomy is not an appropriate approach for anesthesiologists, who typically lack the necessary training [

          Definition
         </strong>
         – A failed airway (or "cannot intubate/cannot oxygenate" [CICO] scenario) occurs when oxygenation is not possible despite optimal attempts at facemask ventilation, ventilation with a supraglottic airway (SGA), and endotracheal intubation. Guidelines recommend a maximum of three attempts at each of these techniques plus one more by a more experienced clinician before declaring a failed airway and performing an emergency surgical airway (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef134460" href="/z/d/graphic/134460.html" rel="external">

          Training and preparedness
         </strong>
         – Clinicians involved in airway management should ideally participate in regular training exercises or simulations. Equipment for performing an emergency invasive airway should be standardized at an institutional level, and should be readily available in every anesthetizing location. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Training and preparedness for management of the failed airway'

         <strong>
          Decision to perform emergency invasive airway access
         </strong>
         – If a failed airway occurs, emergency invasive airway access must be attempted immediately. Delay in performing an invasive airway can result in hypoxic injury. Return to spontaneous ventilation is not feasible in most cases of failed airway in the operating room. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Decision to perform emergency airway access'

         <strong>
          Choice of technique
         </strong>
         – For invasive airway access performed by anesthesiologists, we suggest using a scalpel cricothyrotomy for most patients (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         )
         <strong>
          .
         </strong>
         Scalpel cricothyrotomy has a high success rate (80 to 100 percent), and requires only equipment that is readily available in the operating room. Because a standard endotracheal tube (ETT) is used, it allows ventilation with the anesthesia machine breathing circuit and use of capnography and protects against aspiration. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Scalpel cricothyrotomy'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Other invasive airway options include percutaneous needle cricothyrotomy with narrow or wide bore catheters, or surgical tracheostomy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Choice of invasive airway technique'
