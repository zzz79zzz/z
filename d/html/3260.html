The primary goal of colposcopy is to identify precancerous and cancerous lesions so that they may be treated early.</p><p>Colposcopy of the cervix is the main focus of this topic and is used as further evaluation of abnormal cervical screening tests (cytology and/or human papillomavirus testing). Colposcopy of the vagina and vulva is also reviewed here.</p><p>Colposcopic evaluation is based on the finding that malignant and premalignant epithelium have specific visual characteristics in terms of contour, color, and vascular pattern that are recognizable using colposcopy. The improved visualization of epithelial surfaces with colposcopy compared with gross visual examination enhances the colposcopist's ability to distinguish normal from abnormal areas and to obtain directed biopsies.</p><p>Related topics are discussed in detail separately, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cervical cancer screening (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7575.html" rel="external">"Screening for cervical cancer in resource-rich settings"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Follow-up of abnormal cervical screening tests (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128059.html" rel="external">"Cervical cancer screening: Risk assessment, evaluation, and management after screening"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3229.html" rel="external">"Cervical cytology: Evaluation of atypical and malignant glandular cells"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Management of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3215.html" rel="external">"Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Management"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anal neoplasia (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8032.html" rel="external">"Anal squamous intraepithelial lesions: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, screening, prevention, and treatment"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Colposcopy is used as a follow-up test to evaluate abnormal cervical cancer screening tests (cytology and/or human papillomavirus testing [HPV]) or abnormal findings on gross examination of the cervix, vagina, or vulva.

While other vaginal infections may not affect visualization with colposcopy, treatment may allow the patient to be more comfortable during the examination. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5460.html" rel="external">"Acute cervicitis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5477.html" rel="external">"Vaginitis in adults: Initial evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anticoagulation or bleeding diatheses – Anticoagulation or bleeding diatheses are not absolute contraindications to colposcopy. Bleeding is usually minimal, even in patients with these issues. However, a full history should be obtained in patients that are at high risk for bleeding. Medications can sometimes be held prior to colposcopy; for example, in our practice, we tell some patients to skip their morning dose of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="85642" href="/z/d/drug information/85642.html" rel="external">apixaban</a> on the day of their colposcopy/biopsy. This is done only after discussion with their prescribing provider.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pregnancy – The physiologic changes to the cervix during pregnancy (eg, hyperemia) make colposcopy and identifying cancerous lesions more difficult. In addition, the morbidity associated with cervical conization or biopsy during pregnancy is substantial. Biopsy is only performed if invasive disease is suspected. This is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3215.html" rel="external">"Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Management", section on 'Pregnant patients'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Immunosuppression – Patients who are severely immunosuppressed (absolute neutrophil count &lt;500 cells/microL) are at risk for bacterial translocation and potential bacteremia from a speculum examination. Colposcopy should be avoided in these patients in most circumstances. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1786760767"><span class="h1">RELEVANT ANATOMY AND HISTOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The uterine cervix is a tubular fibromuscular structure that serves as the conduit between the endometrial cavity and the vagina. The superior portion is continuous with the uterus. The cervical canal opens into the endometrial cavity at the internal os and into the vagina at the external os.</p><p>The inferior portion of the cervix protrudes into the vagina. In some patients (eg, postmenopausal, following pelvic radiation), the cervix may appear flush with the vagina on examination rather than protruding.</p><p>The ectocervix is the surface of the cervix that protrudes into the vagina  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106232" href="/z/d/graphic/106232.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). It is covered with squamous epithelium. The endocervix is the cervical canal, which is lined with columnar (glandular) epithelium.</p><p>The squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) of the cervix (junction of squamous and glandular cells, generally at the external cervical os) and the transformation zone (the transformation zone is the area between the original SCJ and the current one) are the areas at greatest risk for neoplasia  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105120" href="/z/d/graphic/105120.html" rel="external">figure 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef102479" href="/z/d/graphic/102479.html" rel="external">figure 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105122" href="/z/d/graphic/105122.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The transformation zone is an area of squamous metaplasia that lies between the SCJ and the remainder of the squamous epithelium [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The transformation zone contains embryonic cells that may be especially vulnerable to infection with human papillomavirus and to oncogenic transformation [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. </p><p>A comparison of normal, low-grade, and high-grade squamous lesions by cervical cytology and histology is shown in the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60116" href="/z/d/graphic/60116.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>).</p><p>The vagina is tubular and the proximal portion is the widest. The areas of the vagina that surround the protruding cervix are called the fornices. The vagina is covered with squamous epithelium.</p><p>The vulva comprises the external female genitalia, including the labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, vulvar vestibule, external urethral meatus, and vaginal orifice. These structures are covered with squamous epithelium.</p><p>Female pelvic anatomy is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14185.html" rel="external">"Surgical female pelvic anatomy: Uterus and related structures"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14186.html" rel="external">"Surgical female urogenital anatomy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3238347855"><span class="h1">INSTRUMENTATION AND EQUIPMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3853048913"><span class="h2">Colposcope</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The colposcope is a lighted binocular microscope that magnifies the tissue of interest (eg, cervical, vaginal, or vulvar epithelium), thereby helping to identify features suggestive of abnormal tissue  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80392" href="/z/d/graphic/80392.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). Specifications and set-up of the colposcope include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>At the start of the procedure, the clinician should adjust the intraocular distance between the two eyepieces on the colposcope to ensure binocular vision.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The colposcope should be placed approximately 30 cm from the tissue that is being visualized. Most colposcopes have a focal length (ie, working distance between the lens and target tissue) of 30 cm. This focal length allows the colposcopist the appropriate amount of room to comfortably reach the cervix with instruments.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Colposcopes differ by manufacturer, and magnification can range from 3.5x to 30x. On conventional colposcopes, the head of the colposcope is moved closer and farther from the patient, and this changes the focus, and sometimes the magnification. One type of video colposcope automatically adjusts the magnification, depending on how close the scope is to the patient, and this is based on the focus. Fine focusing can be done by turning a knob; coarse focusing is performed by moving the instrument toward or away from the patient.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Low power (2x to 10x) is often used to obtain an overall impression of surface architecture and for examination of the vulva. Medium (10x to 20x) and high (20x to 25x) powers are utilized to evaluate the vagina and cervix, with high power being particularly useful for close inspection of vascular patterns, which can signify high-grade or invasive disease. A consistent plan for magnification (usually starting at 15x) is important so that examinations are comparable and reproducible. In general we use a magnification of 15x for the cervix and vagina and 3.5 to 7.5x for evaluation of the vulva, as the organ is closer and thus requires less magnification.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The examination should begin with white light at a low-power setting for a global view of the cervix. A green filter switch is present to toggle between the two light settings. Green filter light may help identify vascular changes.</p><p></p><p>"Smart" colposcopes are now available and allow the clinician to capture and annotate images and videos and incorporate these into the patient's electronic medical record; one such device is the Enhanced Visual Assessment System (EVA) colposcope, which is cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1922447773"><span class="h2">Other supplies and instruments</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Other supplies and instruments include biopsy instruments and solutions needed for the examination (eg, acetic acid) or to control bleeding (eg, Monsel solution)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60238" href="/z/d/graphic/60238.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Prior to starting the examination, all necessary equipment and supplies should be readily available to the colposcopist, and an assistant should be present throughout the procedure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1635984983"><span class="h1">PREPROCEDURE PREPARATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4087092449"><span class="h2">Review of history and records</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A focused medical history and relevant medical records should be obtained. The biggest risk factor for cervical neoplasia is a history of cervical neoplasia, especially recurrent or persistent abnormal results over a period of years.</p><p>The lower genital tract history and review of records should include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prior cervical cytology (Pap test) and human papillomavirus (HPV) tests, normal and abnormal</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prior cervical, vulvar, and vaginal biopsy results</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of lower genital tract cancers or precancers</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of condyloma (genital warts)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Treatments to the cervix, vagina, and vulva</p><p></p><p>If possible, documentation of prior abnormal results should be obtained to confirm the history. For most patients, the written reports of previous cytology and histology are sufficient. In some cases, in our practice, we request the slides and have them reviewed by our pathology laboratory. In general, we do this when the patient is seeing us for a second opinion or when there is a discrepancy between the cytology and biopsy result (especially when the cytology results is a high-grade squamous epithelial lesion or adenocarcinoma in situ and we are unable to find a lesion on colposcopic examination that explains this abnormality).</p><p>In addition, a relevant medical history should be obtained, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Obstetric and gynecologic history – Last menstrual period, history of sexually transmitted infections, birth control method (if appropriate), history of cervical or pelvic surgery, and HPV vaccination status, with dates of injections if available. Vaccination status does not appear to affect colposcopic evaluation. In one retrospective study including 160 patients in Sweden presenting for colposcopy, colposcopic impression was similar for vaccinated (56 percent) compared with unvaccinated patients; the prevalence of HPV 16/18 infection was lower in the vaccinated subgroup (8 versus 33 percent) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Immunosuppression – Immunosuppression increases the risk of progression of cervical neoplasia (eg, human immunodeficiency virus infection, autoimmune disease, history of transplant or cancer, or immunosuppressant medications).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Smoking history – The risk of cervical neoplasia is increased in cigarette smokers.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Factors that impact the safety of the procedure – Anticoagulation, bleeding disorders, allergy to iodine.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3021568319"><span class="h2">Informed consent and counseling</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The procedure should be explained to the patient. Questions should be answered about the procedure, possible results and prognosis, and follow-up.

Although printed information leaflets did not reduce anxiety levels, they did increase knowledge levels.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">CERVICAL COLPOSCOPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The colposcope is used to examine the entire surface for the cervix, but the most emphasis is put on examining the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) and transformation zone. (See <a class="local">'Relevant anatomy and histology'</a> above.)</p><p>Recommendations have been made by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) Standards Committee to address shortcomings in colposcopic practice.

However, colposcopic findings themselves are not diagnostic of cervical neoplasia; this can only be established definitively by pathologic examination of the biopsied tissue.</p><p>Colposcopy by an experienced colposcopist will usually detect sites of significant disease (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] 2,3; cancer), but some patients with a normal colposcopic examination can still have a significant histologic abnormality. For this reason, it is important to reconcile the cytologic, colposcopic, and histologic findings in formulating a diagnosis and management plan for each patient.</p><p>To begin the procedure, the patient is placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.

This allows improved colposcopic visualization of abnormal areas. The acetic acid is applied generously to the cervix using a cotton swab [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. After 30 to 60 seconds, the acidic solution dehydrates cells so that squamous cells with relatively large or dense nuclei (eg, metaplastic cells, dysplastic cells, cells infected with HPV) reflect light and thus appear white [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. This is referred to as "acetowhite change." Blood vessels and columnar cells are not affected but become easier to visualize against the white background. Fading of acetowhite changes usually occurs after three minutes [<a href="#rid16">16</a>], and therefore, acetic acid should be reapplied, as needed, after this time. If excessive acetic acid pools in the vagina, it should be removed with dry swabs as it can cause irritation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Differential light absorption by squamous versus glandular cells – A tissue characteristic that helps to differentiate between cell types is that squamous and glandular cells have a differential absorption of light.

Lugol iodine consists of 5 g of iodine and 10 g of potassium iodide in 100 mL distilled water [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Uniform uptake of stain would confirm the colposcopist's impression that no lesion is present. Glycogen-containing cells will take up iodine and become dark brown. Nonglycogenated cells, such as normal columnar or glandular cells, high-grade lesions, and many low-grade lesions, will not take up iodine and remain light yellow. Thus, they can be easily differentiated from normal tissue for sampling or treatment purposes.

In rare cases of significant bleeding, the vagina can be packed to apply pressure to the cervix. Ferric subsulfate solution and silver nitrate interfere with interpretation of biopsy specimen, so these substances should not be applied until after all biopsies have been taken.</p><p>Infection may present as postprocedure pelvic pain, purulent discharge, or abnormal bleeding or spotting. The patient should be evaluated for cervicitis with a pelvic examination and cervical testing for infection. In our practice, we treat these patients in the same manner as nonspecific cervicitis (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9041" href="/z/d/drug information/9041.html" rel="external">azithromycin</a> monotherapy, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9393" href="/z/d/drug information/9393.html" rel="external">doxycycline</a> monotherapy, or a combined regimen of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9554" href="/z/d/drug information/9554.html" rel="external">levofloxacin</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9646" href="/z/d/drug information/9646.html" rel="external">metronidazole</a>).

It has not been found to be an effective screening tool for cervical cancer when used alone [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>The efficacy of colposcopy to detect CIN and cervical cancer depends upon the experience and training of the colposcopist. An important factor is the ability of the colposcopist to interpret the colposcopic findings and obtain properly directed biopsies. Among experienced colposcopists, there is good interobserver agreement for normal epithelium; CIN 2,3; and invasive cancer [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. There is more interobserver variation in diagnosis of CIN 1 [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. However, this lack of agreement is also true for histopathologic diagnosis of these entities.</p><p>Colposcopy using the 2011 IFCPC criteria was able to distinguish normal cervix from CIN/carcinoma with a sensitivity of 86 percent and specificity of 30 percent, and to distinguish normal cervix/low-grade lesions (CIN 1) from high-grade lesions (CIN 2,3 or carcinoma) with sensitivity of 61 percent and specificity of 94 percent [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p>One explanation for limitations of the specificity of colposcopy is that acetowhite epithelium is often observed on the anterior and posterior ectocervix, even in the absence of CIN; this may lead to unnecessary biopsies, particular in these areas [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. However, CIN appears to be similarly distributed in all four quadrants.</p><p>The diagnostic performance of colposcopy for detection of cervical neoplasia was evaluated in a meta-analysis of 32 studies including almost 8000 colposcopic punch biopsies; all patients subsequently underwent excisional biopsy (cone biopsy or loop electrosurgical excision procedure) and the results of excisional biopsy were used as the reference standard. To detect CIN 2 or higher in the excisional biopsy, a colposcopic punch biopsy of CIN 1 or higher had a sensitivity of 91 percent and a specificity of 25 percent and a punch biopsy result of CIN 2 or higher had a sensitivity of 80 percent and a specificity of 63 percent [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].</p><p>Performing two or more biopsies appears to increase sensitivity [<a href="#rid22">22,24</a>]. Options include performing additional biopsies from another part of the most abnormal-appearing lesion, from more than one abnormal-appearing area, or randomly from normal-appearing quadrants [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. The best approach has not been studied, but at this time random biopsies from normal-appearing cervix do not appear warranted, since this would lead to biopsy of very large numbers of patients without disease and in the absence of information about the additional cost and risks of this approach [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h1">VAGINAL COLPOSCOPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Colposcopy of the vagina is very similar to that of the cervix, but the natural rugae and folds can make the procedure more time-consuming and difficult in premenopausal patients. Postmenopausal patients can have more atrophy or mucosal thinning, resulting in abrasions and tears from the speculum. In such patients, a limited course (eg, three months) of vaginal estrogen therapy may be used to improve colposcopic evaluation. </p><p>A systematic approach, beginning in one quadrant and gradually working to cover all four quadrants, involves applying acetic acid repeatedly, and noting areas of abnormal staining. Adenosis, pigmented lesions, and cysts are usually seen without the need of special stains. It is necessary to rotate the speculum to allow the anterior and posterior vagina to be visualized. Lugol staining is helpful in delineating lesions, and in ensuring that all abnormal areas have been identified.</p><p>Opening the speculum as much as is feasible pulls the vaginal tissue taut so the rugated surface appears nearly flat and facilitates colposcopy; however, when biopsy is attempted, it is helpful to partially close the speculum to allow the vagina to fold in on itself. Keeping the vagina taut makes biopsy difficult. Cysts and adenosis are usually easy to sample. The site of the lesion is documented using the vaginal apex, urethra, and fourchette as landmarks. Appropriate terminology should be used similar to cervical colposcopy  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef86246" href="/z/d/graphic/86246.html" rel="external">table 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef126122" href="/z/d/graphic/126122.html" rel="external">table 5</a>) [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].</p><p>Practice varies regarding whether anesthesia is used for vaginal biopsies. Some clinicians use local anesthesia for all vaginal biopsies, while others use it for only distal vaginal biopsies (the distal vagina has somatic innervation, so biopsies may be more painful; the proximal vagina has autonomic innervation).</p><p><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="83319" href="/z/d/drug information/83319.html" rel="external">Ferric subsulfate</a> solution and pressure are usually all that are required for hemostasis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17"><span class="h1">VULVAR COLPOSCOPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Vulvar colposcopy is indicated in patients with:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Visible abnormalities of the vulva</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>No abnormalities of the cervix or vagina that can account for the abnormal cervical cytology</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Focal vulvar itch, pain, or burning, without a clear etiology</p><p></p><p>Vulvar colposcopy is performed in a similar manner to cervical and vaginal colposcopy. Three to 5 percent acetic acid is applied to the external genitalia. It may take from three to five minutes for the solution to permeate the cells and for the lesion to appear white. Particular attention should be paid to periurethral and perianal areas.</p><p>If clearly delineated lesions are noted, a vulvar biopsy is performed under local anesthesia using a 3 to 5 mm punch biopsy and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9888" href="/z/d/drug information/9888.html" rel="external">silver nitrate</a> sticks for hemostasis. Alternately, a lesion may be excised with a scalpel and sutures placed. This may allow a lesion to be removed in its entirety. We typically apply a eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (EMLA) to the vulva approximately 20 to 30 minutes prior to the anesthetic skin injection and find that patients are comfortable during the biopsy/excision. </p><p>Specimens are individually labeled according to their location on the vulva (eg, numbered and diagrammed in the patient's record) and placed in separate specimen containers. With the shift to electronic medical records, we recommend that a picture be taken and placed in the patient's medical record if possible.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1382021"><span class="h1">PREGNANT PATIENTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If there is any possibility of pregnancy, a pregnancy test should be obtained.

In our practice, we perform a biopsy in pregnant patients only if there are colposcopic features of high-grade or invasive disease.

The cervix can also be evaluated by other modalities. These may be divided into visualization techniques utilizing broad-band light (eg, direct visualization, speculoscopy, cervicography, and colposcopy) and technologies utilizing electronic detection methods (eg, Polarprobe and in-vivo spectroscopy). Four-quadrant biopsy of the squamocolumnar junction is also an acceptable alternative where equipment and experienced personnel to perform colposcopy are not available, but pathology evaluation of the specimens is available [<a href="#rid24">24,34</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Visualization techniques – Visual inspection techniques have lower specificity than cytology and are generally used in low-resource settings where cervical cytology and colposcopy are not feasible [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].

Malignant and premalignant epithelium have specific macroscopic characteristics relating to contour, color, and vascular pattern that can be identified by the colposcopist for directed biopsy. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indications</strong> – Indications for colposcopy include further assessment of cervical cytologic abnormalities or abnormal human papillomavirus (HPV) tests, patients exposed to diethylstilbestrol in utero, patients with gross abnormalities of the lower genital tract, and as an adjunct to surgery of the cervix, vagina, and vulva.
