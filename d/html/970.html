These events mostly occur in patients with structural heart disease (that may not have been previously diagnosed), particularly coronary heart disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/974.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology and etiology of sudden cardiac arrest"</a>.)</p><p>The event is referred to as SCA (or aborted SCD) if an intervention (eg, defibrillation) or spontaneous reversion restores circulation. The event is called SCD if the patient dies. However, the use of SCD to describe both fatal and nonfatal cardiac arrest persists by convention. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/963.html" rel="external">"Overview of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death", section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p>Evaluation of the survivor of SCD includes the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Identification and treatment of acute reversible causes</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Evaluation for structural heart disease</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients without obvious arrhythmic triggers or cardiac structural abnormalities, an evaluation for primary electrical diseases</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Neurologic and psychologic assessment</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In selected patients with a suspected or confirmed heritable syndrome, evaluation of family members</p><p></p><p>The evaluation of the survivor of SCD will be reviewed here. The pathophysiology of SCD and the management of survivors of SCD are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/963.html" rel="external">"Overview of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/974.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology and etiology of sudden cardiac arrest"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1019.html" rel="external">"Approach to sudden cardiac arrest in the absence of apparent structural heart disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/946.html" rel="external">"Secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGY OF SCD</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Accurate and precise measures of the relative frequencies of various causes of SCD are difficult to obtain. Case definitions are inconsistent and etiologies vary according to the population studied. Common causes of SCD include coronary heart disease, structural heart disease not related to CHD (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, etc), arrhythmias caused by primarily electrical disease (eg, Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome, etc), and transient or reversible causes (eg, medication toxicity, electrolyte abnormalities, etc).</p><p>A detailed review of the causes of SCD is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/974.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology and etiology of sudden cardiac arrest", section on 'Etiology of SCD'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">INITIAL EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The evaluation begins immediately after resuscitation. The first concern is to exclude any obvious reversible factors that may have led to the event  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52416" href="/d/graphic/52416.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">History and physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The patient (if awake) and family should be questioned, with particular attention to the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prior diagnoses of heart disease</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use of any medications, especially antiarrhythmic drugs, diuretics, and drugs that might produce long QT syndrome</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ingestion of toxins or illicit drugs</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Antecedent symptoms, especially evidence of ischemia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Antecedent stressful events or activities</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the cardiac arrest is frequently unwitnessed. In addition, the patient resuscitated from VF often has retrograde amnesia and is unable to remember what occurred prior to the cardiac arrest. Thus, a coherent history may not be ascertainable. Obtaining a history from an observer, when available, is important. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Laboratory testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Immediate evaluation should include standard laboratory testing and, in many cases, an arterial blood gas to exclude electrolyte abnormalities and acidosis. Any reversible metabolic abnormalities should be identified and corrected, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia which can predispose to ventricular tachyarrhythmias [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Toxicologic screening for drugs of abuse should be considered when relevant as drug overdose has been documented in significant numbers of patients with apparent sudden cardiac death [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>When interpreting the test results, two important limitations should be considered:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Electrolyte abnormalities during and shortly after resuscitation may be secondary to cardiac arrest and hypoperfusion as opposed to a cause of SCD [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Electrolyte abnormalities by themselves are usually insufficient to cause SCD. Clinical settings that increase the proarrhythmic effect of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia include acute myocardial infarction [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], overt heart failure, and long QT syndrome. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1043.html" rel="external">"Acquired long QT syndrome: Definitions, pathophysiology, and causes", section on 'Metabolic abnormalities'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>It is potentially hazardous to ascribe a cardiac arrest to an electrolyte or metabolic derangement alone, unless there is compelling evidence of an association. Mistaken attribution of a major arrhythmia to an innocent or merely potentiating laboratory abnormality can place the patient at high risk if appropriate therapy to prevent recurrent SCD is delayed or not given. Importantly, electrolyte and pH abnormalities may be secondary to the arrhythmia itself.</p><p>This risk was illustrated in a review of 169 patients treated with an ICD for sustained ventricular arrhythmia in whom the plasma potassium concentration was measured on the day of the arrhythmia [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The likelihood of a recurrent sustained ventricular arrhythmia was 82 percent at five years. The long-term risk was similar in patients with low, normal, and high plasma potassium concentrations at presentation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Electrocardiogram</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The ECG can reveal evidence of both acute abnormalities and chronic conditions. It should be part of the immediate evaluation and repeated as necessary once the patient's cardiac, hemodynamic, and metabolic condition stabilizes. The ECG should be evaluated for evidence of the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ongoing ischemia or prior myocardial infarction.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/974.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology and etiology of sudden cardiac arrest"</a>.)</p><p>It is essential that all survivors of SCD undergo a complete cardiac examination to determine the nature and extent of underlying heart disease. The initial history, physical examination, and laboratory tests may provide evidence of one of these disorders, but further testing is usually necessary to confirm a diagnosis.</p><p>The standard evaluation typically includes:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>ECG (see <a class="local">'Electrocardiogram'</a> above)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cardiac catheterization with coronary angiography</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Echocardiography</p><p></p><p>In the appropriate clinical setting, coronary angiography and echocardiography may be part of the urgent initial evaluation.</p><p>In selected patients, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and, rarely, myocardial biopsy are performed. (See <a class="local">'Cardiac MR'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Coronary angiography</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Coronary angiography is performed in most survivors of SCD for one of two indications: management of an acute coronary syndrome or diagnosis of chronic CHD.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h3">Acute coronary syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with evidence of STEMI following resuscitation from SCD should undergo urgent cardiac catheterization and, when indicated by the anatomy, revascularization with primary PCI or surgical revascularization [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Similarly, patients with a confirmed NSTEMI and those with a high suspicion of ongoing myocardial ischemia should also undergo cardiac catheterization with revascularization as indicated. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/72.html" rel="external">"Primary percutaneous coronary intervention in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: Determinants of outcome"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/46.html" rel="external">"Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes: Selecting an approach to revascularization"</a>.)</p><p>SCD may be the presenting manifestation of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Among patients with an ACS, malignant arrhythmias are significantly more common in the setting of an acute ST elevation MI (STEMI), but are also seen in approximately 2 percent of patients with a non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI). In patients with an ACS and ischemia, the arrhythmia is usually polymorphic VT, rapid VT (ventricular flutter), or VF. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1060.html" rel="external">"Ventricular arrhythmias during acute myocardial infarction: Incidence, mechanisms, and clinical features"</a>.)</p><p>Patients who experience SCD during the first 48 hours after an STEMI have a higher in-hospital mortality compared with STEMI patients who do not experience sustained VT or VF. However, among patients who survive to hospital discharge there is little or no difference in mortality at one to two years. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1060.html" rel="external">"Ventricular arrhythmias during acute myocardial infarction: Incidence, mechanisms, and clinical features"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Diagnostic angiography</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In SCD survivors without an ACS, angiography is still considered to exclude stable, chronic CHD, which, as indicated above, is the leading cause for SCD [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Malignant arrhythmias and SCD occur in such patients, usually those who have had a prior infarction with residual myocardial scar. In contrast to patients with an ACS, the culprit arrhythmia is usually scar-related monomorphic VT, which is not the result of ischemia. However, monomorphic VT can ultimately degenerate to VF, particularly if the arrhythmia induces ischemia. Because SCD may be the first clinical evidence of chronic CHD, most SCD survivors undergo diagnostic angiography prior to discharge.</p><p>Even for patients arriving at the hospital in refractory VT/VF who are receiving ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), immediate coronary angiography appears beneficial in a carefully selected group of patients (18 to 75 years of age with VT/VF as initial rhythm who received three shocks and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8595" href="/d/drug information/8595.html" rel="external">amiodarone</a> loading dose and who can be in the catheterization lab in &lt;30 minutes post-arrest) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Among a cohort of 55 patients who met these criteria (after excluding 7 of 62 who were declared deceased on arrival to the catheterization lab), all of whom were started on extracorporeal life support and underwent immediate coronary angiography, 46 patients (84 percent) had significant obstructive CHD, including 35 patients (64 percent) with acute thrombus, all of whom underwent percutaneous coronary intervention [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Among the cohort, 26 patients (42 percent) were discharged alive with favorable neurologic function, compared with 15 percent of historical controls.</p><p>Diagnostic coronary angiography may not be necessary in selected patients without signs or symptoms of CHD if another clear cause for SCD is identified (eg, long QT syndrome, WPW, Brugada, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular noncompaction, or arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy).</p><p>Angiography is suggested in younger patients without an apparent cause for SCD in whom angiography may also detect an anomalous origin of a coronary artery. Among competitive athletes under age 35, anomalous origin of a coronary artery was present in 13 percent of SCD survivors in one series [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/986.html" rel="external">"Athletes: Overview of sudden cardiac death risk and sport participation", section on 'Etiology of sudden death'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with stable CHD who experience an episode of primary SCD without evidence of simultaneous ischemia are at high risk for recurrent malignant arrhythmias, even after percutaneous or surgical revascularization [<a href="#rid18">18-21</a>]. As a result, such patients are treated with an ICD. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/78.html" rel="external">"Risk stratification after acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h2">Echocardiography</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Echocardiography can detect abnormalities that suggest or confirm the diagnosis of many of the important causes of SCD.

However, EP study can be valuable in those whose initial evaluation reveals no etiology, and in selected patients with a previously identified disorder.</p><p>In SCD survivors with an apparently normal heart, EP testing may reveal the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Abnormalities of atrioventricular conduction – The presence of severe conducting system disease suggests that a serious bradyarrhythmia may have contributed to the SCD event. However, such patients typically present with syncope rather than SCD. Furthermore, even when conduction disease is identified, VT/VF may be the real culprit and ventricular stimulation to induce ventricular arrhythmias may be warranted.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An accessory pathway in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome – An accessory pathway can result in rapid conduction to the ventricle of a supraventricular arrhythmia, primarily atrial fibrillation, producing a very rapid ventricular rate that can degenerate to VF. Such patients usually have evidence of preexcitation on their ECG. If preexcitation is evident on an ECG in a survivor of SCD, EP study and ablation of the accessory pathway are usually indicated. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/962.html" rel="external">"Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: Anatomy, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Ventricular fibrillation and sudden death'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Inducible ventricular arrhythmias – VT and VF may be induced in patients with a number of underlying cardiac abnormalities. The prognostic value of inducible arrhythmias is best established in patients with prior myocardial infarction and reduced LV systolic function. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1052.html" rel="external">"Incidence of and risk stratification for sudden cardiac death after myocardial infarction", section on 'Inducible VT/VF'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>There is evidence that inducible VF, particularly when induced repeatedly with nonaggressive protocols, suggests the diagnosis of idiopathic VF and may predict recurrent arrhythmic events [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>]. In a review of the literature, 69 percent of patients with idiopathic VF had a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia induced with a nonaggressive protocol; induced arrhythmia was generally polymorphic in configuration and poorly tolerated [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p>In some other conditions it is not clear that inducible VT or VF has prognostic significance (eg, Brugada syndrome, infiltrative diseases, HCM). Furthermore, aggressive stimulation protocols can induce polymorphic VT or VF in some individuals without cardiac disease. Thus, inducible arrhythmias can be a nonspecific finding. For this reason, the significance of inducible ventricular arrhythmias in patients with apparently normal hearts is unclear. On the other hand, the absence of inducible VT/VF may not preclude ICD implantation since lack of inducibility does not predict low risk.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Myocardial scar – Substrate mapping may identify areas of scar indicating abnormal substrate and a predisposition to ventricular arrhythmia. These abnormalities are more commonly seen in patients with CHD, HCM, ARVC, or infiltrative diseases, but also occur in some cases of idiopathic VF [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. In addition, some patients with idiopathic VF have other electrophysiologic abnormalities, including areas of slow conduction, regionally delayed repolarization, or dispersion in repolarization [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Supraventricular arrhythmias – Patients in whom VT or VF was not well documented at the time of SCD may have another culprit arrhythmia, usually a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).

However, it may be of importance for the SCD survivor in whom the sudden death episode occurred during exercise or physical activity. In addition, the provocation of ischemia with exercise, independently of coronary anatomy, is of importance in the evaluation of the SCD survivor. Although angiography alone does not prove a causal relationship to SCD or the presence of ischemia, the observation that revascularization appears to improve outcomes [<a href="#rid9">9,20,21</a>] means that a negative exercise test in a patient with significant coronary disease on angiography is not likely to affect the decision on revascularization. Also of great importance is the provocation of VT or VF in these patients, which would predict a higher recurrence rate. It is also a target for adjunctive antiarrhythmic therapy, particularly a beta blocker, in addition to an ICD. While VT (which is often scar mediated and provoked by catecholamines) may be provoked during exercise, VF most commonly occurs after exercise in the recovery period (when ischemia is more common). </p><p>In patients with apparently normal hearts, exercise testing can assist in the diagnosis of long QT syndrome (QT interval fails to shorten or may even lengthen with an increase in heart rate) and catecholaminergic polymorphic VT. It is also useful in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern as the resolution of the delta wave with exercise generally correlates with low likelihood of a rapid ventricular rate with atrial fibrillation which is the etiology for VF and SCD in these patients.

In a nationwide Danish study from 2000 to 2006, 470 victims of SCD were identified who were 35 years of age or younger [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Among a cohort of 3073 first- and second-degree relatives of the SCD victims who were followed for up to 11 years, cardiovascular disease (CVD) was significantly more likely to be present than in the general population (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] for CVD 3.5, 95% CI 2.7-4.7). In contrast, among relatives of elderly (greater than 60 years of age) victims of SCD, there was no difference in the rates of CVD compared with the general population (SIR 0.9, 95% CI 0.8-1.1). </p><p>A general cardiologic evaluation of first- and second-degree relatives of victims of unexplained SCD can yield the diagnosis of a heritable disease in up to 40 percent of families as illustrated by the following observations [<a href="#rid33">33-35</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a study of 32 families of victims of unexplained SCD, a general cardiologic evaluation (ECG, echocardiogram, Holter monitor and, less commonly, stress testing) was completed in 107 first-degree relatives [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].
