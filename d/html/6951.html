These findings led to the development of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as the treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer. Although ADT is palliative, it can normalize serum levels of prostate-specific antigen in over 90 percent of patients and can produce objective tumor responses in 80 to 90 percent. This antitumor activity can improve quality of life by reducing bone pain as well as the rates of complications (eg, pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, ureteral obstruction).</p><p>The duration of response to ADT for patients with metastatic prostate cancer is highly variable, and most males eventually experience disease progression despite treatment. Patients who have progressed while receiving ADT typically have castrate testosterone levels (defined as &lt;50 ng/dL) and are said to have castration-resistant disease, although such tumors may remain responsive to additional therapies directed against androgenic stimulation of the prostate cancer. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/112896.html" rel="external">"Overview of the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)"</a>.)</p><p>Many males will develop advanced, recurrent, or metastatic prostate cancer at a time when they have never received, or are no longer receiving ADT for localized disease in the adjuvant setting. In most of these cases, testosterone levels are higher than 50 ng/dL, and these males are described as having noncastrate or castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC).</p><p>Historically, ADT was initially used as monotherapy for the treatment of males with advanced CSPC. More recently, the development of additional effective therapies such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16083" href="/z/d/drug information/16083.html" rel="external">abiraterone</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9381" href="/z/d/drug information/9381.html" rel="external">docetaxel</a>, and second-generation antiandrogens such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="86370" href="/z/d/drug information/86370.html" rel="external">enzalutamide</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="116885" href="/z/d/drug information/116885.html" rel="external">apalutamide</a> has led to their use in combination with ADT for initial therapy of advanced CSPC.</p><p>This topic will discuss initial systemic therapy options for management of advanced recurrent and metastatic CSPC. The role and timing of systemic therapy for males with an isolated biochemical recurrence after local definitive prostate cancer are discussed elsewhere, as is an overview of treatment for CSPC that includes a discussion of prostate-directed therapy in those with metastatic disease and of metastasis-directed therapy in those with oligometastatic disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6933.html" rel="external">"Role of systemic therapy in patients with a biochemical recurrence after treatment for localized prostate cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6941.html" rel="external">"Overview of systemic treatment for recurrent or metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H266895395"><span class="h1">DISEASE EXTENT AND THE APPROACH TO THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Males with advanced, recurrent, or metastatic CSPC encompass a broad spectrum of disease presentations, including individuals with a rising serum prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level after definitive local therapy and no demonstrable local or metastatic disease (termed a biochemical recurrence), those with locally recurrent nonmetastatic tumors, and those with demonstrable metastases, in bone, viscera, or both.</p><p>Issues involved with evaluating the extent of disease are discussed elsewhere.

(See <a class="local">'Historical evolution'</a> below.)</p><p>More recently, the development of additional effective systemic therapies has led to their use in combination with ADT for initial therapy of males with more advanced disease:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Abiraterone</strong><strong>/</strong><strong>prednisone</strong><strong> plus ADT</strong> – <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16083" href="/z/d/drug information/16083.html" rel="external">Abiraterone</a> acts by blocking the intracellular conversion of androgen precursors in the testes, adrenal glands, and prostate tumor tissue. It initially was shown to prolong overall survival in castration-resistant disease. More recently, randomized trials showed that combining ADT with abiraterone plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> in patients with very high-risk localized nonmetastatic or metastatic castration-sensitive disease prolongs overall survival compared with ADT alone.

Both drugs have significant activity in males with castration-resistant prostate cancer. More recently, three randomized trials (ENZAMET [Australian and New Zealand Urogenital and Prostate Cancer Trials Group (ANZUP) 1304], TITAN, and ARCHES) showed benefit over ADT alone for metastatic CSPC. Both apalutamide and enzalutamide are now approved for use in this setting.

(See <a class="local">'ADT plus docetaxel'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>If doublet therapy is chosen, there are only limited clinical trial data comparing the combination of ADT plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16083" href="/z/d/drug information/16083.html" rel="external">abiraterone</a> versus ADT plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9381" href="/z/d/drug information/9381.html" rel="external">docetaxel</a>, and there are no data comparing either of these approaches with ADT plus either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="116885" href="/z/d/drug information/116885.html" rel="external">apalutamide</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="86370" href="/z/d/drug information/86370.html" rel="external">enzalutamide</a>. (See <a class="local">'Patients with low-risk/low-volume disease or not eligible for docetaxel'</a> below.)</p><p>Given the lack of comparative data supporting one approach over any other, the choice of the specific regimen is usually based on disease extent, and a discussion with the patient about potential toxicities associated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16083" href="/z/d/drug information/16083.html" rel="external">abiraterone</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9381" href="/z/d/drug information/9381.html" rel="external">docetaxel</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="116885" href="/z/d/drug information/116885.html" rel="external">apalutamide</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="86370" href="/z/d/drug information/86370.html" rel="external">enzalutamide</a>, as well as the expected duration and cost of treatment. An example of an approach to initial systemic therapy that is derived from an American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline [<a href="#rid3">3</a>], and based upon disease extent at the time of presentation is presented in the algorithm  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef130862" href="/z/d/graphic/130862.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Our suggested approach largely parallels these guidelines. This guidance is consistent with updated European guidelines for treatment of relapsing and metastatic prostate cancer [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14506178"><span class="h1">BENEFITS AND METHODS FOR ANDROGEN DEPRIVATION THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with lowering of serum testosterone levels to castrate levels is an integral component of the primary approach to the systemic treatment of castration-sensitive advanced prostate cancer. ADT can be accomplished either by surgical orchiectomy (castration) or medical castration (using either a gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] agonist or a GnRH antagonist). Both medical castration and surgical orchiectomy are effective methods for lowering serum testosterone levels in males with advanced CSPC. The decision between medical and surgical treatment is based on a variety of factors, including patient preference, cost, and treatment availability. (See <a class="local">'Surgical orchiectomy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Medical castration'</a> below and <a class="local">'ADT plus first-generation antiandrogens'</a> below.)</p><p>Guidelines from major groups, including the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), the European Association of Urology, and the American Urological Association/American Society for Radiation Oncology/Society of Urologic Oncology, all recommend initial ADT using either medical castration or surgical orchiectomy for initial systemic therapy of males with advanced prostate cancer [<a href="#rid4">4-7</a>]. Modern treatment approaches add a second systemic agent to ADT for initial therapy for most patients. (See <a class="local">'ADT plus systemic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1178848124"><span class="h2">Historical evolution</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Historically, the use of estrogens to suppress serum testosterone was studied as an alternative to surgical or medical castration. Estrogens inhibit the release of GnRH from the hypothalamus, thus suppressing pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) release and thereby reducing testicular production of testosterone. Diethylstilbestrol (DES) was extensively studied as an alternative to surgical orchiectomy for the initial management of metastatic prostate cancer prior to the development of GnRH agonists. However, two large randomized trials conducted by the Veterans Administration Cooperative Urological Research Group found that DES at a dose of 5 mg per day significantly increased the risk of dying from heart disease or stroke and that DES did not provide any advantage compared with surgical orchiectomy in terms of overall survival [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Surgical orchiectomy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bilateral orchiectomy is a relatively simple, cost-effective procedure [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Following surgery, serum testosterone levels rapidly decrease to castrate levels [<a href="#rid11">11</a>], and this is usually associated with improvements in bone pain and other disease-related symptoms [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Although orchiectomy is used much less frequently than medical castration in North America and Europe, it remains a useful alternative when an immediate decrease in testosterone is necessary (eg, impending spinal cord compression) or when costs or adherence to medical therapy are an issue. In many countries, bilateral orchiectomy remains the standard of care for initial hormone therapy of metastatic prostate cancer.</p><p>The psychological impact of surgical castration is also an important factor for males choosing between surgery and medical treatment. In a study of 159 males with metastatic prostate cancer who were provided with standard information regarding the costs, benefits, and risks of orchiectomy, only 22 percent chose orchiectomy [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. However, the benefits of lower overall cost, avoidance of injections for continued medical castration, and potentially fewer clinic visits may make orchiectomy more appealing in the current era of escalating health care costs.</p><p>The psychological effects of orchiectomy may be ameliorated with placement of testicular prostheses or with modification of the total orchiectomy to a subcapsular orchiectomy, in which the tunica albuginea and epididymis remain intact, providing a cosmetic effect in the scrotum [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Medical castration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Medical castration can be accomplished using either a GnRH agonist (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9549" href="/z/d/drug information/9549.html" rel="external">leuprolide</a>) or a GnRH antagonist (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9073" href="/z/d/drug information/9073.html" rel="external">degarelix</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="130388" href="/z/d/drug information/130388.html" rel="external">relugolix</a>). In our view, either approach is acceptable.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H261285669"><span class="h3">GnRH agonists</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Synthetic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs have greater receptor affinity, have reduced susceptibility to enzymatic degradation, and are approximately 100-fold more potent than the natural GnRH molecule [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. GnRH agonists bind to the GnRH receptors on pituitary gonadotropin-producing cells, causing an initial release of both LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which causes a subsequent increase in testosterone production from testicular Leydig cells  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50484" href="/z/d/graphic/50484.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). After approximately one week of therapy, GnRH receptors are downregulated on the gonadotropin-producing cells, with a decline in the pituitary production of LH and FSH [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The fall in serum LH leads to a decrease in serum testosterone to castrate levels within three to four weeks after the start of treatment [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Continued treatment maintains serum testosterone at castrate levels.</p><p>The decrease in testosterone production is generally reversible upon cessation of GnRH agonist therapy. However, testosterone production does not always return to baseline levels and may be related to the duration of GnRH agonist therapy, patient age, and other factors [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Flare phenomenon</strong> – The transient rise in LH when GnRH therapy is initiated can cause a surge in serum testosterone, which may stimulate prostate cancer growth. Although relatively uncommon, this "flare" may cause an increase in bone pain, bladder obstruction, or other symptoms due to prostate cancer [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Thus, initial treatment with GnRH alone is contraindicated in males with severe urinary tract obstruction or painful bone metastases. The flare phenomenon in males with metastatic disease can be effectively prevented using a short duration (ie, two weeks) of antiandrogen therapy, which blocks the effect of the increased serum testosterone [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See <a class="local">'ADT plus first-generation antiandrogens'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h4">Formulations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>GnRH agonists approved for parenteral administration include <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9549" href="/z/d/drug information/9549.html" rel="external">leuprolide</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8500" href="/z/d/drug information/8500.html" rel="external">goserelin</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10018" href="/z/d/drug information/10018.html" rel="external">triptorelin</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8867" href="/z/d/drug information/8867.html" rel="external">buserelin</a>. Buserelin is available in both a parenteral and nasal formulation. Depot formulations are widely used for all of these agents. These initially were available to suppress testosterone levels for approximately one month; even-longer-acting formulations are now available that are administered every three months, and are commonly used.

Historically, this has correlated with a level of 1.7 nmol/L (&lt;50 ng/dL), although contemporary laboratory testing indicates that in most cases, testosterone levels decline to 0.7 nmol/L (&lt;20 ng/dL) after orchiectomy [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>The potential relationship between suppression of serum testosterone and clinical outcome is illustrated by a secondary analysis of the JPR.7 trial, in which 626 evaluable males were treated with continuous ADT for a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and were followed for a median of eight years [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. The risk of dying was lowest in those with the greatest suppression of serum testosterone in the first year. Compared with a first-year minimum testosterone nadir &lt;0.7 nmol/L, those with a nadir testosterone of 0.7 to 1.7 nmol/L had an increased risk of dying (hazard ratio [HR] 2.08, 95% CI 1.28-3.38), as did those with a nadir &gt;1.7 nmol/L (HR 2.93, 95% CI 0.77-4.70). However, it is unclear whether further hormonal manipulation to achieve a deeper suppression of serum testosterone would result in improved outcomes [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p>Our practice is consistent with the current guidelines from the NCCN, which use a serum testosterone level of 1.7 nmol/L (&lt;50 ng/dL) [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Additional hormonal maneuvers can be considered if this level of suppression of serum testosterone cannot be achieved with initial treatment.</p><p>Rechecking the serum testosterone level is especially important if the anticipated clinical or biochemical response to treatment has not been achieved. Some patients have serum testosterone levels &gt;50 ng/dL even when rechecked.

Analysis of clinical trials which included mainly patients with asymptomatic metastases or an isolated biochemical recurrence after initial local therapy suggest that early as compared with deferred ADT also modestly improves survival in these populations, and it significantly reduces disease progression and associated complications [<a href="#rid42">42-44</a>].

Furthermore, some of the patients in these trials did not receive deferred treatment as originally planned.</p><p>A year 2019 Cochrane review included 10 randomized trials of early versus deferred ADT in advanced CSPC, with the majority of trials enrolling males with asymptomatic disease, often with a rising PSA as the only evidence of advanced disease [<a href="#rid43">43</a>].

IAD typically involves treatment for either a fixed interval of time or until a maximal response is achieved based upon serum PSA levels. ADT is then withdrawn, and patients are followed for evidence of recurrence. As testosterone production resumes, the side effects of ADT are mitigated, but the risk of disease progression also increases. The patient is followed with PSA measurements, and ADT is reinitiated based on a predefined threshold level of serum PSA (which varies with different practices but is often between 10 and 20 ng/mL) or with evidence of new metastatic disease.</p><p>The biological rationale for IAD is twofold. First, prolonged ADT theoretically may facilitate progression from androgen dependence to androgen independence. In addition, many of the acute and chronic side effects of ADT are due to castrate levels of testosterone. Periods of time when males are off therapy may be associated with decreases in these side effects, thereby improving quality of life.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Metastatic and locally advanced disease</strong> – Data on the superiority of continuous rather than intermittent ADT are available from at least two trials:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The Intergroup trial INT 0162 (S9346, <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT00002651%3Fterm%3DNCT00002651%26rank%3D1&amp;token=Rti1NBSWdX%2F%2FH%2FlCKGrzlGu03gYcMJXuTK3xOgZRWSzsN1lK8hRWX7wYbGShpzS6piSqqTkRvB%2Fxu1D1O%2FKOve0FTYHQNN94t49lRzsmooM%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=6951" target="_blank">NCT00002651</a>) compared IAD with continuous ADT for its impact on overall survival and quality of life in patients with metastatic CSPC and a serum PSA ≥5 ng/mL [<a href="#rid46">46</a>].

(See <a class="local">'Symptomatic metastases'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>For patients with asymptomatic metastatic disease, we also suggest early rather than delayed ADT (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). Early treatment modestly improves survival and delays skeletal-related events. (See <a class="local">'Timing of treatment initiation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3">For males with locoregionally advanced nonmetastatic CSPC who have not undergone previous local treatment and are willing and able to undergo RT, we suggest early ADT in conjunction with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16083" href="/z/d/drug information/16083.html" rel="external">abiraterone</a> and prostate RT (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>).

Another option is deferred therapy until progression. (See <a class="local">'Locoregional nonmetastatic disease'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>For most males with either metastatic or locoregionally advanced nonmetastatic CSPC who are starting ADT, we suggest continuous rather than intermittent therapy (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>).

Selected patients with "low disease burden" may be considered for triplet therapy, such as a younger patient without significant medical comorbidities but an anticipated poor cancer-specific survival despite having a "low disease burden" (eg, short time to relapse after primary local therapy).
