         After delivery, immediate care includes drying the newborn, clearing the airway of secretions, and providing warmth. (See

         For newborns who are at increased risk of requiring resuscitation, a clinician skilled in neonatal resuscitation should be present at the time of delivery. The identification of high-risk infants and their care is discussed separately. (See

         A delivery room assessment of the neonate's clinical status is quickly performed by assessing the newborn’s gestational age (GA), muscle tone, and respiratory effort [
         <a href="#rid1">

         Newborns who meet
         <strong>
          all
         </strong>
         of the following criteria can be cared for in the normal nursery (neonatal level of care 1) [

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Newborns who meet these criteria do not require immediate intervention and should be given to the mother. Well appearing newborns should remain with the mother and be placed skin-to-skin (kangaroo care) to promote infant-maternal bonding and early initiation of breastfeeding [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Medical staff should instruct and assist the mother on safe positioning of the newborn during kangaroo care and breastfeeding, and directly observe the first breastfeeding session. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4986.html" rel="external">

         Newborns &lt;35 weeks GA generally require a higher level of care (neonatal level of care 2, 3, or 4), depending on their GA and clinical status.

         Newborns who are limp and/or apneic require resuscitation, as discussed in detail separately. (See

         The Apgar score provides a universally accepted method to assess the status of the newborn infant immediately after birth.
        </p>
        <p>
         The score is determined by assessing five variables, each of which is assigned a value of 0, 1, or 2. The Apgar score calculator may be used to determine the score (
         <a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/13501.html" rel="external">
          calculator 1

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The Apgar score is assessed at one and five minutes after birth. If the five-minute score is ≤6, a 10-minute score should be assessed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Approximately 90 percent of neonates have five-minute Apgar scores of 7 to 10, and generally require no further intervention. Newborns with Apgar scores in this range have spontaneous breathing or crying, good muscle tone, and good color. They can be admitted to the level 1 newborn nursery for routine care (provided they are ≥35 weeks gestation).
        </p>
        <p>
         Infants with five-minute Apgar scores ≤6 require further evaluation and possible intervention. Approximately 1 percent of newborns require resuscitation at birth. This is discussed in greater detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5015.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The Apgar score should not be used as a prognostic tool. Although studies have found that lower Apgar scores are associated with higher rates of neonatal mortality and morbidity [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ], the Apgar score does not accurately predict outcomes in individual patients [
         <a href="#rid5">

         </span>
         The transitional period between intrauterine and extrauterine life is during the first four to six hours after birth. Physiological changes that can occur during the transitional period include decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) with increased blood flow to the lungs, lung expansion with clearance of alveolar fluid and improved oxygenation, and closure of the ductus arteriosus. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4970.html" rel="external">
          "Physiologic transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         During this time, the clinical status of the newborn should be assessed every 30 to 60 minutes to ensure further interventions and/or evaluations beyond routine care are no longer required for successful transition to extrauterine life. The following clinical parameters are monitored beginning in the delivery room and continuing in the mother/infant's room (rooming in) or nursery:

         Temperature − The normal axillary temperature should be between 36.5 to 37.5ºC (97.7 to 99.5ºF) for an infant in an open crib [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,6
         </a>
         ]. Initial hyperthermia may be reflective of maternal fever or the intrauterine environment. Persistent hyperthermia or hypothermia may be a sign of sepsis. Hypothermia may contribute to metabolic disorders such as hypoglycemia or acidosis. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5043.html" rel="external">

         Respiratory rate − The normal respiratory rate is 40 to 60 breaths per minute, and should be counted over a full minute. Tachypnea may be a sign of respiratory or cardiac disease. Apnea may be secondary to exposure to maternal medications (eg, maternal anesthesia or sedation), a sign of neurologic impairment, or sepsis.

         Heart rate − The normal heart rate is 120 to 160 beats per minute, but may decrease to 85 to 90 per minute in some term newborns during sleep. Heart rates that are too high or low may be a sign of underlying pathology, such as cardiac disease, sepsis, and metabolic derangements.

         The postpartum care of the umbilical cord for reducing the risk of infection (omphalitis) is dependent upon the quality of the care at delivery and postnatally. If there is an increased risk for omphalitis, especially in a clinical setting of low resources, the use of antiseptic agents (eg, triple dye, alcohol,

Each feeding should be recorded, and if the newborn is fed formula, the volume of feeding should also be recorded.
        </p>
        <p>
         Breastfeeding is recommended because of its increased benefits for both the infant and mother compared with formula feeding, except when medically contraindicated. (See

         Breastfed infants should be fed as soon as possible after delivery, preferably in the delivery room. They should receive at least 8 to 12 feeds per day during the newborn hospitalization. Rooming-in, skin-to-skin contact, frequent demand feedings in the early postpartum period, and lactation support increase the rate of successful breastfeeding. (See

         Term newborns may lose up to 10 percent of their birth wight (BW) in the first few days after birth and typically regain their BW by 10 to 14 days [

          33,34
         </a>
         ]. Exclusively breastfed infants delivered by cesarean section tend to have greater weight loss in the first week of life. This was demonstrated in a study using data from a large health maintenance organization, where 25 percent of exclusively breastfed infants delivered by cesarean section had &gt;10 percent weight loss at 72 hours of age [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. In this study, infants born vaginally returned to BW more quickly than those delivered by cesarean section. For infants born vaginally, 86 percent achieved BW by 14 days and 95 percent by 21 days. For infants born by cesarean delivery, 76 percent achieved BW by 14 days and 92 percent by 21 days.
        </p>
        <p>
         Excessive weight loss should be evaluated with a complete feeding assessment, ongoing lactation support for breastfeeding mothers, and interventions as deemed necessary. Weight loss nomograms based on mode of delivery and for exclusively breastfed infants have been developed [

         The optimal timing for the first bath is uncertain. Common practice in many birthing centers is to delay bathing for 6 to 24 hours after birth [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31,35

        </p>
        <p>
         However, bathing should be performed soon after delivery if there is clinical concern for transmittable infectious exposures (eg, newborn infants born to mothers with active herpes simplex virus [HSV] genital lesions or with a history of HIV or hepatitis B or C) [

         A medical home for continuing infant care has been identified and timely communication of pertinent birth hospitalization information has been sent to the care providers of the medical home. The timing of follow-up is discussed below. (See

         In most cases, the above criteria are met at ≥48 hours after birth. Depending on the preferences of the parents/caregivers, earlier discharge (at &lt;48 hours) may be reasonable if
         <strong>

         the above criteria are met. However, the parents/caregivers should be informed that early newborn discharge is associated with increased risk of subsequently needing readmission to the hospital [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40,41
         </a>
         ]. Newborns who are discharged at &lt;48 hours after birth should generally have follow-up within 48 hours after discharge. If an appropriately timed follow-up appointment cannot be ensured, discharge should be deferred until an appointment can be made. (See

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In a meta-analysis of 10 clinical trials involving 6918 newborns randomly assigned to early versus standard discharge, 28-day readmission rates were higher in the early discharge group (6.8 versus 4.3 percent; relative risk 1.59, 95% CI 1.27-1.98) [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41

         It is uncertain whether early discharge is associated with higher, lower, or similar healthcare costs compared with standard discharge. Some studies have reported higher postnatal care costs associated with early discharge [

         In the United States, because of concerns that early discharge could adversely affect maternal and infant health outcomes, both state and federal governments passed postpartum discharge laws in the late 1990s (Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act [NMHPA]) to prevent extremely short LOS. In general, these laws require insurance plans to cover postpartum stays of up to 48 hours for infants born by vaginal deliveries and up to 96 hours for cesarean deliveries [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ]. The impact of legislation ensuring insurance coverage for a minimum of 48 hours has increased the LOS of newborn infants and their mothers and appears to have decreased neonatal readmission rates and emergency department visits [

         We agree with the policy statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics that home birth is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         recommended in developed countries due to the two- to threefold increase in infant mortality when compared with outcomes following delivery in medical facilities [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. Pediatric healthcare providers should offer information about the increased risk of neonatal mortality and complications associated with planned home births to expecting parents who are considering a home birth.
        </p>
        <p>
         In particular, pregnant individuals with conditions associated with increased risk of perinatal complications (eg, intrauterine growth restriction, diabetes) should be strongly encouraged to deliver in a medical facility.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nevertheless, recognizing that home births do and will continue to occur, care for the newborn delivered at home should be consistent with the care provided to newborns born in medical facilities [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. Planned home births are safest when they are part of an integrated regulated, system with multiple well-qualified providers for both the care of the mother and infant, appropriate risk assessment, and ability for seamless transfer, if necessary. (See

          Delivery room care
         </strong>
         – Immediately after an uncomplicated delivery, routine care includes drying the newborn, clearing the airway of secretions, and providing warmth. Approximately 90 percent of newborns will not require further intervention in the delivery room, and these newborns should be given to their mothers for skin-to-skin contact and initiation of breastfeeding. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Delivery room care'

         <strong>
          Transitional period
         </strong>
         – Most newborn infants make a successful transition to extrauterine life and require only routine care immediately after birth. During the transitional period (first four to six hours of life), optimal routine care, which begins in the delivery room, includes promoting early bonding with skin-to-skin contact and early initiation of breastfeeding. The clinical status of the newborn is monitored every 30 to 60 minutes to determine whether further intervention is required. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Transitional period'

         <strong>
          Routine assessment
         </strong>
         – A thorough assessment should be performed within 24 hours of birth to identify any abnormality that would alter the newborn course or identify a medical condition that should be addressed during the first days of after birth. The assessment includes a review of the maternal, family, and prenatal history and a complete physical examination. Additional details are provided separately. (See

          Eye care
         </strong>
         – For all newborns, we recommend administering ophthalmic antibiotic therapy shortly after birth to prevent gonococcal conjunctivitis (ophthalmia neonatorum) (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">
          Grade 1B
         </a>

         <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13276" href="/z/d/drug information/13276.html" rel="external">
          erythromycin

         ointment, or 2.5 percent povidone-iodine solution. We prefer erythromycin over these agents because it is less likely to cause chemical conjunctivitis. (See

          Vitamin K

         – For all newborns, we recommend prophylactic administration of

          vitamin K

          Grade 1B
         </a>

          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Based upon the available observational data, the IM route appears to be more effective for preventing both early and late VKDB. However, oral vitamin K is routinely used for prophylaxis in some parts of the world. (See
