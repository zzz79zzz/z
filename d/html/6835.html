Although the cause is usually benign, palpitations are occasionally a manifestation of a concerning or potentially life-threatening arrhythmia. Thus, a thoughtful and appropriate evaluation is needed for patients with palpitations, although many patients may not benefit from extensive testing.</p><p>The common etiologies for palpitations and a rational guide to the diagnostic evaluation of palpitations in adults are reviewed here. The approach to palpitations in children and the management of documented arrhythmias in children and adults are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6436.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with palpitations"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6435.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with tachycardia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/961.html" rel="external">"Arrhythmia management for the primary care clinician"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/936.html" rel="external">"Overview of the acute management of tachyarrhythmias"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/994.html" rel="external">"Premature ventricular complexes: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/932.html" rel="external">"Supraventricular premature beats"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">DEFINITION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Palpitations are a subjective symptom. They are defined as an unpleasant awareness of the forceful, rapid, or irregular beating of the heart. Patients may additionally describe the sensation as a rapid fluttering or a flip-flopping in the chest, or a pounding sensation in the chest or neck; the precise description of the subjective sensations experienced by the patient may help the clinician determine the cause of the palpitations [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H469560504"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGIES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The cause of palpitations can be determined in the majority of patients. The most common causes of palpitations include cardiac disorders, medical conditions including endocrine and metabolic abnormalities, psychiatric disorders, medication effects, and drug or other substance use effects  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64306" href="/z/d/graphic/64306.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). As an example, in a study of 190 consecutive patients presenting with a chief complaint of palpitations, an etiology was determined in 84 percent; among all patients, the cause was determined to be cardiac in 43 percent, psychiatric in 31 percent, miscellaneous (eg, medication induced, thyrotoxicosis, caffeine, cocaine, anemia, amphetamine, mastocytosis) in 10 percent, and unknown in the remaining 16 percent [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cardiac disorders</strong> – Cardiac disorders are a common cause of palpitations, and this possibility generates the most concern among clinicians. Cardiac causes of palpitations include [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Cardiac arrhythmias, including the development of a new arrhythmia or a significant change in the rate of a previously stable arrhythmia (such as atrial fibrillation). Cardiac arrhythmias may develop due to underlying structural heart disease (eg, cardiomyopathy, previous myocardial infarction) or identifiable conduction system abnormality (eg, long QT syndrome, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, complete heart block), or they may be idiopathic. (See <a class="local">'Personal and family history of cardiac disease'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Arrhythmias causing palpitations include tachyarrhythmias, bradyarrhythmias, and ectopic beats.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Other less common cardiac causes include valvular heart disease (eg, mitral valve prolapse), pacemaker syndrome (ie, atrioventricular dyssynchrony due to single chamber [ventricular] pacing), atrial myxoma, and high-output cardiac states. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/950.html" rel="external">"Modes of cardiac pacing: Nomenclature and selection", section on 'Pacemaker syndrome'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113041.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of high-output heart failure", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8172.html" rel="external">"Mitral valve prolapse: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'MVP syndrome'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In one study, features that predicted a cardiac etiology of palpitations included male sex, description of an irregular heartbeat, a personal history of heart disease, and event duration greater than five minutes [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1">The majority of patients with palpitations who undergo ambulatory monitoring are found to have supraventricular or ventricular ectopy or normal sinus rhythm [<a href="#rid5">5-8</a>]; normal sinus rhythm is correlated with symptomatic palpitations in up to 30 percent of patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Psychiatric disorders</strong> – Palpitations are a clinical feature of several psychiatric disorders, including panic attacks, generalized anxiety disorder, and somatization [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Coexisting psychiatric disorders'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other causes</strong> – Other important causes of palpitations are related to medication effects, drug or other substance effects, endocrine disorders, and metabolic abnormalities  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64306" href="/z/d/graphic/64306.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Medications'</a> below and <a class="local">'Caffeine, nicotine, and other substance use'</a> below and <a class="local">'Coexisting medical conditions'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1674299808"><span class="h1">OUR APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the majority of patients with palpitations, we can determine the cause for their palpitations using a focused medical history, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and limited laboratory testing [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. In addition, most patients with a likely cardiac cause will need further evaluation with ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitoring to characterize the nature and severity of arrhythmia. For patients in whom no cause for the palpitations is immediately apparent after the initial evaluation, ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitoring is also performed to determine if a cardiac arrhythmia is responsible for their symptoms. (See <a class="local">'Ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H544416723"><span class="h2">Patients experiencing palpitations at time of evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We initially assess all patients to determine if they are currently experiencing palpitations at the time of the evaluation. If so, we immediately obtain a 12-lead ECG and perform a focused physical examination with specific attention to the cardiovascular system:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If an arrhythmia is confirmed by ECG, the patient's hemodynamic stability is assessed and the arrhythmia (and any underlying cause) managed as appropriate. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/961.html" rel="external">"Arrhythmia management for the primary care clinician"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients with no arrhythmia identified on the 12-lead ECG, we perform a cardiac examination. Some arrhythmias, particularly infrequent premature beats (eg, premature atrial complexes [PACs; also referred to as premature atrial beats, premature supraventricular complexes, or premature supraventricular beats] and premature ventricular complexes/contractions [PVCs; also referred to as premature ventricular beats or premature ventricular depolarizations]), are not captured due to the brief nature of the ECG but may be detected during several minutes of cardiac auscultation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/932.html" rel="external">"Supraventricular premature beats"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/994.html" rel="external">"Premature ventricular complexes: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The diagnosis of PVCs or PACs is likely if the cardiac examination is consistent with premature contractions (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/994.html" rel="external">"Premature ventricular complexes: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation", section on 'Physical examination'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/932.html" rel="external">"Supraventricular premature beats", section on 'Physical examination'</a>), the patient describes the palpitations as an occasional "skipped beat" followed by a pause, and the palpitations do not occur during exercise (or resolve with exercise). In these patients, the ECG is examined for other abnormalities, and a medical history is taken to assess the characteristics of the palpitations and to evaluate for coexisting disease and other contributory factors. The evaluation and management of patients with PVCs and PACs is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/994.html" rel="external">"Premature ventricular complexes: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/932.html" rel="external">"Supraventricular premature beats"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/961.html" rel="external">"Arrhythmia management for the primary care clinician"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients in whom the initial ECG or physical examination does not provide a diagnosis, we proceed with the evaluation described below.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H74411442"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients who are not currently symptomatic, we elicit detailed characteristics of the palpitations from the patient and obtain a relevant clinical history including personal and family history of heart disease, medication and substance use, and a focused review of systems (eg, symptoms of hyperthyroidism or other endocrine disorders).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H283005087"><span class="h3">Palpitation characteristics</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several characteristics of the palpitations can be helpful in providing diagnostic clues to the etiology of the palpitations.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Age of onset</strong> – Although age does not appear to be an independent predictor of the presence or absence of a cardiac etiology of palpitations [<a href="#rid3">3</a>], the age at which palpitations begin may help narrow the differential diagnosis of likely causative arrhythmias.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients with episodes of rapid palpitations since childhood are likely to have a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), probably an atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) with an accessory pathway or atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/943.html" rel="external">"Narrow QRS complex tachycardias: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/976.html" rel="external">"Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) associated with an accessory pathway"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/902.html" rel="external">"Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients in whom palpitations have begun at an older age are more likely to have paroxysmal SVT (PSVT), atrial tachycardia, or atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/943.html" rel="external">"Narrow QRS complex tachycardias: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/900.html" rel="external">"Focal atrial tachycardia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/901.html" rel="external">"Multifocal atrial tachycardia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1022.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation: Overview and management of new-onset atrial fibrillation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1048.html" rel="external">"Overview of atrial flutter"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Older age of onset is also a risk factor for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, as these are more likely to occur in patients with structural heart disease. However, idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (VT) occasionally occurs in adolescence, and many cases of torsades de pointes due to congenital long QT syndrome occur before the age of 20. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/965.html" rel="external">"Ventricular tachycardia in the absence of apparent structural heart disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1036.html" rel="external">"Congenital long QT syndrome: Epidemiology and clinical manifestations"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Duration of palpitations</strong> – Palpitations that last for an "instant" (perhaps described as an occasional skipped beat) are more likely to represent PVCs or PACs; those that are sustained and last for minutes (or longer) are more consistent with supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/932.html" rel="external">"Supraventricular premature beats"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/994.html" rel="external">"Premature ventricular complexes: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Heart rate and rhythm regularity</strong> – Asking the patient to describe (or quantify if possible) the rate and degree of regularity of the palpitations may be helpful in identification of the cause. It may be helpful for the patient to tap out the rhythm with the fingers. Similarly, it may also be useful for the clinician to provide examples of rapid and regular rhythms, rapid and irregular rhythms, slow and regular rhythms, and slow and irregular rhythms. For example, a heart rate of &gt;160 bpm is unlikely to be due to sinus tachycardia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Rapid and regular rhythms are suggestive of PSVT or VT. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/943.html" rel="external">"Narrow QRS complex tachycardias: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation", section on 'Paroxysmal and incessant SVT'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/917.html" rel="external">"Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia: Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Rapid and irregular rhythms suggest paroxysmal AF, atrial flutter, or atrial tachycardia with variable block. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/956.html" rel="external">"Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1048.html" rel="external">"Overview of atrial flutter"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/900.html" rel="external">"Focal atrial tachycardia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/901.html" rel="external">"Multifocal atrial tachycardia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Additional descriptive sensations</strong> – Other descriptions of the subjective sensations experienced by the patient can provide helpful information. As examples:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A feeling of rapid fluttering in the chest is typically seen in sustained ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias, including sinus tachycardia. The regularity or irregularity of the palpitation may indicate the probable arrhythmic etiology; as examples, AF is irregular while sinus tachycardia and AVNRT are regular.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A sensation of "flip-flopping" in the chest, the experience of a pounding, or very strong heartbeat followed by the heart briefly "stopping" may be caused by premature supraventricular or ventricular beats. The sensation that the heart has stopped results from the pause following the premature contraction, and the pounding or flipping sensation results from the forceful contraction following the pause. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/932.html" rel="external">"Supraventricular premature beats"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/994.html" rel="external">"Premature ventricular complexes: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">An irregular, pounding feeling in the neck may be experienced by patients with PVCs, complete heart block, pacemaker syndrome, or VT. It is caused by atrioventricular dissociation, with independent contraction of the atria and ventricles, resulting in occasional atrial contraction against a closed tricuspid and mitral valve. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/994.html" rel="external">"Premature ventricular complexes: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/911.html" rel="external">"Third-degree (complete) atrioventricular block", section on 'Clinical presentation and evaluation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/950.html" rel="external">"Modes of cardiac pacing: Nomenclature and selection", section on 'Pacemaker syndrome'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/917.html" rel="external">"Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia: Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and management", section on 'History and associated symptoms'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A sense of rapid and regular neck pulsations is typical of reentrant supraventricular arrhythmias, particularly AVNRT (or AVNRT due to a pre-excitation syndrome). AVNRT, the most common form of PSVT, is three times as common in women as in men [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. In the typical form of AVNRT, the atria and ventricles are activated simultaneously at a rate of 160 to 180 beats per minute; as a result, the atria are always contracting against a closed or partially closed mitral and tricuspid valve. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/962.html" rel="external">"Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: Anatomy, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/902.html" rel="external">"Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/976.html" rel="external">"Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) associated with an accessory pathway"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Associated presyncope or syncope</strong> – Lightheadedness, presyncope, or syncope may accompany palpitations and should prompt a search for a hemodynamically significant and potentially serious arrhythmia, most importantly VT. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/917.html" rel="external">"Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia: Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and management", section on 'History and associated symptoms'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1029.html" rel="external">"Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation", section on 'History and associated symptoms'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Occasionally syncope is associated with SVT, particularly upon initiation of the episode. This type of syncope is believed to result from acute vasodilation, rapid heart rate with low cardiac output, or both [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. Other tachyarrhythmias including AF and atrial flutter may cause palpitations and presyncope.

The device is worn for one or two days while the patient keeps a diary recording the time and characteristics of symptoms.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Holter monitors are limited by the short duration of time available for monitoring. In addition, arrhythmias may be identified that are unrelated to the palpitations. This was illustrated in a study of over 1400 older adult patients aged 60 to 94 years, 8.3 percent of whom complained of palpitations [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Arrhythmias, predominantly conduction abnormalities and sinus bradycardia, were found in 12.6 percent. However, the prevalence of palpitations was similar in those with and without documented arrhythmias. In another study of 518 patients who underwent 24-hour ambulatory rhythm monitoring, 34 percent experienced typical palpitations, but the corresponding cardiac rhythm was normal [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/958.html" rel="external">"Ambulatory ECG monitoring"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/958.html" rel="external">"Ambulatory ECG monitoring", section on 'When to choose continuous ECG (Holter) monitoring'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Continuous loop event recorders continuously record data but typically save the data for the preceding and subsequent two minutes (or for other time periods as programmed), but only when the patient manually activates the monitor. These recording devices are capable of direct transmission of the ECG as an audio signal via the telephone [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Continuous loop recorders can be used for longer periods than Holter monitors; since most patients with palpitations do not have them daily, this method is more likely to record data during palpitations. Furthermore, with event recorders, symptoms can be directly correlated with the cardiac rhythm since the patient activates the monitor. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/958.html" rel="external">"Ambulatory ECG monitoring", section on 'Event (loop) monitor'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The ICM is a subcutaneous monitoring device for the detection of cardiac arrhythmias [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Such a device is typically implanted in the left pectoral region and stores events when the device is activated automatically according to programmed criteria or manually with magnet application. The ICM is most often used for patients with unexplained syncope, but it may have a role for those in whom other methods have failed to document the cause of palpitations. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/958.html" rel="external">"Ambulatory ECG monitoring", section on 'Insertable cardiac monitor'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Continuous loop devices have a higher diagnostic yield than Holter monitors (66 to 83 percent versus 33 to 35 percent), and are likely more cost effective [<a href="#rid5">5,28,29</a>]. A Holter monitor, however, can be useful in patients with frequent, daily palpitations, particularly if the patient is likely to have trouble activating the loop recorder.</p><p>Regardless of the method, two weeks of event monitoring is sufficient to make a diagnosis in the vast majority of patients with palpitations and is less costly than the standard monitoring period of one month. As an example, in a retrospective analysis of 5000 patients who had undergone event recording with a continuous loop monitor, 87 percent had an initial transmission corresponding to palpitations in the first two weeks of monitoring [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. An additional 9 percent of initial transmissions occurred by four weeks of monitoring. In a second report of 105 outpatients with palpitations referred for event monitoring, the diagnostic yield was 1.04 diagnoses per patient in week 1, 0.15 in week 2, and 0.01 diagnoses per patient in week 3 and beyond [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The cost-effectiveness ratio increased from USD $98 per new diagnosis in week one, to $576 and $5832 in weeks 2 and 3, respectively.</p><p>An implantable event recorder can be used in selected patients with extremely infrequent but symptomatic palpitations (eg, typically those associated with presyncope or syncope).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H718244838"><span class="h2">Referral for electrophysiologic testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If palpitations are sustained or poorly tolerated, an electrophysiologic (EP) study may be indicated [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].

Patients may additionally describe the sensation as a rapid fluttering or a flip-flopping in the chest, or a pounding sensation in the chest or neck; the precise description of the subjective sensations experienced by the patient may help the clinician determine the cause of the palpitations. (See <a class="local">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Etiologies</strong> – Common etiologies are displayed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64306" href="/z/d/graphic/64306.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Etiologies'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Common cardiac causes include the development of a new arrhythmia or a significant change in the rate of a previously stable arrhythmia. Less common cardiac causes include mitral valve prolapse, pacemaker syndrome, atrial myxoma, and high-output cardiac states.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Palpitations are also a clinical feature of several psychiatric disorders, including panic attacks, generalized anxiety disorder, and somatization.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Other important causes of palpitations are related to medication effects, drug or other substance effects, endocrine disorders, and metabolic abnormalities.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Approach to diagnosis</strong> – In the majority of patients with palpitations, the cause for their palpitations can be determined using a focused medical history, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and limited laboratory testing. (See <a class="local">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Patients symptomatic on presentation</strong> – We initially assess all patients to determine if they are currently experiencing palpitations at the time of the evaluation. If so, we immediately obtain a 12-lead ECG and perform a focused physical examination with specific attention to the cardiovascular system (see <a class="local">'Patients experiencing palpitations at time of evaluation'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>If an arrhythmia is confirmed by ECG, the patient's hemodynamic stability is assessed and the arrhythmia (and any underlying cause) managed as appropriate.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>In patients with no arrhythmia identified on the 12-lead ECG, we perform a cardiac examination. Some arrhythmias, particularly infrequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) or premature atrial complexes (PACs), are not captured due to the brief nature of the ECG but may be detected during several minutes of cardiac auscultation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Patients without symptoms on presentation</strong> – For patients who are not currently symptomatic, we elicit detailed characteristics of the palpitations from the patient and obtain a relevant clinical history, including personal and family history of heart disease, medication and substance use, and a focused review of systems (eg, symptoms of hyperthyroidism or other endocrine disorders). (See <a class="local">'History'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Focused physical examination</strong> – Although the clinician rarely has the opportunity to examine a patient during an episode of palpitations, the physical examination is often useful in defining potential abnormalities that may provide an indication of the etiology of the palpitations. We check temperature, blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rate, and perform a careful cardiovascular examination. A pulmonary examination can provide important clinical information, and we also evaluate for signs of endocrine abnormalities. (See <a class="local">'Focused physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>ECG for all patients</strong> – For all patients with palpitations, a 12-lead ECG is required as part of the initial evaluation. Although the majority of patients are in sinus rhythm when the initial ECG is obtained, it may still help narrow the differential diagnosis of palpitations. Specifically, the ECG should be examined for findings suggestive of underlying structural heart disease or electrical system disturbance. (See <a class="local">'12-lead ECG'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Limited laboratory testing</strong> – There are no evidence-based guidelines to direct the laboratory workup of patients with palpitations. In most patients, we perform limited laboratory testing to rule out anemia and hyperthyroidism. In addition, we test for specific metabolic disorders as suggested by the history and physical examination. Finally, toxicology testing may be indicated in patients for whom substance use is suspected. (See <a class="local">'Limited laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Echocardiography for some patients</strong> – We obtain an echocardiogram in patients whose history, physical examination, or ECG raise concern for structural heart disease. These include those with a family history, symptoms, or ECG concerning for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, who have a murmur on physical examination, or who have an ECG with Q waves suggesting prior myocardial infarction, a left bundle branch block, or changes consistent with ventricular hypertrophy. (See <a class="local">'Echocardiography for any patient with possible structural heart disease'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Need for ambulatory monitoring</strong> – We use the clinical history gathered from the patient, along with the results of the physical examination, the 12-lead ECG, and the echocardiography (if appropriate) to determine the need for further evaluation including ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitoring. (See <a class="local">'Ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients who are at low risk of concerning arrhythmias (eg, those whose palpitations are unsustained and well tolerated and who do not have evidence of heart disease by history, physical examination, or 12-lead ECG), we generally do not obtain ambulatory rhythm monitoring. If a patient is very concerned about their symptoms and requires reassurance, however, we will perform two weeks of event monitoring.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>We obtain ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitoring for all patients whose initial diagnostic evaluation suggests the possibility of a disorder known to be associated with the development of ventricular tachycardia (VT):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Palpitations that are sustained, poorly tolerated, or associated with syncope or presyncope</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Organic heart disease (eg, scar formation from myocardial infarction, dilated cardiomyopathy of any cause, clinically significant valvular heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>A personal or family history of arrhythmia, syncope, sudden death, cardiomyopathy, or long QT syndrome.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">An inpatient evaluation may be more appropriate for those patients with frequent symptoms and associated syncope.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Referral for electrophysiologic testing</strong> – If palpitations are sustained or poorly tolerated, an electrophysiologic (EP) study may be indicated.
