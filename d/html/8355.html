In an open-label, randomized trial of 168 adults with a history of severe eosinophilic asthma and good control on <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="115768" href="/d/drug information/115768.html" rel="external">benralizumab</a> and high-dose ICS, 43 patients were assigned to an ongoing high-dose ICS-formoterol regimen and 125 patients were assigned to a 32-week taper protocol (medium-, low-, and as-needed dosing of ICS-formoterol) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In the tapering arm, 92 percent of patients achieved lower doses of ICS, with only 9 percent experiencing exacerbations. However, significant decreases in FEV<sub>1</sub> and increases in fraction of exhaled nitric oxide occurred in patients using the least amount of as-needed ICS-formoterol after their taper. These data suggest that most patients well-controlled on biologics may be successfully tapered to regimens containing medium- or low-dose ICS with long-acting bronchodilators. However, the safety and efficacy of tapering to as-needed ICS-formoterol requires further study. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/551.html" rel="external">"Treatment of severe asthma in adolescents and adults", section on 'Tapering therapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143006"><span class="h2">Long distance effect of wildfire smoke on asthma symptoms (October 2023)</span></p><p>Wildfire fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5)</sub> has been shown to affect respiratory health; however, previous work has focused on populations residing near and directly affected by wildfires. In June 2023, smoke from wildfires in Canada drifted hundreds of miles to New York City, resulting in increased ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub>. During smoke waves, emergency department visits for asthma in both pediatric and adult patients increased to 261 per day (reference during nonsmoke periods, 181.5 per day; incidence rate ratio 1.4) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Wildfires have health effects far from their source and are particularly hazardous to those with underlying lung disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/140586.html" rel="external">"Climate emergencies", section on 'Changing wildfire exposure'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H210_142136"><span class="h1">COPD</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H142977"><span class="h2">Significance of airway dilation on computed tomography and symptoms in patients at risk for COPD (October 2023)</span></p><p>Smokers and former smokers without airway obstruction but with respiratory symptoms or pulmonary imaging abnormalities are considered at risk for COPD, but their long-term prognosis is uncertain. In a recent study of over 3200 smokers and former smokers with normal spirometry, individuals with a computed tomography (CT)-derived marker of airway dilation and clinical symptoms (cough, phlegm production, dyspnea, or respiratory exacerbations) had increased 10-year mortality compared with those without CT-derived airway dilation (23 versus 11 percent, adjusted mortality difference 15 percent) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. These investigational data suggest that clinical and imaging features of airway disease have prognostic significance in patients at risk for COPD, but further study is needed to determine the value of detecting airway dilation in this population. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1455.html" rel="external">"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Diagnosis and staging", section on 'Additional testing'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H142730"><span class="h2">Pulmonary embolism in patients with severe COPD exacerbation (September 2023)</span></p><p>Pulmonary embolism (PE) is an important potential trigger for COPD exacerbation. In a recent multicenter study, 1580 patients with COPD who were admitted to the hospital with acute worsening of respiratory symptoms were all screened for PE with computed tomography pulmonary angiogram within 48 hours of admission [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. PE was identified in 266 (17 percent), with 166 patients (11 percent) having PE involving the main or lobar pulmonary arteries. Purulent sputum production decreased the odds of PE by 60 percent. We suggest obtaining imaging for PE in patients requiring admission for COPD exacerbation who do not have evidence of other triggers (eg, infection or heart failure). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/122144.html" rel="external">"COPD exacerbations: Clinical manifestations and evaluation", section on 'Triggers'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/122144.html" rel="external">"COPD exacerbations: Clinical manifestations and evaluation", section on 'Additional testing'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H142136"><span class="h2">Longitudinal risk of airway obstruction in symptomatic current or former smokers (August 2023)</span></p><p>Whether current or former smokers with early respiratory symptoms have a different risk for COPD development or complications is not well understood. In one longitudinal cohort of patients aged 40 to 80 years with a &gt;20 pack-year smoking history, the risk of developing airway obstruction over five years was 30 to 35 percent regardless of the presence of respiratory symptoms [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. However, patients with symptoms were significantly more likely to have respiratory exacerbations during follow-up. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1443.html" rel="external">"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Risk factors and risk reduction", section on 'Cigarette smoking'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H211_141834"><span class="h1">CRITICAL CARE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143583"><span class="h2">Routine prone positioning not beneficial in ARDS during ECMO (January 2024)</span></p><p>Whether prone positioning benefits patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) undergoing venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) is unclear. In a recent randomized trial of 170 patients with mostly COVID-related ARDS, routine prone positioning during V-V ECMO did not alter outcomes including ECMO duration, length of stay, and 90-day mortality when compared with V-V ECMO in the supine position [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. However, a significant proportion of patients were prone before enrollment which may have impacted the results. In addition, the results are not generalizable to the non-COVID ARDS population. Until data show benefit, we do not support the routine application of prone positioning during V-V ECMO in ARDS. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/134266.html" rel="external">"Extracorporeal life support in adults: Management of venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO)", section on 'Management of refractory hypoxemia during ECMO'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143024"><span class="h2">Emerging microbiologic colonization in mechanically ventilated patients (January 2024)</span></p><p>Mechanically ventilated patients act as reservoirs for hospital-acquired pathogens, including <em>Staphylococcus</em>, <em>Pseudomonas,</em> and <em>Aspergillus</em> species. However, a recent surveillance study of 51 acute care and long-term health care facilities reported the emergence of two additional species in mechanically ventilated patients, <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em> (31 percent of patients, and one-half were carbapenem-resistant) and <em>Candida auris</em> (7 percent, and one-third were newly identified) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Clinicians should be aware of emerging microbiologic species in their local facility so that appropriate surveillance can be conducted and antimicrobial therapy initiated, if indicated. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1628.html" rel="external">"Clinical and physiologic complications of mechanical ventilation: Overview", section on 'Aspiration and ventilator-associated pneumonia and microbial colonization'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143335"><span class="h2">Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (December 2023)</span></p><p>Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is being increasingly used, but data are limited and the benefits are uncertain. In a recent meta-analysis of 11 studies (10,000 patients) who underwent CPR, compared with standard CPR, ECPR was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality and increased long-term favorable neurologic outcome and survival at one year [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The benefit of ECPR was confined to patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest. These data support the growing practice of ECPR in select patients likely to benefit. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/134279.html" rel="external">"Extracorporeal life support in adults: Management of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO)", section on 'Sudden cardiac arrest (extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation)'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143224"><span class="h2">Sighs during mechanical ventilation (December 2023)</span></p><p>A ventilatory sigh refers to the administration of a deep breath every few minutes, which in prior studies was proven to maintain lung volume and to avoid atelectasis. However, sighs subsequently fell out of favor when high lung volumes were shown to be harmful. In a recent trial of over 500 ventilated trauma patients, compared with usual care, intermittent sigh volumes delivered every six minutes (plateau pressure 35 cm H<sub>2</sub>0) did not increase the number of ventilator-free days or 28-day mortality [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. There were few adverse events, but sigh-related hypotension was seen in 2 percent. While encouraging, further data are needed before sighs can be routinely applied during mechanical ventilation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1640.html" rel="external">"Overview of initiating invasive mechanical ventilation in adults in the intensive care unit", section on 'Intermittent sigh'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143222"><span class="h2">Heart rate control in septic shock (December 2023)</span></p><p>Beta blockade has the potential to limit harm from the adrenergic overdrive that occurs in septic shock. However, data to support heart rate control in patients with septic shock are limited. In a recent, unblinded randomized trial of 126 patients with septic shock-related tachycardia (heart rate ≥95/min) who were receiving norepinephrine, the beta blocker landiolol did not reduce organ failure as measured by the sequential organ failure assessment score [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Furthermore, landiolol was associated with increased 28-day mortality compared with standard care (37 versus 25 percent). We continue to avoid the routine use of beta blockers in patients with septic shock. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1631.html" rel="external">"Investigational and ineffective pharmacologic therapies for sepsis", section on 'Heart rate control'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H142867"><span class="h2">No benefit to tight glucose control in critically ill patients (December 2023)</span></p><p>In earlier studies that showed benefit from tight glucose control in critically ill patients, early <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10307" href="/d/drug information/10307.html" rel="external">parenteral nutrition</a> was a potential variable that influenced the outcome. In a recent study of over 9000 patients in whom parenteral nutrition was withheld for a week, 90-day mortality, duration of intensive care unit care, and several other outcomes (eg, infections) were similar when liberal glucose control was compared with tight glucose control [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. These results are consistent with more recent studies that support the use of liberal rather than tight targets for glucose control in critically ill patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1600.html" rel="external">"Glycemic control in critically ill adult and pediatric patients", section on 'Adults'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143376"><span class="h2">Liberal transfusion strategy for acute myocardial infarction (December 2023)</span></p><p>Restrictive transfusion (transfusing at a lower hemoglobin, typically &lt;7 or 8 g/dL) is appropriate for most patients based on evidence from randomized trials, but trial data for patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) have been slower to accumulate. In the MINT trial, which randomly assigned 3504 patients with acute MI and anemia to a restrictive or liberal (transfusing for hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL) strategy, there was a trend toward better outcomes with the liberal strategy without an increased risk of adverse events [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. We now suggest a liberal strategy for acute MI. A slightly lower hemoglobin may be reasonable for stable, asymptomatic patients, and patients with hemodynamic instability may require a higher hemoglobin. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7948.html" rel="external">"Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for RBC transfusion in adults", section on 'Acute MI'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143493"><span class="h2">Nasal decolonization in intensive care units (November 2023)</span></p><p>To reduce hospital-acquired infections, many hospitals provide nasal decolonization with either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9668" href="/d/drug information/9668.html" rel="external">mupirocin</a> or an iodophor to all patients in intensive care units (ICUs). In a cluster-randomized trial in over 130 hospitals that used universal nasal mupirocin and daily <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9244" href="/d/drug information/9244.html" rel="external">chlorhexidine</a> bathing for ICU patients, switching to nasal iodophor was associated with a higher rate of <em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>growth on clinical cultures than continuing with mupirocin [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. There was no difference in the rate of bloodstream infection from any pathogen. For hospitals that elect to use nasal decolonization in the ICU, we suggest mupirocin rather than iodophors. This practice may be particularly beneficial in ICUs with high rates of S. aureus infections, including methicillin-resistant strains. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3810.html" rel="external">"Nosocomial infections in the intensive care unit: Epidemiology and prevention", section on 'Patient bathing plus decolonization'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143323"><span class="h2">Guidelines for fever management in critically ill patients (November 2023)</span></p><p>Updated guidelines on the management of fever in the intensive care unit have been recently published by the Society for Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Differences with the previous guidelines include an emphasis on the use of core methods when feasible (eg, pulmonary artery catheter, bladder, esophageal) and oral or rectal measurement when not feasible. Also promoted was the use of bedside imaging (eg, ultrasonography) in the evaluation process and biomarkers to facilitate duration of antimicrobial therapy. We agree with the recommendations, most of which were based upon weak evidence. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1624.html" rel="external">"Fever in the intensive care unit", section on 'Temperature measurement'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143364"><span class="h2">Diagnostic "mini" bronchoalveolar lavage for ventilator-associated pneumonia (November 2023)</span></p><p>Bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is the gold standard for the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Mini-BAL is less invasive than BAL and can be performed in ventilated patients by nurses and respiratory therapists with lower rates of complications. A meta-analysis of six studies in which patients underwent both mini- and bronchoscopic BAL (in succession) reported a sensitivity of mini-BAL for VAP that was 0.9 and a specificity that was 0.83 [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. These results confirm the role of mini-BAL as a reasonable alternative to bronchoscopic BAL for the diagnosis of VAP. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1635.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation of ventilator-associated pneumonia", section on 'Invasive respiratory sampling'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143439"><span class="h2">Adverse effects with piperacillin-tazobactam versus cefepime (November 2023)</span></p><p>Observational data have raised concerns for nephrotoxicity with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9777" href="/d/drug information/9777.html" rel="external">piperacillin-tazobactam</a> (when given with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10037" href="/d/drug information/10037.html" rel="external">vancomycin</a>) and neurotoxicity with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9215" href="/d/drug information/9215.html" rel="external">cefepime</a>. In an open-label trial of over 2500 patients randomly assigned to piperacillin-tazobactam versus cefepime, the incidence of major kidney events was comparable between groups (9 versus 10 percent), including among the 1900 patients who also received vancomycin [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Median antibiotic use was three days. Although the incidence of neurotoxicity (primarily delirium) was higher with cefepime (21 versus 17 percent), imbalances in baseline delirium rates reduce confidence in that finding. These data reduce concern for nephrotoxicity with short-term coadministration of piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin (eg, for initial empiric therapy). For those who warrant prolonged therapy with vancomycin plus an antipseudomonal agent, we weigh the uncertain risks of nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity when choosing between piperacillin-tazobactam and cefepime. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/479.html" rel="external">"Beta-lactam antibiotics: Mechanisms of action and resistance and adverse effects", section on 'Renal reactions'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143279"><span class="h2">Sulbactam-durlobactam for Acinetobacter infections (November 2023)</span></p><p>Antibiotic options for infections due to <em>Acinetobacter </em>spp are limited due to high rates of resistance. The US Food and Drug Administration recently approved a new beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor antibiotic, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="141569" href="/d/drug information/141569.html" rel="external">sulbactam-durlobactam</a>. In an international randomized trial of 125 patients with carbapenem-resistant <em>Acinetobacter </em>infection (mainly hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia), sulbactam-durlobactam resulted in a trend toward lower all-cause mortality that was not statistically significant (19 versus 32 percent) and a higher clinical cure rate (62 versus 40 percent) compared with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8718" href="/d/drug information/8718.html" rel="external">colistin</a> [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. We reserve this agent for patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia or bacteremia due to susceptible <em>Acinetobacter baumannii </em>complex isolates that are resistant to other first-line agents (ie, other beta-lactams, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3150.html" rel="external">"Acinetobacter infection: Treatment and prevention", section on 'First-line antibiotics'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H143247"><span class="h2">Uncertain role for inhaled antibiotics in prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia (November 2023)</span></p><p>Whether inhaled antibiotics are effective in preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is unclear.

While promising, the lack of benefit for patient-important outcomes reduces our confidence in the preventive value of inhaled antibiotics, and thus we have not adopted this practice in our intensive care units.

The inconsistency of this finding compared with the lack of effect in most other trials decreases confidence in the mortality benefit. Furthermore, the value of convalescent plasma against Omicron variants and in the context of contemporary management remains uncertain, as only a few patients in the trial had Omicron infection and most received only <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a> without other immunomodulatory agents.

In a 2023 systematic review including 12 studies in patients with respiratory infections and 15 studies in healthy volunteers, use of NIV or HFNO was not associated with increased generation of pathogen-laden aerosols compared with controls with unsupported normal or labored breathing, low-flow nasal oxygen, or oxygen or nonrebreather mask [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Inconsistency among studies may reflect differences in sampling and detection methodologies and operating room ventilation.

However, benefit from the routine use of V-A ECMO for cardiogenic shock due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is unproven. In a meta-analysis of four randomized trials (nearly 570 patients with AMI-related cardiogenic shock), routine V-A ECMO use showed no mortality benefit and increased rates of both major bleeding and peripheral vascular ischemia compared with medical care alone [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Limitations of this meta-analysis include crossover between groups and a low rate of active left ventricular uploading during ECMO therapy, which may have biased the study in favor of the control group. These findings suggest no meaningful benefit for the routine use of V-A ECMO for patients with AMI-related cardiogenic shock but does not preclude benefit in selected patients who are candidates for salvage procedures such as heart transplant.

Despite their potential efficacy, we do not routinely use infliximab or abatacept for COVID-19, because they do not offer clear advantages over baricitinib or tocilizumab, which have more established benefit and, in the United States, are approved for this indication.
