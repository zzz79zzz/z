         Down syndrome (DS; constitutional trisomy 21, OMIM #190685) is the most common chromosomal abnormality among live-born infants. DS manifests as a developmental delay with a characteristic spectrum of congenital malformations, which may include the heart (eg, atrioventricular septal defect), gastrointestinal (eg, duodenal stenosis or atresia, imperforate anus, Hirschsprung disease), musculoskeletal, and complications in other organ systems. Hematologic abnormalities are common in children with DS. Among other hematologic disorders, neonates with DS may exhibit transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM; previously called transient leukemia or transient myeloproliferative disorder of DS), a preleukemic condition that is unique to infants with DS or mosaic trisomy 21.
        </p>
        <p>
         Myeloid leukemia associated with DS (ML-DS) is a unique form of childhood leukemia that arises before age four years in a child with DS or with trisomy 21 mosaicism. The clinical presentation, pathogenesis, response to treatment, and excellent prognosis distinguish ML-DS from other acute leukemias in children [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. ML-DS is usually manifest as acute megakaryocytic leukemia and diagnosis often follows a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-like phase with prolonged cytopenias. ML-DS can arise in a child with a history of TAM, but most cases develop in children who were not documented to have TAM.

          Myeloid leukemia associated with Down syndrome (ML-DS)
         </strong>
         – ML-DS is a unique type of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that arises in children with DS. ML-DS typically manifests as acute megakaryocytic leukemia, which is often diagnosed following a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-like phase with prolonged cytopenias. In contrast with AML that arises in children who do not have trisomy 21, ML-DS has an excellent prognosis.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         ML-DS can develop in children with constitutional trisomy 21 (ie, Down syndrome) or who are mosaic for trisomy 21; affected children may have had transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM; described below) as newborns, while other cases of ML-DS develop in children who were not documented to have TAM.

          Transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM)
         </strong>
         – TAM is a preleukemic disorder unique to infants with DS or trisomy 21 mosaicism that is manifest with circulating and/or tissue-infiltrating myeloid blasts. TAM resolves spontaneously in most patients, but some affected children experience early death from complications (eg, liver failure/fibrosis, coagulopathy). Approximately one-fifth of children with TAM subsequently develop ML-DS.

         Central to the pathophysiology of both ML-DS and transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM) is the presence of trisomy 21 and an acquired
         <em>
          GATA1
         </em>
         mutation in a progenitor cell of fetal (liver) hematopoiesis.

          Trisomy 21 and

         </strong>
         <strong>
          mutation
         </strong>
         – In the setting of constitutional trisomy 21, there is an expansion of megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor cells (MEPs) in the fetal liver [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Development of TAM and/or ML-DS can occur when a fetal long-term hematopoietic stem cell in a child with trisomy 21 acquires a mutation that encodes an amino-terminally truncated GATA1 transcription factor (GATA1s, for short) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. GATA1s is associated with disordered fetal erythropoiesis/megakaryopoiesis. TAM resolves spontaneously within months of birth in most affected children; however, a minority of children experience early death from liver failure or other complications. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16914.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Development of ML-DS
         </strong>
         – Approximately 20 percent of children with TAM develop ML-DS months to years after resolution of TAM; ML-DS usually arises within the first four years of life. No specific clinical, hematologic, or molecular features predict the risk of transformation to ML-DS.

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Although blasts disappear clinically in most children with TAM, they may persist subclinically for years. The presence of the same
         <em>
         </em>
         patient-specific
         <em>
          GATA1
         </em>
         mutation in blasts of both TAM and ML-DS within the same individual indicates that ML-DS develops from a subclone of TAM [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6
         </a>
         ]. Compared with TAM blasts, those of ML-DS contain additional genetic abnormalities that contribute to transformation (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101461" href="/z/d/graphic/101461.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Current understanding is that somatic mutations of
         <em>
          GATA1
         </em>
         during fetal hematopoiesis function are the initiating event and result in the development of TAM. In a subset of patients (approximately 20 percent), ML-DS arises when additional mutations are acquired by a dormant TAM clone during the first four years of life.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The most common additional molecular abnormalities are acquired loss-of-function mutations of cohesin complex genes (eg,

         mutation-positive TAM clone(s) and result in transformation to ML-DS. The timing of the acquisition of the co-operating mutations and the prognostic impact of specific mutations in ML-DS remain to be determined.

         ML-DS comprises a spectrum of disease. Most patients present with symptoms consistent with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, up to one-third of patients initially have a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-like phase with prominent cytopenias and a modest percentage of blasts; this cytopenic phase is expected to progress to overt AML.

        <p>
         By definition, ML-DS is not diagnosed in the first 90 days of life or after age four years. During the first three months, an accumulation of myeloid blasts in infants with DS is likely due to transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM). (See

         Management of ML-DS differs from that of transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM) and treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in children without DS.
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment should be delivered in a center with expertise in managing pediatric leukemias. If that is not possible, management should be in consultation with and/or incorporating input from a clinician who has substantial experience with ML-DS and DS. We encourage enrollment in a clinical trial, when possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         Assessment of measurable residual disease (MRD) is an important aspect of management of ML-DS [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38

         The timing for initiating treatment should be individualized; the type of presentation of ML-DS (ie, AML-like versus myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS]-like), concurrent infections, and family circumstances should all be considered when weighing this decision.

          Clinical presentation
         </strong>
         – As described above, ML-DS comprises a spectrum of disease; in most patients, it presents as de novo leukemia, but in a minority of cases, it may first be recognized in a child who appears well and has few circulating blasts and only modest cytopenias. (See
         <a class="local">

          AML-like
         </strong>
         – For children with an AML-like presentation (≥20 percent marrow blasts) we generally initiate treatment promptly to hasten the resolution of cytopenias and avoid other disease-related complications.
        </p>
        <p>

         <strong>
          MDS-like
         </strong>
         – For an otherwise well child with mild or moderate cytopenias due to ML-DS, it is acceptable to either promptly initiate treatment or modestly delay the start of treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         We explain to families that, in contrast to TAM, spontaneous improvement of cytopenias and resolution of blasts cannot be expected in ML-DS. Earlier treatment of ML-DS avoids disease progression (eg, increasing blasts in blood or marrow, emergence of a cytogenetic clonal abnormality, or transfusion-dependence) and complications (eg, progressive neutropenia with infections). For children with ML-DS, the marrow blast percentage at the start of chemotherapy (ie, &lt;20 percent versus ≥20 percent) was not associated with prognosis [

          Concurrent viral infection
         </strong>
         – In children who are ill with a significant viral infection (eg, pneumonia) at the time of diagnosis, we generally delay the start of treatment until clinical stabilization. Viral infections have been associated with early death in treatment of children with ML-DS [
         <a href="#rid39">

         Similarly, we await count recovery between courses of chemotherapy to avoid exacerbating the anticipated treatment-related cytopenias.

        <p>
         Treatment of ML-DS is not stratified according to MRD response; this contrasts with treatment of non-DS AML in children. In one study, reduction of treatment intensity in patients with optimal MRD response with ML-DS was associated with an unexpected increase of relapse rate [

        <p>
         Bone marrow of children treated for ML-DS contains DS-specific, non-malignant myeloid precursors that co-express CD56 and CD33/CD34 that are not found in normal, non-DS bone marrow [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48-50
         </a>
         ]. There is a high risk of mistaking these normal cells in recovering bone marrow of children with DS for persistent ML-DS MRD. It is therefore important to base treatment decisions only on MRD results obtained from a ML-DS MRD reference lab to avoid potentially grave errors in management.

          Presentation
         </strong>
         – ML-DS comprises a spectrum of disease. Most patients present with de novo AML (≥20 percent blasts in blood or marrow), but some have a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-like phase with prominent cytopenias and fewer blasts in the bone marrow than overt AML.

          Evaluation
         </strong>
         – Evaluation must consider cardiac or kidney disorders that might affect treatment. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should be performed (aspiration often yields little material if the marrow is fibrotic). (See

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – ML-DS should be suspected in a child with DS &gt;3 months to 4 years of age with unexplained cytopenias and/or myeloid blasts and may occur in a child &lt;4 years with unexplained cytopenias or myeloid blasts in the absence of features of DS (in association with mosaicism for trisomy 21).

         <strong>
          Timing
         </strong>
         – Timing for initiating treatment should be individualized. We favor initiating treatment soon after establishing the diagnosis to hasten resolution of cytopenias and avoid disease complications. However, outcomes do not differ according to disease phase (ie, MDS-like versus AML-like). Treatment should be delayed to enable clinical stabilization after a significant viral infection (eg, pneumonia) and may be delayed for children with an MDS-like presentation with mild cytopenias for family/other circumstances.

          Treatment
         </strong>
         – Management of ML-DS is complex and associated with significant toxicity. Details of treatment should conform with a contemporary treatment protocol.

         For all children with ML-DS, we suggest induction therapy followed by intensification therapy that includes high-dose
