         The oral cleft is the most common craniofacial malformation in the newborn. The three main types of oral clefts are cleft lip alone, cleft palate alone, and cleft lip with cleft palate  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78946" href="/z/d/graphic/78946.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Cleft lip with or without a cleft palate (CL/P) and cleft palate alone (CP) differ with respect to embryology, etiology, candidate genes, associated abnormalities, and recurrence risk.

         Craniofacial development represents a complex interaction of cell patterning, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Much of the facial tissue originates by cell migration from the embryonic neural crest, which is governed by regulatory, structural, and positional genes.

          Cleft lip
         </strong>
         – Normally, complete closure of the lip is accomplished by 35 days postconception as the lateral nasal, median nasal, and maxillary mesodermal processes merge. Failure of closure of any one of the three normal sites of fusion can produce unilateral (most common), bilateral (less common), or median (rare) lip clefting  (

         – CP occurs when midline fusion of the palatal shelves fails to occur. Abnormalities in programmed cell death may contribute to lack of palatal fusion, although this mechanism remains debated. CP can occur with CL or alone; the latter is possible because palatal closure is not completed until 56 to 58 days postconception, well after closure of the lip, and because the etiology may differ.

         The process of midface development involves genes that control cell patterning, cell proliferation, extracellular communication, and differentiation. Gene variants in any of these developmental processes crucial to midface development have been associated with development of clefts [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-7
         </a>
         ]. Over 30 candidate genes have been identified, although as a group they contribute to a relatively small percentage of nonsyndromic cases. Variants in genes associated with syndromic clefting are found in approximately 10 percent of individuals with apparently nonsyndromic oral clefts, suggesting genetic overlap between nonsyndromic and syndromic etiologies [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         While many genes have been associated with oral clefting in animal models, findings in humans are more limited [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Some genes that have been implicated include
         <em>
          SATB2

         (transcription factor),
         <em>

         While animal studies have associated clefting with in utero exposure to several medications and other environmental agents, an association in humans is possible but far less clear. It is possible that teratogen exposure contributes to clefting in genetically at-risk fetuses but not others.

         Fetuses with oral clefts should undergo careful full body assessment for additional structural abnormalities, which are common and vary by type and location of the oral cleft. For example, associated anomalies have been detected in 28 percent of fetuses with both CL and CP, 8 percent of those with CL alone, and 22 percent of those with CP alone [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41

         ]. Associated anomalies are very common with midline CL and more common with bilateral CL/P than unilateral CL/P (100, 25, and 10 percent, respectively, in one study [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42

         ]). Clefts in atypical positions may be associated with amniotic bands.
        </p>
        <p>
         Associated anomalies typically involve the central nervous system/skeletal system (33 percent) and cardiovascular system (24 percent), which are sites of tissues with neural ectodermal origin. Sometimes, the associated anomaly is detected before the lip and palate are examined and prompt careful examination of these structures. As an example, midline forebrain abnormalities (eg, holoprosencephaly) are associated with malformation of midline facial structures such as median CL and CP.

        <p>
         Polyhydramnios was noted in 15 out of 230 (6.5 percent) pregnancies with CL/P alone in one study, and the palate was involved in 13 of these cases [

         In all cases, noninvasive prenatal testing may be used to screen for common trisomies, while amniocentesis for microarray is diagnostic. Chromosomal abnormalities (eg, trisomy 13) are found in 40 to 60 percent of fetuses with CL/P plus associated anomalies [

         Gene panels are available to sequence over a dozen clefting-associated genes, including those present in the Stickler and van der Woude syndromes, which are among the more common syndromic causes of oral clefts (see
         <a class="local">
          'Syndromic cases'
         </a>
         above). As with gene panels in numerous other disorders, some caveats should be considered. For example, not all genes for syndromes associated with oral clefts are on available panels or even known, and sequencing candidate genes can reveal pathogenic variants as well as variants of unknown significance. Given the range of possible genes involved in oral clefts, some consider exome sequencing a preferable approach to targeted sequencing panels [

         Patients with an ultrasound diagnosis of presumed CL/P alone or CP alone should understand that prenatal evaluation for additional anomalies may not detect all anomalies and is generally unable to detect cognitive deficits or sensory deficits affecting vision or hearing. As an example, in one series of fetuses presumed to have CL/P alone after detailed ultrasound examination, approximately one-fifth were found to have additional anomalies at birth [

         Referral to the neonatology service that will attend the birth is also desirable. They can counsel parent(s) about newborn management issues; begin a discussion about planning surgical repair; and initiate a referral to a multidisciplinary cleft or craniofacial management team, which may include pediatrics, genetics, nursing, nutrition, oral surgery, dentistry, orthodontics, otolaryngology, plastic and reconstructive surgery, psychology, social work, speech pathology, and audiology. Postnatal care by an experienced multidisciplinary team is necessary because affected infants/children may have problems with feeding/chewing, breathing, speech intelligibility, sleep, ear infections and hearing, and social integration, which can be mitigated by surgery, dental treatment, speech therapy, and psychosocial interventions. The multidisciplinary team can give parents information on the medical and psychosocial issues that these children and their families face [

Whether this will also be possible in humans in whom the clefts have not been surgically created is unknown.

         In most cases, the identification of a fetus with an oral cleft does not alter antepartum or intrapartum maternal care.

         The initial focus of postdelivery newborn care is assessment of the infant's airway and sucking ability. Infants with severe Pierre Robin sequence (CP in association with micrognathia) may need expert support after birth to maintain a safe airway. Infants with a palatal cleft generally cannot generate sufficient negative intraoral pressure to suck milk effectively from bottle or breast but often can be bottle fed with formula or expressed breast milk with use of adaptive feeding equipment (eg, squeezable bottle, modified nipple, spoon) [

          Terminology
         </strong>
         – The oral cleft is the most common craniofacial malformation in the newborn. It may consist of cleft lip alone, cleft lip with cleft palate, or cleft palate alone  (

         </a>
         ). Cleft lip with or without a cleft palate (CL/P) and cleft palate alone (CP) differ with respect to embryology, etiology, candidate genes, associated abnormalities, and recurrence risk. (See

         <strong>
          Epidemiology
         </strong>
         – In the United States, the estimated prevalence of oral clefts (CL/P and CP) was reported to be 14.5/10,000 live births. The prevalence of CL alone, CL with CP, and CP alone has been reported to be 3.1, 5.6, and 5.9 per 10,000 live births, respectively. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Prevalence'

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Race/ethnicity affects the prevalence of CL. By contrast, the prevalence of CP is relatively constant across races and ethnicities. The male to female ratio of CL/P is 2:1, while the male to female ratio of CP is 1:2. (See

         <strong>
          Risk factors/etiology
         </strong>
         – Both genetic and environmental factors influence the development of oral clefts. Most oral clefts are nonsyndromic (a genetically complex event with gene-gene and gene-environment interactions); syndromes account for approximately 30 percent of cases of CL/P and 50 percent of cases of CP.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Females planning pregnancy can reduce their risk of having a child with nonsyndromic oral cleft by working with their clinician to discontinue drugs associated with this malformation (eg, certain antiseizure medications) and following routine preconception advice, such as smoking cessation, avoidance of alcoholic beverages, and supplementation with

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Syndromic cases may be caused by variants in a single gene or deletion or duplication of a genomic region (copy number variant [CNV]). Oral clefting is noted in over 100 syndromes. Van der Woude syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder and the most common form of syndromic clefting, accounting for 1 to 2 percent of cases. (See

         <strong>
          Prenatal diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Oral clefts are diagnosed prenatally beginning after 12 weeks of gestation when the soft tissues of the fetal face can be clearly visualized sonographically and developmental separation of the lip and palate should no longer be present. The sensitivity of fetal ultrasound for facial clefting is highest when CL/P is associated with other structural anomalies. In other situations, such as CL/P alone in a low-risk population, the sensitivity may only reach 50 percent. CP alone is the most difficult oral malformation to diagnose prenatally, with a very low detection rate. Three-dimensional ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, where available, can provide a clear image of the malformation and may enhance detection, especially of CP alone. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Prenatal diagnosis'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Postdiagnostic evaluation
         </strong>
         – Fetuses found to have oral clefts should undergo careful assessment for additional structural abnormalities as these defects are noted in 50 percent of newborns with CP, 20 percent of those with CL and CP, and 8 percent for those with CL. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Prenatal diagnosis'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis for chromosome microarray should be offered to patients with ultrasound findings of fetal oral clefts; if associated anomalies are present, there is a high rate of chromosomal abnormalities. Further genetic analysis by specific panels or exome sequencing may be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration family history and any associated anomalies. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Obstetric management'

         <strong>
          Recurrence risk
         </strong>
         – The recurrence risk of CL/P and CP depend on the setting, and can be as high as 50 percent in the setting of a dominant disorder with a minimally affected parent, emphasizing the need for thorough multidisciplinary care. (See
         <a class="local">
