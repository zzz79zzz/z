Men who are managed with radical prostatectomy are staged pathologically based on pathologic examination of the resection specimen; some will have histopathologic extension beyond the prostate (pT3), positive margins upon examination of the surgical specimen (R1), or lymph node involvement  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110728" href="/z/d/graphic/110728.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110729" href="/z/d/graphic/110729.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p>The management of patients with pT3/T4 disease, positive surgical margins, or pathologic lymph node involvement following radical prostatectomy for clinically localized disease will be reviewed here.</p><p>The management of patients with clinical lymph node involvement identified during pretreatment staging is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6947.html" rel="external">"Initial management of regionally localized intermediate-, high-, and very high-risk prostate cancer and those with clinical lymph node involvement", section on 'Clinical evidence of lymph node involvement'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PATHOLOGIC VERSUS CLINICAL STAGING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) system is used to stage newly diagnosed prostate cancer  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110728" href="/z/d/graphic/110728.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110729" href="/z/d/graphic/110729.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). This system incorporates the anatomic extent of disease, including the primary tumor (T), regional lymph nodes (N), distant metastases (M), and margin status (R). In addition, the baseline serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and histologic grade group  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107132" href="/z/d/graphic/107132.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) (based on the Gleason score) are incorporated to divide patients into prognostic stage groupings  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118962" href="/z/d/graphic/118962.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Imaging findings are not incorporated into pathologic staging. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16992.html" rel="external">"Initial staging and evaluation of males with newly diagnosed prostate cancer", section on 'Clinical versus pathologic TNM staging'</a>.)</p><p>The pretreatment evaluation provides the information for the clinical (c) stage, which forms the basis for the initial treatment decisions, along with patient age, overall medical condition, and the presence or absence of symptoms. For patients whose initial treatment includes radical prostatectomy, additional information is obtained from histopathologic examination of the prostatectomy specimen, and this forms the basis for the pathologic (p) stage.</p><p>Clinical staging may underestimate or overestimate the anatomic extent of disease. Patients with cT1N0 or cT2N0 disease may be reclassified as pT3 or N1 based on these results. Conversely, patients thought to have more extensive (cT3) disease may be reclassified as pT2. If surgical margins are positive for tumor (residual microscopic disease), staging is modified by an "R1" descriptor, while negative margins are designated "R0."</p><p>pT3 involvement is defined by the presence of extraprostatic disease. pT3 stage is subdivided into pT3a, which includes extraprostatic extension (sometimes also called "extracapsular" extension) or microscopic invasion of the bladder neck, and pT3b, which includes seminal vesicle invasion. Invasion into the rectum, levator muscles, and/or pelvic wall is defined as pT4 disease.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H255203697"><span class="h1">PATHOLOGIC T3 OR MARGIN-POSITIVE DISEASE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3597731638"><span class="h2">Risk of recurrence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In contemporary series, between 50 and 75 percent of men with pathologic (p) T3 disease will ultimately have a biochemical relapse following radical prostatectomy (defined as a detectable serum prostate-specific antigen [PSA; &gt;0.2 ng/mL]) [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4117308094"><span class="h3">T3a versus T3b disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pattern of disease recurrence appears to differ for men with pT3a disease compared with those with pT3b disease [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. With extraprostatic extension (pT3a), local control tends to be more of a problem, particularly in the presence of positive margins. By contrast, men with seminal vesicle invasion (pT3b) are at higher risk for distant disease recurrence, regardless of the status of the surgical margins. The effectiveness of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) does not appear to differ in men with pT3a disease as compared with those with pT3b disease. (See <a class="local">'RT: adjuvant versus early salvage'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2597888682"><span class="h3">Positive margins</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The natural history of men with positive resection margins (R1) after radical prostatectomy is variable. Even when multiple positive margins are present, not all men recur [<a href="#rid6">6-10</a>].</p><p>The variable natural history is illustrated by a contemporary multicenter analysis in which positive surgical margins were identified in 2607 of 11,521 men (23 percent) who had undergone radical prostatectomy [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The 15-year cancer recurrence rate was significantly increased compared with that in those with negative margins (10 versus 6 percent), although the median follow-up was only 56 months. Furthermore, in a multivariable analysis that incorporated Gleason score, seminal vesicle invasion, and the use of postoperative RT, the impact of positive surgical margins was not statistically significant. An understanding of the impact of positive surgical margins and adjuvant therapy requires recognition of factors that are modifiable and those that are not. Non-modifiable risk factors are largely due to the inherent biology of the disease and will drive both recurrence rates and the impact adjuvant therapy has on the course of the disease.</p><p>Multiple factors have been identified that influence the risk of recurrence when a positive margin is identified in the surgical specimen:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The risk classification of the patient at presentation influences the likelihood of recurrence in those with a positive surgical margin. In a single-institution series of 1268 patients, 21 percent of cases had positive surgical margins [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The number and location of positive margins influence the risk of recurrence. In a series of 1667 evaluable men who underwent radical prostatectomy, 1295 had negative margins, 96 had a solitary positive apical margin, 82 had a solitary positive nonapical margin, and 194 had multiple positive margins (78, 6, 5, and 12 percent, respectively) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Among those with a solitary positive apical margin, a solitary positive nonapical margin, and multiple positive margins, the three-year rates of biochemical recurrence were 13, 18.6, and 27 percent, respectively. However, late relapses may be seen for many years after radical prostatectomy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The primary Gleason score at the positive surgical margin also influences the likelihood of systemic progression and cancer-specific survival. In a series of 1036 patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy, 338 (33 percent) had positive margins [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. At a median follow-up of 13 years, primary Gleason grade 4 at the resection margin was associated with worse systemic disease-free survival compared with primary Gleason grade 3 or negative surgical margins (74 versus 90 versus 93 percent, respectively). Similarly, cancer-specific survival was worse in this group (86 versus 96 versus 97 percent, respectively).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H123361585"><span class="h2">Management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following represents our approach to these patients:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For men with pT3 disease, negative nodes, negative or minimally positive surgical margins following radical prostatectomy, and an undetectable serum PSA, we suggest early salvage RT at the first sign of PSA recurrence rather than adjuvant RT. Delayed RT avoids radiation complications in those who will never require additional treatment, particularly since adjuvant RT appears to adversely affect urinary continence. (See <a class="local">'RT: adjuvant versus early salvage'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In occasional circumstances, men with higher-risk disease (eg, extensively positive surgical margins, especially with grade group 4 or 5 disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107132" href="/z/d/graphic/107132.html" rel="external">table 3</a>)) may consider adjuvant external beam RT following radical prostatectomy, rather than salvage RT at the first sign of a biochemical recurrence. However, careful monitoring for evidence of a biochemical recurrence, followed by salvage RT at the earliest evidence of relapse, is an acceptable alternative. (See <a class="local">'RT: adjuvant versus early salvage'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is not routinely recommended in the adjuvant setting for patients who have node negative disease. For most men, early salvage RT is preferred over adjuvant RT. ADT given in conjunction with early salvage RT for node negative patients may be considered if the PSA level at time of salvage is elevated, particularly &gt;0.7 ng/mL and considering the results of RTOG 9601, GETUG 16, and a preliminary report of RTOG 0534. Concomitant ADT with salvage RT may also be considered with gross residual recurrence in the prostate bed, a rapid PSA doubling time, or other high risk features. We do not routinely recommend using ADT in conjunction with adjuvant RT or early salvage RT following prostatectomy. However, this approach can be considered in men with multiple features of high-risk disease (eg, grade group 4 or 5 disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107132" href="/z/d/graphic/107132.html" rel="external">table 3</a>), positive seminal vesicles, and/or positive margins). (See <a class="local">'Concurrent ADT'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The role of adjuvant ADT alone after prostatectomy is uncertain. We reserve this approach (typically high-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9154" href="/z/d/drug information/9154.html" rel="external">bicalutamide</a> [150 mg daily]) as an alternative to adjuvant RT for a very select population of sexually active young men who have preserved erectile function after radical prostatectomy for high-risk, completely resected disease (eg, grade group 4 or 5  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107132" href="/z/d/graphic/107132.html" rel="external">table 3</a>), pT3b), who are aware of the risk of gynecomastia, and who wish to avoid RT.

(See <a class="local">'Role of chemotherapy'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with detectable postoperative PSA, particularly that above 0.2 ng/mL, are candidates for salvage RT and may also be candidates for additional staging workup, including advanced positron emission tomography (PET) agents, depending on PSA level.

However, given the risk of an early rapid recurrence, the option of adjuvant RT should be discussed with men who have extensive grossly positive surgical margins, especially in conjunction with grade group 4 or 5 disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107132" href="/z/d/graphic/107132.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Careful monitoring for evidence of a biochemical recurrence, followed by salvage RT at the earliest evidence of relapse, is also an acceptable alternative.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Adjuvant RT versus observation</strong> – Adjuvant RT decreases the risk of a biochemical relapse in select patients. It may also improve overall and metastasis-free survival in these select patients. However, the role of adjuvant RT, particularly compared with early salvage RT at the time of a biochemical relapse, is in evolution. Previous prospective randomized trials showing that adjuvant RT was associated with a reduced risk of recurrence in men at risk (ie, positive surgical margins, pathologic stage T3 disease, grade group 4 or 5 disease) were confounded by the use of salvage treatment (typically ADT) only at the time of clinical progression, and few men receiving adjuvant RT at all. More recent trials have favored early salvage RT rather than adjuvant RT for most men because of lower risks for overtreatment and fewer adverse events.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Arguments for adjuvant RT include the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Extended follow-up from large clinical trials provides evidence that adjuvant RT is well tolerated and that it improves biochemical and local control rates in men who are found to have pT3 disease or diffusely positive resection margins at radical prostatectomy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>There is also increasing evidence that postoperative RT improves metastasis-free and overall survival [<a href="#rid14">14-17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Postoperative surveillance without treatment, followed by salvage RT at the first evidence of a rising serum PSA, entails the risk that distant metastases might develop in some men who might have been rendered disease free with immediate adjuvant RT.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Arguments against adjuvant RT include the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Recommending adjuvant RT for all men with high-risk disease after prostatectomy means that RT will be administered to many men who may never require such treatment (ie, overtreatment).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Adverse effects are more common with adjuvant RT. Consistent with quality of life (QOL) data from the prospective randomized SWOG trial 8794 [<a href="#rid14">14</a>], there are retrospective reports that suggest that men who receive adjuvant RT following radical prostatectomy have a lower rate of postprostatectomy recovery of urinary continence [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>At least three randomized trials and a meta-analysis of all three trials directly comparing adjuvant versus early salvage RT at the time of PSA progression support the view that prostate cancer-specific outcomes are similar with salvage as compared with adjuvant RT, but that the risk of overtreatment and its attendant treatment-related adverse effects are less with salvage therapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Postoperative RT in men with pT3 or margin-positive disease has been compared with observation in several randomized trials [<a href="#rid14">14,15,19-21</a>] and a meta-analysis [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The meta-analysis of EORTC 22911 [<a href="#rid15">15</a>], SWOG 8794 [<a href="#rid19">19</a>], and a third trial, ARO 96-02/AUO AP 09/95 [<a href="#rid20">20</a>], came to the following conclusions [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Compared with a wait-and-see strategy for pT3 or margin-positive prostate cancer, adjuvant RT significantly improved 10-year metastasis-free survival (odds ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.62-0.96), biochemical progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.48, p &lt;0.00001), clinical progression-free survival, hormone-free survival, and local recurrence-free survival. However, none of these benefits translated into a significant improvement in either overall survival (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.67-1.42) or prostate cancer-specific survival (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.46-1.33).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Grade 2 or higher genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicities were significantly higher in the adjuvant therapy group, including urinary stricture (11 versus 5.7 percent) and urinary incontinence (6.9 versus 2.7 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In our view, the trials included in this analysis used outdated treatments, and most men in the observation arms never received adjuvant RT, because further treatment was not typically administered until clinical progression, and most went straight to ADT. Furthermore, these trials included a heterogeneous group of patients with variable amounts of disease involvement, variable postoperative PSA levels, and varying or unspecified thresholds for the initiation of salvage RT. In current practice salvage RT is often initiated at the first sign of biochemical relapse (PSA &gt;0.10-0.2 ng/mL). Thus, these trials, while demonstrating the benefit of adjuvant RT, did not adequately address the important question of whether early salvage therapy is as effective as immediate adjuvant therapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Versus early salvage RT</strong> –Retrospective studies have given conflicting results regarding the relative merits of adjuvant versus early salvage RT [<a href="#rid17">17,22,23</a>]. Three randomized trials directly compared both approaches, and while they enrolled slightly different patient populations, and some used ADT while others did not, they have come to similar conclusions. Prostate cancer-specific outcomes are similar with salvage as compared with adjuvant RT, but the risk of overtreatment and its attendant treatment related adverse effects are less with salvage therapy [<a href="#rid24">24-26</a>]; a similar conclusion was reached in a meta-analysis of all three trials [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The phase III RADICALS-RT trial randomly assigned 1396 men after surgery for high-risk prostate cancer (with either pT3-4, Gleason score 7 to 10 disease, preoperative PSA &gt;10 ng/mL, or positive postoperative margins) to postoperative RT or delayed RT at the time of disease recurrence [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. The use of ADT for up to two years was permitted at the discretion of the clinician, or if the patient was participating in a substudy of no ADT, six months of ADT, or two years of ADT. Within eight years after randomization, only 33 percent of the men in the salvage RT group had received RT.

However, self-reported urinary incontinence was worse at one year with early RT, and grade 3 or 4 urethral strictures were more common with adjuvant RT as well (6 versus 4 percent).

Five-year event-free survival (the primary endpoint, defined as locoregional or distant disease relapse, biochemical progression, or death) was 92 percent in the adjuvant RT group, compared with 90 percent with salvage RT.

Overall, 421 of the men randomized to early salvage RT had started salvage treatment (39 percent) at the time of the analysis. Event-free survival was defined by PSA rise to ≥0.4 ng/mL and rising after completion of any postoperative RT, clinical or radiologic progression, initiation of nontrial treatment, death from prostate cancer, or a PSA level ≥2 ng/mL at any time after randomization.

However, the fact that only 39 percent of men assigned to salvage RT had received it with median follow-up duration of five years or longer is consistent with a high population of patients with favorable-risk disease in all three studies, and limits the power of the high-risk subgroup analysis in this study. Furthermore, there was a disparity in the time frame for assessment for postradiotherapy PSA progression in the adjuvant and salvage RT groups that could have biased the result in favor of salvage RT for men with high-risk features at risk for early rapid PSA progression [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2749290725"><span class="h4">Men with high-risk disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The positive, but relatively small, SWOG adjuvant therapy trial was conducted in the 1980s when, potentially, the pathology reports were not as refined as are contemporary reports. We suspect that, in that setting, adjuvant RT was mostly given for clinically very high-risk disease (eg, extensive positive margins, especially in the setting of high Gleason grade disease). Men with high-risk features such as these can have a rapid rise in PSA, and given the delay associated with delivery of salvage RT relative to adjuvant RT, disease within the RT treatment volume (ie, prostatic bed) may spread outside the RT treatment volume during that time [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. The SWOG trial supports a potential survival advantage for such patients.</p><p>A benefit for adjuvant RT for men with high-risk disease was subsequently shown in the SWOG trial 8794, in which 425 men with pT3 or margin-positive prostate cancer were randomly assigned to immediate RT (60 to 64 Gy) or observation [<a href="#rid14">14,19</a>]. At a median follow-up of 12.6 years, adjuvant RT significantly improved both metastasis-free and overall survival compared with observation (median 14.7 versus 12.9 years, HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54-0.94, and median 15.2 versus 13.3 years, HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55-0.96) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p>Subset analyses found that the benefits in metastasis-free and overall survival were independent of the Gleason score and included men with either detectable or undetectable postprostatectomy PSA levels and those with positive margins or seminal vesicle involvement.

These included rectal complications (3.3 versus 0 percent without adjuvant RT), urethral strictures (17.8 versus 9.5 percent), and total urinary incontinence (6.5 versus 2.8 percent).</p><p>A benefit for adjuvant rather than early salvage RT for men with high-risk disease was also suggested in a multi-institutional analysis of 26,118 men with pT2-3N0 or N1M0 prostate cancer who were consecutively treated with radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy at one of four medical centers in the United States and Germany [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Among the 2424 with adverse pathologic features (pN1, grade group 4 or 5, pT3/4 disease), 428 underwent adjuvant RT, 1031 had early salvage RT, and 965 received no RT; among the 23,694 men without adverse pathology, the corresponding numbers were 391, 3570, and 19,733 for adjuvant, salvage, and no RT, respectively. In an analysis adjusted for treatment propensity score (which represents the probability of treatment assignment conditional on observed baseline prognostic covariates), age at prostatectomy, treatment institution, and time dependent use of postprostatectomy androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and after excluding men with a persistently positive PSA level, adjuvant RT significantly reduced all-cause mortality compared with early salvage RT in men with adverse pathologic features, including those with pN1 disease (10-year all-cause mortality 14 versus 22 percent, relative risk [RR] 0.66, 95% CI 0.44-0.99) or without pN1 disease (10-year all-cause mortality 5 versus 22 percent, RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13-0.85). By contrast, there were no significant differences in all-cause mortality with adjuvant RT among men without adverse pathology (10-year all-cause mortality 8 versus 9 percent).</p><p>In our view, these data are insufficient to change our practice, which limits early adjuvant RT to those with grossly positive surgical margins, especially in conjunction with grade group 4 or 5 disease.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2578931956"><span class="h4">Influence of tissue-based molecular markers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>No genetic test of the resected prostate can accurately aid in the selection of postsurgical RT (either adjuvant or salvage RT), and routine use of genomic markers in the postprostatectomy setting should not be offered.

This may be in situations in which a Decipher score associated with a high risk of disease progression, for instance, helps to inform patient counseling in making a decision to proceed with adjuvant RT (eg, in a man with adverse pathologic features such as Grade Group 3 to 5  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107132" href="/z/d/graphic/107132.html" rel="external">table 3</a>), T3a, node-positive, or margin-positive cancers, with an undetectable PSA).

We agree with this position.</p><p>Notably, consensus-based guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network suggest that tumor-based molecular assays can be used to prognosticate risk of metastasis and prostate cancer-specific mortality in men with adverse features after prostatectomy, but they do not advocate their use for selecting men for adjuvant versus salvage RT [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p>Year 2018 guidelines for treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer from the combined American Urological Association (AUA), American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), and Society for Urologic Oncology (SUO) do not address the utility of molecular markers in this setting [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1565906925"><span class="h3">Concurrent ADT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The potential use and duration of ADT in conjunction with adjuvant or early salvage RT following prostatectomy remains controversial, and continues to evolve as more clinical trial data and observational studies become available.

Benefit for early adjuvant ADT was shown in a trial in which 98 men were randomly assigned to ADT immediately following prostatectomy or to observation with ADT given for distant metastases or symptomatic recurrences [<a href="#rid49">49,50</a>]. In the latest analysis, with a median follow-up of 12 years, patients assigned to immediate rather than delayed ADT had significant improvements in overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 1.84, 95% CI 1.01-3.35), prostate cancer-specific survival (HR 4.09, 95% CI 1.76-9.49), and progression-free survival (HR 3.42, 95% CI 1.96-5.98).</p><p>In our view, further support for the benefit of adjuvant ADT comes from the SWOG S9921 trial, in which 961 men who underwent prostatectomy for clinical T1-3N0 prostate cancer with one or more risk factors (including pathologically positive nodes, which were present in 17 percent of enrollees) were randomly assigned to ADT with or without <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9660" href="/z/d/drug information/9660.html" rel="external">mitoxantrone</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Approximately one-fourth of the patients in each group also received adjuvant RT. Despite the high-risk nature of the cohort, the 10-year overall survival estimate for the ADT group was 87 percent, and prostate cancer was the cause of death in only 8 percent.

However, individual values and preferences are an important component of this decision, and many men decline RT, particularly if the PSA is undetectable after surgery. If RT is chosen, many clinicians, including some of the authors and editors associated with this review, delay initiation until 6 to 12 months postoperatively.</p><p>There are no large randomized trials assessing the role of adjuvant RT following radical prostatectomy in men with positive lymph nodes. However, retrospective data from large series suggest that this approach can improve outcomes in some individuals:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>This issue was addressed in a retrospective cohort study of 1338 men with positive lymph nodes who underwent radical prostatectomy at three centers between 1988 and 2010, which analyzed overall survival for those whose initial management was observation (n = 387), ADT (n = 676), or RT plus ADT (n = 325) [<a href="#rid51">51</a>].

The 10-year all-cause mortality with ADT plus RT ranged from 12 to 31 percent based on pathologic Gleason grade, stage, margin status, and the number of positive nodes. For those managed with ADT alone, the 10-year all-cause mortality ranged from 17 to 71 percent based on associated risk factors.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>As noted above, a benefit for adjuvant rather than early salvage RT for men with high-risk disease, including those with pN1 disease was also suggested in a multi-institutional analysis of 26,118 men with pT2-3N0 or N1M0 prostate cancer who were consecutively treated with radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy at one of four medical centers in the United States and Germany [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. In an adjusted analysis, and after excluding men with a persistently positive PSA level, adjuvant RT significantly reduced all-cause mortality compared with early salvage RT in men with adverse pathologic features, including those with pN1 disease (relative risk [RR] 0.66, 95% CI 0.44-0.99) or without pN1 disease (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13-0.85).
