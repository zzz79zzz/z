Rarely, heterozygotes may have bleeding (autosomal dominant transmission, due to heterodimer binding). Hemophilia C is more common in Ashkenazi Jewish population (Jews from Eastern Europe). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1333.html" rel="external">"Factor XI (eleven) deficiency"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acquired factor deficiencies</strong> – Acquired coagulation factor deficiencies caused by an autoantibody (often to factor VIII) are sometimes referred to as acquired hemophilia. The terms "acquired factor inhibitor" or "acquired factor deficiency" are preferable to avoid potential mislabeling the patient as having hemophilia A or B. Management of these conditions is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1305.html" rel="external">"Acquired hemophilia A (and other acquired coagulation factor inhibitors)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inhibitors</strong> – In hemophilia, 'inhibitor' refers to an alloantibody that typically forms in response to infused factor. Inhibitors are most common in individuals with very low baseline factor levels and those with specific genetic variants. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1308.html" rel="external">"Inhibitors in hemophilia: Mechanisms, prevalence, diagnosis, and eradication"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Severity</strong> – Hemophilia is characterized as mild, moderate, or severe, based on the residual or baseline factor activity level (also referred to as "factor level"); this is expressed as a percent of normal or in international units (IU)/mL [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Factor levels typically correlate with the degree of bleeding symptoms [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Severity is defined as follows [<a href="#rid1">1,4</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Severe hemophilia</strong> – Severe hemophilia is defined as &lt;1 percent factor activity, which corresponds to &lt;0.01 IU/mL.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Moderate hemophilia</strong> – Moderate hemophilia is defined as a factor activity level ≥1 percent of normal and ≤5 percent of normal, corresponding to ≥0.01 and ≤0.05 IU/mL.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Mild hemophilia</strong> – Mild hemophilia is defined as a factor activity level &gt;5 percent of normal and &lt;40 percent of normal (≥0.05 and &lt;0.40 IU/mL). Individuals may also be classified as having mild hemophilia despite having a factor level of ≥40 percent if they share a genetic variant in the relevant factor gene (<em>F8</em> or <em>F9</em>) with a family member who has hemophilia [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Target joint</strong> – A target joint is defined as a joint with ≥3 recurrent bleeding episodes in a six-month period.

Hemophilia A is more common than hemophilia B. Typically reported incidences are as follows [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hemophilia A</strong> – Hemophilia A occurs in approximately 1 in 4000 to 1 in 5000 live male births. Approximately one-half to two-thirds have severe disease (factor VIII activity &lt;1 percent of normal).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hemophilia B</strong> – Hemophilia B occurs in approximately 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 30,000 live male births. Approximately one-third to one-half have severe disease (factor IX activity &lt;1 percent of normal).</p><p></p><p>Severe hemophilia is almost exclusively a disease of males, although females can be affected in some rare cases (eg, compound heterozygosity; skewed lyonization; X chromosome loss). </p><p>In contrast, mild hemophilia has been reported in up to one-quarter of female carriers who are heterozygous for the pathogenic variant in the factor gene (<em>F8</em> or <em>F9</em>). Mild hemophilia is an appropriate diagnosis in these individuals, rather than classification as 'symptomatic carriers' that has been used historically. (See <a class="local">'Bleeding in females/carriers'</a> below and <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Most commonly, hemophilia is inherited (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1311.html" rel="external">"Genetics of hemophilia A and B"</a>). However, sporadic disease (without a positive family history, presumed due to a de novo mutation) is also common. Studies have demonstrated that sporadic causes account for as much as 55 percent of cases of severe hemophilia A and 43 percent of cases of severe hemophilia B [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. In moderate and mild hemophilia A and B, approximately 30 percent are sporadic cases. </p><p>Hemophilia occurs in all racial and ethnic groups and throughout the world. A publication from the World Federation of Haemophilia estimated that 43 percent of the world's hemophilia population lives in India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and China, of which only 12 percent have been diagnosed [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Epidemiologic estimates may be skewed in other regions of the world by reduced diagnostic capabilities. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinical manifestations of hemophilia relate to bleeding from impaired hemostasis, sequelae from bleeding, or complications of coagulation factor infusion.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Initial presentation</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H86820608"><span class="h3">Age at first bleeding</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most infants with severe hemophilia present within the first year to one and a half years of life with easy bruising, hemarthrosis, bleeding due to oral injury, or after an invasive procedure.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Average age of diagnosis based on life table analysis of 13,399 participants in a Centers for Disease Control (CDC) data collection project for severe, moderate, and mild hemophilia were 1 month, 8 months, and 36 months, respectively [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In another report from the CDC involving a cohort of 547 boys with hemophilia, 441 (81 percent) had at least one bleeding event during the first two years of life [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a survey of 140 boys from Sweden, the mean ages at diagnosis for severe disease and moderate disease were 9 and 22 months, respectively [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a report of 580 children diagnosed with hemophilia before age two, 75 percent were diagnosed within the first month of life, especially if there was a known family history of hemophilia or known carrier status of the mother [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. These data did not include children diagnosed after age two, so they are likely to be biased towards inclusion of families with a known history of hemophilia.</p><p></p><p>Other reviews have reported similar mean age for first bleeding episode; however, the range of ages for first bleeding is large, with some children having severe bleeding at birth and others not experiencing a bleeding episode until the age of four [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. The majority of newborns with severe hemophilia undergo non-instrumented delivery without significant bleeding [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>In contrast to severe disease, mild hemophilia may go undetected for long periods of time. This is true in the absence of an informative family history as well as in individuals with a positive family history for whom the information is not communicated. Disease may only become apparent when there is a significant hemostatic challenge (trauma or surgery). In one report of 10 patients, the age of diagnosis of mild hemophilia ranged from 14 to 62 years [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Up to one-third of patients with mild hemophilia have no bleeding or very limited bleeding only associated with trauma or surgery [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>The majority of patients with hemophilia present with a known family history. However, a significant number of individuals present with unexpected bleeding, most likely due to a de novo gene mutation transmitted from the mother [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In the survey of 140 boys with hemophilia (only some of whom had known carrier mothers), a bleeding episode preceded the diagnosis in one-fourth [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H86820528"><span class="h3">Initial site of bleeding</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bleeding may occur anywhere in the body in patients with hemophilia. Differences in disease severity and hemostatic challenges throughout life influence the initial site of bleeding.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Infants</strong> – Common sites of bleeding in newborns include the central nervous system, extracranial sites such as cephalohematoma, and sites of medical interventions including circumcision, heel sticks, and venipunctures [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Approximately 3 to 5 percent of infants with severe hemophilia develop subgaleal or intracerebral hemorrhage in the perinatal period [<a href="#rid17">17-22</a>]. Approximately one-half have excessive bleeding with circumcision [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Children</strong> – Bruising, joint bleeds, and other sites of musculoskeletal bleeding become more common once children become mobile (including crawling) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Frenulum and oral injuries are also common sites in young toddlers. Forehead hematomas ("goose-eggs") were reported as a common presenting finding in a retrospective analysis of 324 children with hemophilia, in whom forehead hematoma was the initial site of bleeding in 84 (25 percent) and the only site of bleeding in 14 of these (17 percent) [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. The ages of affected children ranged from six months to 11 years (mean, 3.4 years), and many had mild or moderate disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Older children and adults</strong> – Common sites of bleeding in older children and adults include joints, muscles, central nervous system, and oral or gastrointestinal tract. (See <a class="local">'Joints and muscle'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Patients with bleeding will require hemostatic intervention, often including infusion of the appropriate coagulation factor, and they should be treated in consultation with a hemophilia treatment center. This and other management issues are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1314.html" rel="external">"Treatment of bleeding and perioperative management in hemophilia A and B"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4074597337"><span class="h2">Disease severity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with more severe hemophilia are more likely to have spontaneous bleeding, severe bleeding, and an earlier age of first bleeding episode, which can begin as early as birth [<a href="#rid3">3,16</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p>Immediate and delayed bleeding after trauma is common; it can be massive or may persist as continuous oozing for days or weeks. In contrast, excessive or prolonged bleeding from small cuts is uncommon. The overall frequency of bleeding has declined with greater use of prophylactic therapy, such that some patients with severe disease may not experience a severe bleeding event.</p><p>Rarely, patients with severe hemophilia have a milder-than-expected clinical course [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. The following examples illustrate potential mechanisms for the attenuation of disease severity:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hemophilia B Leyden</strong> – The hemophilia B Leyden phenotype is characterized by severe hemophilia B in childhood that becomes progressively milder after puberty. Mutations in these individuals occur in the factor IX promoter, affecting expression of the gene, rather than the factor IX coding region. The increase in factor IX expression is seen as a child ages, often thought to occur by or during puberty, likely due to hormonal changes and testosterone sensitivity. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1311.html" rel="external">"Genetics of hemophilia A and B", section on 'Leyden phenotype'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Coinheritance of thrombophilia</strong> – The factor V Leiden mutation or other thrombophilic conditions can co-occur with hemophilia [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>]. These prothrombotic conditions may potentially ameliorate the bleeding phenotype of hemophilia, resulting in fewer bleeding episodes and a later onset of first bleeding [<a href="#rid12">12,27,28</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1355.html" rel="external">"Factor V Leiden and activated protein C resistance"</a> and <a class="local">'Initial presentation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p>Patients with moderate hemophilia often bleed in response to intercurrent injury and invasive procedures. Bleeding is less frequent than in severe hemophilia and typically occurs four to six times yearly. However, more frequent bleeding may occur if a target joint (a joint with ≥3 recurrent bleeding episodes in six months) develops. Some patients with moderate hemophilia may express a more severe phenotype requiring the use of prophylactic treatment regimens. (See <a class="local">'Hemophilic arthropathy'</a> below.)</p><p>In contrast, individuals with mild hemophilia generally only have bleeding in response to injury/trauma or surgery, and bleeding may not become clinically apparent until later in life [<a href="#rid3">3,16</a>]. Delayed bleeding can occur after minor surgical procedures such as dental extraction, even in patients with mild disease. (See <a class="local">'Age at first bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p>Heterozygous females have variable factor levels. Those with a factor activity level above 50 percent of normal are not expected to experience excessive bleeding, and, in these cases, carrier status is primarily important for the potential reproductive implications (risk to male children). Other female carriers may have factor activity levels less than 50 percent of normal and may have greater bleeding than unaffected relatives or matched controls [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. It may be challenging to obtain a true baseline factor activity level, especially in hemophilia A carriers, due to the stress response, use of hormonal regulation for birth control or menses, or during pregnancy; these may elevate factor VIII levels. Clinical observation and close attention to management are required in these cases, especially if only a single factor activity level measurement is available. (See <a class="local">'Bleeding in females/carriers'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3084248"><span class="h2">Sites of bleeding</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Intracranial bleeding</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is relatively rare compared with other sites of bleeding, but it is one of the most dangerous and life-threatening events in individuals with hemophilia [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].

Twenty-eight percent of carriers met the definition for mild hemophilia (factor level below 0.40 IU/mL, corresponding to &lt;40 percent of normal activity).

In some individuals with hemophilia A, factor VIII levels may increase with stress, leading to a normalization of the aPTT or mis-categorization of factor levels and disease severity.</p><p>In patients with hemophilia, the aPTT corrects in mixing studies, unless an inhibitor is present, which only applies to individuals who have received factor infusions or who have an autoantibody such as a lupus anticoagulant or an acquired factor inhibitor. Mixing studies that do not show correction of a prolonged aPTT suggest an alternative diagnosis such as an acquired factor inhibitor.

Mixing studies for the aPTT assay are performed if the aPTT is prolonged. If mixing studies show correction, consistent with a factor deficiency rather than an inhibitor, factor activity levels are then measured (see <a class="local">'Factor activity levels'</a> below).

Normal ranges for activity are determined from reference plasma. The normal range is generally considered to be from approximately 55 percent to 150 percent of the normal value; this range may also depend on the laboratory performing the testing and the age of the patient. A factor activity level of 100 percent corresponds to 1 IU/mL. Chromogenic assays, in which the readout is based on release of a colored product, are increasingly being used; these assays have less variability and measure the activity of the specific factor rather than the entire coagulation cascade.</p><p>Some assays are performed as automated, one-stage assays that compare coagulation time of patient plasma to reference plasmas (normal and factor-deficient), using serial dilution to determine the factor activity level. Less commonly, a two-stage aPTT-based assay is used. In the first step of a two-stage assay, patient plasma is depleted of some factors (II, VII, IX, and X), and then factors are added that allow coagulation to progress to the formation of factor Xa but not further  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90873" href="/z/d/graphic/90873.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). In the second step, normal plasma is added to allow coagulation to progress to clot formation. The coagulation time can be measured by release of a chromogenic end product or by optical density [<a href="#rid85">85</a>]. Two-stage methods are more difficult to perform but are less subject to other variables (eg, variation in the levels of other coagulation factors, presence of a lupus anticoagulant) [<a href="#rid86">86,87</a>]. Two-stage and chromogenic assays are more sensitive for identifying mild hemophilia. Highly specific assays using immunoradiometric methods and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent techniques (ELISA) also have been developed [<a href="#rid88">88</a>].</p><p>Two-stage and chromogenic assays are especially useful for patients with borderline values. Several reports have described hemophilia mutations for which a two-stage assay demonstrated lower factor activity than a one-stage assay; a hemophilia diagnosis may have been missed if only the one-stage method had been used [<a href="#rid86">86,87,89,90</a>].</p><p>Some forms of von Willebrand disease (VWD; type 2N or 3) have decreased factor VIII activity levels because von Willebrand factor (VWF) stabilizes circulating factor VIII. All patients with reduced factor VIII activity levels should have testing for VWF antigen (VWF:Ag) to eliminate the possibility of type 3 VWD. To evaluate for Type 2N VWD, a factor VIII/von Willebrand factor binding assay can be performed.

Cord blood testing is preferred if possible to avoid the risk of bleeding with venipuncture [<a href="#rid110">110</a>]. Cord blood is tested for factor activity level of the appropriate factor. Values must be compared with age-appropriate normal ranges because healthy newborns have lower levels of factor IX than older children. Results of cord blood testing may not be accurate in newborns with mild hemophilia, and it is prudent in later infancy to retest those who appear to be unaffected when tested as a newborn.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H91041047"><span class="h1">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The differential diagnosis of hemophilia includes other inherited bleeding disorders and other causes of an isolated prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Usually these conditions can be readily differentiated by measurement of the appropriate factor level.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>von Willebrand disease</strong> – Like hemophilia, von Willebrand disease (VWD) is an inherited bleeding disorder that may be associated with a normal or prolonged aPTT; some patients with VWD will also have reductions in factor VIII levels. Unlike hemophilia, VWD transmission is autosomal. Thus, VWD is equally common in male and female patients, and disease severity is similar in both sexes. Most types of VWD present with a different bleeding pattern from hemophilia (eg, mucosal bleeding seen in VWD; joint bleeding seen in hemophilia)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77834" href="/z/d/graphic/77834.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). However, some types of VWD (eg, type 2N, type 3) have bleeding patterns similar to hemophilia. Details of diagnostic testing to differentiate VWD from hemophilia are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1307.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of von Willebrand disease", section on 'Laboratory testing'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inherited platelet disorders</strong> – A variety of inherited platelet disorders can cause clinical bleeding symptoms. Like hemophilia, some of these may be associated with normal platelet counts. Unlike hemophilia, inherited platelet disorders should have normal coagulation testing, and most of these disorders are autosomal rather than X-linked. Inherited platelet disorders may be characterized by thrombocytopenia, abnormal platelet function, and/or abnormal platelet morphology  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89962" href="/z/d/graphic/89962.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5921.html" rel="external">"Causes of thrombocytopenia in children", section on 'Inherited platelet disorders'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6675.html" rel="external">"Inherited platelet function disorders (IPFDs)", section on 'Specific disorders'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Factor XI deficiency</strong> – Factor XI deficiency (also called Rosenthal syndrome; hemophilia C) is an inherited bleeding disorder. Like hemophilia A and B, factor XI deficiency is characterized by a prolonged aPTT. Unlike hemophilia A and B, patients with factor XI deficiency tend to exhibit provoked bleeding (eg, bleeding in response to trauma) rather than spontaneous bleeding. Factor XI deficiency is more prevalent in Ashkenazi Jews (Jews from Eastern Europe). Diagnostic testing for factor XI deficiency will reveal low factor XI levels and normal factor VIII and factor IX levels. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1333.html" rel="external">"Factor XI (eleven) deficiency"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Factor XIII deficiency</strong> – Factor XIII is involved in stabilizing the fibrin clot and protecting it from fibrinolysis. Factor XIII deficiency is an inherited bleeding disorder that can produce severe bleeding in homozygotes or compound heterozygotes, and milder bleeding in heterozygotes. Like hemophilia, factor XIII deficiency can present with intracranial hemorrhage around the time of birth or bleeding associated with umbilical cord separation. Unlike hemophilia, the typical presentation is delayed bleeding after initial hemostasis; impaired wound healing and pregnancy loss may also be seen. Unlike hemophilia, factor XIII deficiency is characterized by a normal aPTT and PT, and normal activity levels of factor VIII, IX, and XI. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1336.html" rel="external">"Rare inherited coagulation disorders", section on 'Factor XIII deficiency (F13D)'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other factor deficiencies with prolonged aPTT</strong> – Other inherited conditions such as deficiencies of factor XII, prekallikrein, or high molecular weight kininogen can cause an isolated prolongation of the aPTT, with a normal prothrombin time (PT). Unlike hemophilia, these deficiencies are not associated with clinical bleeding. Diagnostic testing will reveal the specific deficiency, with normal factor VIII, IX, and XI levels. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1336.html" rel="external">"Rare inherited coagulation disorders"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Very rarely, a patient may have combined factor VIII and factor V deficiency due to a variant in a gene affecting cellular transport rather than in a coagulation factor gene. Unlike hemophilia, however, these patients will have a prolonged PT as well as aPTT. Finding of prolonged PT and aPTT or if the inheritance pattern includes females or multiple male and female siblings, should prompt additional testing such as mixing studies for the PT test and specific factor assays if coagulation testing shows correction with mixing studies. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1336.html" rel="external">"Rare inherited coagulation disorders", section on 'Factor V and VIII combined deficiency (F5F8D)'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acquired factor inhibitors (acquired hemophilia)</strong> – Acquired inhibitors are autoantibodies that can interfere with the normal activity of coagulation factors. Inhibitors to factor VIII, XIII, and other factors have been reported; these can develop during pregnancy or in patients with an underlying systemic disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, malignancy, or a drug reaction. Acquired inhibitors during pregnancy can cross the placenta and impair hemostasis in the fetus or neonate. Like hemophilia, acquired inhibitors may present with bleeding and a prolonged aPTT. Unlike hemophilia, acquired inhibitors most commonly present in adulthood, and mixing studies fail to show correction of the aPTT when patient plasma is mixed with control plasma because the inhibitory antibody is present in excess. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1305.html" rel="external">"Acquired hemophilia A (and other acquired coagulation factor inhibitors)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1368.html" rel="external">"Clinical use of coagulation tests", section on 'Use of mixing studies'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is due to an acquired autoantibody that prolongs the aPTT in vitro, but clinically manifests as a prothrombotic state rather than impaired hemostasis. Patients with APS may have thromboembolism and/or recurrent pregnancy loss. Rarely, APS may be associated with prolongation of the PT and acquired prothrombin deficiency. Unlike hemophilia, the prolonged aPTT in APS does not show correction when patient plasma is mixed with control plasma; additional laboratory findings of APS are presented separately.

Severity depends largely on the factor activity level, with severe disease defined as &lt;1 percent of normal; moderate disease as 1 to 5 percent, and mild disease as &gt;5 percent. (See <a class="local">'Definitions'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1311.html" rel="external">"Genetics of hemophilia A and B"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Presentation </strong>– Severe hemophilia causes spontaneous bleeding and bleeding after minor trauma out of proportion to the degree of injury, which can begin as early as birth. Delayed bleeding after trauma is common. In contrast, mild hemophilia may only become apparent when there is significant trauma or surgery. (See <a class="local">'Initial presentation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Most infants with severe hemophilia present within the first year to one and a half years with bruising, hemarthrosis, or bleeding after oral injury or a procedure. Life-threatening bleeding can occur at delivery, with trauma, or spontaneously. Approximately 3 to 5 percent of infants with severe hemophilia develop subgaleal or intracerebral hemorrhage perinatally. (See <a class="local">'Age at first bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Once children are mobile (crawling, walking), joint and other musculoskeletal bleeding, frenulum and oral injuries, and forehead hematomas become more common. (See <a class="local">'Initial site of bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bleeding sites</strong> – Common sites of bleeding include joints and soft tissues, muscles, oral mucosa, and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). ICH is rare compared with other sites, but it is one of the most dangerous and life-threatening events. Hemarthrosis is the most common site for bleeding in ambulatory patients. (See <a class="local">'Sites of bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complications</strong> – Late complications include neurologic sequelae of ICH and joint destruction from repetitive hemarthroses (hemophilic arthropathy). Complications of treatment include the potential for infection, which has declined dramatically since the mid-1980s and is extremely low, and development of antibodies to the infused factor. (See <a class="local">'Late complications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Female heterozygotes</strong> – Female carriers are heterozygotes and are expected to have approximately 50 percent of normal factor, which is generally sufficient to prevent bleeding. Some females have symptoms similar to males with mild hemophilia. Potential carriers should be tested using genetic testing. If carrier status is confirmed, measurement of factor levels is appropriate to guide management during hemostatic challenges. (See <a class="local">'Bleeding in females/carriers'</a> above and <a class="local">'Carrier detection'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – The evaluation begins with the personal and family bleeding history; approximately one-third of patients with hemophilia have a de novo mutation and negative family history. Laboratory testing includes coagulation tests, factor activity levels, and/or genetic testing. In individuals with reduced factor VIII activity, von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag) should be tested to exclude von Willebrand disease. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis </strong>– Confirm the factor activity level is &lt;40 percent (&lt;0.40 international units [IU]/mL) or document a pathogenic variant in a hemophilia gene (<em>F8</em> or <em>F9</em>). Individuals with factor levels ≥40 percent who carry a familial hemophilia variant can also be diagnosed with hemophilia. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prenatal diagnosis </strong>– Carriers who become pregnant should undergo fetal sex determination by ultrasound. Confirmatory testing is generally performed in male children at birth, on cord blood. Circumcision should be deferred until the diagnosis is confirmed or excluded. Maternal factor levels should be determined prior to invasive procedures including neuraxial anesthesia. Maternal and fetal risks of vaginal versus Cesarean delivery should be discussed. (See <a class="local">'Carrier detection'</a> above and <a class="local">'Obstetric considerations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong> – The differential diagnosis of hemophilia includes other inherited bleeding disorders (eg, VWD, platelet disorders, other factor deficiencies) and acquired coagulation factor inhibitors.
