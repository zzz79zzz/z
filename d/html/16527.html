Successful reconstruction restores both the function and appearance of the affected limb by replacing lost tissue. Microsurgery, which makes tissue transplants and tendon, muscle, and nerve transfers possible, is an important component of upper extremity reconstructive surgery. Tissue flaps are often used to provide coverage for soft tissue defects, and various types of implants and prosthetic devices can aid in these reconstructive efforts. </p><p>The principles of surgical reconstruction of the upper extremities are reviewed. In some severe cases, reconstruction will not restore the function of the affected extremities. Regardless of whether the limiting factor is the size of the injury or the overall health of the patient, primary amputation may be the best treatment. Amputation should not be regarded as a loss or failure to treat an injury. The determination of whether upper extremity reconstruction or completion amputation is more appropriate is reviewed separately. Other aspects of management of upper extremity trauma, including upper extremity amputation, and upper extremity fasciotomy are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15235.html" rel="external">"Severe upper extremity injury in the adult patient"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/120669.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of severe upper extremity injury", section on 'Limb salvage versus amputation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15224.html" rel="external">"Upper extremity amputation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/114658.html" rel="external">"Upper extremity fasciotomy techniques"</a>.)</p><p>Severe lower extremity injury and reconstruction are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15150.html" rel="external">"Severe lower extremity injury in the adult patient"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16732.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of severe lower extremity injury"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16695.html" rel="external">"Lower extremity amputation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15205.html" rel="external">"Lower extremity fasciotomy techniques"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15121.html" rel="external">"Surgical reconstruction of the lower extremity"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2726324177"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Traumatic injuries</strong> – Traumatic injuries include open fractures, multiple tendon injuries, vascular injuries, crush injuries, traumatic amputations, and severe nerve injuries, including peripheral nerve and spinal cord injuries. Injuries, such as open fractures with large skin defects, usually require multiple combined surgical procedures. In the acute trauma phase, the initial focus is on hemostasis. The goal is to restore blood flow to limit the duration of ischemia and potential tissue loss. At times, a temporary shunt may be necessary to facilitate temporary fracture fixation before vascular repair can commence. Subsequently, ischemic or necrotic tissue will require debridement, sometimes serial debridement, before the reconstruction can take place. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15235.html" rel="external">"Severe upper extremity injury in the adult patient", section on 'Initial evaluation and management'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/120669.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of severe upper extremity injury"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Infection</strong> – Antibiotics, incision and drainage, and debridement are the mainstay of treatment for upper extremity infection. In cases of severe infection, multiple sequential debridement procedures may be required. Reconstructive surgery is performed after the remission of infection to aid functional recovery of the damaged limb. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15117.html" rel="external">"Overview of hand infections"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7662.html" rel="external">"Necrotizing soft tissue infections"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/108059.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of necrotizing soft tissue infections"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Degenerative disease</strong> – Degenerative diseases are mainly caused by repetitive stress and aging. One orthopedic degenerative disorder that affects the upper extremities is osteoarthritis, for which various reconstructive surgeries are performed, such as joint replacement. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For degenerative diseases that affect the central nervous system, such as spastic paralysis, arthrodesis or tendon transfers of the upper extremity can be performed. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Autoimmune disease</strong> – Autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, also have a destructive effect on joints. Advances in disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologics have increased remission rates and reduced joint destruction. In cases with residual deformities or pain, or for destroyed joints, patients may undergo reconstructive surgery. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7516.html" rel="external">"General principles and overview of management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7478.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of end-stage rheumatoid arthritis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4673.html" rel="external">"Arthritis and other musculoskeletal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Tendon ruptures, caused by inflammation, or joint destruction affecting the site of tendon attachment can be treated with tendon transfers. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Malignant tumor</strong> – Surgical treatment of a malignant tumor (mostly sarcoma) includes radical resection and reconstruction of the defect  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116976" href="/d/graphic/116976.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). The most common treatment is covering the defect with a skin graft or flap. However, if the tumor is extensive and involves the brachial plexus and proximal vessels (subclavian, axillary), the required excision surpasses reconstructive abilities and amputation is necessary. The amputation rate following resection of upper extremity tumors is less than 20 to 30 percent [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Survival rates for reconstruction versus amputation are not significantly different [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/109748.html" rel="external">"Surgical resection of primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15224.html" rel="external">"Upper extremity amputation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Congenital disease</strong> – In cases of reconstruction for congenital disease, surgeons must consider how the defect will affect the child's development [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Timing of the surgery is largely according to the normal developmental progress. As examples: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Reconstruction of polydactyly is usually performed when a child is around two years old, corresponding to the development of a pinch grip. Oftentimes, children will require more than one reconstructive surgery. The deformity most commonly operated on is a Wassel type IV polydactyly with a duplicated proximal phalanx  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116977" href="/d/graphic/116977.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). For this type of polydactyly, the redundant thumb is resected but the metacarpophalangeal joint of the residual thumb is reconstructed. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Severe limb defects, such as congenital limb shortening or achondroplasia, can be treated with a lengthening operation. Such treatment improves posture and arm extension. Lengthening is performed over a span of several months, with the affected limb, including bones, vessels, and nerves, gradually extended.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H558909075"><span class="h1">GOALS AND INFORMED CONSENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Before proceeding with reconstructive surgery, realistic goals must be set. In most cases, the available tissues for reconstruction will be limited, and, thus, a return to a normal state will not be feasible, which needs to be conveyed to the patient. Expectations for recovery should also be discussed to avoid disappointment, particularly if there are any anticipated residual aesthetic or functional deficits. </p><p>While it is always desirable to avoid multiple surgeries, some situations will require multiple operations because of the nature of the operation, the patient's age, or the extent of the patient's injury or defect [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. For the upper extremity, one study found that the average number of reconstructive surgeries performed per patient was three [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Older patients are likely to have longer recovery periods [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. </p><p>Unexpected problems can be encountered during any surgery, and the surgeon must have alternative plans to accommodate for them. It is important that the patient is informed beforehand about all possible treatment paths. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1929694042"><span class="h1">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION AND PREPARATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The surgeon must estimate the extent of required resection and plan reconstructive steps after thorough clinical evaluation including history and physical examination and preoperative imaging, which may include radiographs or computed tomography of the extremity. Evaluation and preparation and medical risk assessment varies depending upon the specific indication for upper extremity reconstruction. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Upper extremity trauma (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15235.html" rel="external">"Severe upper extremity injury in the adult patient", section on 'Initial evaluation and management'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15235.html" rel="external">"Severe upper extremity injury in the adult patient", section on 'Management approach'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Degenerative or rheumatic disease (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1826.html" rel="external">"Preoperative evaluation and perioperative management of patients with rheumatic diseases"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6616.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Malignancy (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2793.html" rel="external">"Preoperative evaluation and management of patients with cancer"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Congenital problems (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/106984.html" rel="external">"General anesthesia in neonates and children: Agents and techniques", section on 'Patient and parent or caregiver preparation for anesthesia'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H641935139"><span class="h1">BONE STABILIZATION AND RECONSTRUCTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Stabilization of the bone structure constitutes the foundation of reconstruction surgery of the extremity. Simple fractures can be easily stabilized by performing osteosynthesis. Bone defects and avascular bone fragments are often seen in severe injury and can cause nonunion of the fracture and osteomyelitis. For the success of the bone reconstruction, the surgeon should preserve vascularized bone fragments, aggressively debride avascular or contaminated fragments, and compensate for bone defects by grafting.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2928831234"><span class="h2">Fracture stabilization</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If necessary, the bones and joints must be stabilized before reconstructing other tissues  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef119933" href="/d/graphic/119933.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). The stability of a joint can be determined by observing the joint during active motion. The evaluation of any affected joints should include an examination for injuries to the cartilage or ligaments, as well as joint instability and movement-induced pain. </p><p>The principal goal of fracture stabilization is to permit early active and passive range of motion exercises to prevent tendinous adhesions and joint contractures. External fixation devices, plates, intramedullary nails, Kirschner wires, and soft wires are used to stabilize fractures. External fixation is mostly used as a temporary measure. </p><p>Secure unification of bone fragments leads to stabilization of a fracture. Precise alignment, leaving no gaps between the fragments, is essential for effective healing. If there is a gap, scar tissue will form, which hinders bone healing, ultimately leading to a nonunion. Bone defects are managed with grafting. (See <a class="local">'Bone grafting'</a> below.)</p><p>The basic principles of management of specific upper extremity fractures are provided separately (predominantly for individual, closed fractures). </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>As long as the displacement of the fragments of the fracture is small or manually reducible, most isolated proximal and midshaft humeral fractures can be treated with a cast. However, with the reconstruction of multiple injuries, these fractures are treated with fracture stabilization procedures that include intramedullary nails and locking plates. On the other hand, distal humeral fractures are usually treated with locking plates regardless of the degree of displacement since the fracture site is vulnerable to shear force, and nonsurgical treatment for the fracture can result in nonunion. Surgical stabilization enables the patient to mobilize the elbow early, preventing nonunion and joint contracture of the elbow joint. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/217.html" rel="external">"Proximal humeral fractures in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/221.html" rel="external">"Midshaft humerus fractures in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Long-term casting (more than three weeks) can cause contracture of the forearm and the elbow. Therefore, forearm fractures should be stabilized with surgical treatment, with the exception of stable or non-displaced fractures. Locking or non-locking plates are mainly used for the stabilization of the fracture. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/210.html" rel="external">"Radial head and neck fractures in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/98726.html" rel="external">"Midshaft ulna and radius fractures in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/219.html" rel="external">"Distal radius fractures in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the hand, plates are used with caution for the stabilization of phalangeal fractures because they can cause tendinous adhesions. Stabilization with wires or screws is preferred [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15114.html" rel="external">"Overview of finger, hand, and wrist fractures"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/256.html" rel="external">"Overview of metacarpal fractures"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/196.html" rel="external">"Overview of carpal fractures"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2462829315"><span class="h2">Closing bony gaps</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2695558164"><span class="h3">Bone grafting</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bone grafting is the most commonly used procedure to close gaps between bone fragments [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Several types of bone grafts are available, including autologous grafts (or autografts), allogenic graft, and synthetic grafts. All bone grafts are used to serve as a scaffold to fill gaps with new bone growth, a process referred to as osteo<strong>con</strong>duction. In addition, autografts and allografts trigger osteo<strong>in</strong>duction, which is the formation of new bone through the differentiation of osteoprogenitors into osteoblasts. Autografts are the most commonly used bone graft for their osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. </p><p>Autografts include nonvascularized (or free) and vascularized bone grafts. With nonvascularized bone grafting, the surgeon harvests only the bone, whereas with vascularized bone grafting, the bone is harvested along with the artery and vein, which are anastomosed with the arteries and veins in the recipient site. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nonvascularized grafts for upper extremity reconstruction are mainly harvested from the anterior iliac crest, the distal radius, or the proximal ulna. A relatively large amount of bone can be collected from the posterior iliac crest, but this requires an intraoperative change of the patient's position. Nonvascularized bone grafting is performed by placing the cancellous bone and cortical bone in the gap between the fragments. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A large vascularized autograft is used for defects of 6 cm or more and can be harvested from the fibula, the lateral border of the scapula or the iliac crest  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116979" href="/d/graphic/116979.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>) [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H241218867"><span class="h3">Bone shortening</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bone shortening is another method that can be used to close gaps for many upper arm and forearm fractures [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. However, excessive shortening can result in weak muscles because the muscles are longer relative to the bone. The maximal length of bone shortening of the upper arm reported in the literature ranges between 4 and 5 cm [<a href="#rid13">13-16</a>]. </p><p>Ideally, defects in forearm bone should be compensated by the bone grafting, rather than shortening. Inappropriate shortening can easily decrease in the length of the lever arm and limit range of motion and strength; thus, shortening should be performed judiciously. Shortening less than one centimeter may not affect forearm rotation, but surgeons cannot preoperatively estimate the range of forearm rotation that will occur after the shortening. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3376720781"><span class="h2">Open fractures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Open fractures are more difficult to treat and have limited functional results compared with closed fractures because of the increased risk for nonunion, deformity, and infection [<a href="#rid17">17-19</a>]. Definitive fixation and defect coverage with a soft tissue flap, or the "fix and flap approach," is aggressively performed for open fractures in the upper extremity [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. This approach facilitates fracture repair and helps prevent nonunion with the vasculature provided by the flap. (See <a class="local">'Soft tissue coverage'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2502843203"><span class="h2">Repair of nonunions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The treatment of nonunion depends on how the initial injury occurred  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116978" href="/d/graphic/116978.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). Causes of nonunion include inadequate fixation of bone fragments, poor bone healing, or a combination of both. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypertrophic nonunion – Hypertrophic nonunion is due to inappropriate fixation. Radiography of this type of nonunion shows a hyperplastic callus. Hypertrophic nonunions can be treated adequately with internal fixation fortified with extra plating or exchanging an existing intramedullary nail with a thicker one. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Oligotrophic nonunion – Oligotrophic nonunion (or atrophic nonunion) is due to poor bone healing. Imaging shows atrophy of bony structures around the injury site [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. The healing of the fracture ultimately ceases because the surrounding soft tissue fills in the gaps between the bone fragments, disrupting fracture union.

Although the Ilizarov technique is commonly used for lower extremity injuries, it is being applied to upper extremity injuries such as nonunions, various deformities from trauma or infection, and malformations from congenital diseases and benign bone tumors [<a href="#rid21">21-24</a>]. It is usually difficult to make subtle adjustments with an Ilizarov fixator. Thus, Taylor Spatial Frames (TSFs) have been developed, which use computerized calculations to assist in a more refined and precise extension of the upper extremity [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Moreover, TSF is often used for the bone transplantation, which can fill a massive bone defect without a vascularized bone graft  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116980" href="/d/graphic/116980.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2394610146"><span class="h3">Masquelet technique</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Masquelet technique is a length-independent technique that is used for bone reconstruction following osteomyelitis.

With this technique, coverage with the vascularized flap promotes the consolidation of the nonvascularized cancellous bone autograft by induction of the periosteal membrane [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. </p><p>This two-stage procedure is usually performed on the lower extremities but has been adapted for the upper extremities. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the first stage, infection is cleared with debridement until bleeding occurs from the bone marrow, and the bone is stabilized via external or internal fixation.

These spacers induce a membrane made of a type 1 collagen-rich matrix containing fibroblasts at the site of the bone defect. The membrane contains osteogenic factors that promote bone ingrowth and osteoinduction [<a href="#rid27">27-29</a>].

Joint reconstruction procedures are categorized into reconstruction of the defective tissues, joint transplants, and arthrodesis. The procedures selected are based on the affected joint and the amount of tissue loss. As an example, an elbow injury with a small osteochondral and skin defect may be repaired by combining an osteochondral transplant with a flap.

Therefore, nerve reconstruction should ideally be performed within three to six months after the injury. If more than approximately one year has passed since the injury, an irreversible degeneration of the neuromuscular junction may have occurred. Even with nerve repair or neuron transfer, it will no longer be possible to reproduce muscle contractions.

The suturing of severed nerves is an intricate procedure that is usually done under a microscope for delicate examination. With this process, the stumps must be connected with appropriate tension; too much tension inhibits the recovery of conduction and can cause the nerve to re-rupture. The technique involves connecting individual bundles of axons within the nerve.

Because allogeneic nerve transplantation requires immunosuppression for up to two years, these are much less common. </p><p>Vascularized nerve grafts can be used for defects of 10 cm or more in length [<a href="#rid58">58</a>]. Ischemia of the graft, which causes central necrosis and intraluminal fibrosis, can be avoided using vascularized nerve grafts, which maintain blood supply through the anastomosed vascular pedicle during transplantation.

Nerve transfers are performed when the site of nerve injury is located far from the neuromuscular junction of the muscle. Some examples of this type of injury are high ulnar nerve, brachial plexus, and spinal cord injuries [<a href="#rid61">61</a>]. </p><p>Typically, nerve transfer is performed by suturing the distal stump of the donor nerve to the proximal stump of a paralyzed recipient nerve in an end-to-end fashion. Other times, suturing end-to-side is performed while preserving the continuity of the recipient nerve. Commonly referred to as a supercharged nerve transfer or supercharged end-to-side transfer (SETS), the donor nerve facilitates the growth of the recipient's regenerated axons. SETS can be combined with the repair of the damaged area by nerve suture or neurolysis. Once the repair of the original site of the injured nerve regenerates, it leads to "dual innervation" with the nerve sutured for supercharge.</p><p>Donor nerves are usually chosen from the nerves that produce a similar motion as the injured nerve upon innervation [<a href="#rid62">62</a>]. However, this is not mandatory, because the patient can acquire control of the muscle reinnervated gradually through postoperative biofeedback training. The donor nerve should be selected from one that is located near the recipient nerve because recovery is accelerated if the attachment site is close to the recipient nerve's neuromuscular junction. Also, the sacrifice of the muscle that the donor nerve innervates should be minimized.</p><p>There are a few common nerve transfers for the upper extremity:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The motor branch of the ulnar nerve can be transferred to the musculocutaneous nerve to restore elbow flexion.

High ulnar nerve injuries, including severe cubital tunnel syndrome (ie, entrapment neuropathy of the ulnar nerve), require a longer time for the axons to reinnervate the intrinsic muscles because of the long distance between the injury site and the neuromuscular junction. AIN can be transferred to the ulnar nerve to augment the regeneration of the axons and reinnervation of the muscles before the nerve axons degenerate. AIN transfers to the ulnar nerve are performed with end-to-end sutures or SETS transfers.

In one prospective study of the nerve transfer for the spinal cord injury, functional results of patients who received nerve transfers were comparable to those who received tendon transfers [<a href="#rid61">61</a>].

Ideally, the patient will be able to produce motion soon after the operation, while preventing tendon adhesion to the surrounding connective tissue. Flexor tendon adhesions are problematic because they impede the flexing power and range of motion of the fingers. Adhesions are more likely to occur in the zone extending from the distal palmar crease to the middle phalanx (zone 2), where the tendon passes between pulleys [<a href="#rid70">70</a>]. Furthermore, if the tendon injury is accompanied with fracture or skin damage, the risk of postoperative tendon adhesion will increase. </p><p>Injuries that involve functional deficits of both the flexor and extensor tendons of the forearm are treated with multistage surgery; extensor tendons are repaired only after the flexor tendons have recovered in strength and function. It is difficult to perform postoperative rehabilitation of the flexor and extensor tendons simultaneously.

The graft is usually harvested from the palmaris longus tendon. </p><p>Reconstruction of the extensor tendons is usually with primary tendon grafting. Primary grafting connects the graft and the stump of the tendon with interwoven sutures, which provide sufficient strength to allow for early exercise. The extensor tendons are normally pulled to the digital bones by the interosseous muscles and ligaments such as the oblique retinacular ligament. In addition, the extensor retinaculum in the wrist joint widely presses the tendons to the volar side. Because all of these structures are usually not injured at the same time, reconstruction of the tendon sheath is rarely necessary. The distal stump and the graft are sutured together first, followed by the suturing of the proximal stump and graft. Suture tension is adjusted as needed during the procedure. Ultimately, the overall outcome of the procedure can be tested by observing the passive motion of the tendon. Primary grafting should not be used in cases involving extensive tendon adhesions, failure of primary repair, or underlying fractures and severe skin damage. </p><p>Reconstruction of flexor tendons depends on the condition of the patient's tendon sheath. If the tendon sheath is intact, primary repair can be performed. But without tendon sheaths, the fingers cannot fully flex.

Depending upon the size of the artery to be reconstructed, a vein graft can be harvested from the saphenous vein, cephalic vein, or the dorsal veins of the hand  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116984" href="/d/graphic/116984.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>). The radial artery may also be available for vascular grafting, but it is rarely needed. </p><p>Arterial defects with a concurrent soft tissue defect can be reconstructed with a "flow-through flap" [<a href="#rid76">76</a>]. Moreover, bone shortening described previously can substitute for bone grafting. As an example, extremity replantation, which involves arterial reconstruction, is usually performed with bone shortening. </p><p>Most extremity venous injuries can be treated with ligation, but the major deep veins should be repaired to prevent extremity edema distal to the injured site. Veins should also be reconstructed in degloving injuries to prevent venous decongestion in the flap.</p><p>Compartment syndrome should be monitored after arterial reconstruction to the ischemic limb. Reperfusion exacerbates the edema with the production of free radicals, which is a cause of compartment syndrome. A reperfused limb with ischemia for more than three hours should undergo a prophylactic fasciotomy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/358.html" rel="external">"Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/114658.html" rel="external">"Upper extremity fasciotomy techniques"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1503089563"><span class="h1">SOFT TISSUE COVERAGE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Appropriate coverage of the bone or joint with soft tissue is one of the most important steps in reconstructive surgery [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3333559227"><span class="h2">Timing of soft tissue coverage</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Wound coverage facilitates healing of the reconstructed structure with sufficient blood supply, allowing the patient to begin physiotherapy. However, wound coverage is generally performed once the wound bed is clean and well prepared, which may require several rounds of debridement. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15912.html" rel="external">"Basic principles of wound management", section on 'Wound debridement'</a>.)</p><p>With traumatic wounds, some authors have reported the superiority of early free flap coverage [<a href="#rid34">34,77</a>]. Alongside early free flap coverage, internal fixation is also performed for many open fractures with skin defects. This technique is referred to as the "fix and flap approach" [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. When it is possible, it is the most rational treatment. However, there are only a limited number of hospitals that have the technology and skills to use this technique. (See <a class="local">'Bone stabilization and reconstruction'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1095911439"><span class="h2">Grafts and flaps for reconstruction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Wound coverage uses a variety of methods that include simple wound closure, skin grafting, and various flaps. The selection is based on the concept of the "reconstructive elevator," which states that the most necessary and sufficient procedure should be selected according to the site and condition of the injury [<a href="#rid78">78,79</a>]. The different characteristics of skin grafts and flaps must be taken into consideration throughout the selection process. Between grafts and flaps, the biggest difference is vasculature. However, aside from vasculature and skin type, flaps are further classified according to the type of soft tissue. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15118.html" rel="external">"Skin autografting"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/114188.html" rel="external">"Overview of flaps for soft tissue reconstruction"</a>.)</p><p>Skin grafts cannot cover poorly vascularized tissues, such as exposed cortical bone, because they cannot provide sufficient capillary ingrowth. In addition, skin grafts are not usually used for coverage near joints or exposed tendons. The scar formed during engraftment causes dermal contractures and tendon adhesions, which decrease the range of joint motion. </p><p>Flaps for upper extremity reconstruction are selected based upon the size, appearance, and condition around the skin defect. The volume of the selected flap must match that of the recipient site for optimal functional and cosmetic aspects [<a href="#rid80">80</a>]. An excessively bulky flap hinders appearance and interferes with range of motion. One flap that is commonly used for forearm and hand reconstructions is an anterolateral thigh flap, which is harvested as a thin flap [<a href="#rid81">81</a>]. Several perforator flaps have also been used [<a href="#rid82">82,83</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4134422948"><span class="h3">Large defects</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A pedicled groin flap is used as a distant flap for the reconstruction of large skin defects on the hands and fingers. This type of graft is harvested easily, with a width of 10 cm and a length of 20 cm, and can cover the defect without vascular anastomoses  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116987" href="/d/graphic/116987.html" rel="external">picture 7</a>) [<a href="#rid84">84</a>]. However, this type of flap requires a division of the flap and has the risk of elbow and shoulder stiffness. A groin flap harvested as a free flap does not have this challenge, but the variability of vascular anatomy makes harvesting the flap more difficult. </p><p>Other free flaps from various parts of the body can be used to cover large defects. Some of these include the latissimus dorsi muscle flap, anterolateral thigh flap, and the scapula flap (may be less difficult because of the limited anatomic variation). The latissimus dorsi muscle flap is helpful for reconstructing extensive skin defects on the upper extremity but usually requires additional skin grafting on the muscle flap. Some suggest that reconstruction with muscle flap and skin graft is inferior to a cutaneous flap in terms of cosmetic appearance [<a href="#rid85">85</a>]. Anterolateral thigh flaps are also useful given their similar slimness and appearance to the forearm. This procedure can be safely performed regardless of age or smoking status. When using the flap, the surgeon should take into account the wide variability in the anatomy of the flap's perforating arteries [<a href="#rid86">86</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2300095569"><span class="h3">Flaps for small defects in hand and forearm</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several regional flaps are available for forearm reconstruction. As described above, the traditional radial artery flap is reliable but can be aesthetically unappealing at the donor site [<a href="#rid87">87</a>]. Therefore, some surgeons prefer to use it as an adipofascial flap. </p><p>The posterior interosseous artery flap is used for reconstruction of the first web space because it can fill the defect with the appropriate amount of tissue while avoiding sacrifice of the radial and ulnar arteries [<a href="#rid88">88</a>]. </p><p>The radial artery and ulnar artery perforator flaps are used for skin defects of the dorsal hand. </p><p>A lateral upper arm flap supplied by the radial collateral artery can be harvested for forearm reconstruction. In addition, it can be used as a pedicle or free flap for the reconstruction of the skin around the elbow  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116977" href="/d/graphic/116977.html" rel="external">picture 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116981" href="/d/graphic/116981.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>) [<a href="#rid89">89</a>]. Some surgeons prefer this flap because of matching skin tone. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H726349469"><span class="h3">Thumb and finger defects</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Thumb and finger flaps are used to reconstruct amputations, or for defects following tumor resection. The tips of the thumb and fingers should be covered with a sufficient amount of soft and pain-free skin. Sensory perception is vital in the thumb and can be restored with a flap that contains a nerve [<a href="#rid90">90</a>]. </p><p>Volar advance and kite flaps supplied by the dorsal metacarpal artery are commonly used in thumb reconstruction. A volar advance flap, which includes a digital nerve in the pedicle, is used as an innervated flap. On the other hand, a kite flap, which does not usually contain a nerve within the pedicle, can be used as an innervated flap by suturing the dorsal branch of the radial nerve included in the flap to the residual stump of the volar digital nerve. </p><p>A neurovascular flap harvested from the ring finger with the ulnar digital artery and nerve is available as a regional innervated flap [<a href="#rid91">91</a>]. </p><p>For reconstruction of the fingertips, a reverse island flap, harvested from the lateral proximal region of the finger, or oblique triangular flap is used [<a href="#rid92">92</a>]. </p><p>Cross-finger flaps or dorsal metacarpal artery flaps are used as regional flaps. A cross-finger flap is harvested from the adjacent finger. With this technique, the donor and recipient fingers remain attached by the flap while the capillary network is established. The two fingers are separated after approximately two weeks. </p><p>For volar or dorsal skin defects in the proximal and middle phalanx, a dorsal metacarpal artery flap is used  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116986" href="/d/graphic/116986.html" rel="external">picture 8</a>). </p><p>Composite tissue allografts from the toes are used to reconstruct multiple tissues simultaneously  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116988" href="/d/graphic/116988.html" rel="external">picture 9</a>). Toe transfer and wrap-around flaps can restore the tips, even maintaining the nail and perception of the toe [<a href="#rid93">93,94</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1171373947"><span class="h1">POSTOPERATIVE CARE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2444555183"><span class="h2">Wound care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>After any surgical procedure, wounds should be managed to avoid infection, which can be characterized by, but not limited to, swelling or redness. Drainage of any subcutaneous abscesses and debridement of any necrotic tissue are common ways to minimize postoperative infection. </p><p>In addition, surgeries that involved vascularized grafts or flaps must be monitored periodically to ensure a successful outcome [<a href="#rid95">95</a>]. Systemic anticoagulation is commonly used to prevent postoperative thrombosis. However, for patients with competing injuries (eg, brain trauma or severe injuries), anticoagulation may not be possible. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/114188.html" rel="external">"Overview of flaps for soft tissue reconstruction", section on 'Identifying vascular compromise'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3698322540"><span class="h2">Postoperative rehabilitation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Physiotherapy plays an important role in obtaining satisfactory results after surgical reconstruction of the upper extremity. While protecting the reconstructed extremity with splints, promoting joint motion or tendon excursion with early active and passive mobilization can prevent joint contractures and tissue edema. </p><p>The surgeon, rehabilitation staff, and patient must cooperate to ensure a successful healing process. Based on intraoperative and postoperative observations, the surgeon must thoroughly communicate the plan and goals of rehabilitation with the occupational therapist or physical therapist. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1174543211"><span class="h1">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Complications after reconstructive surgery include deep infections, flap necrosis, tendon adhesions, joint contractures, pseudoarthrosis, chronic regional pain syndrome, and sensory disorders. The main complications that impair upper extremity reconstruction include adhesions and joint contracture. </p><p>Most tendon adhesions are avoidable with early implementation of postoperative rehabilitation. However, in cases with adhesion, tenolysis can restore the tendon excursion  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116981" href="/d/graphic/116981.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>). Surgeons should keep in mind that tenolysis in the immature stage in a reparative process of the tendon can cause rerupture of the affected tendon. Therefore, tenolysis should be done after no less than the four months after the primary reconstruction. Moreover, many surgeons prefer to postpone the tenolysis if the limb has been revascularized.</p><p>Most joint contractures can also be avoided with appropriate postoperative rehabilitation. Splinting in a functional position helps prevent contractures. Positions that should be avoided in the hand are flexion of the interphalangeal joints, extension of the metacarpophalangeal joints, and adduction of the thumb. When joint contractures do occur, they are treated with capsulotomy and partial resection of the tensioned ligament at the joint, but the restoration after these interventions is limited, and recurrent contracture often occurs after the revision surgery.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H663128793"><span class="h1">OUTCOMES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although excellent treatment results have been reported for each reconstructive technique, many are based on retrospective reviews. The heterogeneity in patients' medical conditions has made it difficult to conduct prospective research to determine the usefulness of each treatment. However, even in such situations, comparative studies based on retrospective studies can serve as a guide for the reconstructive plan. </p><p>As an example, retrospective studies of traumatic major amputation have compared revision amputation and replantation, with several attempts at reconstructive surgeries [<a href="#rid96">96-98</a>]. In these cases, those who had several reconstructive surgeries after replantation had better outcomes and patient satisfaction compared with revision amputation and prosthesis [<a href="#rid96">96-98</a>]. These results may encourage the surgeons, in the face of a challenging upper extremity injury, to exert maximum efforts for limb salvage. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4227383551"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Successful reconstruction restores both the function and appearance of the affected limb by replacing lost tissue. Additional surgeries may be necessary. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above and <a class="local">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bone stabilization</strong> – Stabilization of the bone structure constitutes the foundation of extremity reconstruction. To reinforce fracture fixation, bone grafting or bone shortening may be necessary. Bone transport with the Ilizarov technique and the Masquelet procedure are options for large bony defects. (See <a class="local">'Bone stabilization and reconstruction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Joint reconstruction</strong> – Joint restoration is accomplished through several procedures, including ligament reconstruction with a graft and cartilage reconstruction with osteochondral grafts. Joint transplantation, prosthesis placement, and arthrodesis are also used for joint restoration. (See <a class="local">'Joint reconstruction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nerve, muscle, and tendon reconstruction</strong> – Nerves, muscles, and tendons are approached as an integrated neuromuscular unit during the reconstructive process.
