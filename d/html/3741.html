         The goals of the initial evaluation of an adult with HIV are to assess the stage of HIV disease, determine the risk for other infections, identify comorbidities that are associated with HIV infection or relevant to its treatment, and select an antiretroviral regimen. In addition, the initial evaluation is an important time to establish the patient-practitioner relationship and educate the patient about the natural history and management of HIV infection.

         </span>
         A comprehensive medical history should be performed during the initial visits with a patient with HIV. This should include an assessment of the duration and stage of HIV infection, the presence of comorbidities that might affect prognosis and the choice of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and the presence of epidemiologic factors that increase the risk of HIV transmission and acquisition of other infections. The evaluation should also assess the patient's understanding of his or her illness and issues of transmission. For patients who have already been in HIV care, a detailed assessment of any prior treatment is essential. In a newly diagnosed patient, assessment should also include review of the patient's emotional state and available social supports. Involvement of a specialized social worker (HIV case manager) may be useful in this setting.
        </p>
        <p>
         For newly diagnosed patients or those re-engaging in care, there has been an emphasis on rapid initiation of ART at the initial visit. To allow for this, certain parts of the history may need to be deferred to a subsequent visit. A more detailed discussion of when to initiate ART is presented elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3777.html" rel="external">
          "When to initiate antiretroviral therapy in persons with HIV", section on 'Timing of treatment'

         In patients who have previously received ART, a thorough treatment history, including all prior regimens, CD4 count and viral load responses, and significant side effects and/or long-term toxicities, is important for future treatment considerations. Medical records are often required to confirm treatment histories and to document prior drug resistance testing as well as virologic and immunologic responses to therapy. Patients with newly diagnosed HIV infection should also be asked about any prior use of antiretroviral drugs for prevention. (See

          Viral hepatitis
         </strong>
         – Coinfections with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) are common in individuals with HIV given the shared routes of transmission. Liver disease tends to progress more rapidly in HIV/HBV- and HIV/HCV-coinfected patients compared with those with HCV or HBV infection alone [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Patients with chronic HBV should be on a tenofovir-containing regimen [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-7
         </a>
         ]. Intention to treat HCV also has implications for antiretroviral drug choice because of adverse drug-drug interactions with some regimens. Patient education regarding routes of acquisition of hepatitis B and C is also important. One study found that many patients who engaged in high-risk behaviors (traumatic sex or injection drug use) did not perceive themselves to be at risk for viral hepatitis [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8

          Cardiovascular risk factors/disease
         </strong>
         – The presence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia may influence the choice of ART, as some medications, especially protease inhibitors (PIs), may increase the likelihood of developing glucose intolerance and/or dyslipidemia. Patients with HIV are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease after adjustment for traditional risk factors. (See

         <strong>
          Tuberculosis
         </strong>
         – A history of tuberculosis (TB) or TB exposure should be sought, and results of prior testing or treatment for latent TB, if any, should be obtained. HIV infection is among the most significant risk factors for reactivation of latent TB, and patients with HIV and a history of latent TB are at high risk for developing active infection in the absence of prophylaxis [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, HIV infection is a risk factor for accelerated TB progression and extrapulmonary involvement, especially in patients with advanced immune dysfunction [

          10

         <strong>
          Sexually transmitted infections
         </strong>
         – A history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and their treatment should be elicited, including a history of genital or anal warts and any abnormal cervical or anal cytology tests. STIs are common in patients with HIV given shared routes of transmission and may be associated with greater morbidity. As examples, human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cervical and anal dysplasia is common in patients with HIV, and its incidence is highest in those with advanced immune dysfunction. Similarly, herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection can reactivate more frequently in patients with HIV and a longer duration of symptoms than in immunocompetent hosts. (See

         Performing resistance testing early in the course of disease increases the chance of detecting transmitted viral mutations before they mutate back to the more fit wild-type virus and decrease to a level lower than the limit of detection of standard genotypic tests.

        <p>
         Resistance testing is also indicated in initial evaluation of patients on ART with a viral load that is not suppressed or has become detectable. Ideally, resistance testing should be done while the patient is taking the failing regimen or within four weeks of discontinuing treatment. In such cases, additional testing beyond genotypic resistance testing may be appropriate, including:

          Cryptococcal antigen

         – Screening for cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) is reasonable in asymptomatic patients with a CD4 count ≤100 cells/microL who are not receiving effective ART. There may also be a benefit to screening at a higher CD4 count threshold (eg, &lt;200 cells/microL) in certain areas of high prevalence for cryptococcal disease.

Because of the low incidence of anal cancer among younger individuals with HIV, some UpToDate contributors advise deferring screening until after 30 years of age. (See

          Goals of the initial evaluation
         </strong>
         – The goals of the initial evaluation of an adult with HIV are to assess the stage of HIV disease, determine the risk for other infections and the need for prophylaxis, identify comorbidities that are associated with HIV infection or relevant to its treatment, and select an antiretroviral regimen. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          History
         </strong>
         – A comprehensive medical history should be performed during the initial visits with a patient with HIV. This should include discussion of risk factors for and history of HIV, any prior treatment history, and the presence of potential comorbidities that are common in populations with HIV, such as viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and tuberculosis (TB), as well as risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The evaluation should also assess the patient's understanding of his or her illness and issues of transmission. (See
         <a class="local">
          'History'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Physical examination
         </strong>
         – The physical examination should be attentive to potential complications that can occur in patients with advanced immunosuppression (eg, thrush) or with long-standing HIV (eg, fat redistribution). In particular, examination of the skin, oral mucosa, lymph nodes, and anogenital region is often revealing in patients with advanced HIV. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Laboratory testing
         </strong>
         – Initial laboratory testing should include assessment of HIV staging parameters (CD4 cell count, HIV RNA, HIV genotype test) along with baseline testing of organ function and screening for potential coinfections, such as viral hepatitis, TB, and STIs, including human papillomavirus (HPV)-related neoplasia  (

         <strong>
          Selecting an antiretroviral regimen
         </strong>
         – Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for nearly all persons with HIV, regardless of the CD4 cell count. The initial evaluation is a time to educate individuals about ART and evaluate for readiness and potential issues with medication adherence. Detailed discussions of selecting an ART regimen are presented in separate topic reviews. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3777.html" rel="external">
          "When to initiate antiretroviral therapy in persons with HIV"
