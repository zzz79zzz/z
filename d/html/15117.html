Hand infections are classified as superficial or deep. An untreated superficial hand infection can progress and become a deep hand infection, which is a surgical emergency. Prompt evaluation and proper treatment of hand infections are important and can mean the difference between an excellent outcome and permanent disability. </p><p>The basic principles of evaluating and treating hand infections and considerations for specific hand infections are reviewed. An overview of the evaluation of hand pain is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1830.html" rel="external">"History and examination of the adult with hand pain"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3842024346"><span class="h1">ANATOMY AND CLASSIFICATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H841350505"><span class="h2">Superficial versus deep hand infections</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Superficial hand infections are generally limited to the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Superficial hand infections include cellulitis, lymphangitis, paronychia, pulp space infections, herpetic whitlow, subcutaneous abscess, and web space abscess. These infections typically present with a history of minor trauma, are associated with few systemic symptoms, are relatively easy to diagnose, and are amenable to a trial of close nonsurgical treatment, especially in the early phase prior to abscess formation. (See <a class="local">'Superficial hand infections'</a> below.)</p><p>An untreated superficial hand infection can progress to involve deeper tissue planes and become a deep hand infection. </p><p>Deep hand infections involve the deeper structures including tendon sheaths, tendons, potential synovial spaces, intermuscular planes, bone, and joints. Deep hand infections include synovial space infections, deep fascial space infections, septic arthritis, and necrotizing fasciitis. (See <a class="local">'Deep hand infections'</a> below.)</p><p>Compared with superficial hand infections, deep hand infections are difficult to diagnose, especially in the early stages, and often result from hematogenous spread without any history of trauma. They are associated with more pain, swelling, limitation of motion, and systemic symptoms (eg, fever and tachycardia).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1308669064"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial evaluation and management of hand infection includes a focused history and examination and often involves laboratory evaluation and imaging. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H986789489"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A focused medical history should determine the possible source of infection, history of progress of the infection, the immune status of the patient, and any relevant past medical history. Most patients with acute hand infections are healthy and active young adults who put off treatment for minor trauma. More severe infections can be seen in patients with impaired immune status. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Symptoms</strong> –<strong> </strong>The onset of hand pain, any loss of hand function, fever and/or chills, and any spontaneous drainage should be documented. Severe throbbing pain is suggestive of an abscess in a confined space. (See <a class="local">'Deep hand infections'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A rapid deterioration in general condition suggests severe infections like necrotizing fasciitis. (See <a class="local">'Necrotizing fasciitis'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prior injury</strong> – Any prior hand injury from splinters, bites, and needle sticks and any prior attempts at drainage either by the patient or other clinicians should be noted.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hand dominance</strong> – The patient's dominant hand should be documented.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Occupation</strong> – The patient's occupation may increase their exposure to certain infectious agents. An animal handler may be prone to bite wounds that may become infected with organisms typical for the involved species (eg, <em>Pasteurella</em>). A rose gardener is at risk for infection with <em>Sporothrix</em> through the introduction of spores through a cut or puncture wound in the skin. Certain professions are more prone to chronic paronychia. As an example, dishwashers are likely to develop <em>Candida</em> infections, whereas a person employed in a tropical fish aquarium is more likely to develop a <em>Mycobacterium</em> infection after a hand injury. (See <a class="local">'Bite wounds'</a> below and <a class="local">'Superficial hand infections'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Immune status</strong> – Host factors that lower immune status increase the risk of significant morbidity from hand infections (eg, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, malignancy).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prior treatment</strong> – Documentation of how the infection has been managed can help determine next steps in the treatment plan.</p><p></p><p>Patients should be questioned about any similar lesions elsewhere suggesting hematogenous multifocal presentation or similar episodes in the past and whether they were ever treated for inflammatory arthropathies like rheumatoid arthritis or gout. This medical history combined with clinical examination and investigations can help differentiate between an infectious and an inflammatory process. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3734255281"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>On physical examination, vital signs should be taken and recorded, and any fever noted. The <strong>entire </strong>upper extremity should be exposed for a systematic examination. The hand and wrist are examined for the presence of swelling, deformity, open wounds, alignment of the fingers, neurovascular status, and local tenderness. </p><p>The following findings should be noted:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Erythema</strong> – Erythema may indicate the presence of cellulitis, lymphangitis, or an underlying abscess. The area of erythema should be outlined with an indelible marker  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63361" href="/d/graphic/63361.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). This will allow assessment of progression or regression of the infectious process. We find it extremely valuable in patients in the early stages of necrotizing fasciitis who are not systemically ill. The rapid progression of erythema over one to two hours helps differentiate necrotizing fasciitis from cellulitis and indicates the need for surgical intervention. (See <a class="local">'Necrotizing fasciitis'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Swelling</strong> – The location of any swelling can provide clues about the anatomic location of a deep infection. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fluctuance</strong> – Fluctuance indicates an<strong> </strong>underlying abscess  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73140" href="/d/graphic/73140.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lacerations and puncture wounds</strong> – Skin lacerations and/or puncture wounds may corroborate the history of trauma, foreign body, or bite wounds.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Skin ischemia </strong>–<strong> </strong>Discoloration of the skin overlying an abscess indicates ischemia from thrombosis of the subdermal and subcutaneous capillaries and potential impending rupture. Central skin necrosis with surrounding erythema (dermonecrosis) is a feature of methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> infections  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52190" href="/d/graphic/52190.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Crepitus</strong> – Subcutaneous air manifesting as crepitus can be associated with a gas-forming organism (<em>Clostridium</em>, anaerobic <em>streptococcus</em>, and some coliforms), but it is not always infectious in nature (eg, air gun injuries), but this should be apparent from the patient's history. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lymphadenopathy</strong> – Epitrochlear and axillary lymphadenopathy often accompany an infection of the forearm. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Limitation of movement</strong> – Limitation of hand, finger, or wrist movement should be documented. Assess for Kanavel cardinal features of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis: fusiform swelling of the whole digit, partially flexed posture of the digit, tenderness along the flexor tendon sheath, and pain on passive extension of the digit.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27990955"><span class="h2">Laboratory studies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients who are systemically ill or immunocompromised, the white blood cell count may help assess the severity of infection and serve as a useful baseline for comparison to monitor the progress treatment. Other studies (eg, renal function, liver function) should be ordered based upon the patient's underlying medical conditions. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1387296755"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most hand infections can be diagnosed on clinical examination based on the presence of pain, erythema, abnormal swelling, drainage, or limitation of movement. (See <a class="local">'History'</a> above and <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3191858776"><span class="h2">Imaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Imaging evaluation may point to the specific diagnosis. The type of imaging depends on the clinical assessment and suspected injuries based on the physical examination and mechanism of injury. Consultation with a radiologist is helpful. If a deep space infection is suspected, ultrasound examination should be performed for confirmation and to look for fluid collections along the tendon sheaths [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Deep hand infections'</a> below.)</p><p>Plain radiographs of the affected part should be obtained when clinical findings and history suggest the following conditions. The radiograph also serves as a baseline for future comparison. Radiography may demonstrate:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Foreign body</strong> – A foreign body can serve as a nidus of infection and may require removal for an infection to resolve  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66000" href="/d/graphic/66000.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). However, radiographs may be misleading if the foreign body is radiolucent. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Periosteal abnormalities</strong> – Periosteal elevation is a nonspecific reaction to tumor, infection, trauma, certain drugs, and some arthritic conditions [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Periosteal thickening coupled with bone erosion in the setting of a clinical infection may indicate osteomyelitis. However, imaging findings may be subtle or radiographically absent in the first one to two weeks of infection. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gas in the soft tissue</strong> – Gas in soft tissue is seen in type I necrotizing fasciitis or gas gangrene caused by clostridia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7672.html" rel="external">"Clostridial myonecrosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Joint abnormalities</strong> – In the early phase of septic arthritis, radiographs will show widening of the joint space and surrounding soft tissue swelling. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H62222596"><span class="h2">Cultures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Blood and wound cultures determine the infective organism and direct specific antimicrobial treatment. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Blood cultures should be obtained if septic embolism is suspected (eg, patient with recurrent fever, immunocompromised patient, suspected endocarditis). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with an open or draining wound, a sample of the drainage should be sent for Gram stain and aerobic and anaerobic culture. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3371249739"><span class="h1">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several inflammatory conditions of the hand may be wrongly diagnosed as an acute infection of the hand. Some of the common conditions that mimic acute hand infections include gout, pseudogout, acute calcific tendinitis, retained foreign bodies, extravasation injury, pyoderma gangrenosum, metastatic tumor, and factitious illness. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1830.html" rel="external">"History and examination of the adult with hand pain"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gout</strong> – Gout is a disorder of urate metabolism that leads to high levels of uric acid and the formation of urate crystals. Urate crystals can be deposited under the skin, in joints, and within tendon sheaths as "gouty tophi," which cause an intense inflammatory process. Inflamed gouty tophi may be mistaken for a felon, a subcutaneous abscess, pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis, or septic arthritis  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74050" href="/d/graphic/74050.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>).  </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The differentiation between gout and septic arthritis depends on the patient's history, the presence of preexisting gout, and the clinical presentation. If gout is suspected, serum uric acid values and a radiograph should be obtained. It may be difficult to differentiate between gout and infection based only on clinical examination and laboratory and radiological investigations. A trial of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9293" href="/d/drug information/9293.html" rel="external">colchicine</a> may help differentiate between them. Aspiration of the involved joint and examination of the aspirate under a polarizing light microscope can confirm diagnosis of gout (negatively birefringent needle-shaped intracellular monosodium urate crystals). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1667.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pseudogout</strong> – Pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate deposition) is like gout except that it is caused by deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals rather than urate crystals. As with gout, differentiation from an infection depends on the patient's history, the presence of preexisting underlying diseases, and the clinical presentation. The aspirate in pseudogout shows positively birefringent rhomboid-shaped calcium pyrophosphate crystals under a polarizing microscope. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1668.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease", section on 'Acute CPP crystal arthritis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acute calcific tendinitis</strong> – Acute calcific tendinitis is caused by deposition of calcium salts around the tendons and ligaments. Patients present acutely with pain, swelling, erythema, and tenderness overlying tendons or ligaments. However, other signs of infection such as fever, lymphadenopathy, or abnormal laboratory values are absent. Radiographs demonstrate characteristic homogenous calcific densities in the area of tenderness  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef134105" href="/d/graphic/134105.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). This process is self-limiting, and patients are managed conservatively with analgesics, rest, and splints. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13803.html" rel="external">"Overview of overuse (persistent) tendinopathy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Retained foreign bodies</strong> – Retained foreign bodies, especially wooden splinters and thorns, can provoke an inflammatory response that can mimic an infection. Radiographs may be misleading if the foreign body is radiolucent. History is valuable in diagnosis, and removal of the offending foreign body is curative. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7661.html" rel="external">"Infectious complications of puncture wounds"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Extravasation injury</strong> – The extravasation of vesicant agents at the site of intravenous access, usually over the dorsum of the hand, may present as marked erythema and swelling. This is frequently seen with chemotherapeutic agents and may be mistaken for a secondary infection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2797.html" rel="external">"Extravasation injury from cytotoxic and other noncytotoxic vesicants in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pyoderma gangrenosum</strong> – Pyoderma gangrenosum is an inflammatory skin disease commonly misdiagnosed as an infection. Pyoderma gangrenosum usually begins as small papules that are followed by central necrosis, resulting in a central ulcer with a raised border  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53733" href="/d/graphic/53733.html" rel="external">picture 5</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52528" href="/d/graphic/52528.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>). The diagnosis is often associated with underlying systemic disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, and lymphoproliferative disorders. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13782.html" rel="external">"Pyoderma gangrenosum: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Metastatic tumor</strong> – Metastatic tumors to the hand are rare and usually involve the distal phalanx  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79595" href="/d/graphic/79595.html" rel="external">picture 7</a>); thus, they can be confused with a pulp space infection or felon. Radiographs are useful in differentiating a tumor from infection. Primary lung tumors are the most common metastatic lesion to the hand. Other tumors that metastasize to the hand include breast, kidney, colon, thyroid, and prostate. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4202570037"><span class="h1">GENERAL MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1615322285"><span class="h2">Initial care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Initial care of hand infection includes empiric antibiotics, along with pain control and limb elevation to decrease swelling and provide comfort. Specific management of bite wounds, superficial hand infections, and deep space infections are reviewed below. (See <a class="local">'Bite wounds'</a> below and <a class="local">'Superficial hand infections'</a> below and <a class="local">'Deep hand infections'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3751374267"><span class="h3">Antibiotic therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Initial antibiotic therapy is empirically based on epidemiologic clues for likely pathogen(s) as well as the Gram stain, if available, while awaiting culture and sensitivity results, which can take two to three days. <em>S. aureus</em> and beta-hemolytic streptococci are the most common pathogenic organisms in the hand [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. First-generation cephalosporins provide appropriate coverage for methicillin-sensitive <em>S. aureus</em> and <em>streptococcus</em>. Alternative antibiotics are selected in patients with allergies or if the local prevalence of methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> exceeds 10 to 15 percent [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].

The first debridement is critical because the tissue planes are pristine, it is possible to separate infected tissue from normal tissue and to dissect, identify, and protect the neurovascular structures. The granulation tissue that appears after the initial debridement makes subsequent debridement challenging. As the infection resolves, the swelling becomes better. However, the appearance of granulation and the repeated surgical intervention can lead to adhesions and stiffness.

Herpetic whitlow has a bimodal age distribution affecting children less than 10 years of age and young adults between 20 and 30 years of age. Herpetic whitlow is caused by HSV-1 in children, and in adults, it can be caused by either HSV-1 or HSV-2. HSV spreads by direct digital contact with secretions, from lesions of infected patients, or from secretions of asymptomatic carriers. </p><p>The lesion in herpetic whitlow can be a single vesicle or a cluster of vesicles. The lesions are initially clear but become turbid, yellow, and appear purulent with an erythematous base  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71643" href="/d/graphic/71643.html" rel="external">picture 17</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52029" href="/d/graphic/52029.html" rel="external">picture 18</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75510" href="/d/graphic/75510.html" rel="external">picture 19</a>). These lesions appear after an incubation period of 2 to 20 days following inoculation and can coalesce to form larger blisters. The lesions may spread around the paronychial folds, and satellite lesions may appear. The lesions are associated with tingling and burning pain of the hand that is disproportionate to the clinical findings. Occasionally patients have flu-like symptoms, including fever and epitrochlear/axillary lymphadenitis. When the blister (or vesicle) is unroofed, non-purulent fluid is released, and the underlying tissue has a honeycomb appearance that is diagnostic for herpetic whitlow. </p><p>The diagnosis of herpetic whitlow is clinical. Diagnostic tests include viral culture, serum antibody titers, Tzanck smear, and lesion-specific antigen detection [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Viral culture is most sensitive but requires one to four days for a positive result. Serum antibody titers take about three weeks. Thus, both these tests are not useful for rapid confirmation. A Tzanck smear or antigen detection in samples of vesicle fluid or scrapings can be used for early diagnosis. However, the Tzanck smear is not specific for HSV, but it is relatively inexpensive. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5562.html" rel="external">"Office-based dermatologic diagnostic procedures", section on 'Tzanck smear'</a>.)</p><p>Herpetic whitlow is often confused with acute paronychia or a pulp abscess (see <a class="local">'Pulp space infections'</a> above). However, unlike a bacterial infection, the pulp space is not tense. Herpetic whitlow usually affects only one digit; if multiple digits are affected, other vesicle-forming viral infections like the Coxsackievirus infection (enterovirus) should be suspected. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96219.html" rel="external">"Hand, foot, and mouth disease and herpangina"</a>.) </p><p>The treatment of primary herpetic whitlow is conservative (rest, elevation, and anti-inflammatory agents). Surgery is contraindicated because it will only spread the infection and may result in secondary bacterial infection. Unless a secondary bacterial infection is suspected, herpetic whitlow does not require use of antibiotics. A dry dressing is used to cover the digit to prevent transmission of the infection. The natural history of untreated uncomplicated herpetic whitlow is complete resolution within three weeks. The vesicles evolve into shallow ulcers that form crusts that eventually peel off to leave healed epidermis below. The satellite lesions, shallow ulcers, and crusts last for about 12 days and coincide with the period of viral shedding, during which time the patients are most infectious. </p><p>While topical 5% <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9335" href="/d/drug information/9335.html" rel="external">acyclovir</a> shortens the duration of labial and genital HSV lesions, it has not been studied in herpetic whitlow. Immunocompetent patients with primary herpetic whitlow may benefit from topical acyclovir therapy. Patients with primary HSV infection at multiple sites or recurrent herpetic whitlow may be considered for oral antiviral therapy [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. A total daily dose of 1600 to 2000 mg given at the onset of prodromal symptoms has been shown to prevent viral shedding and shorten the duration of symptoms. Similarly, 200 mg of acyclovir taken orally three to four times daily has been shown to prevent or decrease recurrence rates. However, the dose and duration of treatment have not been optimized [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Intravenous acyclovir is recommended only for immunocompromised patients or those with disseminated HSV infections.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15866.html" rel="external">"Cutaneous manifestations of tuberculosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7646.html" rel="external">"Soft tissue infections following water exposure"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27991357"><span class="h3">Synovial space infections</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The flexor tendons of the hand are enclosed in a double-layered synovial sheath composed of an inner visceral layer and an outer parietal layer, which create a closed system  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70488" href="/d/graphic/70488.html" rel="external">figure 9</a>). The tendon sheath of the flexor pollicis longus continues proximally as radial bursa while the tendon sheaths of the fingers (usually the ulnar digits) continue proximally as the ulnar bursa. The radial and ulnar bursa end proximal to the wrist. They can communicate with each other via the space of Parona  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77205" href="/d/graphic/77205.html" rel="external">figure 10</a>), which is a potential space deep to the tendons of the flexor digitorum profundus (sublimis) and superficial to the pronator quadratus.</p><p>The synovial spaces intercommunicate and provide an optimal environment for bacterial growth because they are poorly vascularized and rich in synovial fluid [<a href="#rid13">13,21,22</a>]. Bacterial proliferation within the synovial sheath rapidly destroys the tendon's gliding mechanism and leads to increased pressure within the sheath, which obstructs the blood flow and can cause tendon necrosis and rupture. The infection can spread from the bursa into the surrounding soft tissue compartments. The infection can also track from the radial to the ulnar bursa and vice versa to form a so-called "horseshoe abscess."</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2812657053"><span class="h3">Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with an isolated infection of the digital flexor sheaths (pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis) typically present with fusiform swelling of the whole digit, partially flexed posture of the digit, tenderness along the flexor tendon sheath, and pain on passive extension of the digit (Kanavel's cardinal features of pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis), although all features may not be seen in an early presentation  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51632" href="/d/graphic/51632.html" rel="external">picture 24</a>) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. </p><p>Patients with an infection of the radial bursa, ulnar bursa, space of Parona, or a combination of these (horseshoe abscess) present with a flexed attitude of the wrist; swelling; and tenderness along the thenar, hypothenar, and/or the distal wrist crease because of the associated thumb and/or small finger flexor tenosynovitis.</p><p>In general, the management of tenosynovitis requires antibiotic therapy and surgical intervention  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63419" href="/d/graphic/63419.html" rel="external">picture 25</a>).

These spaces are deep to the flexor tendons but superficial to the interosseous muscles. Infections in these spaces most commonly occur following a penetrating injury but occasionally can result from extension from a subcutaneous abscess, adjacent pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis, or hematogenous spread from a distant site. </p><p>All deep palmar space infections present with palmar swelling and tenderness over the involved palmar space and generalized dorsal swelling: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A thenar space abscess is characterized by a widely abducted thumb and fullness on the dorsum of the first web space, with pain on adduction or opposition of the thumb  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56271" href="/d/graphic/56271.html" rel="external">picture 26</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A midpalmar space abscess is characterized by loss of the normal palmar concavity  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66269" href="/d/graphic/66269.html" rel="external">picture 27</a>).

In addition, there is no involvement of the fingers or the flexor tendons.</p><p></p><p>An ultrasound examination can help confirm the presence and location of an abscess cavity and thus differentiate deep fascial space infection from other entities in the differential diagnosis such as pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis, radial or ulnar bursal infections, and subcutaneous abscess. Radiographs are useful to evaluate for a retained foreign body. </p><p>The incisions used to approach to thenar space, midpalmar space, and hypothenar space infections are illustrated in the figures  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78024" href="/d/graphic/78024.html" rel="external">figure 11</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55033" href="/d/graphic/55033.html" rel="external">figure 12</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66822" href="/d/graphic/66822.html" rel="external">figure 13</a>). For deep fascial space infection, the surgical approach identifies the limits of the infection to adequately debride to normal appearing tissue proximally and distally. Typically for any infection extending into the palm, it is safer to perform a carpal tunnel release. The superficial palmar arch limits proximal clearance of palmar infections and proximal debridement would not be possible without doing a carpal tunnel release.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27991462"><span class="h3">Septic arthritis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Septic arthritis usually refers to bacterial infection in a joint but also includes fungal and mycobacterial infections that involve the joint [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].

It is important to differentiate necrotizing fasciitis from cellulitis because the early presentation of both these conditions is similar. (See <a class="local">'Cellulitis'</a> above.)</p><p>Necrotizing fasciitis requires emergent surgical intervention.

Initial evaluation includes a focused history and examination, laboratory evaluation, and imaging. The area of erythema should be marked to help document progression of the infection. With bite wounds, rabies immunization status should be documented. (See <a class="local">'Anatomy and classification'</a> above and <a class="local">'Bite wounds'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Superficial infections</strong> – Superficial hand infections arise from the skin and subcutaneous tissue in a plane superficial to the tendons. These include cellulitis, lymphangitis, paronychia, pulp space infections, herpetic whitlow, subcutaneous abscess, and web space abscess. As a superficial hand infection progresses, it follows the path of least resistance and may involve deeper tissue planes. (See <a class="local">'Superficial hand infections'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Deep infections</strong> – Deep hand infections are deep to the tendon sheaths and include synovial space infections, deep fascial space infections, septic arthritis, and necrotizing fasciitis. Although less common overall, both typical and atypical mycobacterial infections should be suspected with hand infections that are refractory to treatment (typically deep infection). Because mycobacteria are difficult to culture, a tissue biopsy is often necessary. (See <a class="local">'Deep hand infections'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Differential diagnosis</strong> – Acute hand infections may be mistaken for several inflammatory or other conditions of the hand. Some of these include gout, pseudogout, acute calcific tendinitis, retained foreign bodies, extravasation injury, pyoderma gangrenosum, and metastatic tumor. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong> – Early and superficial infections of the hand may respond to nonsurgical management. Empiric antibiotics should be initiated, and hand elevation and heat will provide comfort for the patient. Most acute infections of the hand require early surgical intervention.
