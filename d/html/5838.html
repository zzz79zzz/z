         Hypothyroidism is the most common disturbance of thyroid function in children; acquired hypothyroidism is most often caused by autoimmune thyroiditis [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. As in adults, acquired hypothyroidism can be caused by both thyroid disease (primary hypothyroidism) and hypothalamic-pituitary disease (central hypothyroidism); furthermore, primary hypothyroidism may be either subclinical (elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] and normal serum free thyroxine [T4] concentrations) or overt (elevated serum TSH and low serum free T4 concentrations). Whatever its cause, hypothyroidism in children can have deleterious effects on growth, pubertal development, and school performance.
        </p>
        <p>
         An overview of the clinical manifestations, causes, diagnosis, and treatment of acquired hypothyroidism in children is discussed below. Details about each of the causes are available in linked topics. Evaluation and management of congenital hypothyroidism are discussed separately. Information in this topic pertains to primary hypothyroidism; information on secondary (central) hypothyroidism is presented only when helpful to separate this entity from primary hypothyroidism.

          Autoimmune thyroiditis
         </strong>
         – Autoimmune thyroiditis is the most common cause of acquired hypothyroidism [

          Autoimmune thyroid disease
         </strong>
         – This is a somewhat broader term, encompassing disorders with autoimmune mechanisms that have a risk of both hypothyroidism (Hashimoto disease) and hyperthyroidism (Graves disease).

          Clinical presentation
         </strong>
         – Presenting features of acquired hypothyroidism in children may include:

         <strong>
          Declining growth velocity/short stature
         </strong>
         – The most common manifestation of hypothyroidism in children is declining height velocity, often resulting in short stature. The growth delay tends to be insidious in onset, and it may be present for several years before other symptoms occur, if they occur at all [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Thus, any child with declining height velocity should be evaluated for hypothyroidism. Skeletal maturation typically is delayed, and therefore, bone age and height age are less than chronologic age [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Indeed, because skeletal maturation slows or ceases after the onset of hypothyroidism, the bone age may indicate the age of onset. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5834.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Abnormal pubertal development
         </strong>
         – Pubertal development is delayed in most adolescent hypothyroid children. However, some children with primary hypothyroidism have sexual precocity, characterized by breast development and vaginal bleeding in girls and macro-orchidism (enlarged testes) in boys, and slightly increased (for age) serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations. In these cases, the bone age may not be delayed, owing to the effect of sex steroid production. Rarely, patients may present with galactorrhea secondary to hyperprolactinemia associated with their hypothyroidism.

         <strong>
          Functioning in school
         </strong>
         – Another common feature is altered school performance. Performance often declines, but it improves in some children, perhaps because they are less active and, therefore, less easily distracted and better able to concentrate. One reason for delay in diagnosis is that parents/caregivers see the latter changes as positive.

         <strong>
          Other symptoms
         </strong>
         – Other symptoms are sluggishness, lethargy, cold intolerance, constipation, dry skin, brittle hair, facial puffiness, and muscle aches and pains. Although hypothyroidism may cause weight gain, this is typically minimal and attributable to fluid retention rather than adiposity. If the cause is hypothalamic or pituitary disease, the child may have headaches, visual symptoms, or manifestations of other pituitary hormone deficiencies. (See

         <strong>
          Hashimoto encephalopathy
         </strong>
         – Rarely, an encephalopathy may occur in children or adults with autoimmune thyroiditis. This disorder has been termed Hashimoto encephalopathy and is thought to be an associated autoimmune disorder that is unrelated to thyroid dysfunction or thyroid autoantibodies [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5

         <strong>
          Examination findings
         </strong>
         – In primary hypothyroidism, the most common physical finding at presentation is a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland (goiter). In one series from Turkey, a noticeable goiter was present in 39.5 percent of children with autoimmune thyroiditis [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Alternatively, the thyroid gland may be normal in size or not palpable at all. Other abnormalities on physical examination may include short stature; apparent overweight (more fluid retention than obesity); puffy facies with a dull, placid expression; bradycardia; pseudohypertrophy of the muscles; and delayed deep tendon reflexes. Abnormal findings on chest and cardiac auscultation may point to pleural or pericardial effusions [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. These effusions resolve with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9557" href="/z/d/drug information/9557.html" rel="external">
          levothyroxine
         </a>
         treatment. Hypothyroidism should be considered in any child with unexplained pericardial or pleural effusions. There appears to be a higher risk of slipped capital femoral epiphysis in children with acquired hypothyroidism [
         <a href="#rid8">

         <strong>
          Laboratory abnormalities
         </strong>
         – In addition to characteristic findings on thyroid function testing (see
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnosis'
         </a>
         below), patients with primary hypothyroidism also may have hyperlipidemia (most notably hypertriglyceridemia and low high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol), normocytic or macrocytic anemia, and hyponatremia (infrequently). Rarely, children may present with a myopathy and dramatically elevated serum creatine kinase levels, known as Kocher-Debre-Semelaigne syndrome [
         <a href="#rid9">

         <strong>
          Imaging abnormalities
         </strong>
         – Primary hypothyroidism may be associated with enlargement of the sella turcica, resulting from secondary hyperplasia of thyrotroph cells [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. The enlargement may be discovered when cranial imaging is performed for evaluation of short stature. Although pituitary enlargement may be rather pronounced, with the upper convexity of the gland even abutting inferiorly on the optic chiasm, it rarely causes symptoms or signs (in contrast with a pituitary tumor or craniopharyngioma), and it is reversible with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9557" href="/z/d/drug information/9557.html" rel="external">
          levothyroxine
         </a>
         therapy. Thus, primary hypothyroidism must be excluded in any child with an enlarged sella turcica. Occasionally, patients with severe hypothyroidism develop pericardial and pleural effusions, which may be presenting features [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. As noted above, skeletal maturation (bone age) is delayed.

          Epidemiology and pathogenesis
         </strong>
         – The most common cause of hypothyroidism in children is autoimmune thyroiditis (also known as chronic lymphocytic or Hashimoto thyroiditis). The autoimmune process typically presents with a goiter, though the thyroid gland may be normal at diagnosis, or even atrophied in a minority. If a goiter is present at diagnosis, it may persist, further enlarge, or regress over time. Autoimmune thyroiditis is more common in girls than boys and more common in White than Black individuals. Among children with this disorder, euthyroid goiter is more common than hypothyroidism [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,11,12
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/120705.html" rel="external">
          "Approach to acquired goiter in children and adolescents", section on 'Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto)'

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) from 1988 to 1994, 6.3 percent of American adolescents (12 to 19 years of age) had positive antithyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) and 4.8 percent had positive antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. The likelihood of detecting TgAb and TPOAb was two times greater in female versus male adolescents. The incidence of antithyroid antibodies was highest in Hispanic adolescents and lowest in Black non-Hispanic adolescents; non-Hispanic White adolescents had an incidence between these two groups. Approximately 2 percent of adolescents had a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) &gt;4.5 mU/L, which this study used as a cutpoint to define mild hypothyroidism. While uncommon, hypothyroidism caused by autoimmune thyroiditis has been reported in infants [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The natural history of euthyroid autoimmune thyroiditis was illustrated in a report of 160 children (mean age 9.1 years) with elevated titers of antithyroid antibodies who underwent serial measurements of TSH levels [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Among 105 children with normal TSH followed for five years, 65 percent remained euthyroid, 9 percent developed mild elevation in serum TSH concentrations (typically 5 to 10 mU/L), and 26 percent developed serum TSH levels twofold above the upper limit of normal (usually &gt;10 mU/L). In a subsequent study of 87 children with elevated antithyroid antibodies and mild TSH elevation (5 to 10 mU/L) followed for three years, 41 percent reverted to euthyroidism (TSH &lt;5 mU/L), 20 percent had persistent mild TSH elevation (5 to 10 mU/L), while 39 percent developed more severe hypothyroidism (TSH &gt;10 mU/L) [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Most children with autoimmune thyroiditis remain euthyroid for some time, and only a minority of those with mild TSH elevation progress to overt hypothyroidism.

         Atrophic thyroiditis is primarily the result of cell-mediated cytotoxicity leading to follicular cell apoptosis; complement-dependent antibody-mediated cytotoxicity may contribute to thyroid damage. TSH receptor-blocking antibodies result in loss of thyroid morphologic integrity, which may be reversible.

         Goitrous thyroiditis may be induced by one of three mechanisms: lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltration (and lymphoid germinal centers), the production of antibodies that stimulate thyroid growth, or excess TSH secretion.

Because of these associations, children with these disorders should undergo periodic screening for hypothyroidism by measuring serum TSH and free thyroxine (T4) or TSH followed by reflex testing for free T4 if TSH is abnormal. Children whose autoimmune thyroiditis is identified by screening are diagnosed at an earlier stage of the disease, and so have fewer clinical symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism [

          Down syndrome
         </strong>
         – Children with Down syndrome are at increased risk for both congenital and acquired hypothyroidism. Thyroid function tests in infants and older children with Down syndrome often show mild TSH elevation and normal free T4 levels. While these results may indicate subclinical hypothyroidism, TSH levels just above the upper reference range may result from an altered TSH set-point in this population. The cause of acquired hypothyroidism in Down syndrome children is usually autoimmune thyroiditis. The cause of congenital hypothyroidism in Down syndrome infants is not clear, but it does not appear to be autoimmune thyroid disease. There is speculation that the extra chromosome 21 results in genomic dosage imbalance of dosage-sensitive genes interfering with thyroid hormone production. (See

         – In a small percentage of children with autoimmune thyroiditis, the initial presentation is characterized by hyperthyroidism of short duration (&lt;3 months), often termed "Hashitoxicosis." In some children, the hyperthyroidism results from production of TSH receptor-stimulating antibodies (TRAb or thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins [TSI]), followed by autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland, resulting in hypothyroidism [

          38

         ]. In other children, the hyperthyroidism results from "destructive" thyroiditis with release of preformed, stored thyroid hormone, followed by hypothyroidism once this storage supply is exhausted. Typically the thyroid gland is not enlarged and is nontender. During the hyperthyroid phase of the form of destructive thyroiditis, radioactive iodine uptake will be low, distinguishing this entity from Graves disease in which the uptake is high. (See

The tumors contain very high levels of type 3 deiodinase activity, which catalyzes deiodination of T4 to reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) and triiodothyronine (T3) to diiodothyronine (T2), resulting in low serum T4 and T3 concentrations. Thyroid hormone production is increased, but not sufficiently to compensate for the large increase in T4 and T3 degradation. (See

They are usually euthyroid because the elevated thyroid hormone concentrations are able to overcome the nuclear receptor defect. However, they may have some tissue-specific clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism and/or hyperthyroidism because tissues with predominantly beta receptors have impaired sensitivity to thyroid hormone, causing symptoms of hypothyroidism, while tissues with predominantly alpha receptors still respond to the excess thyroid hormone concentrations, causing symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

         – TSH elevation &gt;10 mU/L with low free T4 is diagnostic of overt primary hypothyroidism. In children with mild elevations of serum TSH (5 to 10 mU/L), the test should be repeated before making treatment decisions. In addition, some children with secondary (central) hypothyroidism may have a mild TSH elevation (although most patients with central hypothyroidism have normal or low TSH).

         – Persistent elevation of TSH with normal free T4 is compatible with "subclinical hypothyroidism." For patients with serum TSH &gt;10 mU/L on two or more occasions, we suggest initiating treatment, particularly if the TSH is trending higher.

         For children with mild TSH elevations (5 to 10 mU/L), we perform further evaluation and monitoring to determine whether the TSH elevation persists and whether they are likely to develop clinically important hypothyroidism. TSH often will normalize on repeat testing [

          72

         ]. We also include testing for antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and antithyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb). If either of these thyroid antibodies is positive, or if suspicious clinical findings are present, we recommend treatment if repeat serum TSH is still in the 5 to 10 mU/L range. (See

         Mild elevation of serum TSH concentration (ie, 5 to 10 mU/L) occurs in 10 to 23 percent of children with obesity, associated with normal or slightly elevated free T3 and normal T4 values [

Elevated serum leptin, present in children with obesity, stimulates increased transcription of the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) gene, and so may be the primary factor increasing serum TSH levels. Thus, the elevated TSH levels probably are a consequence rather than a cause of obesity. The elevated TSH levels return to normal after weight loss [

          Primary hypothyroidism
         </strong>
         – We recommend that patients with overt primary hypothyroidism (elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], low free thyroxine [T4]) be tested for autoimmune thyroiditis by measuring antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and antithyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb). Approximately 85 to 90 percent of children with autoimmune thyroiditis have positive serum TPOAb titers, while 30 to 50 percent have positive TgAb titers [

          blocking
         </strong>
         antibodies may explain the development of hypothyroidism in some children, which was found in 9.2 percent of children with autoimmune thyroiditis in one study [
         <a href="#rid78">
          78

         In a child with hypothyroidism and positive thyroid antibodies who in addition has a palpable goiter, we suggest an
         <strong>
          ultrasound examination
         </strong>
         to obtain baseline characteristics of the goiter. Autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis typically shows a "moth-eaten" or "Swiss cheese-like" pattern of scattered hypo- or hyperechogenicity  (

          image 1
         </a>
         ). If the patient has a markedly asymmetric goiter or a palpable nodule, ultrasound examination is important to determine size and echo characteristics of the goiter and nodule and determine if fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the nodule is indicated. In a study of 904 children age 1.2 to 12.8 years with autoimmune thyroiditis, thyroid nodules developed in approximately 20 percent over a mean follow-up period of 4.5 years [
         <a href="#rid79">
          79
         </a>
         ]. In patients with positive thyroid antibodies but without these abnormalities on examination, thyroid ultrasonography is helpful but not always necessary. In a study of 105 children with antibody-positive autoimmune thyroiditis, only one-third showed typical ultrasound changes (scattered hypo- and hyperechogenicity) at diagnosis [

          80

         </strong>
         – In patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (elevated TSH with normal free T4), it may be helpful to test for TPOAb and TgAb. Those with positive antithyroid antibodies have autoimmune thyroiditis and are at risk to develop overt hypothyroidism over time. The decision to treat depends on the presence of likely clinical features of hypothyroidism, the degree of TSH elevation, and changes in TSH and free T4 over time (see
         <a class="local">
          'Treatment and prognosis'

         is the recommended treatment for children with primary or central hypothyroidism. The goals of treatment are to restore normal growth and development, including pubertal development.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, treatment decisions often depend on the degree of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) elevation. For those with TSH levels &gt;10 mU/L, there is general agreement to treat, based on expert opinion. There is some controversy about the need to treat children with mild subclinical hypothyroidism, characterized by TSH elevations between 5 and 10 mU/L. If there are clinical features likely to be associated with hypothyroidism, such as a decreasing height velocity, presence of a goiter, positive antithyroid antibodies, or metabolic complications such as dyslipidemia [
         <a href="#rid84">
          84
         </a>
         ], most clinicians would treat until growth and puberty are complete, and then reevaluate thyroid function. Regardless, these patients should be monitored periodically, and treatment initiated if greater abnormalities in thyroid hormones develop. (See

          levothyroxine
         </a>
         dose in the middle of the appropriate range for age, though an initial dose at the lower end of the range may be used in children with subclinical hypothyroidism and central hypothyroidism. The dose is then adjusted based on thyroid hormone measurements, as described below. Children clear levothyroxine more rapidly than adults; as a result, the weight-adjusted daily replacement dose is higher.
        </p>
        <p>
         In children with longstanding hypothyroidism, rapid correction of hypothyroidism may be associated with untoward effects, in particular on behavior and an increased risk of pseudotumor cerebri. In these cases, we recommend a slower up-titration to full dosing, for example one-quarter of the estimated full dose for four to six weeks, then advancing by a one-quarter dose increase every four to six weeks, such that full dosing is achieved by 12 to 16 weeks.

         For children with acquired primary hypothyroidism, serum TSH and free T4 should be checked six to eight weeks after initiation of treatment and then every 6 to 12 months. Thyroid function tests should be obtained six to eight weeks after any dose change or if the patient develops any clinical manifestations suspicious for hypo- or hyperthyroidism. The
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9557" href="/z/d/drug information/9557.html" rel="external">
          levothyroxine
         </a>
         dose is adjusted to maintain TSH and free T4 (or T4) in the normal reference range for age. Because the free T4 reference range varies according to the assay method, clinicians need to determine the range for their specific laboratory. Because the levothyroxine dose gradually increases as children grow, we target TSH in the lower one-half and free T4 in the upper one-half of the reference range to anticipate these changes; however, as long as both values are in the normal range, we judge the levothyroxine dose to be appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
         For children with central hypothyroidism, only measurement of serum free T4 or T4 is generally required for dose monitoring. We recommend maintaining the free T4 in the upper one-half of the reference range. As an example, if the normal free T4 reference range is 0.8 to 1.8 ng/dL (10 to 23 pmol/L), the corresponding optimal free T4 range would be between 1.3 and 1.8 ng/dL (16 to 23 pmol/L). Serum TSH, if checked, is usually low or undetectable in treated children with central hypothyroidism, so this test generally is not useful for monitoring these patients.

          Causes
         </strong>
         – Acquired hypothyroidism is the most common abnormality of thyroid function in children and is most often caused by autoimmune thyroiditis. In the United States, 6 percent of adolescents have positive antithyroid antibodies and 2 percent have an elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Other causes of hypothyroidism in children are listed in the table  (

         <strong>
          Clinical manifestations
         </strong>
         – Many children with acquired hypothyroidism, particularly those with subclinical hypothyroidism, will be asymptomatic. In those with overt disease, clinical features include declining height velocity, short stature, and/or the presence of a goiter. Adolescents may also have signs of pubertal delay. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Evaluation
         </strong>
         – Patients with symptoms or findings on physical examination compatible with hypothyroidism should be evaluated with measurements of serum TSH and free thyroxine (T4) concentrations, and the results should be compared with age-specific normal values  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60095" href="/z/d/graphic/60095.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). If another etiology is not obvious, we recommend testing for antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and antithyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) because autoimmune thyroiditis is the most common cause. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – TSH elevations &gt;10 mU/L with low free T4 is diagnostic of overt primary hypothyroidism. In children with milder elevations (TSH 5 to 10 mU/L), the test should be repeated before making treatment decisions. This is because TSH levels are normal in up to 70 percent of such patients when the test is repeated. Moreover, mild elevation of TSH is common in children with obesity and does not warrant thyroid hormone replacement. (See
         <a class="local">
