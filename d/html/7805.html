Along the continuum of alcohol consumption, alcohol use, unhealthy alcohol use, and alcohol use disorder impart greater risks to perioperative morbidity. Unhealthy alcohol use is an amount of alcohol consumed that places a person at risk for alcohol-related events. Unhealthy alcohol use does not necessarily indicate that the patient has an alcohol use disorder; unhealthy alcohol consumption is a spectrum of alcohol consumption from risky alcohol consumption to alcohol use disorder. Patients with unhealthy alcohol use, with or without alcohol withdrawal syndrome, have an elevated risk of alcohol-associated medical and psychiatric problems, which if present can contribute to complications in the perioperative period. Alcohol consumption may interact with perioperative medications (eg, anesthetics, analgesics) and can contribute to compliance with postoperative treatment or postoperative recovery.</p><p>Patients anticipated to have surgery should be screened for unhealthy alcohol use. Those assessed with or suspected of having frequent heavy use could be encouraged to undergo medically supervised withdrawal prior to surgery and should be monitored closely for alcohol withdrawal syndrome during the perioperative surgical period. If surgery is needed urgently, or medically supervised withdrawal is refused by the patient, for patients suspected to have physical dependence on alcohol, they should be treated prophylactically with benzodiazepines (or other agents) to prevent alcohol withdrawal syndrome and its associated complications. The perioperative surgical period is an ideal time to identify and intervene on patients with unhealthy alcohol consumption. Patients with unhealthy drinking should always be educated about the consequences of their use and encouraged to participate in brief counseling or alcohol use disorder treatment, as appropriate.</p><p>This topic reviews the epidemiology, consequences, identification, and management of unhealthy alcohol use in patients who are undergoing surgical procedures. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with alcohol use disorder are described separately. The diagnosis and management of alcohol withdrawal are also described separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7809.html" rel="external">"Risky drinking and alcohol use disorder: Epidemiology, clinical features, adverse consequences, screening, and assessment"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14843.html" rel="external">"Screening for unhealthy use of alcohol and other drugs in primary care"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14832.html" rel="external">"Brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol and other drug use: Efficacy, adverse effects, and administration"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7810.html" rel="external">"Alcohol use disorder: Psychosocial management"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7800.html" rel="external">"Alcohol use disorder: Pharmacologic management"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/323.html" rel="external">"Management of moderate and severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7801.html" rel="external">"Alcohol withdrawal: Ambulatory management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2333688947"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The identification and management of patients with unhealthy alcohol use in the perioperative period is aided by defining the spectrum of problems encountered. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7809.html" rel="external">"Risky drinking and alcohol use disorder: Epidemiology, clinical features, adverse consequences, screening, and assessment"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2333689610"><span class="h2">Unhealthy alcohol use</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Unhealthy alcohol use encompasses the spectrum of alcohol use that can (but may not necessarily) result in health-related consequences, including risky alcohol use, which includes frequent or heavy alcohol use, and alcohol use disorder [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Patients with frequent and heavy alcohol use can, but not always, have physiologic dependence and have alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which can contribute to morbidity directly and through increased complications of surgery or of treatment in the postoperative period.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2333688974"><span class="h3">Risky alcohol use</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Risky alcohol use refers to consumption of amounts of alcohol that places the patient at risk for health consequences. Thus, risky alcohol use – often called at-risk, heavy, and hazardous alcohol drinking – is defined by the amount a person drinks. Acute and chronic conditions resulting from risky alcohol consumption include injuries, gastrointestinal bleeding, depression, sexually transmitted diseases, stroke, cancer, liver and heart disease, birth defects, perioperative complications, and alcohol use disorder. Many conditions that may occur or be exacerbated in patients who drink at risky levels may be further exacerbated by stress and treatment that naturally occur in patients in the perioperative period. For example, the increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, dyspepsia, and ulcers in the perioperative period may be additive to these risks in patients who drink at risky alcohol amounts.</p><p>The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) in the United States has estimated consumption amounts of alcohol that increase health risks [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Men under age 65:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>More than 14 standard drinks per week on average</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>More than 4 drinks on any day (or episode of drinking) in the last year</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Women and all adults 65 years and older:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>More than 7 drinks per week on average</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>More than 3 drinks on any day (or episode of drinking) in the last year</p><p></p><p>Amounts are based on a standard drink, which is defined, in the United States, as 12 grams of ethanol, 5 ounces of wine, 12 ounces of beer, or 1.5 ounces of 80 proof spirits. The number and size of drinks used in these estimates vary internationally.</p><p>Specifying thresholds for risky alcohol use is an inexact science based on epidemiological evidence, and patients who drink just below these thresholds may have similar risks of those patients who drink just above these thresholds. While risky alcohol use is defined as a dichotomous "yes" and "no" state, risks of a myriad of untoward health consequences are often delineated along a continuum of consumption amounts.</p><p>Patients with frequent heavy alcohol use are more likely to have a moderate to severe alcohol use disorder, and are at increased perioperative risks from the medical consequences of alcohol use, as well as from physiologic dependence and potential withdrawal if alcohol is suddenly discontinued. Patients may have physical dependence on alcohol, with or without a formal diagnosis of alcohol use disorder.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3082707"><span class="h3">Alcohol use disorder</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>], alcohol use disorder (which replaced the DSM-IV disorders alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence) is characterized by a pattern of alcohol use associated with clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by multiple psychosocial, behavioral, or physiologic features [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. As opposed to risky alcohol drinking, alcohol use disorder is not defined by the amount of alcohol consumption; physical dependence on alcohol is just one criterion for DSM-5 alcohol use disorder. Not all patients diagnosed with alcohol use disorder have physiologic dependence on alcohol and may not require or need management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Patients with risky alcohol consumption may not have physical dependence on alcohol and not experience alcohol withdrawal syndrome. It is rare, however, for a patient not be physically dependent on alcohol without either consuming unhealthy alcohol amounts or having a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7809.html" rel="external">"Risky drinking and alcohol use disorder: Epidemiology, clinical features, adverse consequences, screening, and assessment", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H24528901"><span class="h3">Binge drinking</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>"Binge" drinking has been defined as "drinking so much within about two hours that blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels reach 0.08g/dL" [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In women, this typically occurs after about four standard drinks, and, in men, after about five standard drinks. This term is consistent with heavy drinking episodes in the NIAAA definition of risky alcohol use. (See <a class="local">'Risky alcohol use'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prevalence of risky drinking in surgical patients is not precisely known, but is higher than in the general population. In a study of 2219 patients admitted to a university hospital trauma service, investigators tested 1602 patients for serum ethanol; 685 (43 percent of those tested) patients had a measurable level of ethanol [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>In a study of consecutive inpatient admissions to a university hospital, investigators found that 23 percent of general surgery admissions, 12.5 percent of obstetrics-gynecology admissions, and 43 percent of otolaryngology admissions screened positive for a DSM-IV diagnosis of alcohol dependence [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The incidence of alcohol withdrawal syndrome is generally estimated to be two to five times higher in surgical and trauma patients compared with other inpatients [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>].</p><p>Obesity combined with presentation for a gastric bypass procedure is strongly associated with a history of an alcohol use disorder and may be a risk factor for perioperative complications secondary to alcohol use. A longitudinal study of 199 patients who underwent bariatric surgery found that nearly 33 percent had a lifetime history of alcohol use disorder [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. There is strong evidence that bariatric surgery leads to changes in alcohol metabolism after surgery [<a href="#rid10">10-13</a>]. Patients with obesity may have an increased risk of alcohol consumption and new onset of alcohol use disorder after bariatric surgery [<a href="#rid14">14-16</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8113770"><span class="h1">ALCOHOL-RELATED COMPLICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Unhealthy alcohol use contributes to surgical and postoperative complications [<a href="#rid7">7,17,18</a>]. Patients with unhealthy drinking have a higher likelihood of comorbid illnesses that can complicate surgery (eg, liver disease, dementia with risk of delirium). The effect of alcohol use on perioperative complications appears to be dose-dependent, with greater consumption incurring a higher rate and severity of perioperative consequences [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Common complications include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Infections:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Risky alcohol use is a significant independent risk factor for surgical site infections [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Alcohol-induced immune incompetence is believed to contribute to this risk. Risky alcohol use has been found to decrease T-cell activity and proliferation; delayed type-hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions have been shown to be decreased pre- and postoperatively in patients with unhealthy alcohol use [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Wound disruption – Decreased protein accumulation and slower surgical wound healing among patients with alcohol use disorder has been demonstrated [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bleeding – Significantly higher bleeding times and an increased frequency of bleeding episodes requiring transfusion have been observed postoperatively in patients with unhealthy alcohol use [<a href="#rid17">17,22</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cardiopulmonary insufficiency:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Risky alcohol use and alcohol use disorders are known to cause cardiomyopathy, and patients with unhealthy alcohol use have decreased preoperative ejection fractions compared with controls [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Depressed cardiac function may predispose patients to increased postoperative ischemia and arrhythmias [<a href="#rid17">17,23</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3467.html" rel="external">"Alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Arrhythmias can develop in patients with unhealthy alcohol use without preexisting cardiac disease. The "holiday heart syndrome" refers to arrhythmias classically occurring after episodes of binge drinking, often atrial fibrillation [<a href="#rid24">24-28</a>]. Surgery is often a risk factor for heart problems, including arrhythmias, which can be compounded by concomitant unhealthy alcohol consumption. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1004.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, risk factors, and prevention of atrial fibrillation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Liver disease – Alcohol-associated liver disease, including fatty liver, alcohol hepatitis and alcohol cirrhosis, may affect surgical risk.

Alcohol withdrawal syndrome is comprised of withdrawal signs and symptoms along with associated distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning [<a href="#rid31">31-33</a>]. Among surgical patients with unhealthy drinking, patients who experience perioperative alcohol withdrawal have higher levels of morbidity than patients without withdrawal [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Mild to moderate symptoms of alcohol withdrawal include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Insomnia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Tremulousness</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mild anxiety</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Gastrointestinal upset</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anorexia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Headache</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diaphoresis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Palpitations</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Tachycardia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypertension</p><p></p><p>Symptoms of severe alcohol withdrawal, which can be life threatening, include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Disorientation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hyperthermia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Agitation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hallucinations</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Seizures</p><p></p><p>The time course for the development of alcohol withdrawal syndrome varies, often from individual to individual and by the nature, frequency, and volume of the alcohol consumption by the individual prior to alcohol cessation. Early symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome can begin as early as two hours after cessation of or significant reduction in alcohol consumption. Severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome symptoms typically peak within four days after onset and usually subside within a week  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75499" href="/z/d/graphic/75499.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Seizures and hallucinations, however, can occur early in the course of withdrawal and in the absence of hyperautonomic symptoms. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/323.html" rel="external">"Management of moderate and severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes"</a>.)</p><p>It is important, if possible, to query patients about their typical alcohol withdrawal syndrome, to help planning prophylactic or definitive treatment for a particular individual. Clinical manifestations, course, diagnosis, and management of alcohol withdrawal is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/323.html" rel="external">"Management of moderate and severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7801.html" rel="external">"Alcohol withdrawal: Ambulatory management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3084444"><span class="h2">Intraoperative issues</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Unhealthy alcohol use among surgical patients can complicate the administration and dosing of anesthesia and analgesia, due to widespread and complex effects of alcohol on virtually all systems. Any patient with a history of regular alcohol consumption may require additional anesthesia. Studies have documented increased anesthesia requirements for both induction and analgesia among patients with unhealthy alcohol use [<a href="#rid34">34-36</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients consuming greater than 40 g of alcohol/day for at least two years have been found to require more <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9826" href="/z/d/drug information/9826.html" rel="external">propofol</a> to induce anesthesia compared with patients without unhealthy use (&lt;40 g alcohol/day) or who did not consume alcohol [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with DSM-IV alcohol dependence have been found to require significantly larger doses of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8441" href="/z/d/drug information/8441.html" rel="external">fentanyl</a> than those without a diagnosis of alcohol dependence to achieve adequate analgesia at the time of surgery [<a href="#rid35">35,36</a>].</p><p></p><p>Acute alcohol consumption prior to surgery may prolong the duration of action of several medications used perioperatively, including <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9829" href="/z/d/drug information/9829.html" rel="external">propranolol</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9763" href="/z/d/drug information/9763.html" rel="external">phenobarbital</a> [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Chronic alcohol consumption induces the cytochrome P-450 system, potentially shortening the duration of action of other medications used perioperatively.</p><p>Patients with unhealthy drinking experience increased surgical stress. Acute physical stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, resulting in increased serum cortisol levels. Surgery is a known potent stimulus for HPA activation. The "surgical stress" response triggers multiple physiologic changes including increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, and increased plasma catecholamine levels. The stress response begins at the time of incision, peaks upon cessation of anesthesia and return of pain sensation, and continues throughout the postoperative period [<a href="#rid38">38</a>].</p><p>A number of intraoperative complications common in patients with unhealthy alcohol use can affect hemostasis. A study of patients with traumatic hemorrhage found patients with unhealthy alcohol use less able to maintain adequate blood pressures during surgery [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].

All preoperative patients should be assessed for quantity, frequency, and recency of alcohol use. This allows clinicians to anticipate operative and postoperative complications.</p><p>The primary function of screening in the preoperative period is to ensure that persons with unhealthy alcohol use are identified. If identified, practitioners should assess for risky alcohol use and alcohol use disorders and for potential physical alcohol dependence, which can cause alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Screening instruments and approaches to severity assessment are described in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14843.html" rel="external">"Screening for unhealthy use of alcohol and other drugs in primary care", section on 'Screening tests'</a>.)</p><p>There exists several instruments to screen for unhealthy alcohol consumption that may be appropriate for use in the perioperative period. For example, the three-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) can screen for unhealthy alcohol use prior to surgery. A score of 5 or more in the year before surgery has been associated with increased postoperative complications [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. An alternative is to screen with a single question: "How many times in the past year have you had five or more drinks in a day (four for women)". A response of one or more indicates unhealthy use. Patients screening positive should be assessed for quantity, frequency, and recency of use. In addition, they should then be screened for alcohol use disorder, using standard instruments.</p><p>Patients with heavy drinking episodes (identifiable through the AUDIT-C or single screening question described above) are at risk of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. For such patients, they should be inquired about their last drink, the volume of recent consumption, and history of withdrawal symptoms. If they do have a history of withdrawal, they should be carefully questioned about their typical course of alcohol withdrawal including history of major consequences of withdrawal (eg, timing and duration of hallucinations, seizures, delirium tremens).</p><p>Some patients may not disclose their alcohol consumption in the perioperative period (eg, due to fear of not having elective surgery), or may not be able to do so (eg, under sedation, unconscious). Inquiry to patterns of alcohol consumption should be made in a nonthreatening manner without fear of retribution or consequences to the patient. Surrogate interviews, medical history, physical examination, and laboratory studies can provide information on alcohol consumption, signs and symptoms of unhealthy alcohol use, alcohol withdrawal, and resulting end-organ damage.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Risk factors that suggest possible physiologic alcohol dependence include presentation with alcohol intoxication or a detectable (and particularly a high) blood or breath alcohol level or a past history of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The emergence of alcohol withdrawal symptoms may be the first sign of physiologic dependence in some patients. Risk factors associated with severe and prolonged withdrawal including amount and duration of alcohol use, prior withdrawal episodes, recurrent detoxifications, older age, and comorbid disease, are described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/323.html" rel="external">"Management of moderate and severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes", section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Physical examination findings indicative of acute or chronic hepatic injury can aid diagnosis but are generally not sufficiently sensitive or specific to identify current unhealthy alcohol use.

Regardless, patients with significant alcohol consumption may have impairment of INR and liver enzymes causing potential perioperative bleeding problems or drug interactions. In particular, reduced hepatic metabolism that may complicate perioperative anesthetic and analgesic management.</p><p></p><p>All patients with known or suspected unhealthy alcohol use, particularly those with recent and frequent heavy drinking, should be systematically assessed for signs/symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome using a validated instrument such as the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, revised  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64835" href="/z/d/graphic/64835.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid41">41</a>].

The psychiatric diagnoses in DSM-IV-TR, alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence, were replaced by one diagnosis, alcohol use disorder, in DSM-5. Although the crosswalk between DSM-IV and DSM-5 disorders is imprecise, alcohol dependence is approximately comparable to the moderate to severe subtype of alcohol use. Alcohol abuse is comparable to a mild alcohol use disorder.

There is some evidence of benefits to this approach. A randomized trial of 42 patients with daily heavy drinking compared alcohol use disorder treatment (800 mg of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9379" href="/z/d/drug information/9379.html" rel="external">disulfiram</a> twice weekly to achieve and maintain abstinence) with no treatment one month before surgery [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].

As an example, in a clinical trial, 3139 patients scheduled to undergo elective inpatient surgery were screened to identify 136 patients with unhealthy alcohol use; they were randomly assigned to receive a customized brief intervention or to a control condition [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. At six months' follow-up assessment both groups experienced a reduction in drinking; they did not differ in the amount consumed or in postoperative complications. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14832.html" rel="external">"Brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol and other drug use: Efficacy, adverse effects, and administration"</a>.)</p><p>For patients with unhealthy alcohol use who refuse preoperative alcohol use disorder treatment or whose urgent need for surgery precludes treatment, the perioperative period typically involves contacts with several clinicians, providing an important opportunity for patient education and encouraging the patient to transition to alcohol use disorder treatment following surgery. The patient’s need for surgery can be a powerful motivator for modifying behaviors that may have contributed to health consequences.</p><p>Preoperative consultation with a healthcare provider with addiction expertise (eg, addiction psychiatrist, addiction medicine clinician) may be useful, depending on the treating physician’s knowledge and experience treating alcohol use disorder and alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The consultant would interview the patient, identify the presence and extent of unhealthy alcohol use, determine risk of withdrawal, develop a plan with the patient to minimize alcohol-related surgical morbidity, and review treatment options. Frequent contact with the specialist and the patient in the perioperative period may enhance outcomes (eg, length of stay, use of benzodiazepines), but further research in this area is warranted.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3084061"><span class="h3">Preventing/treating withdrawal</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with recent history of known or suspected frequent heavy alcohol use require ongoing monitoring for symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and treatment, if present, with a cross-tolerant medication. Patients with risky alcohol use but no recent frequent heavy use and those without physiological dependence do not need supervised withdrawal or prophylaxis prior to alcohol use disorder treatment. (See <a class="local">'Alcohol withdrawal syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p>Benzodiazepines are the mainstay of treatment for alcohol withdrawal and may be used to prevent alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Benzodiazepines have been found to reduce the severity of withdrawal symptoms and incidence of delirium and seizures more effectively and safely than other agents [<a href="#rid48">48,49</a>]. We recommend that alcohol not be used to treat symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Study of alcohol for this purpose has been limited; it is difficult to titrate, has been associated with surgical and medical complications (eg, anemia and hepatic enzyme elevations) and end-organ effects, and is less efficacious compared with benzodiazepines [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. Beyond benzodiazepines, there exists other pharmacologic treatments of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, but at the time of this writing, they are the preferred agent, particularly in controlled inpatient environments. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/323.html" rel="external">"Management of moderate and severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes", section on 'Alternative and contraindicated agents'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3085229"><span class="h4">Monitoring</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with known or suspected frequent or heavy alcohol use need ongoing monitoring to detect the emergence of signs and symptoms of withdrawal. Use of a validated instrument such as the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, revised, a measure of withdrawal severity, is suggested  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64835" href="/z/d/graphic/64835.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid41">41</a>].</p><p>Identifying alcohol withdrawal accurately in patients during or following surgery can be challenging, and often assessment using validated instruments of alcohol withdrawal syndrome are imprecise. As an example, patients may not be able to communicate, and other perioperative signs and symptoms (eg, tremulousness, fever/sweat) may impart a falsely high reading on the withdrawal instrument. Administration of withdrawal instruments in the postoperative period may be complicated by endotracheal intubation, decreased level of consciousness, or inability to communicate with the assessor [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/323.html" rel="external">"Management of moderate and severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes"</a>.)</p><p>The presentation of alcohol withdrawal can be similar to manifestations of the stress responses; difficulty differentiating between the two syndromes can delay time to recognition of withdrawal, increasing the morbidity of patients with physiologic dependence on alcohol. The preoperative evaluation for potential unhealthy alcohol use and potential for alcohol withdrawal syndrome may inform the differentiation. In patients with suspected (but uncertain) unhealthy alcohol use, the clinician can provide alcohol withdrawal syndrome prophylaxis and low-dose alcohol withdrawal syndrome pharmacotherapy while monitoring physical signs and their response to treatment until the patient is able to communicate.</p><p>Emerging alcohol withdrawal syndrome symptoms days after the surgery may tip the clinician to institute full alcohol withdrawal syndrome treatment. In all patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome symptoms postoperatively who are unable or unwilling to be assessed for their preoperative alcohol consumption, preoperative unhealthy alcohol consumption and alcohol withdrawal syndrome should be considered. As an example, postoperative delirium is common and can present similarly regardless of whether due to alcohol withdrawal or other causes  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59943" href="/z/d/graphic/59943.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid52">52</a>]. The clinician must consider a differential diagnosis that includes cardiovascular, endocrine, infectious, metabolic, neurologic, oncologic, psychiatric, pulmonary, and medication-related causes.</p><p>Because patients with unhealthy alcohol use may be at risk for or have medical and mental health conditions associated with their use, these conditions could be exacerbated in the postoperative period.
