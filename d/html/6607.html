         Sexual abuse occurs when a child engages in sexual activity for which they cannot give consent, is unprepared for developmentally, and cannot comprehend. This includes fondling and all forms of oral-genital, genital, or anal contact with the child (whether the victim is clothed or unclothed), as well as non-touching abuses such as exhibitionism, voyeurism, or involving the child in pornography [

         The management of sexual abuse involves prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and pregnancy. Psychosocial support and anticipatory guidance should also be offered to the victims and their non-offending caregivers.

         Although evaluation and management of sexual abuse should be performed by an experienced child abuse team (including a child abuse specialist or clinician with similar experience) whenever possible, urgent evaluation is necessary under the following circumstances and typically occurs in an emergency setting (see

         The need for STI prophylaxis depends upon whether the patient is pre- or postpubertal:

         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         receive antibiotic prophylaxis. STI prophylaxis is not routinely recommended for prepubertal victims for the following reasons [
         <a href="#rid4">

         Excessive concern by the caregiver or child concerning STI may make prophylactic treatment appropriate. However, cultures must be obtained prior to treatment whenever prophylaxis is prescribed. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6605.html" rel="external">
          "Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents", section on 'Sexually transmitted infection testing'

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Diagnoses of STIs in prepubertal children have profound consequences for the child, family or caregivers, and alleged perpetrator and are likely to be challenged in court. Because cultures can miss some STIs, prophylaxis can complicate efforts to protect children when initial testing is in doubt. Given the low risk of ascending infection in prepubertal children, it is reasonable to withhold treatment until all follow-up testing is complete and a definitive diagnosis has been established.

         <strong>
          Postpubertal
         </strong>
         – We suggest that postpubertal children who have been sexually abused receive antibiotic prophylaxis for STIs. Postpubertal females should definitely be offered STI prophylaxis if the assailant is known to be infected, the victim has signs or symptoms of infection, or at the victim's request. Additional considerations are the high prevalence of pre-existing asymptomatic infection, the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, and the possibility of loss to follow-up. For these reasons, STI prophylaxis is routinely offered even when there are no symptoms, and the infection status of the assailant is unknown.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Some experts recommend that all postpubertal patients be screened for STIs, including HIV, because the prevalence of pre-existing asymptomatic infection is high [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Others do not routinely test for STI because identification of an infection is unlikely to provide useful evidence and prophylactic treatment is typically prescribed regardless of culture results. Therefore, the decision to test a victim of sexual abuse for STIs should be made on an individual basis [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4

         Testing for STIs in pediatric victims of sexual abuse is covered in greater detail separately. (See

         Almost no clinical trials of STI-related pharmaceuticals include participants younger than 16 years of age, and relatively few include 16- to 17-year-olds. Most data regarding safety and efficacy are extrapolated from late adolescents and young adults.

         Definitive data concerning the risk of acquiring HIV for sexually abused children and adolescents are lacking, although there have been reports of HIV transmission after rape in adults and from sexual abuse in children [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-9
         </a>
         ]. The risk of transmission of the virus may be greater in girls than in adult women because vaginal epithelium in children is thin and adolescents have more cervical ectopy than adults. In addition, children may have been exposed to the same perpetrator repeatedly over time.
        </p>
        <p>
         Recommendations for HIV prophylaxis are generalized from the model for occupational HIV exposure [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. For adult rape victims, antiretroviral prophylaxis is generally recommended if it can be initiated within 72 hours of exposure, and ideally within four hours. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2765.html" rel="external">
          "Evaluation and management of adult and adolescent sexual assault victims in the emergency department", section on 'HIV infection'

         For children and adolescents, decisions regarding HIV prophylaxis are usually made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the following factors [

         Nonadherence to HIV prophylaxis among sexual assault survivors appears to be prevalent. In several retrospective studies describing HIV prophylaxis for pediatric and adult sexual assault victims, between 13 and 24 percent of patients completed the full 28-day prophylaxis regimen [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12-14
         </a>
         ]. Nonadherence to the prophylaxis regimen may limit its effectiveness as well as increase the likelihood that the patient will develop viral resistance. Consequently, the decision to initiate antiretroviral therapy must include counseling for the victim and family or caregivers and close follow-up. Consultation with a specialist in treating HIV-infected children is advised [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. For clinicians in the United States, the Warmline National HIV telephone consultation service (1-800-933-3413) is also available to provide current HIV clinical and drug information and expert case consultation.

         For children who have been sexually abused, there is evidence of a higher risk for early sexual debut and therefore, a higher risk of acquiring STIs, including human papillomavirus (HPV) [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. For this reason, HPV vaccination is recommended at nine years of age or older as a preventative measure among those children who have a known or suspected history of sexual abuse [

         The majority of children who are evaluated for sexual abuse can be discharged with close outpatient follow-up. Indications for hospitalization in child or adolescent victims of sexual abuse include severe injury requiring treatment or when the home environment is unsafe and there are no alternatives for placement.

         The child's physical and emotional well-being is of primary concern [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Whenever possible, involvement of a social worker with experience supporting victims of sexual abuse should occur during the initial evaluation. The child should be reassured that what happened was not the child's fault and that they did nothing wrong. Children in whom sexual abuse is confirmed or suspected should be referred to a mental health professional for evaluation and counseling. The family or caregivers of the victim may also need treatment and support to cope with the emotional trauma of their child's abuse [

         For children who develop psychological sequelae as the result of sexual abuse, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), as part of a broader psychosocial intervention, may be helpful. In a systematic review that described 10 randomized trials, CBT appeared to have a positive, though not statistically significant, impact on immediate and longer-term sequelae among children who had been sexually abused [

         For children whose examination is normal, the patient and family or caregivers should be informed that the absence of physical findings does not exclude abuse. For patients with abnormal physical findings, the differential diagnosis must be discussed with the family or caregivers. The child and family or caregiver should be reassured that injuries typically heal rapidly [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. The potential risks of STIs (including HIV), as well as decisions to perform cultures or provide prophylactic therapy, should also be addressed. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         The anticipated involvement and intervention of child protective services (CPS) and possible law enforcement should be discussed with the child and parents or caregivers. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6604.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Additional concerns that the patient and/or family or caregivers may have about the effects of the abuse (eg, that it has caused the child to lose his or her virginity or may alter the sexual orientation of the child) should be elicited. Listening to family or caregiver concerns and providing reassurance are often the most important aspects of the evaluation [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The support that children receive from non-offending caregivers has significant impact on the child's psychological recovery from sexual abuse. The presence of an adult who believes and supports the child is vital to recovery and can have a larger impact than abuse-related factors [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. Caregivers often struggle with how to best assist a child after sexual abuse. Stressing the importance of their emotional support is beneficial to the caregiver as well as the child.
        </p>
        <p>
         Parents or caregivers may wonder whether they should attempt to gain further history or details of the assault from their child. Parents or caregivers should be counseled that questioning by an untrained interviewer may complicate further forensic interviews or investigations, but that the child should always feel safe and listened to should they decide to discuss the episode. In short, the parent should be open to any history the child gives but should not attempt to obtain further detail themselves.

         Pre-employment screening – All staff and volunteers who have access to children in a health care setting should undergo screening during recruitment and hiring. The screening should consist of any history of child abuse allegations as determined by examination of prior employment and checks of criminal background and child abuse registries. While essential, employment screening alone is insufficient to provide protection because a small minority of people who molest children have a criminal record.

         Response to abuse allegations – All patient, parent/caregiver, or staff allegations of sexual abuse by a health care provider require documentation, timely investigation, and, when there is sufficient suspicion for sexual abuse, adherence to mandated reporting, if not already performed, according to legal requirements of the jurisdiction (see

         In the early stages of an assessment about alleged sexual abuse, non-offending caregivers may benefit from guidance as to their role in obtaining the history of abuse. Caregivers should be counseled that it is not their role to conduct a forensic interview of the child, but that they should be open to a child's history or questions, and that they should make the child feel safe in reporting or discussing any abusive activity [

         Non-offending parents or caregivers often describe the disclosure of child sexual abuse as a major life crisis with a variety of emotional reactions. They may be unsure of how to respond to the child after the disclosure and may be unprepared for the emotional and behavioral sequelae. Caregivers may become isolated from other family members or may experience financial challenges if their partner was the perpetrator of abuse. Thus, support of the non-offending caretakers can be critical to the healing process of the child [

          Management
         </strong>
         – The management of all children who have been sexually abused must include attention to the immediate medical and social needs of patients and families or caregivers as well as to the local requirements for mandated reporting. Management should be performed by a multidisciplinary child abuse team whenever possible. Urgent evaluation and treatment, typically in an emergency setting, is necessary for patients with any one of the following situations (see
         <a class="local">

          STI prophylaxis
         </strong>
         – With regard to prophylactic treatments to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs), we offer the following recommendations (see
         <a class="local">
          'Sexually transmitted infection prophylaxis'

         We suggest that prepubertal children who have no symptoms of STIs
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         receive antibiotic prophylaxis (

          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Children who are prescribed prophylaxis should have specimens sent for culture prior to treatment. (See

         We suggest that postpubertal children who have been sexually abused receive antibiotic prophylaxis for STIs (

          Grade 2C

         Clinicians considering prescribing HIV prophylaxis for children who have been sexually abused should consult with a specialist in treating HIV-infected children. (See

         Victims of sexual abuse warrant assessment for hepatitis prophylaxis. The approach depends upon whether the perpetrator is known to be hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive and the vaccination status of the victim. (See

          Emergency contraception

          Sequelae

         – Children who have been sexually abused may experience psychological and behavioral sequelae. They and their families or caregivers should be offered a referral to a mental health professional. (See

          Reporting and disposition
         </strong>
         – Physicians in many countries (eg, United States, Canada, Germany, and Japan) are required to report all cases of suspected or known child sexual abuse. The designated agency to which sexual abuse should be reported varies by region; physicians should be aware of the local laws. (See
         <a class="local">
