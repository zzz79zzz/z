Information about COVID-19 continues to accrue, and interim guidance by multiple organizations is constantly being updated and expanded in an attempt to balance evidence-based maternity care with COVID-19-related infection control practices. The screening and infection control guidance in this topic generally applies to areas where the infection is prevalent; these measures can be relaxed in areas of low prevalence and high rates of vaccination.</p><p>This topic will discuss issues related to COVID-19 during labor, delivery, and the postpartum period.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/130296.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: General approach to infection prevention in the health care setting", section on 'Precautions for those NOT suspected of having COVID-19'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>SARS-CoV-2 testing </strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Indications for universal testing</strong> – In areas with a moderate to high level of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community (moderate to high viral transmission is defined as &gt;10 [moderate] to &gt;100 [severe] cases per 100,000 people or a test positivity rate of &gt;5 [moderate] to &gt;10 [severe] percent [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]), universal testing with a rapid SARS-CoV-2 test upon presentation to the labor and delivery unit (or the day before if a scheduled admission) is reasonable, given the correlation between community and obstetric inpatient rates and the insensitivity of symptom- and contact-based screening alone [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. This information is useful to inform infection control precautions both intrapartum and postpartum, including newborn care.

An antigen test should be used instead of a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) since some people remain NAAT positive but are noninfectious during this period. Symptomatic patients who tested positive in the previous 90 days are managed based on their symptoms.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Universal use of masks in the health care setting</strong> – Universal masking is required for all patients, support persons, visitors, and health care personnel to reduce transmission of the virus from unsuspected carriers.

It is reasonable for pregnant people to wear a mask or respirator in indoor public spaces even at the low community level, as there is no known harm from wearing a mask or respirator and there are potential benefits. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126981.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Epidemiology, virology, and prevention", section on 'Wearing masks in the community'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H441494411"><span class="h3">Other potential interventions</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Limiting time on the labor unit</strong> – Time in the labor unit should be limited, as is safely feasible, during periods of moderate to high viral transmission. For example, patients with low-risk pregnancies who are in early labor can remain at home, with telephone support by a midwife if possible. Patients with low-risk pregnancies who are going to be induced can undergo outpatient rather than inpatient cervical ripening with a balloon catheter. For inpatient cervical ripening, using two methods (eg, mechanical and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9657" href="/z/d/drug information/9657.html" rel="external">misoprostol</a> or mechanical and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9734" href="/z/d/drug information/9734.html" rel="external">oxytocin</a>) may decrease the time from induction to birth, compared with using a single agent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although nosocomial transmission rates are very low, health care systems tend to be overburdened during periods of moderate to high viral transmission in the community.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Limiting support persons and visitors</strong> – Visitor and support person restrictions have been relaxed since the beginning of the pandemic. Most facilities recognize that a support person is important to many laboring patients and permit at least one support person. A doula is considered a type of health care personnel by some facilities and a visitor by others. In some areas, both a family support person and a doula are allowed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4438.html" rel="external">"Continuous labor support by a doula"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, we limit movement of the support person. In these cases, the support person should remain with the laboring patient (ie, may not leave the room and then return) throughout labor and birth.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A support person with any signs/symptoms consistent with COVID-19 or a positive test for COVID-19 within 10 days should not be allowed to physically attend the labor and birth; this duration may need to be extended in some patients. When screen-positive or additional support persons are desired, they can be a part of the patient's labor and delivery via video.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Support persons with a known exposure in the last 10 days, no symptoms, and a negative test for COVID-19 may be allowed to attend the labor and birth but must always wear a well-fitting mask. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Limiting time in the hospital and office visits after birth</strong> – As discussed above, although nosocomial transmission rates are very low, health care systems tend to be overburdened during periods of moderate to high viral transmission in the community. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127759.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Evaluation of adults with acute illness in the outpatient setting", section on 'General principles'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>After the birth, we suggest sending patients home as soon as they are stable and ready [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. This may be as soon as one day after a cesarean birth. However, this should be considered in the context of the clinical scenario (eg, infection prevalence in the community, vaccination status) since early discharge may place additional burdens on families to access recommended newborn care and pediatric offices to provide this care [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Modifying or reducing in-person postpartum outpatient care in the midst of the pandemic is appropriate. For example, it may be possible to perform early postpartum assessments, including wound and blood pressure checks, with telehealth. A comprehensive postpartum visit may still be important by 12 weeks, especially in patients with comorbidities and in patients who lose insurance coverage at that time.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">In-person health care provider visits require the patient to leave their home, traveling via public, private, or emergency transport and potentially exposing others to SARS-CoV-2.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H751160586"><span class="h1">INTRAPARTUM CARE OF PATIENTS NOT SUSPECTED OF INFECTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Intrapartum care is generally routine for patients not suspected of being infected, except for the infection control precautions described above. (See <a class="local">'Infection control precautions, intrapartum and postpartum'</a> above.)</p><p>Some additional issues to consider include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intrapartum fever</strong> — COVID-19 should be part of the differential diagnosis of intrapartum fever, particularly when accompanied by respiratory symptoms and hypoxemia. Such patients should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 if not previously tested, along with evaluation for common causes of intrapartum fever (eg, chorioamnionitis, epidural fever) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. We do not routinely retest febrile patients within 72 hours of a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test if a non-COVID-19-related cause of fever has been diagnosed (eg, chorioamnionitis) and the patient has no respiratory symptoms. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4453.html" rel="external">"Intrapartum fever"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Umbilical cord blood banking</strong> — Umbilical cord blood banking can be performed if planned; the risk of COVID-19 transmission by blood cells has not been documented and is unclear at present [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H808595098"><span class="h1">INTRAPARTUM CARE OF INFECTED PATIENTS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1701040868"><span class="h2">Health care workers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When caring for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, health care workers should use contact and droplet precautions with eye protection (ie, gown; gloves; N95, surgical, or medical procedure mask; face shield or goggles). In particular, during episodes of patient deep respiratory efforts in the active phase and while pushing, health care workers should use both contact and droplet precautions with eye protection and airborne precautions (ie, N95 mask or powered air purifying respirator). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/130296.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: General approach to infection prevention in the health care setting", section on 'Health care personnel'</a>.)</p><p>Health care workers are at risk for developing COVID-19 through exposures in the community, as well as in the health care setting. Guidelines for work restriction and monitoring after exposure and returning to work after exposure and after confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are available separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/130296.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: General approach to infection prevention in the health care setting", section on 'Management of HCP'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2795010739"><span class="h2">Choosing the route of birth</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>COVID-19 is generally not an indication to alter the planned route of birth [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Induction generally can be performed safely, even in intubated patients [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>].</p><p>Cesarean birth is performed for standard obstetrical indications and does not appear to reduce the already low risk for neonatal COVID-19, which generally causes only mild symptoms in newborns [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127535.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Overview of pregnancy issues", section on 'Risk of vertical transmission'</a>).

In the setting of maternal COVID-19 infection or maternal COVID-19 vaccination, the infant may receive passive antibody protection (both IgA and IgG neutralizing antibodies) against the virus since breast milk is a source of maternal antibodies and other anti-infective factors.

This approach considers the clear mother-infant benefits of breastfeeding, the low likelihood of passing maternal infection to the newborn when infection precautions are taken, the favorable effects of passive antibody protection, and the nonsevere course of newborn infection when it does occur. This policy was based, in part, on a study from New York City that tested and followed 82 infants of 116 mothers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2: no infant was positive for SARS-CoV-2 postnatally, although most roomed-in with their mothers and were breastfed [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].
