         Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice. Given the frequency of AF in the general population, many patients undergoing noncardiac surgery will have AF before, during, or after surgery. In some, the diagnosis is established, while in others it is new.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with AF are at increased risk for death, heart failure, and thromboembolic events. This risk likely increases around the time of noncardiac surgery due to perioperative stresses.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will focus on management issues specific to these patients. Other relevant topics include:

         The prevalence of AF the United States is approximately 3 million [
         <a href="#rid1">

         <a href="#rid2">
          2-4
         </a>
         ]. Projections of AF prevalence in the United States by the year 2050 range from 5.6 to 16 million [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,4
         </a>
         ]. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, AF is common in patients who need to undergo noncardiac surgery. In a study of 38,047 patients undergoing noncardiac surgery over seven years, 4312 patients (11 percent) had a prior history of AF [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. In the same study, a history of AF was associated with a 30-day postoperative mortality rate of 6.4 percent, compared with a rate of 2.9 percent in patients with coronary artery disease. This underscores the fact that perioperative mortality is twofold higher in patients with AF compared with those with coronary artery disease [
         <a href="#rid5">

         In patients with known AF, elective noncardiac surgery should be deferred until rate and rhythm are felt to be optimal for surgery and a decision has been made as to how to manage anticoagulant therapy. (See
         <a class="local">

        </p>
        <p>
         Major cardiac events (eg, death, heart failure, or stroke) due to AF have two primary etiologies: AF with rapid ventricular response (leading to severe palpitations, cardiac ischemia, or global hemodynamic compromise) and systemic thromboembolism. The principal goals of the preoperative evaluation and management of patients with known AF are to ensure hemodynamic stability and optimal anticoagulation status in the perioperative period.

         Patients with known AF are typically managed long term with either a rhythm- or a rate-control strategy [

         Paroxysmal AF patients may present for noncardiac surgery in sinus rhythm or in AF (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/956.html" rel="external">
          "Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation", section on 'Management'
         </a>
         ). This is true for patients with or without ongoing drug therapy or prior catheter ablation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Asymptomatic recurrences of AF are common in patients who are on antiarrhythmic drug therapy or who have had prior ablation. In the absence of symptoms or rapid rates, there is generally no need to restore sinus rhythm or delay surgery. Rhythm-controlling drugs should be continued throughout the perioperative period. For patients who are expected to be in sinus rhythm due to the infrequent nature of their AF paroxysms or due to successful rhythm control strategies such as the use of antiarrhythmic drug therapy or prior catheter ablation, the presence of AF may be unexpected. The failure of the rhythm control strategy should be investigated, unless surgery is urgent. A decision to proceed with surgery prior to addressing the failure of the rhythm control strategy will need to take into account the urgency of the surgery.
        </p>
        <p>
         In some patients, it may be prudent to proceed with surgery, as restoration of sinus rhythm with manipulation of antiarrhythmic drug therapy or another ablation procedure may delay surgery for weeks to months. (See

         </span>
         Patients presenting in AF should have the rate adequately controlled to avoid rapid ventricular rates and the possibility of ensuing cardiac ischemia. We do not suggest cardioversion in the preoperative period because this would mandate uninterrupted systemic anticoagulation for a minimum of four weeks after restoration of sinus rhythm, which may increase the risk of bleeding during the surgical procedure or be contraindicated.

        </p>
        <p>
         Major adverse cardiac events in AF patients undergoing noncardiac surgery may be due to inadequate rate control and attendant cardiac ischemia during the perioperative period. Rate control is most often achieved pharmacologically, with beta blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, or (less frequently)

        <p>
         Prior to surgery, heart rates between 50 and 100 beats per minute (bpm) are reasonable as long as the patient is asymptomatic [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Postoperatively, in our experience, heart rates as high as 120 bpm are reasonable given the stressors of pain or hypovolemia, as long as these increased heart rates do not cause hemodynamic instability or myocardial ischemia. (See

         Many AF patients receive long-term oral anticoagulation to reduce the risk of embolic events (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1031.html" rel="external">
          "Atrial fibrillation in adults: Use of oral anticoagulants"
         </a>
         ). While some surgical procedures can be performed safely on patients who are systemically anticoagulated [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ], interruption of anticoagulation during the perioperative period is required in others where the perioperative bleeding risk is high. This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1312.html" rel="external">
          "Perioperative management of patients receiving anticoagulants"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Certain surgical procedures (eg, cardiac device implantation) carry low bleeding risk, and may be performed safely without interruption of systemic anticoagulation [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. In patients with high risk of periprocedural bleeding, however, interruption of anticoagulation may be necessary. Risk factors for periprocedural hemorrhage include recent major bleeding, thrombocytopenia, dual antiplatelet therapy, supratherapeutic anticoagulation (as indicated by international normalized ratio), or a history of perioperative bleeding in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
         For those patients who will have their anticoagulation interrupted, thromboembolic risk and estimation of bleeding risk should be weighed to determine duration of anticoagulation cessation. Longer interruption will increase risk of systemic thromboembolism. Decisions about the timing and duration of anticoagulation interruption require communication between the surgical and anesthesia teams and the physicians managing the patient's anticoagulation. Suggestions for the discontinuation of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants in the perioperative time period are made in a table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120231" href="/z/d/graphic/120231.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). This will facilitate an accurate assessment of bleeding and stroke risks, and establish a plan for the conduct of anesthesia. For instance, neuraxial procedures are typically contraindicated if there has been anticoagulation with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8926" href="/z/d/drug information/8926.html" rel="external">
          dabigatran
         </a>
         within the prior four to five days or factor Xa inhibitors within the prior three to five days, and anticoagulation should not be restarted until 24 hours after catheter removal [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. In addition, it is critical that the patient is involved in the risk conversation. Some patients may opt to defer elective surgery, knowing that there is always some risk of stroke associated with interruption of oral anticoagulation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Determining when anticoagulation should be interrupted is critical, as premature interruption may unnecessarily increase stroke risk, and delayed interruption may increase surgical bleeding risk (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1312.html" rel="external">
          "Perioperative management of patients receiving anticoagulants", section on 'Timing of anticoagulant interruption'
         </a>
         ). In general, we suggest cessation of vitamin K antagonists roughly three to five days prior to anticipated surgery, and cessation of direct oral anticoagulants three days prior to surgery. Bridging therapy in patients at high risk for thromboembolism and taking
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">
          warfarin
         </a>
         may be performed with low molecular weight heparin, with the last injection typically delivered no less than 12 hours prior to surgery. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOAC; also referred to as non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [NOAC]) should be discontinued for one to three days prior to surgery, depending on the risk of surgery, renal function, and the specific DOAC [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13-15
         </a>
         ]. Manufacturer guidelines can be useful for guidance.

Careful clinical decision making and discussion with the patient are encouraged. In general, if there is a high bleeding risk, bridging therapy should not be initiated. If the patient's bleeding risk is low and the patient has a history of a prior thromboembolic event, then bridging is encouraged. If there is a low bleeding risk and no prior thromboembolism, then bridging is not indicated. (See

         A new diagnosis of AF may be made at the time of preoperative evaluation. A few other patients will develop AF intraoperatively or in the first day or two after surgery (see
         <a class="local">
          'Postoperative atrial fibrillation'
         </a>
         below). Our approach to these patients is generally similar to that in patients with new onset AF not related to noncardiac surgery. (See

         AF diagnosed preoperatively may arise in the setting of a risk factor such as hypertension or from an underlying systemic disorder such as severe hyperthyroidism. Both the AF and the underlying disorder may be a source of perioperative risk unless recognized and managed. For these reasons, we suggest that newly discovered AF be treated as a potentially unstable condition that should preclude elective noncardiac surgery. Diagnosis and management of newly discovered AF are discussed elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1022.html" rel="external">

         However, for these patients presenting for
         <strong>
          minor
         </strong>
         surgical procedures, typically of limited duration and complexity (eg, monitored anesthesia care using local anesthetics with minimal anticipated blood loss), it may be reasonable to safely proceed despite new onset AF, as long as the patient is asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable. These patients should subsequently be referred for early evaluation and management of AF. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1022.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Data on rates of incident AF discovered immediately prior to noncardiac surgery are largely lacking. Given the prevalence of AF in the general United States population of roughly 5 million, and the observation that prevalence of both AF and indications for noncardiac surgery both increase with age and systemic illnesses including hypertension and diabetes mellitus, it is anticipated that health care providers will be confronted with newly discovered AF in the preoperative setting. (See

         For patients who develop intraoperative AF, the immediate concern is hemodynamic stability. Anticoagulation is not urgently required and can be considered after surgery. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Anticoagulation after surgery'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         If there is hemodynamic instability such as hypotension, evidence of pulmonary congestion, or electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia, cardioversion should be performed intraoperatively, as soon as this can be attempted without compromising the surgical procedure. Since intraoperative cardioversion requires placement of external defibrillation pads, deep sedation or general anesthesia, and possible patient repositioning to a supine position, the decision to perform this procedure requires thoughtful discussion between the anesthesiologist and surgeon. If the patient is hemodynamically stable, it is reasonable to perform a cardioversion at the end of the surgery while the patient is already under anesthesia. However, the physiological stress that may have triggered AF may still be present and the patient may develop recurrent AF after cardioversion.
        </p>
        <p>
         For those in whom cardioversion will not take place, rate control needs to be considered. Beta blockers or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are given to slow the heart rate intraoperatively in patients who develop AF. For most patients in the operating room, the heart rate goal is &lt;100 to 110 beats per minute. The rate should also be guided by restoration of acceptable blood pressure and resolution of new electrocardiographic ST or T wave abnormalities.

         An electrocardiogram should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis, and electrolytes should be evaluated. Unless there is a clinical suspicion for an acute coronary syndrome or electrocardiographic evidence of cardiac ischemia or injury, cardiac biomarkers including troponin are usually not needed. However, if there is uncertainty about the presence of ischemia or if the patient cannot provide an adequate history postoperatively, it is not unreasonable to test biomarkers.

        <p>
         Management of the AF is then dependent on symptoms, duration of AF, and need for rate or rhythm control. If a home medication such as a beta blocker has been stopped, it should be reinitiated if possible [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         For those in whom sinus rhythm is desired, a rhythm control strategy should be pursued. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1022.html" rel="external">
          "Atrial fibrillation: Overview and management of new-onset atrial fibrillation"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         This approach is recommended for those with symptomatic AF despite good rate control or in those where rate control is difficult to achieve. Rhythm control may also be preferred in patients who are felt to be unlikely to have a recurrence of AF, such as those who are younger, with fewer comorbidities, and with a small left atrium. It can be considered also for those who have not spontaneously converted within 24 hours where the desire is to avoid anticoagulation if possible, especially in those with a high bleeding risk. However, &gt;50 percent of patients with new onset postoperative AF will convert back to normal sinus rhythm within 24 hours on their own [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,22
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Either electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion can be attempted, with the choice based on the patient's status and the local practice pattern. Direct current transthoracic cardioversion is effective about 95 percent of the time in converting to normal sinus rhythm. As a starting point, 120 to 200 joules for biphasic defibrillators and 200 joules for monophasic defibrillators may be used [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. If AF has been present for greater than 48 hours, transesophageal echocardiography to ensure absence of left atrial appendage thrombus is advisable. Anticoagulation strategy is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         </a>
         ]. Another study of critically ill patients in a cardiology intensive care unit showed that diltiazem provided better rate control than amiodarone with equivalent rate of conversion to normal sinus rhythm, but that diltiazem treatment had to be discontinued more frequently, owing to hypotension [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30

         The risk of thromboembolism associated with new onset AF following noncardiac surgery has been evaluated in a few observational studies [

          21,31,32
         </a>
         ]. While the evidence is not strong, we interpret these studies as showing an increased risk of thromboembolism that is reduced with anticoagulation. The best available evidence comes from a 2018 registry study of over 1.5 million patients who underwent noncardiac surgery from 1996 to 2015, of whom 6048 were identified with postoperative AF. From these, 3830 patients were matched with 15,320 patients with nonvalvular AF. The long-term risk of thromboembolism was similar in the two groups (31.7 versus 29.9 events per 1000 person years; hazard ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.85-1.07) during a mean follow-up of 3.2 years [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21

         If a patient presents for emergent or urgent surgery and is found to have a new diagnosis of AF prior to surgery, the following questions need to be asked and answered:

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In most cases, we do not attempt restoration of sinus rhythm, with either electrical or chemical cardioversion, prior to emergency surgery. The most common indication for doing so would be hemodynamic instability.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         We believe that most patients will benefit from a ventricular rate in AF that is less than 140 beats per minute (bpm). In many patients, we attempt to slow the rate to 100 to 110 bpm unless this leads to hypotension.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In most cases, the initiation of anticoagulation can be deferred until after surgery. We do not recommend urgent transesophageal echocardiography prior to surgery to screen for left atrial appendage thrombus. Rather, decisions to proceed to surgery should be made on the basis of clinical risk assessment.

         We manage pre-, intra-, and postoperative atrial flutter in the same manner as AF, as there is little published evidence regarding perioperative atrial flutter. Decisions regarding anticoagulation, rate control, and rhythm can be approached similarly. Direct current cardioversion of atrial flutter typically requires lower energy, and in most patients it can be accomplished with 50 to 100 joules for biphasic devices and 100 joules for monophasic devices.

         Atrial fibrillation (AF) is highly prevalent in the population, and many individuals undergoing noncardiac surgery will carry the diagnosis or develop it in the perioperative period. (See

         The principal goals of the preoperative management of patients with known or newly discovered AF are to ensure hemodynamic stability and optimal anticoagulant status in the perioperative period.

         Prior to surgery, heart rates in AF between 50 and 100 beats per minute (bpm) are reasonable as long as the patient is asymptomatic. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Management of rhythm or rate'

         While some surgical procedures can be performed safely on patients who are systemically anticoagulated, interruption of anticoagulation during the perioperative period is required in others such as those in whom the perioperative bleeding risk is high. The decision to interrupt anticoagulation should be made on a case-by-case basis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Management of anticoagulation'

         For individuals presenting for minor surgical procedures, typically of limited duration and complexity (eg, monitored anesthesia care using local anesthetics with minimal anticipated blood loss), it may be reasonable to proceed, as long as the patient is hemodynamically stable. (See
         <a class="local">

         For patients who develop intraoperative AF, the immediate concern is hemodynamic stability. Anticoagulation is not urgently required and can be considered after surgery. For most patients in the operating room, the heart rate goal is &lt;100 to 110 bpm. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Intraoperative atrial fibrillation'

         For those patients who develop postoperative AF (see
         <a class="local">
          'Postoperative atrial fibrillation'
         </a>
         above) and in whom sinus rhythm is desired, a rhythm control strategy should be pursued. This approach is recommended for those with symptomatic AF despite good rate control or in those where rate control is difficult to achieve. Rhythm control may also be preferred in patients who are felt to be unlikely to have a recurrence of AF, such as those who are younger, with fewer comorbidities, and with small left atrium.

         For many patients with a single episode of AF lasting &lt;48 hours, we do not recommend anticoagulation, unless there are very high-risk features for thromboembolism, such as mitral stenosis. (See
