The estimated frequency of ALF in all age groups is between one and six cases per million people every year [<a href="#rid3">3</a>], but the frequency in children is unknown. PALF accounts for approximately 9 percent of pediatric liver transplants (LT) performed in the United States annually [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>PALF is a rapidly evolving clinical condition. There are no adequately powered studies to inform diagnostic algorithms, to assess markers of disease severity and trajectory, and to guide decisions about LT. The clinician must construct an individualized diagnostic approach and management strategy. Management requires a multidisciplinary team involving the hepatologist, critical care specialist, and LT surgeon.</p><p>Management of PALF and its complications in children are discussed here. An organized approach to diagnosing the cause of PALF is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16142.html" rel="external">"Acute liver failure in children: Etiology and evaluation"</a>.)</p><p>ALF in adults is addressed in separate topic reviews. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3574.html" rel="external">"Acute liver failure in adults: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3570.html" rel="external">"Acute liver failure in adults: Management and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H445201148"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute liver failure in children is defined by the presence of all three of the following criteria [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acute onset</strong> – Onset of hepatic failure within eight weeks of onset of clinical liver disease in a patient with no previous evidence of chronic liver disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Biochemical evidence of acute liver injury</strong> (one or both):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Hepatocellular injury</strong> – Aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase &gt;100 IU/L (unless explained by myopathy)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Biliary dysfunction</strong> – Total bilirubin &gt;5 mg/dL (85.5 micromol/L), direct or conjugated bilirubin &gt;2 mg/dL (34.2 micromol/L), and/or gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase &gt;100 IU/L</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Coagulopathy</strong> – That persists after <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12704" href="/z/d/drug information/12704.html" rel="external">vitamin K</a> administration, defined as:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Prothrombin time (PT) ≥15 seconds or international normalized ratio (INR) ≥1.5 with evidence of hepatic encephalopathy  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef83748 graphicRef134883" href="/z/d/graphic/83748.html" rel="external">table 1A-B</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>PT ≥20 seconds or INR ≥2.0, with or without encephalopathy. Hepatic encephalopathy is not required if the coagulopathy is severe, because it can be difficult to assess in children and may not be clinically apparent until the terminal stages of the disease process [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Hepatic encephalopathy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Patients meeting these criteria should be transferred to or managed in consultation with a pediatric liver transplant center [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18340146"><span class="h1">GENERAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>After the initial characterization of the patient presentation, proper patient management needs to be conducted along multiple parallel paths [<a href="#rid2">2,6</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Evaluate the cause of pediatric acute liver failure (PALF)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef138717 graphicRef138718" href="/z/d/graphic/138717.html" rel="external">figure 1A-B</a>), guided by the patient's age and prioritizing the diagnosis of treatable disorders (see <a class="local">'Treat the underlying cause'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16142.html" rel="external">"Acute liver failure in children: Etiology and evaluation", section on 'Diagnostic testing for the cause of PALF'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Monitor the function of each organ system</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Identify and treat complications</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Provide medical support to maximize health and survival</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H24093559"><span class="h2">Clinical setting</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children with PALF have potential for rapid clinical deterioration and should be cared for by a team of pediatric specialists with experience in the diagnosis and management of PALF. This includes pediatric intensivists, gastroenterologists/hepatologists, liver transplant (LT) specialists, and skilled nurses and ancillary personnel. This core care team may be supplemented by additional subspecialists, including neurologists, nephrologists, geneticists, neurosurgeons, immunologists, and others based on the underlying disease process driving PALF or the multisystemic complications that can accompany PALF.</p><p>For patients initially seen in the outpatient setting, once PALF is recognized, transfer should be arranged to the nearest emergency department. Thereafter, most patients with PALF should initially be monitored in a pediatric intensive care unit. This will allow for careful clinical and neurologic assessment of the patient. Frequent bedside assessment by an experienced nurse or clinician is essential and should be performed multiple times during the day and night to assess evidence of changing mental status or hepatic encephalopathy (HE), increased respiratory effort, changing heart rate or changes in blood pressure that might be signs of infection, increasing cerebral injury (cerebral edema), or electrolyte imbalance. Fluid balance (input and output) should be strictly monitored. For patients with advancing encephalopathy or neurologic symptoms, consulting a neurologist should be considered.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2384748095"><span class="h2">Severity assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are no reliable tools to predict survival or death in patients with PALF. Prognostic tools that incorporate biochemical tests (lactate, total bilirubin, phosphorous, international normalized ratio [INR], prothrombin time [PT], ammonia, Gc-globulin), clinical features (encephalopathy, cerebral edema), diagnosis (eg, acetaminophen), or combinations of the three have been tried without reliable success.</p><p>Development of a reliable model to predict death remains a challenge, given that LT interrupts the natural history of PALF [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. Existing liver failure scoring systems, including the Clichy score, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, and Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease (PELD) score, are not adequate prognostic tools, because they are only weakly associated with outcome [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. The Kings College Hospital Criteria is commonly used to predict prognosis and need for LT in adults with ALF and is stratified by whether the ALF is caused by acetaminophen toxicity. However, this score is not useful in PALF [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3570.html" rel="external">"Acute liver failure in adults: Management and prognosis", section on 'King's College Criteria'</a>.)</p><p>The Liver Injury Unit score has been developed specifically for PALF and includes factors for peak total bilirubin, PT or INR, and ammonia [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. A study tested the validity of the Liver Injury Unit score using data from the Pediatric Acute Liver Failure Study Group and, after optimization, sensitivity and specificity were 74 and 80 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. While this represents an improvement compared with the other scoring systems mentioned above, the Liver Injury Unit score is not sufficient to make critical decisions about LT. We believe that the ideal scoring system should reflect the dynamic nature of PALF and incorporate periodic clinical and biochemical changes into deriving the likelihood of death or survival [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Indeed, more contemporary prognostic scores seek to incorporate change in markers over time as a way to predict outcomes [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. More work is needed to optimize and validate such strategies.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3984095480"><span class="h2">Treat the underlying cause</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Causes of PALF that are amenable to specific treatments include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acetaminophen ingestion.

Establishing a firm diagnosis for autoimmune hepatitis is challenging in patients with PALF, and, in many cases, only a presumptive diagnosis can be made. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16142.html" rel="external">"Acute liver failure in children: Etiology and evaluation", section on 'Autoimmune marker positive'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If autoimmune hepatitis is suspected, patients are usually treated with corticosteroids because these drugs can interrupt the liver injury in many patients. Among children who respond to corticosteroids, some children appear to tolerate weaning of the corticosteroids without recurrence of their disease. Recurrent disease appears to be somewhat less common in children with autoimmune-mediated ALF as compared with adults. Initiation of steroid therapy in the setting of PALF is a difficult decision. Steroid treatment may be the only option for a critically ill, deteriorating child and can be valuable if the patient does have an immune-mediated etiology of disease [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. On the other hand, steroids also may cause mental status changes that interfere with assessments of encephalopathy and also increase risk for sepsis, a frequent cause of death in this population.

The frequency of laboratory monitoring should be at least daily, but multiple tests obtained regularly throughout the day may be necessary to monitor the dynamic changes that can occur in PALF. Management of patients with abnormal results is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Coagulopathy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Metabolic'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Blood cultures should be obtained if a systemic infection is suspected (eg, fever, elevated white blood cell count) or if there is evidence of clinical deterioration (eg, worsening encephalopathy, cardiovascular instability), with or without fever, as infection may precipitate clinical decline.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For measurement of ammonia, arterial samples are ideal but not always clinically practical. For children with stage 0 to II HE, ammonia can generally be monitored with venous samples obtained from a free-flowing catheter and promptly placed on ice and transported to the laboratory. Children with more advanced HE often require elective intubation and ventilatory support, accompanied by placement of an arterial catheter. If available, ammonia samples should be obtained from the arterial catheter, but the arterial catheter should not be placed solely for ammonia testing. (See <a class="local">'Hepatic encephalopathy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tests for transplant evaluation</strong> – Not all patients admitted with clinical and biochemical features of PALF will require an LT evaluation. However, if an evaluation is warranted, most of the biochemical tests necessary for evaluation are included in the initial and daily monitoring tests described above. Additional tests include blood typing (ABO and Rh; these need to be obtained/confirmed with two separate blood draws), human leukocyte antigens (HLA) antibodies, acute hepatitis panel, and cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus serologies. Consultations from anesthesia, neurology, cardiology, and social work should be sought for most patients.

Overhydration can lead to pulmonary and peripheral edema, while underhydration can precipitate renal dysfunction including hepatorenal syndrome and contribute to encephalopathy and hypotension. Therefore, intravenous and oral fluid intake should be modestly restricted for most patients with PALF. An effort should be made to restrict total daily fluid intake (including medications and blood products) to between 90 and 95 percent of the maintenance fluid requirement [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Initial fluids should be 10 percent dextrose (D10) one-half normal <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12796" href="/z/d/drug information/12796.html" rel="external">saline</a> (or similar to avoid sodium overload), with 15 mEq of potassium (K<sup>+</sup>)/L as <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13037" href="/z/d/drug information/13037.html" rel="external">potassium chloride</a> alone or a combination of potassium chloride and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12985" href="/z/d/drug information/12985.html" rel="external">potassium phosphate</a> [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Glucose and electrolytes can be adjusted as needed based upon monitoring laboratory tests and renal function. Fluids with "fixed" concentrations of electrolytes, such as <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="108442" href="/z/d/drug information/108442.html" rel="external">Lactated Ringer</a> (which includes 28 mEq lactate/L and does not have glucose), should be avoided for use as maintenance fluids. However, if the child is hemodynamically unstable, additional fluid resuscitation and pressor support may be needed to stabilize cardiovascular status.</p><p>Serum glucose should be maintained between 90 and 120 mg/dL (5 to 6.7 mmol/L), since both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia may affect critical homeostatic mechanisms and liver regeneration [<a href="#rid2">2,17</a>]. Some patients may require higher concentrations of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13222" href="/z/d/drug information/13222.html" rel="external">intravenous dextrose</a>, administered by central venous catheter.

There is little evidence to support the use of enteral formulas designed for hepatic disease (eg, formulas enriched in branched-chain amino acids and low in aromatic amino acids), and these formulas are expensive. Limited evidence from studies in adults suggest that such formulas may have some benefit for HE but not for mortality [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].

LT interrupts the natural course of PALF and can save the life of a patient with ALF if they have a condition that is not amenable to treatment or fails to respond to treatment  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83763" href="/z/d/graphic/83763.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). However, because the cause of PALF often is not known and the course of PALF is difficult to predict, it is likely that some patients may receive LT in situations in which spontaneous recovery would have occurred.</p><p>The first decision is whether and when to initiate an evaluation for LT. Listing for LT has become more selective over time, without adversely affecting outcomes. This was shown in a report of more than 1000 participants in the PALF study from 2000 to 2015 [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], in which time to listing (median one day) remained constant over the 15-year study period, while frequency of listing and receiving an LT decreased over time, and there was no association with an increase in the frequency of death. Clinical characteristics differed between those listed for LT and those not listed, for reasons of being "not sick enough" or "medically unsuitable." Patients who were listed for LT were more likely to be male and have clinical evidence of encephalopathy and higher bilirubin levels compared with those "not sick enough." They were also more likely to have an indeterminate diagnosis, to be older, and have higher values for alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, and platelet count compared with those who were deemed "medically unsuitable."</p><p>As discussed above, none of the scoring systems are adequate to direct decisions about LT for patients with PALF [<a href="#rid2">2</a>] (see <a class="local">'Severity assessment'</a> above). A more reliable modeling scheme is needed to readily and effectively distinguish the patient who would die from the one who would survive without LT and recognize when it would be futile to proceed with LT. Until then, the best solution is a global clinical assessment by a team of clinicians with experience in PALF and LT, incorporating the prognosis associated with the cause of the ALF, and the patient's dynamic course, based on repeated assessments of the probability of survival with native liver from one time interval to the next.</p><p>LT decisions are particularly challenging for patients with PALF caused by a mitochondrial disease. Multisystem mitochondrial dysfunction is a contraindication to LT because the long-term prognosis is poor [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. However, patients with certain mitochondrial diseases (such as those caused by defects in the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.omim.org%2Fentry%2F610230&amp;token=tEpDslnpc0F0kICl%2Fz7sFSbCnKy1I6QPXy4E96e7Dz6M4ExQzvPSDi1n0JaCh7aL&amp;TOPIC_ID=83172" target="_blank"><i>TRMU</i></a> or <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.omim.org%2Fentry%2F601465&amp;token=tEpDslnpc0F0kICl%2Fz7sFUfdC7kgbt7z3sRDeh8bdyqcoUuuOnwcXuIP%2BdA9vYXW&amp;TOPIC_ID=83172" target="_blank"><i>DGUOK</i></a> genes), who do not have extrahepatic manifestations of disease may have isolated hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction and could be candidates for LT [<a href="#rid56">56-58</a>]. Unfortunately, multisystem involvement may not be apparent at the time of LT, placing the child at risk for developing symptoms in the future. Moreover, patients whose ALF was triggered by <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12873" href="/z/d/drug information/12873.html" rel="external">valproate</a> have a very poor prognosis after LT due to a high likelihood of mitochondrial disease (especially <em>POLG</em> gene mutations) and extrahepatic disease progression [<a href="#rid16">16,59,60</a>].

Organ allocation in the United States is managed by the United Network for Organ Sharing and is based largely on disease severity scores for adults (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, version 3.0 [MELD 3.0]) and children (Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease [PELD]) to support organ allocation for patients with chronic liver disease. In 2023, PELD was revised to include serum creatinine (PELD-Cr) and the score adjusted to better align pediatric and adult scores with true mortality risk [<a href="#rid61">61</a>].

The urgency of LT for children with PALF is typically not reflected by their PELD-Cr/MELD score. Therefore, patients with ALF who are in need of LT are given priority over those listed with a PELD-Cr/MELD score and are listed as status 1A, the category with the highest priority status.</p><p>To assign a candidate pediatric status 1A, the candidate's transplant hospital must submit a Liver Status 1A Justification Form to the Organ Procurement Transplantation Network.

Because the supply of appropriately sized organs from deceased donors is inadequate, some children with PALF die while waiting for LT and pretransplant mortality is worse than for patients with chronic liver failure. As a result, technical variants to whole grafts such as split and living donors have been introduced.</p><p>Donor organs are made available to a child with ALF in one of three ways [<a href="#rid64">64</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Deceased donor, whole organ</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Deceased donor, cut down to accommodate the child's abdominal cavity or "split" with the right lobe going to an adult and all or part of the left lobe going to the child</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Living donor (either related or unrelated), with all or part of the left lobe going to the child</p><p></p><p>The availability of deceased donor livers varies significantly depending upon the location of the transplant center. Because patients are typically listed for LT within a day or two of hospital admission, the risk of dying before a liver becomes available is increased in areas where liver availability is scarce. In the early years of LT for PALF, living donor transplant was initially not pursued, due to a number of ethical concerns such as whether informed consent could genuinely be obtained given the short time allotted for the evaluation, coercion, and other competing interests. However, many pediatric transplant centers have worked through these important ethical issues and now offer a living donor option for patients with PALF, with good outcomes [<a href="#rid64">64,65</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4590.html" rel="external">"Living donor liver transplantation in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Auxiliary LT is an alternative approach that consists of placement of a graft adjacent to the patient's native liver (auxiliary heterotopic LT) or in the hepatic bed after a portion of the native liver (auxiliary orthotopic LT) has been removed. This technique has been used as a "bridge" to provide needed time for the native liver to regenerate, but challenges remain as to the timing for withdrawal of immunosuppression, which leads to involution of the transplanted graft [<a href="#rid66">66</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3570.html" rel="external">"Acute liver failure in adults: Management and prognosis", section on 'Auxiliary liver transplantation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18340319"><span class="h2">Hepatocyte transplant</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The role of hepatocyte transplantation in PALF is yet to be determined and may be an opportunity for investigation in the future [<a href="#rid16">16,67-69</a>]. Hepatocyte transplantation may serve as a bridge to transplant or perhaps a "cure" for some children with metabolic diseases. It has been used in a small number of children with ALF. However, technical challenges as well as lack of a readily available source for hepatocytes have limited the opportunity for this procedure at most centers. A study that demonstrated the feasibility and safety of transplanting microencapsulated human hepatocytes in alginate extends the utility of this approach [<a href="#rid70">70</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4593.html" rel="external">"Hepatocyte transplantation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18340326"><span class="h1">OUTCOMES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the pre-liver transplantation (LT) era, mortality for children with pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) approached 85 percent. While selection criteria for identifying PALF patients differ from that used in the pretransplant era, improvement in medical management and intensive care as well as introduction of LT as a surgical option have contributed to significantly improved patient outcomes, such that 21-day mortality is now approximately 11 percent [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. However, this change in mortality may also reflect differences in the patient population listed for LT. Moreover, all studies of outcomes are affected by decisions about LT because LT interrupts the natural course of PALF. Some children who receive LT might have recovered spontaneously if they had not undergone LT, and some die as a consequence of LT rather than of the underlying PALF. Patient outcome depends on a number of factors including the etiology, disease severity, supportive management, and treatment. However, outcomes vary among children with seemingly similar etiology, disease severity, and treatment. Additional factors are likely involved to explain these variations, perhaps including the inflammatory milieu, end-organ damage, immune activation, and potential for liver regeneration.</p><p>Data from the Pediatric Acute Liver Failure Study Group in North America and Europe revealed that the 21-day outcome varied by diagnosis, age, and degree of encephalopathy [<a href="#rid27">27,28,71</a>]. Spontaneous survival (survival with the native liver) varies with the underlying cause of the PALF. Spontaneous survival was highest amongst those with liver failure due to acetaminophen (94 percent) and was lower for those with liver failure due to metabolic disease (44 percent), for those with non-acetaminophen drug-induced disease (41 percent), and for those with an indeterminate diagnosis (45 percent) [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. For children with an established diagnosis, between 20 to 33 percent received an LT, and of those with acetaminophen-induced PALF, only 2 percent received an LT. In comparison, among patients with a diagnosis of indeterminant PALF, 46 percent underwent LT. Therefore, children who do not have a specific diagnosis are more likely to receive an LT. The major causes of death for children with PALF who do not receive LT are multiorgan system failure, cerebral edema and herniation, and sepsis.</p><p>In the Pediatric Acute Liver Failure Study Group cohort, patients with higher stages of encephalopathy had lower spontaneous survival, as might be expected [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>]. Excluding patients with acetaminophen toxicity, spontaneous survival was 79 percent among those who never developed encephalopathy, versus 45 percent among those with encephalopathy at study enrollment, and 25 percent among those who developed encephalopathy during the first seven days after enrollment [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. However, it is notable that 4 percent of those who never developed encephalopathy died and 17 percent had LT, suggesting that hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is not a reliable predictor of outcome. PALF participants whose encephalopathy was observed to either progress from one stage to another or persist during the seven days that encephalopathy was recorded had a high likelihood of receiving an LT. Patients presenting without HE were typically younger and less likely to have presented with fever or seizures.</p><p>Both early and late graft loss and death are higher among children who undergo LT for ALF than for those with chronic liver disease [<a href="#rid72">72</a>]. Reasons for these findings are uncertain, but one possibility includes immune dysregulation that may be associated with PALF, which could lead to increased susceptibility to infection or graft rejection. Use of living donor LT appears to mitigate this risk. In a cohort of older PALF patients who underwent LT (most of which were from a living donor), graft survival was 81.9 percent at one year post-transplant and 79.2 percent at five years; patient survival was 87.9 percent at both time points [<a href="#rid73">73</a>]. Comparable results for living donor LT were reported from Poland, with better outcomes in patients receiving a living donor LT compared with a deceased donor LT [<a href="#rid74">74</a>]. However, in a separate study, similar success with living donor LT was not achieved in infants under one year of age with an indeterminate cause for PALF, with five-year patient and graft survival of 26.7 percent and 17.8 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid75">75</a>]. For many children, a clinical benefit from living donor LT becomes more apparent over time for reasons that have not been fully delineated [<a href="#rid76">76</a>].</p><p>A cross-sectional analysis of neuropsychologic functioning and health-related quality of life outcomes among long-term PALF survivors demonstrate an average intelligence quotient and visual spatial ability, but impairments in motor skills, attention, executive function, health-related quality of life, and fatigue were noted [<a href="#rid77">77</a>]. Prospective studies are needed to better understand the impact of PALF on neuropsychologic and health-related quality of life outcomes in children.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2183238780"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

In the absence of the hemodynamic instability, we suggest modest restriction of intravenous fluids, typically to between 90 to 95 percent of the maintenance fluid requirement (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>).

A single dose is sufficient; repeat administration of vitamin K is unnecessary. Vitamin K is routinely administered to these patients because it helps to correct any component of the coagulopathy that is caused by vitamin K deficiency and is very low risk. Furthermore, if the coagulation profile does not significantly improve after vitamin K administration, this suggests that the coagulopathy is caused by liver failure rather than vitamin K deficiency.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Plasma transfusions or other procoagulation products should be reserved for patients with active bleeding or in anticipation of an invasive surgical procedure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Kidney injury</strong> – Several mechanisms can cause kidney function impairment in PALF.
