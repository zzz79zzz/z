         Eyelids contain the body's thinnest skin, protecting eyes from light, extreme temperature, and trauma. With each blink, the cornea and conjunctiva are swept of debris and relubricated.
        </p>
        <p>
         The eyelid has five layers (exterior to interior): skin, orbicularis oculi muscle, tarsal plate, levator muscle apparatus, palpebral conjunctiva. The orbicularis oculi muscle helps with both voluntary closure (sleep) and involuntary closure (blink). The muscle also expels tears and debris through the nasolacrimal duct via the two puncta in the upper and lower lids. The tarsal plate is the connective tissue that forms the scaffolding for the lids. The levator muscle apparatus, enervated by cranial nerve III (oculomotor), open the lids. The palpebral conjunctiva is a thin mucous membrane on the inside of each lid.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tear glands are distributed throughout the eyelid. Meibomian glands are located in the tarsal plate, and secrete the oily, evaporation-prevention portion of tears through their ducts near the posterior eyelid margin. Glands of Moll and Zeiss are associated with each eyelash follicle and secrete sebum to keep the eyelashes soft and flexible. The palpebral conjunctiva contains mucin-producing goblet cells and aqueous-producing Krause and Wolfing glands  (

          Clinical presentation
         </strong>
         – A hordeolum (stye) is an acute inflammation of the eyelid that presents as a localized painful and erythematous swelling or nodule  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58059 graphicRef79059" href="/z/d/graphic/58059.html" rel="external">

          figure 1
         </a>
         ). It tends to appear rather quickly (in a day or even overnight).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>

         <strong>
          Pathology
         </strong>
         – Hordeola can be external or internal. External hordeola arise from glands in the eyelash follicle or lid-margin (gland of Zeis and gland of Moll)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116369" href="/z/d/graphic/116369.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). Internal hordeola are caused by inflammation of the meibomian gland, resulting in swelling just under the conjunctival side of the eyelid.
         <em>
          Staphylococcus
         </em>
         <em>
          aureus
         </em>
         is the pathogen implicated in most cases, but hordeola can also be sterile. Patients with underlying skin conditions that affect the eyelids (eg, rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis) are prone to having frequent episodes of hordeolum. Eye makeup, particularly eye makeup contaminated by bacteria, can cause hordeola by clogging and inflaming gland pores. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13621.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Management
         </strong>
         – Most hordeola resolve spontaneously over one to two weeks. Management recommendations are largely based on longstanding clinical practices and on case reports more than 20 years old; clinical trial data are lacking [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Drainage can be facilitated with warm, moist compresses placed on the affected areas frequently (eg, for 5 to 10 minutes four times a day). Massage and gentle wiping of the affected eyelid after the warm compress can also aid in drainage. Patients should discontinue eye makeup to support healing. If, despite management with warm compresses, the lesion does not reduce in size within two weeks, the patient should be referred to an ophthalmologist for consideration of incision and drainage.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         There is little evidence that treatment with topical or systemic antibiotics and/or glucocorticoids promotes healing [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. However, patients who have frequent hordeola in the setting of rosacea-associated blepharitis and who do not achieve adequate improvement with warm compresses and mechanical removal of lid margin debris may respond to a topical antibiotic/corticosteroid ointment combination. Such patients should be managed by an ophthalmologist because of the potential ocular complications associated with topical glucocorticoid use.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Preseptal cellulitis is an uncommon complication of hordeolum. It typically presents with unilateral ocular pain, eyelid swelling, and erythema  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57604" href="/z/d/graphic/57604.html" rel="external">
          picture 4

         ). Management consists of antibiotic therapy directed against

         <strong>
          Clinical presentation
         </strong>
         – Chalazion, meaning "hail stone" in Greek, typically presents as a painless localized eyelid swelling  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80892" href="/z/d/graphic/80892.html" rel="external">
          picture 2A
         </a>
         ). Examination of the inner eyelid reveals a nontender rubbery nodule  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62030" href="/z/d/graphic/62030.html" rel="external">
          picture 2B

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Chalazion is diagnosed based on the typical clinical appearance of the lesion  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80892 graphicRef62030" href="/z/d/graphic/80892.html" rel="external">
          picture 2A-B
         </a>
         ). Chalazia and hordeola can have a similar appearance; however, chalazia tend to be painless and are less erythematous and angry-appearing  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef139242" href="/z/d/graphic/139242.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). In addition, a chalazion grows slowly, over days to weeks, in contrast to a hordeolum, which appears over a day or so.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <strong>
          Pathology
         </strong>
         – Chalazia are caused by obstruction of Zeis or meibomian glands  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116369" href="/z/d/graphic/116369.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). Inflammatory conditions like rosacea and meibomianitis thicken gland secretions leading to blockage. Hordeola sometimes transform into chalazia after the inflammation resolves.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <strong>
          Management
         </strong>
         – Untreated, chalazia may take several weeks to months to resolve. Draining of large chalazia can be facilitated by placing warm compresses on the eyelid for 5 to 10 minutes four times a day. Antibiotics (topical or systemic) are not indicated since chalazion is a granulomatous condition [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Patients with lesions that do not resolve over one to two months should be referred to an ophthalmologist for consideration of incision and curettage or glucocorticoid injection [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Such persistent or recurring lesions, especially if unilateral, should be assessed histopathologically for possible basal cell, sebaceous cell, or meibomian gland carcinoma. (See

         <strong>
          Clinical presentation

         – Xanthelasma are soft, yellow plaques that usually appear symmetrically on the medial aspects of the eyelids  (

          picture 3

          Pathology
         </strong>
         – Cholesterol-filled xanthelasma are often associated with hypercholesterolemia, and thus we suggest obtaining a lipid profile if the patient has not already undergone screening. Dyslipidemia is present in approximately 50 percent of adult patients with xanthelasma [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. Xanthelasma are a classic feature of primary biliary cholangitis, a condition often associated with marked hypercholesterolemia. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3602.html" rel="external">

         Xanthelasma are common in patients with primary disorders of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol metabolism (eg, familial hypercholesterolemia, hyperapobetalipoproteinemia). The finding of xanthelasma in younger individuals, especially children, should prompt consideration of an underlying inherited dyslipidemia [

         In patients with a normal lipid profile, the association between xanthelasma and atherosclerosis is not clear.

It is commonly seen in children but can also occur in adults. Immunocompromised patients are at risk for extensive and persistent disease. The diagnosis is based on clinical appearance; biopsy is rarely necessary.

         Most lesions are solitary but multiple lesions can occur. They appear as a bright-red papule, nodule, or plaque  (

         ). They range in size from a few millimeters to many centimeters in diameter. They may be superficial, deep, or combined. Hemangiomas characteristically undergo a growth phase that is most rapid for the first several months, followed by a spontaneous involution phase that typically begins after one year and lasts a variable number of years.

         Primary carcinomas of the eyelid include basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), keratoacanthoma, and sebaceous carcinoma. These should be managed by an ophthalmologist and oncologist who have familiarity with these conditions. They are staged according to the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) [

         <strong>
          Hordeolum
         </strong>
         – Acute eyelid inflammation that presents with localized pain, erythema, and edema, often developing within one day or overnight  (

         We suggest use of warm, moist compresses on the affected areas (for 5 to 10 minutes four times a day) to facilitate drainage (

         Topical or systemic antibiotics are unlikely to improve outcomes and are not indicated. Infrequently, hordeola present with preseptal cellulitis, necessitating systemic antibiotics. (See

         If the hordeolum does not reduce in size within two weeks, we advise referral to an ophthalmologist for potential incision and drainage. Patients who have frequent hordeola in the setting of rosacea-associated blepharitis should also be managed by an ophthalmologist for consideration of treatment with a combination topical antibiotic/corticosteroid.

          Chalazion
         </strong>
         – Painless nodule caused by obstruction of the eyelid glands. Presents with localized eyelid swelling, usually developing over days to weeks  (

         Small chalazia often resolve without intervention over several weeks to months. For larger lesions, we suggest use of warm, moist compresses on the affected areas (for 5 to 10 minutes four times a day) to facilitate drainage (

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Patients with lesions that do not resolve over one to two months should be referred to an ophthalmologist for consideration of incision and curettage or glucocorticoid injection. Such persistent or recurring lesions, especially if unilateral, should be assessed histopathologically for possible basal cell, sebaceous cell, or meibomian gland carcinoma. (See

          Xanthelasma
