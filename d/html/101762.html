Additionally, patients require continued surveillance for a variety of important long-term health problems related to TTP.</p><p>This topic discusses our approach to the management of a patient who has recovered from an acute episode of immune TTP, including routine monitoring, evaluation for symptoms of relapse, prophylaxis to prevent relapse, and management of long-term morbidities.</p><p>Separate topic reviews discuss other aspects of care for patients with immune TTP:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1338.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of immune TTP"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treatment of an acute episode</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1344.html" rel="external">"Immune TTP: Initial treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treatment of an acute episode during pregnancy</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1344.html" rel="external">"Immune TTP: Initial treatment", section on 'Immune TTP during pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treatment of refractory or relapsed disease</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/99124.html" rel="external">"Immune TTP: Treatment of clinical relapse"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pathophysiology</strong> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1331.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology of TTP and other primary thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Hereditary TTP (due to biallelic variants in the <em>ADAMTS13</em> gene) is discussed separately.

Patients, families, and caregivers must educate themselves about the possible symptoms of a relapse and the importance of seeking medical care immediately for a suspected relapse. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Symptoms and complete blood count (CBC) are evaluated frequently during the initial recovery period for the purpose of detecting a clinical exacerbation or relapse  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116648" href="/d/graphic/116648.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For individuals receiving <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="120300" href="/d/drug information/120300.html" rel="external">caplacizumab</a>, a normal platelet count may suggest that TTP disease activity has declined when in fact it has not. Caplacizumab does not affect TTP activity. It only blocks platelet adhesion to von Willebrand factor (VWF) which prevents thrombosis, allowing platelet count recovery and resolution of symptoms. If there is concern about relapse, other parameters including ADAMTS13 activity increase in importance. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Clinical relapse is suggested when the platelet count decreases to &lt;150,000/microL or if symptoms suggestive of active TTP occur, such as any neurologic abnormalities. Symptoms heralding a relapse may be extremely variable and may include nonspecific symptoms (symptoms of anemia, gastrointestinal upset, neurologic changes ranging from headache or confusion to focal abnormalities). We expect that clinical relapse frequency will decrease over time with greater routine use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> for treatment of initial episodes and preemptive rituximab for ADAMTS13 relapse during clinical remission. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Monitoring ADAMTS13 activity</strong> – ADAMTS13 activity is monitored after therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has been discontinued  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116648" href="/d/graphic/116648.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). An ADAMTS13 relapse (ADAMTS13 activity &lt;20 percent) suggests an increased risk of clinical relapse, and we generally initiate preemptive <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> if the ADAMTS13 activity decreases to &lt;20 percent, as discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Rituximab during remission to prevent relapse'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Any patient with a history of immune TTP whose platelet count decreases to &lt;100,000/microL requires immediate hospitalization, urgent additional diagnostic evaluation, and immediate initiation of TPE if the results of the evaluation are consistent with clinical relapse  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef120708" href="/d/graphic/120708.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). Management is generally similar to the initial episode. The diagnostic evaluation and management of relapse are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/99124.html" rel="external">"Immune TTP: Treatment of clinical relapse", section on 'Clinical relapse'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4518755"><span class="h2">First week</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most exacerbations of TTP occur during the first week after stopping TPE or the week after stopping <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="120300" href="/d/drug information/120300.html" rel="external">caplacizumab</a>. We use the following sequence during the end of the hospitalization and initial days at home  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116648" href="/d/graphic/116648.html" rel="external">table 2</a>): </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Stop TPE </strong>– When there is a clinical response, indicated by a normal platelet count for two days or a stable plateau platelet count in the normal or supranormal range for three days, TPE is stopped and immunosuppressive therapy is continued as outlined below. The patient usually can be discharged from the hospital. (See <a class="local">'Rituximab during remission to prevent relapse'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Daily CBC</strong> – We continue to obtain a CBC and monitor the platelet count. Initially this is done daily and gradually extended to every two to three days. We also check the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at the time of CBC. In some patients, the platelet count may exceed the baseline and then decrease or fluctuate before stabilizing in the patient's normal range. We do not check ADAMTS13 activity during the first week unless there are clinical or laboratory features suggesting clinical relapse.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Typically, exacerbation is characterized by a sharp decrease of the platelet count within the first week, which often occurs without any associated symptoms of TTP. If the platelet count decreases to &lt;150,000/microL but not less than 100,000/microL and the patient has no TTP symptoms, daily monitoring alone may be appropriate, as some patients will subsequently have a spontaneous recovery of the platelet count back to the normal range.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical status</strong> – We monitor the clinical status daily. We provide our patients with a wallet card  (<a class="graphic graphic_form graphicRef116336" href="/d/graphic/116336.html" rel="external">form 1</a>) that explains the condition, provides our contact information, and emphasizes that any symptoms consistent with TTP call for an immediate CBC with platelet count and triage to a physician who can assess the possibility of relapse. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring for clinical relapse'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Central venous catheter</strong> – A central venous catheter (CVC) increases risk for infection, including sepsis, and we anticipate exacerbations will be less of a concern in individuals treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> and in some cases <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="120300" href="/d/drug information/120300.html" rel="external">caplacizumab</a>. However, we typically leave the CVC in place for one week after stopping TPE. IF there is no exacerbation after one week, the CVC is removed. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Glucocorticoids</strong> – We continue the glucocorticoids during the first week. If the platelet count is stable or increasing, we start to taper glucocorticoids during the second week. (See <a class="local">'First month'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Rituximab</strong> – We continue the initial course of weekly <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> (if started at the time of the acute event). We generally use the conventional regimen of 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> once per week for four weeks. There is no evidence or experience that this is the optimal rituximab regimen for patients with TTP; lower doses and/or fewer doses of rituximab may be equally effective. More doses may be required if the ADAMTS13 activity does not recover. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1344.html" rel="external">"Immune TTP: Initial treatment", section on 'Rituximab'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Based on our experience, approximately half of individuals who did not receive <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> during initial therapy may have a recurrence (exacerbation or clinical relapse) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Inclusion of rituximab as routine initial treatment together with TPE and glucocorticoids is likely to reduce these early recurrences. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4518761"><span class="h2">First month</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Monitoring intervals are extended and therapies are gradually discontinued as follows  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116648" href="/d/graphic/116648.html" rel="external">table 2</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical status and CBC</strong> – Clinical status is monitored on an ongoing basis. The interval of CBC and platelet count monitoring is increased to once weekly and then to every other week. Some individuals may have a platelet count that exceeds their baseline and then decreases or fluctuates before stabilizing in the patient's baseline range. Once the platelet count has been maintained in the normal range for one month after discontinuing TPE or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="120300" href="/d/drug information/120300.html" rel="external">caplacizumab</a>, we are confident that a durable remission has occurred. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring for clinical relapse'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If the serum creatinine and/or LDH were abnormal at the time of hospital discharge, they are monitored until they become normal or another explanation for the abnormality is found. If the serum creatinine and LDH were normal at the time of hospital discharge, they do not require continued monitoring. The hemoglobin concentration generally will recover more slowly, and schistocytes may also persist for a few weeks and do not affect management.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Glucocorticoids and </strong><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> – For individuals who have a normal (or increasing) platelet count following the first week, we taper and discontinue the glucocorticoids rapidly, over two to three weeks. In our experience, a shorter glucocorticoid taper reduces adverse effects and does not increase relapses. For those who were started on rituximab at the time of the acute event, we continue and complete the course of rituximab during the first month. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ADAMTS13 activity</strong> – We measure ADAMTS13 activity one week after TPE was stopped and weekly during the first month. If ADAMTS13 activity does not recover (remains &lt;20 percent), we continue <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="120300" href="/d/drug information/120300.html" rel="external">caplacizumab</a>.
