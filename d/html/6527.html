The approach to the athlete with a complaint of neck pain or injury; overviews of musculoskeletal, cervical spinal cord, and cervical peripheral nerve injuries; and the technique for removal of a motorcycle helmet are presented separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6516.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the child or adolescent athlete with neck pain or injury"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6531.html" rel="external">"Overview of musculoskeletal neck injuries in the child or adolescent athlete"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6528.html" rel="external">"Overview of cervical spinal cord and cervical peripheral nerve injuries in the child or adolescent athlete"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/342.html" rel="external">"Cervical spinal column injuries in adults: Evaluation and initial management", section on 'Helmeted patients'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2358922895"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For this topic, spinal motion restriction is used in preference to spinal immobilization. Historically, the process of restricting the motion in the spine during emergency medical management was described as "spinal immobilization." More recently, trauma experts have adopted the term "spinal motion restriction" for this process because true immobilization of the spine is unattainable. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6329.html" rel="external">"Pediatric cervical spinal motion restriction", section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H82039090"><span class="h1">PREPARATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Severe neck injuries with permanent neurologic sequelae occur rarely among young athletes. Because these injuries are uncommon, most youth team physicians and trainers have little experience managing them [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Nonetheless, the management of athletes with potential cervical spine injuries must be a well-coordinated process.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1508635431"><span class="h2">Emergency action plan</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Athletic programs should have an emergency action plan developed in conjunction with local emergency medical services (EMS) agencies specific to pre-hospital spine-injury care. The plan should address medical roles and duties of sideline personnel, designate who is responsible for ensuring necessary equipment is immediately available during practice and events, and identify EMS agency and hospital contacts for each event.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2941171842"><span class="h2">Pre-season</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Personnel involved in youth team sports, particularly the team physician, must be prepared for the possibility of a cervical spine injury [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Adequate preparation and familiarity with individual roles and duties are of paramount importance in avoiding preventable catastrophic injuries [<a href="#rid1">1,3,4</a>].</p><p>Preseason simulation of the acute care of the injured athlete can help mitigate the stress and confusion that may arise when a severe injury occurs. Such training should include management of a scenario with practical components such as proper notification of EMS and use of emergency equipment [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. All members of the interdisciplinary health team should participate.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1985044558"><span class="h2">Pre-event</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2360000154"><span class="h3">Equipment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Arrangements should be made to have an ambulance with EMS personnel at the athletic event (particularly football games) or readily available in case an athlete requires urgent transport to a medical facility, whenever possible [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. In addition, all necessary equipment should be on hand and easily accessible, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A bag-valve-mask for ventilation (with various mask sizes depending upon the age/size of the participating athletes)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Equipment to safely remove protective gear (eg, face mask, helmet pads, and shoulder pads in football)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cervical spine motion restriction (immobilization) devices (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6329.html" rel="external">"Pediatric cervical spinal motion restriction"</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A backboard</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A mobile phone to contact EMS</p><p></p><p>In settings where an onsite ambulance with equipment is not practical, there should be a preplanned ability for sideline personnel to contact and request EMS for concerns. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1462312625"><span class="h3">Ambulance transport</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Whenever possible, spine-injured athletes should be transported directly from the field to a medical facility that can deliver immediate stabilization and on-site (or transfer to) definitive care for those with a significant cervical spine injury. Team medical personnel should know how to contact the EMS agency and preferred hospital for each event location, and this information should be reviewed during the medical time-out.</p><p>Best practices are for an athlete with a suspected spinal injury to be transported to a designated level 1 or 2 trauma center as quickly and safely as possible [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Key capabilities at such centers include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An emergency department with board-certified emergency medicine physicians</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In-house trauma team to facilitate emergency evaluation and treatment led by trauma surgeons</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Personnel trained in equipment removal</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Advanced imaging services (24 hours per day, seven days per week)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Spine surgeon consultation in house or readily available </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Operating room (24 hours per day, seven days per week)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Critical care monitoring and rehabilitation services</p><p></p><p>If such a facility is not located within a 30- to 60-minute transport from the event, then transport to the nearest acute care hospital permits initial stabilization prior to transport to a definitive center.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3326450268"><span class="h3">Medical time-out</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Sports medicine teams should conduct a pre-event medical time-out before each athletic event (practices and competitions). Before competition, medical personnel from both teams, EMS personnel, and game officials should participate.</p><p>The time-out should review:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Medical roles and duties of sideline personnel</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Available equipment</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Contact numbers for EMS (if not onsite) and hospital notification</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H669454727"><span class="h1">FIELD EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prehospital evaluation of young athletes with acute neck injuries includes the following steps [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recognition of neck injury</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cervical spine stabilization and safety</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Notification of emergency medical services (EMS) and immediate treatment of airway, breathing, and circulation in athletes with severe injury to prevent secondary injury</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Evaluation for return to play (ambulatory athletes with neck injury whose signs and symptoms have resolved)</p><p></p><p>Every patient with concern for an acute neck injury must be assumed to have a serious spinal cord injury until proven otherwise. Failure to adhere to this dictum can result in catastrophic, permanent cervical spine injury [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Prehospital personnel who treat patients with potential cervical spine injuries have three priorities:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ensure patient survival</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Preserve residual spinal cord function</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Transport the patient safely to an appropriate medical center so that further stabilization and treatment can be initiated as well as definitive evaluation as able</p><p></p><p>Primary neurologic injury is sustained at the time of impact and is treated at a medical care facility under the direction of appropriate specialists [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Secondary neurologic injury results from hypoxia and shock, which increase the degree and extent of the primary injury. Prevention of secondary injury is the primary goal of prehospital and hospital care of the young athlete with acute neck injury.</p><p>The hospital care of the unstable pediatric trauma patient and acute spinal cord injury are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6571.html" rel="external">"Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4819.html" rel="external">"Acute traumatic spinal cord injury"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Recognition</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The field medical personnel should watch the sporting event carefully so that high-risk neck injuries can be rapidly recognized and treated. Mechanisms of injury associated with severe neck and cervical spine injuries include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Axial load to the head (eg, spear-tackle in American football or going directly head-first into the boards in hockey)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hyperflexion or hyperextension of the head and neck during a tackle, block, fall, or check</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Direct blow to the neck (ie, clothesline tackle mechanism)</p><p></p><p>A high index of suspicion for a serious spinal cord injury should be maintained in all unconscious athletes, athletes with neurologic compromise, and any awake athlete who complains of neck pain, even in the presence of an initially normal neurologic examination [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. As an integral part of resuscitation and before transport, cervical spine motion restriction must be applied and maintained until cervical spine injury is ruled out clinically or radiographically.</p><p>Because cervical spine injuries can progress, not all significant injuries may be recognized immediately. Suspicion and recognition of cervical spine injuries in the athlete who walks from the field are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Sideline evaluation (ambulatory athletes)'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Spinal motion restriction (immobilization)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In athletes with suspected cervical spine injury, medical field providers should implement spinal motion restriction as soon as possible after injury  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef134118" href="/z/d/graphic/134118.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Stabilize the cervical spine </strong>– The first step involves manual inline cervical spine stabilization to hold the head and neck in a neutral (or current) position  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80874" href="/z/d/graphic/80874.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3,8</a>]. No traction should be applied or attempts at neck realignment made. Care must be taken for motion restriction of an obviously deviated cervical spine; it should be stabilized as is without any attempt at straightening [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6329.html" rel="external">"Pediatric cervical spinal motion restriction"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Position the patient supine on a spine board</strong> – Next, when proper equipment and numbers of field personnel are available, log-roll the athlete into the supine position and onto a padded, rigid spine board for further evaluation and management [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Athletes initially in the prone or side position require extra care in maintaining cervical spine stabilization during the log-roll procedure. The log-roll maneuver is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6329.html" rel="external">"Pediatric cervical spinal motion restriction"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Leave the athlete on the spine board until arrival at the hospital [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If adequate numbers of field personnel are not available, then manually stabilize the cervical spine until EMS arrives.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Determine need to remove helmet and/or shoulder pads </strong>– Athletes wearing either a helmet or shoulder pads alone require careful and skilled equipment removal and continued maintenance of inline manual stabilization until properly trained medical personnel can place a rigid cervical collar.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Athletes wearing both a helmet and shoulder pads require simultaneous removal if they interfere with the maintenance of spinal motion restriction or medical resuscitation. Otherwise, we suggest that the helmet and shoulder pads be left in place. (See <a class="local">'When to remove helmet and/or shoulder pads'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">When to remove helmet and/or shoulder pads</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In athletes with suspected serious cervical spine injury, whether to maintain the helmet or shoulder pads in place or remove them depends upon whether the equipment interferes with spinal motion restriction or medical resuscitation:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Helmet without shoulder pads</strong> – Helmets that are worn without shoulder pads (eg, batting helmets, bike helmets, motorcycle helmets) should be removed to permit motion restriction of the cervical spine in the neutral position, prevent hyperflexion of the cervical spine when the athlete is in the supine position, and assist with access to the airway as needed. Whenever possible, helmet removal should be performed by a health care provider who has experience and expertise in helmet removal. When the athlete is clinically stable (eg, clear airway with normal breathing and circulation), waiting for EMS personnel to arrive is better than attempted helmet removal by an inexperienced person.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The proper removal of a motorcycle helmet is discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/342.html" rel="external">"Cervical spinal column injuries in adults: Evaluation and initial management", section on 'Helmeted patients'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Shoulder pads without helmet</strong> – In some instances, the athlete may have the helmet knocked off but still have shoulder pads in place. These patients require head support to maintain neutral cervical spine alignment during and after the removal of the shoulder pads [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Helmet with shoulder pads (American football, ice hockey, or lacrosse)</strong> – For the athlete suspected of serious cervical spine injury, we suggest leaving the<strong> </strong>helmet and shoulder pads in place during on-the-field care rather than removing them unless they interfere with proper spinal motion restriction or medical resuscitation [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. To further minimize head motion, towel rolls, foam head blocks, and tape may be used.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Unconscious athletes and awake athletes with respiratory distress should have the face mask removed if there is concern about maintenance of airway and breathing [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. During face mask removal, one person should stabilize the head and maintain cervical spine motion restriction while a separate person removes the face mask. Tools for face mask removal are brand specific and should be used whenever available [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. If no such tool is available, the field provider may use heavy-duty trauma shears.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For athletes requiring nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal airway insertion or bag-mask ventilation to maintain the airway and breathing and for those receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the field providers should remove the chin strap along with the face mask to facilitate opening the mouth.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Despite our suggestion to keep football helmets and shoulder pads in place on the field, there are certain circumstances in which they should be removed  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef132700" href="/z/d/graphic/132700.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5,7</a>]. If helmet and shoulder pad removal is necessary, those with the highest level of training and experience in removal techniques should participate in equipment removal. Athletic trainers are recognized as the medical professional with the most training and experience in field athletic equipment removal [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Because the shoulder pads in American football elevate the player's shoulders in the supine position, removal of the helmet and the shoulder pads must occur at the same time to prevent excessive cervical spinal motion [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. In general, correct removal requires at least three persons on both sides of the patient and one person stabilizing the cervical spine. The procedure requires precise coordination of steps by all team members throughout the process, with leadership provided by the person providing inline manual cervical spine motion restriction. Tools to remove the shoulder pads, helmet face mask, and helmet pads are specific to the brand of equipment, and the person most experienced with their use should remove the face mask and helmet padding and release the shoulder pads.
