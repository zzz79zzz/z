In the past, this almost always consisted of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), but, more recently, there has been increasing interest in assessing the role of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy, as well as targeted therapies, sometimes administered concurrent with, and sometimes in lieu of, chemotherapy, in certain subsets of patients.</p><p>This topic will review patient selection, pretreatment assessment, treatment options, and evaluation of response to and treatment after neoadjuvant therapy. Where clinical guidance is provided in this topic, the anatomic staging system set forth in the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging Manual is used  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110848" href="/z/d/graphic/110848.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Clinicians may also find it useful to refer to the clinical prognostic staging system set forth in the eighth edition AJCC manual, which incorporates prognostic features such as tumor grade and hormone and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptor status, and thus provides more refined prognostic information prior to surgery  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110851" href="/z/d/graphic/110851.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Of note, the AJCC eighth edition does not have a pathologic staging system for patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy. Additionally, the studies cited in this topic typically used previous editions of the staging system to define and describe their patient populations, which is a limitation of available data. Further discussion of existing staging systems, including the clinical and pathologic prognostic staging systems, are found elsewhere  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110851" href="/z/d/graphic/110851.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117141" href="/z/d/graphic/117141.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/800.html" rel="external">"Tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging classification for breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p>Specific issues related to deciding between NACT versus neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative cancers, the role of HER2-directed therapies in HER2-positive cancers, selecting a NACT regimen, and the impact of response to neoadjuvant therapy on choice of postoperative therapy are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/98345.html" rel="external">"Neoadjuvant management of newly diagnosed hormone-positive breast cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/106774.html" rel="external">"Neoadjuvant therapy for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/749.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant endocrine and targeted therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/788.html" rel="external">"Selection and administration of adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative breast cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/773.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant systemic therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14227.html" rel="external">"ER/PR negative, HER2-negative (triple-negative) breast cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/122902.html" rel="external">"Choice of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4049625435"><span class="h1">GOALS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While all systemic therapy given for non-metastatic, invasive breast cancer is intended to reduce the risk of distant recurrence, the purpose of administering it prior to surgery is to downstage the extent of disease in the breast and/or regional lymph nodes and provide information regarding treatment response to direct adjuvant therapies. Downstaging may allow less extensive surgery on the breast and/or axilla, including avoiding the risks associated with breast reconstruction in patients able to undergo breast-conserving surgery in place of mastectomy, improving cosmetic outcomes, and reducing postoperative complications such as lymphedema [<a href="#rid1">1-6</a>]. Neoadjuvant therapy also permits evaluation of the effectiveness of systemic therapy, which is increasingly used to guide adjuvant treatment recommendations. The presence and extent or absence of residual invasive cancer after neoadjuvant therapy is a strong prognostic factor for risk of recurrence, especially in triple-negative breast cancer and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer. (See <a class="local">'Poor response to or progression on neoadjuvant therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to these clinical objectives, neoadjuvant therapy gives researchers the opportunity to obtain imaging studies, tumor specimens, and blood samples prior to, during, and, in patients with sufficient residual disease at surgery, after the preoperative treatment, which may assist in the identification of tumor- or patient-specific biomarkers of response or resistance.</p><p>Although it was hypothesized that overall survival might be improved with neoadjuvant therapy, as it provides earlier initiation of systemic therapy in patients at higher risk of distant recurrence, randomized trials have demonstrated equivalent mortality for pre- or postoperative delivery of similar systemic therapy [<a href="#rid1">1,3,7-15</a>]. An individual patient data meta-analysis was conducted by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group based upon data from 4756 women in 10 trials that were initiated between 1983 and 2002 [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. There were no significant differences between neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) versus adjuvant chemotherapy in the risk of distant recurrence (15-year rate of 38 percent in both arms) or breast cancer mortality (34 percent in both arms). The use of NACT was associated with an increased frequency of breast-conserving therapy (65 versus 49 percent). It was also associated with an increased risk of local recurrence (15-year local recurrence rate, 21.4 versus 15.9 percent; rate ratio 1.37, 95% CI 1.17-1.61), which has been attributed to the increased use of breast-conserving surgery. </p><p>While there have been advances in selecting patients for neoadjuvant therapy, given recognition of the potential benefits of preoperative treatment on surgical management and selection of subsequent treatment based on response, it is unlikely that further large, randomized trials comparing neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy will be conducted.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1754002893"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The discussion that follows uses both clinical and pathologic staging in management decisions. Particular notes regarding pathologic assessment are as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The American Joint Committee on Cancer and the International Union for Cancer Control Tumor, Node, Metastasis breast cancer staging system uses "y" to designate stage after neoadjuvant therapy, so clinical stage after neoadjuvant therapy is indicated by ycTN and pathologic stage by ypTN or ypTNM. The tumor (ypT) is measured as the largest single focus of residual invasive tumor, not including areas of fibrosis within the tumor bed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The most widely accepted definition of pathologic complete response requires the absence of residual invasive disease in the breast and the absence of measurable disease in any sampled axillary nodes (ypT0/is ypN0). In retrospective meta-analyses, the presence of residual in situ carcinoma did not affect risk of distant recurrence in patients with no residual invasive cancer. This is the definition used in the following discussion, unless otherwise indicated.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11989615"><span class="h1">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While originally developed for patients with locally advanced breast cancer, in whom even mastectomy may not be an option, neoadjuvant therapy is now frequently administered to patients with operable breast cancers, in an effort to avoid mastectomy or improve cosmetic outcomes following surgery or to limit the extent of axillary lymph node removal. Additionally, it can be used to assess response to neoadjuvant therapy, even if unlikely to alter surgical approach, if this could influence selection of postoperative therapy [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Discussions between the breast surgical oncologist and medical oncologist, and often other specialists, including a radiation oncologist and plastic surgeon, if reconstruction is being considered, are vital in determining the goals and potential benefits of neoadjuvant therapy for a given patient. Potential indications are listed below.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Locally advanced breast cancer</strong> – Patients with locally advanced breast cancer (those with stage III disease, T3, or T4 lesions  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110848" href="/z/d/graphic/110848.html" rel="external">table 1</a>)), no matter the subtype, are ideal candidates for neoadjuvant therapy because their cancers are often not amenable to upfront resection, much less breast conservation, and because their risk of distant recurrence warrants systemic treatment. Many patients with tumors larger than 5 cm (T3), even if potentially operable, are considered to have locally advanced disease and have been included in neoadjuvant therapy clinical trials. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/737.html" rel="external">"Overview of the treatment of newly diagnosed, invasive, non-metastatic breast cancer", section on 'Locally advanced breast cancer'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Select patients with early-stage breast cancer</strong> – Patients with stage I or II breast cancer are appropriate candidates for neoadjuvant therapy if breast-conserving surgery is not possible due to a high tumor-to-breast ratio, or if their anticipated cosmetic outcome would be suboptimal due to tumor location.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Additionally, neoadjuvant therapy is often recommended to patients with T2 tumors and even T1c triple-negative or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancers, in part to identify patients who might benefit from additional treatments in the adjuvant setting if a pathologic complete response (pCR) is not achieved [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Moreover, these patients would typically receive systemic therapy at some point in their treatment course, and these subtypes are associated with a high likelihood of clinical and pathologic response [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/788.html" rel="external">"Selection and administration of adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative breast cancer", section on 'Patients who received neoadjuvant treatment'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/773.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant systemic therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer", section on 'T-DM1'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/106774.html" rel="external">"Neoadjuvant therapy for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14227.html" rel="external">"ER/PR negative, HER2-negative (triple-negative) breast cancer", section on 'Chemotherapy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/122902.html" rel="external">"Choice of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for HER2-negative breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The role of neoadjuvant therapy in patients with early-stage hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancers is less clear. While chemotherapy in such cases infrequently yields a pCR [<a href="#rid19">19-22</a>], neoadjuvant treatment will often induce tumor shrinkage that may be sufficient to allow breast conservation in a patient who otherwise would have required mastectomy. Whether such patients should be offered neoadjuvant chemotherapy or neoadjuvant endocrine therapy depends on many factors, including patient age, comorbidities, and clinical stage. Tumor characteristics including grade and intensity of hormone-receptor expression may help differentiate between patients more or less likely to respond to chemotherapy versus endocrine therapy. Data suggest that tumor proliferation indices such as Ki-67 or gene expression assays (such as Oncotype Dx, MammaPrint, or EndoPredict) may help oncologists to select between treatment options in these patients. Further discussion of indications for neoadjuvant therapy for estrogen receptor-positive tumors is found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/98345.html" rel="external">"Neoadjuvant management of newly diagnosed hormone-positive breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Limited clinically node-positive disease</strong> – Another possible indication for neoadjuvant therapy in patients with early-stage breast cancer, regardless of the size of the primary tumor, is to downstage the axillary nodes in patients with limited clinically node-positive disease (cN1). The standard surgical approach to patients with clinically node-positive breast cancer, whether the patient received neoadjuvant therapy or not, had been an axillary lymph node dissection, which is associated with higher rates of lymphedema and restricted mobility of the affected arm, and other locoregional complications than those reported following sentinel lymph node surgery. Neoadjuvant therapy, particularly chemotherapy in patients with more aggressive breast cancer subtypes, often converts cN1 patients to pathologically node negative (ypN0), and studies with neoadjuvant chemotherapy suggest that many such patients can be effectively managed with limited lymph node removal with sentinel lymph node surgery alone or with resection of the biopsy-proven node (targeted axillary dissection) and, as a result, will have much lower rates of lymphedema and other complications. (See <a class="local">'Positive axilla prior to treatment'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients with temporary contraindications for surgery</strong> – Neoadjuvant systemic therapy is a treatment option for patients who have medical contraindications to undergoing surgery at diagnosis but in whom surgery is anticipated at a later date, such as women with breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy or patients requiring short-term anticoagulation such as those with recent pulmonary embolism, deep-vein thrombosis, or placement of drug-eluding coronary stents. Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, when access to operating rooms was limited, use of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy was increased for patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15801.html" rel="external">"Gestational breast cancer: Treatment", section on 'Systemic therapy'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11990037"><span class="h1">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pretreatment evaluation is aimed at confirming pathology and documenting the extent of the disease.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11994795"><span class="h2">Tumor evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As with all patients presenting with a new diagnosis of breast cancer, histopathologic confirmation and evaluation of receptor status (estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) must be obtained before initiating treatment. A radiopaque clip should be placed in the tumor (or several clips in the setting of multifocal or multicentric disease), either at the time of the diagnostic biopsy or at some other time prior to initiation of neoadjuvant therapy. The clip allows for identification of the site of disease to guide surgical resection after neoadjuvant therapy as well as directing pathologic assessment of the surgical specimen, especially in cases in which neoadjuvant therapy significantly shrinks or eradicates the tumor. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/796.html" rel="external">"Breast biopsy", section on 'Clip placement'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3660172124"><span class="h2">Imaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Imaging should be performed prior to neoadjuvant therapy to document the extent of the disease. In many cases, ultrasound (US) of the breast is sufficient to document tumor size. However, breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be helpful to evaluate disease extent, including assessing for the presence of multifocal or multicentric disease, especially in patients with dense breast tissue on mammography; possible spread to deep axillary, subpectoral, or internal mammary lymph nodes; or invasion of the underlying chest wall. The benefits of detecting more extensive involvement in the ipsilateral breast and/or potential additional sites of pathology in either breast with MRI must be weighed against the risks of false-positive or clinically insignificant findings that might cause a patient who is a candidate for breast conservation to decide to undergo unilateral, or even bilateral, mastectomy. Retrospective analyses have demonstrated no improvement in outcomes and higher mastectomy rates in patients undergoing pretreatment MRI. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14972.html" rel="external">"MRI of the breast and emerging technologies", section on 'Preoperative evaluation of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients'</a>.)</p><p>While the presence of overt metastatic disease would alter the patient's treatment plan and goals, the likelihood of detecting it, in the absence of suspicious symptoms or findings, with routine imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT), bone, and/or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scans, is low. To avoid the unnecessary expense of these tests and the complications of dealing with false-positive findings, we typically omit them in patients with clinical stage I or II disease but order them in patients with clinical stage III disease or inflammatory breast cancers, as well as in patients with symptoms or abnormal findings (including laboratory values) that might be an indication of otherwise occult metastatic disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/744.html" rel="external">"Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of newly diagnosed breast cancer", section on 'Staging'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11994803"><span class="h2">Node evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>cN1 disease includes patients with clinically palpable axillary nodes and those with sonographically detected axillary nodal disease with pathologic confirmation of axillary metastasis identified by fine needle aspiration (FNA) or core needle biopsy (CNB). Of note, the number of abnormal appearing nodes on axillary US or MRI does not impact the cN stage. cN2 disease requires fixed or matted axillary nodes on examination.</p><p>To assess nodal status, we perform a physical exam of the axilla in all patients with a new diagnosis of breast cancer. For those in whom lymph nodes are palpated, we perform US-guided FNA or CNB to confirm pathologic involvement. The aspiration or biopsy is done to rule out a false-positive clinical finding due to reactive lymph nodes or other benign histology.</p><p>For those in whom no abnormal lymph nodes can be palpated, we routinely obtain an axillary US. If no abnormal lymph nodes are identified, we proceed with neoadjuvant treatment. If there are any suspicious lymph nodes on US (based on size or the presence of a thickened cortex), we perform FNA or CNB of the suspicious lymph node. If positive, this is categorized as cN1 disease. While there are false-negative results with either FNA or CNB (20 to 25 percent for FNA, and slightly lower for CNB), a positive sample, in a patient previously considered node negative, will allow more appropriate treatment planning, especially as it relates to surgical management of the axilla after neoadjuvant therapy. (See <a class="local">'Positive axilla prior to treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>In a patient with a positive FNA or CNB, we favor placement of a radiopaque clip or other marker (eg, ink) in the biopsy-proven involved lymph node to enable identification after neoadjuvant therapy. In patients with node-positive disease at presentation, removal of the marked node at the time of post-neoadjuvant therapy sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) lowers the false-negative rate (1.4 versus 10.1 percent with SLNB alone, in one prospective study) [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>]. The marked node will be identified as one of the SLNs in 73 to 77 percent of cases [<a href="#rid25">25-27</a>]; preoperative localization of the marked node can increase the likelihood that it is removed during SLN surgery.</p><p>While some specialists favor pretreatment SLNB for those without evidence of lymph node involvement on exam or imaging, we typically defer this until after neoadjuvant treatment. This avoids an additional surgical procedure and preserves the prognostic information obtained from the status of the nodes after neoadjuvant therapy [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Although it is not our preferred approach, the management of patients with clinically negative axillary exams who undergo a pretreatment SLNB is discussed below. Resection of a positive SLN prior to neoadjuvant therapy means that pathologic assessment of response after therapy is not complete, as axillary response cannot be known given the SLN was removed. Hence, SLN surgery prior to systemic therapy is discouraged.

The imaging modality that most clearly demonstrated the extent of disease at presentation is likely to be the most informative after neoadjuvant treatment. On the other hand, considerations for surgical planning may dictate the decision as to whether to obtain post-treatment studies and the type of imaging performed. For example, repeat breast imaging after neoadjuvant therapy may not be necessary in patients with multicentric disease, extensive calcifications, or other clear contraindications to breast-conserving therapy (BCT), or in patients who have decided to undergo mastectomy even if they are candidates for BCT. </p><p>Even in patients with a clinical complete response to neoadjuvant therapy, no standard imaging modality can exclude the presence of residual invasive disease, as the correlation between tumor measurements by physical examination, imaging (mammography, ultrasound [US], or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), and tumor size on final pathologic analysis is modest [<a href="#rid28">28-36</a>]. This lack of concordance may be due to the variable patterns of tumor response to neoadjuvant treatment, which range from symmetric shrinkage around a central core (which may contain residual cancer or fibrotic tissue) to apparent complete resolution of a discrete mass despite persistence of microscopic foci of invasive cancer. Thus, surgical resection remains the standard of care even in the setting of clinical complete and imaging response.</p><p>Positron emission tomography (PET) scans (fluoro-2-deoxyglucose PET [FDG-PET]) are not sufficiently sensitive for detecting residual disease to be used in routine assessment of the impact of neoadjuvant therapy [<a href="#rid37">37,38</a>] and are not routinely recommended following neoadjuvant therapy unless there is concern for the development of distant metastases. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2215923392"><span class="h2">Management of the axilla</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For women who have received neoadjuvant therapy, our approach to the axilla depends on the presence of suspicious nodes prior to neoadjuvant therapy (either on exam or axillary US), the results of a fine needle aspiration (FNA) or core needle biopsy (CNB) of such nodes prior to treatment, and clinical node status following neoadjuvant therapy  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef127120" href="/z/d/graphic/127120.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).

Patients with residual nodal involvement typically receive regional nodal irradiation after ALND.

Similarly, an ALND can usually be avoided in patients with a single negative sentinel node (ypN0) resected that contains the clip or other marker. However, for those patients who have only one sentinel lymph node without a clip identifier, the optimal management is unclear, and an ALND may be preferable, depending on patient values and preferences.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>More extensive disease or poor response to neoadjuvant treatment</strong> – For patients with either:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Baseline extensive nodal disease (cN2 or cN3  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110848" href="/z/d/graphic/110848.html" rel="external">table 1</a>)), irrespective of response to neoadjuvant treatment, <strong>or</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Baseline cN1 disease with a persistent clinically positive axilla after neoadjuvant therapy (ycN1),</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3">We suggest ALND (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>).

Patients who remain inoperable should consider next-line chemotherapy in order to reduce the tumor mass and create opportunities for surgery and radiation treatment. Patients who develop metastatic disease during neoadjuvant therapy are treated as appropriate for stage IV disease with their tumor subtype and extent of disease.
