         Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) classically presents as acute kidney injury (AKI) after the use of known offending drugs and is sometimes associated with the urinary findings of pyuria, hematuria, and white cell casts [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-4
         </a>
         ]. Less frequently, AIN may present as a component of DRESS (ie, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) syndrome or be secondary to infection, sarcoidosis, or checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. Signs of systemic allergy, such as a maculopapular rash, peripheral eosinophilia, and eosinophiluria, are present in less than one-third of patients [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Proteinuria is common, but excretion is usually &lt;1 g/day. However, nephrotic-range proteinuria may occur and presumably reflects cytokine-induced injury to the glomerulus or an underlying glomerular disease (eg, diabetic kidney disease). It is most often seen with AIN caused by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. Histologically, AIN is characterized by the infiltration of T cells, macrophages, and plasma cells in the interstitial compartment. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7234.html" rel="external">

         Discontinuation of the potential causative agent is a mainstay of therapy; glucocorticoids are initiated in cases with severe impairment of kidney function or in patients who fail to improve with discontinuation of the offending drug.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are no data from randomized, controlled trials or large observational studies that inform the treatment of AIN. Our approach is based upon low-quality data  (

         Our approach to drug discontinuation is as follows:

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         We discontinue the potentially offending drug in nearly all patients with suspected AIN.

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         If there are multiple potentially offending drugs, we generally discontinue them sequentially if the acute kidney injury (AKI) is mild; however, we discontinue them simultaneously if the AKI is severe.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         However, we do not discontinue the potentially offending drug if the drug is a crucial treatment for a severe disease process, there are no reasonable alternatives, and the diagnosis is uncertain (eg, a kidney biopsy has not been performed).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Certain situations call for avoidance of entire classes and related classes of medications (eg, patients who develop AIN secondary to a cephalosporin should avoid other cephalosporins or penicillins).
        </p>
        <p>
         Most cases of AIN are allergic reactions, as evidenced by frequent presence of systemic manifestations of hypersensitivity, absence of a dose-response relationship, improvement following cessation of the drug, and rapid recurrence following accidental re-exposure to the drug or a closely related antigen [
         <a href="#rid9">

          —
         </span>
         Patients with AKI from suspected AIN that is severe enough to warrant dialysis within 24 to 72 hours of the initial evaluation should have a kidney biopsy and initiate glucocorticoid therapy without delay (unless contraindicated). Contraindications for a kidney biopsy are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3067.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, treatment with glucocorticoids should be initiated promptly to limit the extent of damage caused by inflammation and to improve the chances of recovery. If biopsy can be performed on the same day as the initial evaluation, then waiting to start the glucocorticoids until immediately after the biopsy may be reasonable. However, sometimes dialysis may be necessary prior to the biopsy to reduce the risk of bleeding complications. In such situations, glucocorticoids should be initiated prior to biopsy since it should not alter the interpretability of the biopsy.
        </p>

         Some, but not all, contributors treat initially with 500 to 1000 mg of intravenous

          prednisone
         </a>
         at 1 mg/kg daily for definitive management of AIN. Other contributors start prednisone therapy without first giving intravenous methylprednisolone. Thus, we think that either approach is reasonable.
        </p>
        <p>
         Immunosuppressive therapy has been employed to treat AIN that persists despite discontinuation of the offending agent. However, the benefits of therapy are somewhat uncertain and based upon observational data, given the absence of randomized controlled trials to support this practice.
        </p>
        <p>
         The best data supportive of glucocorticoid treatment come from a retrospective, multicenter study of 61 patients with biopsy-proven AIN, of whom 52 were treated with glucocorticoids [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. Despite the small comparison group of nine patients who were not treated with glucocorticoids, those treated had a lower frequency of dialysis (4 versus 44 percent) and a lower serum creatinine level at 18 months (2.1 versus 3.7 mg/dL [186 and 327 micromol/L]). Among treated patients, those who started glucocorticoids within seven days of withdrawal of the offending drug were more likely to recover kidney function compared with those who started later (odds ratio [OR] 6.6, 95% CI 1.3-33.6). Other smaller studies have shown similar results [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,13,14
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         However, not all studies have shown a benefit from glucocorticoids. As an example, in a retrospective analysis that included 95 patients with biopsy-proven, drug-induced AIN, 83 patients received
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">
          prednisone

         and 12 did not [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. There was no difference in the probability of recovery of kidney function at six months between the two groups. Additional retrospective studies have also questioned the benefits of glucocorticoids for AIN [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,16-19
         </a>
         ]. A lack of glucocorticoid effect in negative studies is thought to be due to inclusion of patients with more severe disease and those with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced AIN, which does not respond to glucocorticoids [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,4,8
         </a>
         ]. (See

         Patients who develop AIN that is nonsevere without imminent need for dialysis may be observed for three to seven days after discontinuation of the potential offending agent. If the kidney function has not stabilized in this interval, then a kidney biopsy should be performed and glucocorticoids initiated, if AIN is confirmed. If a biopsy can be performed on the same day, then it may be reasonable to wait to start the glucocorticoids until immediately after the biopsy. We start
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         If kidney function stabilizes or improves during the three- to seven-day interval, then the offending medication should be added to the allergy list. In addition, if there is histologic confirmation of AIN, then the offending drug should be added to the allergy list as well.

         Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced AIN does not generally respond to glucocorticoid therapy. The reasons for this are poorly understood. NSAID-induced AIN is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         Patients initiated on glucocorticoid treatment need to be monitored closely for response. Generally, if the offending agent is discontinued and glucocorticoids are initiated within seven days of appropriate interventions, then many, but not all, patients will begin to recover kidney function over the subsequent one to two weeks. Patients with other etiologies of AIN (ie, non-drug induced) may take longer to show initial recovery and require a longer overall duration of treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients who show improvement in kidney function within one to two weeks of treatment may begin to taper after two full weeks of treatment at 1 mg/kg.
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">
          Prednisone
         </a>
         should be reduced by 10 mg every three to five days until a dose of 10 mg is reached, followed by a slower taper to prevent adrenal insufficiency. The total duration of treatment ranges from 4 to 12 weeks [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,9,13,14
         </a>
         ]. However, treatment length may be tailored to the individual with the assessment of response to, and side effects from, glucocorticoid therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         We take the following action in patients with drug-induced AIN who fail to recover within three to four weeks of withdrawing the offending agent and initiating glucocorticoids:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         We consider alternate etiologies of AKI, especially if a biopsy was not performed to confirm AIN. If feasible, a biopsy should be performed at this time.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         If AIN was confirmed by biopsy, then failure to recover may reflect substantial chronic kidney damage rather than acute inflammatory injury [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Thus, careful attention should be paid to the degree of interstitial fibrosis, presence of granulomatous inflammation, and other chronic histologic changes that may impact the degree of response to glucocorticoids. Such patients with severe chronic changes and no evidence of an acute inflammatory infiltrate are unlikely to improve and should have glucocorticoids tapered and discontinued.

         However, if there is pathological demonstration of an inflammatory infiltrate composed of T cells, plasma cells, and eosinophils in the interstitium, then we would extend the course of glucocorticoids or replace the glucocorticoids with an alternative immunosuppressive agent. There are no high-quality data. However, in our practice, we would continue glucocorticoid therapy for a total of 8 to 12 weeks unless the patient developed a glucocorticoid-associated serious adverse event. If there is no response at 8 to 12 weeks, or if glucocorticoids could not be continued due to side effects, we would switch to

         MMF was used for 13 to 34 months in eight patients with biopsy-proven AIN who had responded to but who could not tolerate withdrawal of glucocorticoids after six months [

          21

         ]. After addition of MMF, all patients were able to discontinue glucocorticoids, and only two patients failed to show improvement in serum creatinine (one with a positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody [ANCA] and another with AIN of unknown etiology). The applicability of these results to drug-induced AIN is limited since this series only included two patients with drug-induced AIN.

         </span>
         For drug-induced AIN, prognostic data are most available for methicillin, which is no longer available because it was estimated to cause AIN in up to 17 percent of patients who were treated for more than 10 days [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Recovery of kidney function was observed in the great majority of cases of AIN due to methicillin, either with discontinuation of the offending drug or with glucocorticoid therapy [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,9,16
         </a>
         ]. The proportion recovering kidney function appears to be lower in AIN due to drugs other than methicillin [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,16,23,24
         </a>
         ]. The prognosis of AIN due to other inciting factors (eg, sarcoidosis, infection) is not well described. Acute dialysis is often required [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,17,18
         </a>
         ], but only approximately 10 percent of patients remain dialysis dependent [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4,23
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Recovery of kidney function is often incomplete, with persistent elevation of the serum creatinine concentration in up to 40 percent of patients [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in a review of published series of AIN in which many patients had a peak serum creatinine &gt;5.5 mg/dL (500 micromol/L), the serum creatinine at the end of follow-up was less than 1.2 and 1.7 mg/dL (110 and 150 micromol/L) in 49 and 68 percent, respectively [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The final serum creatinine concentration did not correlate with the maximum value during AIN.
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinical indicators of a decreased likelihood of recovery include prolonged kidney failure (greater than three weeks), AIN associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use, and certain histologic findings (including interstitial granulomas, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy) on kidney biopsy. As an example, in a multicenter, retrospective study of 182 patients with biopsy-proven AIN treated with glucocorticoids, patients with &gt;50 percent interstitial fibrosis on the initial biopsy were more likely to experience poor recovery (defined as &lt;25 percent improvement in glomerular function) at six months compared with patients with a lesser degree of chronicity (odds ratio [OR] 8.7, 95% CI 2.7-27.4) [

          Presentation
         </strong>
         – Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) classically presents as acute kidney injury (AKI) after the use of known offending drugs and is sometimes associated with the typical urinary findings of pyuria, hematuria, and white cell casts. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Discontinue the offending drug
         </strong>
         – Most cases of AIN are allergic reactions, as evidenced by frequent presence of systemic manifestations of hypersensitivity, absence of a dose-response relationship, improvement following cessation of the drug, and rapid recurrence following accidental re-exposure to the drug or a closely related antigen. As such, discontinuation of the potential causative agent is a mainstay of therapy. Our approach to drug discontinuation is as follows (see
         <a class="local">
          'Discontinue the offending agent'
         </a>
         above):

         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         We discontinue the potentially offending drug in nearly all patients with suspected AIN. Certain situations call for avoidance of entire classes and related classes of medications (eg, patients who develop AIN secondary to a cephalosporin should avoid other cephalosporins or penicillins).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         If there are multiple potentially offending drugs, we generally discontinue them sequentially if the AKI is mild; however, we discontinue them simultaneously if the AKI is severe.
        </p>
        <p>

         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         However, we do not discontinue the potentially offending drug if the drug is a crucial treatment for a severe disease process, there are no reasonable alternatives, and the diagnosis is uncertain (eg, a kidney biopsy has not been performed).

          Glucocorticoid therapy in selected patients
         </strong>
         – In patients with biopsy-proven AIN, we suggest glucocorticoid therapy in addition to withdrawal of the offending agent rather than withdrawal of the offending agent alone (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C

         ). An exception is nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced AIN, which does not generally respond to glucocorticoid therapy.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Our approach to timing of kidney biopsy and glucocorticoid therapy is as follows (see

         Patients with AKI from suspected AIN that is severe enough to warrant dialysis within 24 to 72 hours of the initial evaluation should have a kidney biopsy and initiate glucocorticoid therapy without delay (unless contraindicated). Some, but not all, contributors treat initially with 500 to 1000 mg of intravenous
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9639" href="/z/d/drug information/9639.html" rel="external">

          prednisone
         </a>
         at 1 mg/kg daily for definitive management of AIN. Other contributors start prednisone therapy without first giving intravenous methylprednisolone. Thus, we think that either approach is reasonable.

         Patients who develop AIN that is nonsevere without imminent need for dialysis may be observed for three to seven days after discontinuation of the potential offending agent. If the kidney function has not stabilized in this interval, then a kidney biopsy should be performed and glucocorticoids initiated if AIN is confirmed. We start

          Monitoring and dose adjustment of glucocorticoids
         </strong>
         – Patients initiated on glucocorticoid treatment need to be monitored closely for response, which is usually seen within seven days of the onset of appropriate interventions. Patients who show improvement in kidney function within one to two weeks of treatment may begin to taper after two full weeks of treatment at 1 mg/kg.

          Prednisone
         </a>
         should be reduced by 10 mg every three to five days until a dose of 10 mg is reached, followed by a slower taper to prevent adrenal insufficiency. However, treatment length may be tailored to the individual with the assessment of response to, and side effects from, glucocorticoid therapy. (See
