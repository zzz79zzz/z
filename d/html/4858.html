         Patients with cancer have a high rate of comorbid psychiatric disorders as well as nonspecific psychological distress [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The prevalence of comorbid psychiatric disorders and clinically significant psychological distress among patients with cancer may reach as high as 85 percent. However, it is estimated that fewer than 50 percent of cancer patients with psychiatric disorders and distress are identified and referred for appropriate care.
        </p>
        <p>
         Comorbid psychiatric disorders in patients with cancer may be associated with increased mortality. As an example, a national registry study identified patients with esophageal cancer (n &gt;1600) who underwent surgery and had no prior history of psychiatric disorders [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. After adjusting for potential confounding factors (eg, age, marital status, and tumor stage and histology), the analyses found that all-cause mortality was 70 percent greater among patients who developed psychiatric disorders, compared with patients who were free of psychiatric disorders (hazard ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.3).

         This topic reviews the clinical features and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in patients with cancer. The clinical features and assessment of psychiatric disorders in palliative care are discussed separately, as is the management of psychiatric disorders in cancer patients. (See

         Among patients with cancer, comorbid psychiatric disorders are present in approximately one-third:

         In a meta-analysis of 17 studies in which cancer patients were interviewed (number of patients not reported), the point prevalence of psychiatric disorders (adjustment disorders, anxiety disorders, or depressive disorders) was approximately 38 percent; however, heterogeneity across studies was high [

         A meta-analysis of eight observational studies included patients with cancer (n = 1448) who were assessed with validated instruments, and found that at least one psychiatric disorder (adjustment, anxiety, depressive, somatic symptom, or substance use disorders; or posttraumatic stress disorder) was present in 32 percent; heterogeneity across studies was significant [

         A subsequent cross-sectional study of patients with cancer who were interviewed (n &gt;2000) found that at least one mental disorder (eg, adjustment, anxiety, depressive, somatic symptom, or substance use disorders) was present in 32 percent [

        <p>
         As is the case with other general medical illnesses, cancer patients are more likely to experience psychiatric disorders than the general population [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-8
         </a>
         ]. A national registry study identified patients with cancer (n &gt;300,000) and individuals without cancer (n &gt;3,000,000), and compared the composite incidence of psychiatric disorders (adjustment, anxiety, depressive, somatic symptom, or substance use disorders) in the two groups [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. After adjusting for age, sex, and education, the analyses showed that the incidence of psychiatric disorders was higher in cancer patients than controls, and the increased rate of mental disorders was greatest in the first week after diagnosis, such that cancer patients were seven times more likely to have a psychiatric disorder (hazard ratio 6.7, 95% CI 6.1-7.4). The magnitude of the elevated rate subsequently decreased, but the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in cancer patients remained elevated 10 years after diagnosis (hazard ratio 1.1, 95% CI 1.1-1.2).

         Neuropsychiatric manifestation of cancer per se or its treatment – As an example, primary or metastatic brain cancer can alter cognition, emotions, and behavior. In addition, hormone therapy such as corticosteroids can induce disturbances that range along a spectrum from minor symptoms (eg, irritability, affective lability, or insomnia) to episodes of mania or depression, as well as neurocognitive disorders (delirium or reversible dementia). Some chemotherapy agents can also cause neuropsychiatric symptoms. (See

         Assessment of patients with cancer for psychiatric symptoms should occur periodically, particularly when changes occur in the patient’s cancer (eg, disease progression) or treatment status. Psychiatric symptoms/syndromes can appear, disappear, and reappear, and can be transient or persistent during any phase of cancer (diagnostic work-up, post-diagnosis and pretreatment, treatment, survivorship, recurrence of cancer, and palliative care) [

          ADJUSTMENT DISORDERS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS

          —
         </span>
         For many patients, receiving a cancer diagnosis and undergoing treatment is a stressful life event. In addition, many patients express concerns that stress has “caused” their cancer or that their disease will be exacerbated by further exposure to stress. These concerns can themselves be stressful.
        </p>
        <p>
         Psychological distress can occur at multiple points throughout the illness: during the diagnostic work-up of a concerning symptom, at the time of the cancer diagnosis, the start of treatment, and at the time of recurrence [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Although the initial psychological reaction after a cancer diagnosis can be intense, it usually dissipates.
        </p>
        <p>
         Emotional distress occurs along a continuum of severity and can manifest with a variety of symptoms, such as fear, apprehension about the future, impaired cognition, worry about roles, and thoughts of death; physical symptoms such as impaired sleep and appetite may also be present [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,13,14
         </a>
         ]. In addition, the severity of distress can fluctuate at different times. Although distress is a symptom rather than a psychiatric disorder, persistent significant distress is a criterion for diagnosing adjustment disorder, as well as depressive disorders and anxiety disorders [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Distress can occur in family members as well as patients with cancer [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinically significant distress in patients with cancer is associated with poor outcomes, such as nonadherence to cancer treatment and monitoring, and with poorer quality of life [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In addition, distress is associated with decreased survival in many studies [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. As an example, a nationally representative survey included individuals with a history of cancer (n = 295); after adjusting for potential confounding factors (eg, age, sex, and smoking history), the analyses found that cancer mortality was two times greater among individuals with distress than individuals not distressed (hazard ratio 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.7) [

         We suggest that clinicians screen all patients with cancer for psychosocial distress using a self-report validated instrument and that screening be implemented with services in place to ensure follow-up for diagnosis and treatment. Screening should occur when the initial diagnosis of cancer is made and periodically thereafter as clinically indicated, especially with changes in cancer or treatment status (eg, recurrence or progression of cancer). This approach is viewed as best practice in cancer care and is consistent with practice guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, American College of Surgeons, and Institute of Medicine [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,22
         </a>
         ]. The rationale for screening is that distress is serious, prevalent, under-recognized, and treatable, and that standardized, valid screening tools are available.
        </p>
        <p>
         We typically use the self-administered Distress Thermometer  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113718" href="/z/d/graphic/113718.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ) to screen for distress in patients with cancer. This tool assesses the patient’s level of distress during the past week with a single Likert (visual analogue) scale ranging from 0 (no distress) to 10 (extreme distress) [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]; a score ≥4 suggests clinically significant distress [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,24-29
         </a>
         ]. The scale is often paired with a checklist of potential stressors, such as practical problems (eg, transportation or occupational difficulties), family problems (eg, conflicts with partner), emotional problems (eg, worry and sadness), and physical problems (eg, fatigue and pain) [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. The Distress Thermometer is widely used and recommended due to its brevity and ease of use, and is available in more than 20 languages [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30-33
         </a>
         ]. Although a 2007 pooled analysis of nine studies with nearly 1500 cancer patients concluded that detection of distress with the Distress Thermometer was modest [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34

          26,28,29,35-38
         </a>
         ]. As an example, a prospective study of 462 patients with a variety of cancers found that sensitivity was 87 percent, specificity was 73 percent, and positive predictive value was 53 percent [
         <a href="#rid27">

        </p>
        <p>
         In screening for distress, reasonable alternatives to the Distress Thermometer include the self-report, two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2)  (

          table 2

         ) [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. Other instruments that have been used include the self-report, four-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4), which assesses anxiety (feeling nervous or anxious) and depression (dysphoria and anhedonia) [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39

        </p>
        <p>
         Uptake of routine screening for psychosocial distress in patients with cancer is often limited [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. Although patients with cancer largely accept screening, multiple studies indicate that approximately 25 to 50 percent of patients are not screened [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30,32,40
         </a>
         ]. Barriers to screening include staff turnover and lack of staff who are trained to conduct screening, as well as lack of time for the different steps involved in screening: administering and scoring the screening tool, interpreting the results, referring patients to psychiatric services, following up with patients to ensuring their distress is being managed, documenting the process, and auditing medical records for quality improvement [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,30,40,41
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Several strategies have been suggested to increase the rate of screening for psychosocial distress [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ]. These include securing the support ("buy-in”) of hospital/clinic administrators and clinical staff to provide funding for staff training and protected time to implement the different processes involved in screening (eg, patients referrals and follow-up) [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,30,40,41
         </a>
         ]. Other interventions include providing educational materials and reminders, forming a dyad of clinicians to collaborate in screening cancer patients, and establishing an oncology interdisciplinary committee (eg, oncologist, social worker, nurse, and psychiatrist) to develop screening policies and oversee screening efforts [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30,40-42
         </a>
         ]. Another approach that appears readily acceptable to patients is to screen for distress via mobile (smart) telephones [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. Nevertheless, studies of interventions to improve the rate of screening and referral for psychiatric services suggest that the interventions are generally not beneficial [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Screening for psychological distress in patients with cancer appears to facilitate communication between patients and clinicians, but other benefits have not been clearly demonstrated due to mixed results across randomized trials [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. However, in larger studies and studies that provided adequate staff training, screening led to better outcomes [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ]. As an example, one trial (n &gt;700 cancer patients) compared full screening (multiple assessments for distress, anxiety, and depression) plus referrals for psychosocial services as needed, with minimal screening using the Distress Thermometer plus usual care [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. At the three-month follow-up, clinically significant distress was present in fewer patients who received full screening/referrals, compared with patients who received minimal screening plus usual care (36 versus 49 percent).

         Cancer related fatigue is defined as “a distressing, persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning” [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44

The prevalence, time course, screening, and assessment of fatigue in patients with cancer is discussed separately. (See

        <p>
         If the cancer-related fatigue occurs in conjunction with other depressive symptoms like dysphoria, anhedonia, and suicidal ideation or behavior, fatigue may be a symptom of a treatable depressive syndrome, such as major depression  (

Anticipatory grief symptoms can begin far before death and may arise when cancer is first diagnosed. In addition, anticipatory grief is triggered by current losses such as independent functioning, as well as the anticipated loss of life. Anticipation and psychological preparation for death may facilitate adaptation to one’s impending death.

         Patients with cancer frequently experience insomnia symptoms consisting of transient difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep [

          46
         </a>
         ], including individuals who never had sleep problems previously. In addition, cancer patients often develop insomnia syndromes consisting of repeated insomnia symptoms (eg, more than three times/week for at least one month) that cause distress or impair functioning.
        </p>
        <p>
         Among patients receiving active treatment for cancer, as well as cancer survivors who have finished treatment, insomnia occurs in up to 60 percent [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. As an example, one prospective study of patients (n = 856) with a variety of cancer types who were scheduled for a curative surgical procedure found that at baseline, insomnia syndromes were present in approximately 30 percent, and that insomnia symptoms were present in another 30 percent, for a total prevalence of insomnia of approximately 60 percent in this population [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
         The etiology of insomnia in patients with cancer often involves multiple predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. These include symptoms from the cancer per se (eg, tumors that produce steroids or cause pain or dyspnea), as well as cancer treatments (eg, corticosteroids). Other potential causes of insomnia include stress and anxiety associated with a cancer diagnosis or treatment, poor sleep hygiene  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71116" href="/z/d/graphic/71116.html" rel="external">
          table 4

         ), and cognitive distortions about sleep (eg, the belief that lack of sleep will always affect daytime functioning or that fatigue warrants more sleep).
        </p>
        <p>
         Insomnia symptoms in patients with cancer can persist after treatments for cancer have ended. An 18-month, prospective observational study of cancer patients found that among patients with insomnia syndromes at baseline (n = 240), the syndrome persisted for the duration of follow-up in 38 percent [
         <a href="#rid48">

         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. The Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale consists of 10 items, one of which assesses sleep; the scale is completed by the patient, caregiver, or clinician. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is an eight-item self-report scale that assesses only sleep. However, most clinicians involved in the psychosocial care of cancer survivors do not screen for insomnia. In addition, there are no high-quality studies that demonstrate routine screening of all cancer patients for insomnia improves outcomes.

         Cancer pain is a symptom that affects most aspects of a person's life, including physical functioning, activities of daily living, mental health, and social interactions. Living with uncontrolled pain can be associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms that may resolve once the pain is better controlled.

         Patients with cancer may manifest problematic personality traits or personality disorders that lead to disruptive behavior [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49,50
         </a>
         ]. As an example, patients with a tendency toward excessive control, demanding behavior, and unrealistic expectations about their care may become angry when treatment does not proceed as they want and complain to the clinician’s supervisor or to licensing agencies or threaten to sue. In addition, patients with antisocial personality disorder often lack empathy and may menace clinicians, which can necessitate hospital security intervention or legal action. Patients with difficult personality traits and disorders can evoke strong emotions in clinicians, including feelings of betrayal, guilt, anger, and intimidation.
        </p>
        <p>
         We suggest that oncology teams identify problematic patient behaviors and collectively discuss how best to set limits, in an effort to foster a therapeutic alliance with the patient and preserve the treatment plan. The clinical features and diagnosis of personality disorders are discussed separately. (See

         Many patients diagnosed with and living with a life-threatening form of cancer experience symptoms of acute stress disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57500" href="/z/d/graphic/57500.html" rel="external">
          table 6
         </a>
         ), but far fewer patients meet criteria for these syndromes. As an example, prospective structured clinical interviews of 166 patients with breast cancer found that after cancer was diagnosed but before treatment commenced, at least one stress disorder symptom was present in 83 percent of patients (mean number of symptoms was three); at the one-year follow-up, at least one symptom was present in 57 percent (mean number of symptoms was two) [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. By contrast, the full syndrome of acute stress disorder or PTSD was present at the time of the cancer diagnosis and the follow-up in 4 and 2 percent of patients, which appears to be comparable to the rate in the general population.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some studies of cancer patients, using self-report screening measures, have found relatively high rates of comorbid PTSD (approximately 25 to 30 percent) [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52,53
         </a>
         ]. However, these rates are likely to be inflated because most screening measures are not validated for generating a diagnosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         If patients with cancer present with PTSD symptoms or the full syndrome, clinicians should not assume that the cancer is the sole traumatic event [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53
         </a>
         ]. Evaluations should include questions about trauma that may have preceded the cancer diagnosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to prior history of trauma, other risk factors for PTSD in cancer patients include younger age, less social support, perceiving the cancer as menacing, problematic interactions with treatment staff, and advanced disease [

         Over 50 percent of the care received by patients with cancer is provided by family caregivers, and caregiving is associated with stress and psychiatric problems. As an example, a small cross-sectional study of family caregivers (n = 91) for patients with cancer found that the mental health of caregivers was worse than population norms, and that 62 percent of caregivers reported that their emotional well-being had worsened as a result of caregiving. In addition, a review found that anxiety and depression each occurred in approximately 40 percent of caregivers, and that sleep disturbances and fatigue were common as well [

         A review found that the prevalence of suicidal ideation in patients with cancer varied greatly across 11 studies, but that the best evidence suggested that thoughts of suicide occurred in roughly 10 to 15 percent of patients, which the authors concluded was comparable to the prevalence in the general population [

        <p>
         Patients with cancer who report that they would be better off dead or had thoughts of self-harm should be interviewed to assess the nature of these thoughts and to ascertain whether suicidal ideation is truly present, because these patients may be preoccupied with thoughts of dying from cancer instead of suicide. A retrospective study included outpatients with cancer (n = 330) who completed the PHQ-9 and indicated that they had had thoughts that they would be better off dead or thoughts of self-harm for at least several days [

         For clinicians who are assessing psychiatric symptoms in patients with cancer, one of the initial goals is to determine whether the symptoms represent a normal response, a psychiatric disorder (either new onset or recurrence), or a manifestation of cancer itself or its treatment. (See
