         Wound complications are important causes of early and late postoperative morbidity following laparotomy. Surgical wounds in normal, healthy individuals heal through an orderly sequence of physiologic events that includes inflammation, epithelialization, fibroplasia, and maturation. Mechanical failure or failure of wound healing at the surgical site can lead to disruption of the closure leading to seroma, hematoma, wound dehiscence, or hernia. Other complications include surgical site infection and nerve injury. This topic will review prevention and treatment of complications of abdominal surgical incisions.

         Hematoma and seroma are collections of blood and serum, respectively. Hematomas are more common than seromas and usually result from failure of primary hemostasis or a bleeding diathesis (eg, anticoagulation). Hematomas and seromas can cause the incision to separate and predispose to wound infection since bacteria can gain access to deeper layers and multiply uninhibited in the stagnant fluid.

         Clinical manifestations usually appear a few days after surgery but can also be delayed. Collections of blood or serum in the wound may be asymptomatic or manifest as swelling, pain, and/or drainage. If the collection is infected, fever, erythema, wound induration, and leukocytosis are also likely. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis can usually be made by inspection and palpation of the wound. If the examination is in question, ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) can be used to confirm the diagnosis.

         Small hematomas and seromas can be managed expectantly, while large collections should be drained. For symptomatic hematomas, the wound is opened partially or completely under sterile conditions. If there is no evidence of infection, the wound can be closed immediately. For suspected seroma, aspiration under sterile conditions may be all that is required.
        </p>
        <p>
         More commonly after exploration, the wound is packed until granulation tissue is present and then closed in a delayed fashion, or the wound is allowed to heal by secondary intention. Delayed closure significantly reduces healing time compared with healing by secondary intention [

         Meticulous hemostasis during surgery is essential. Procedures that are associated with a potential for collections of blood and serum in the subcutaneous tissues may benefit from prophylactic wound drainage, especially when large potential dead spaces are created (ie, repair of large ventral hernia, post-mastectomy). The prevention of fluid collection and subsequent infection is the primary aim. Obesity is a risk factor for local wound complications, and drain placement may reduce complications but is controversial [

         Surgical site infection (SSI), which can be superficial or deep, occurs in approximately 4 percent of clean wounds and 35 percent of grossly contaminated wounds. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definitions of and criteria for surgical site infection are shown in the figures  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80661" href="/z/d/graphic/80661.html" rel="external">

         The diagnosis of wound infection is clinical. Symptoms include localized erythema, induration, warmth, and pain at the incision site. Purulent wound drainage and separation of the wound may occur. Some patients will have systemic evidence of their infection such as fever and leukocytosis. (See

         Necrotizing fasciitis, perhaps the most serious wound infection, can be lethal and is a surgical emergency. It is characterized by a copious, dishwater-like drainage; dusky and friable subcutaneous tissue; and pale, devitalized fascia. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7662.html" rel="external">

         Infected wounds are opened, explored, drained, irrigated, debrided, and dressed open. If fascial disruption is suspected, drainage should be performed in the operating room. Once the infection has cleared and granulation tissue is apparent, the wound can be closed secondarily. The need for antibiotic therapy is determined by the extent of the infection, presence of systemic manifestations, and comorbidities of the patient (eg, immunocompromise, diabetes, chronic steroids).

         solution can be used to apply irrigation under pressure to remove loose dead tissue, exudate, and clots. Saline is favored because it is an isotonic solution and does not interfere with the normal healing process; however, tap water has also been used for wound care in the home or ambulatory setting with good results [

         Mechanical debridement is performed with forceps and scalpel or scissors. All foreign bodies and devitalized tissue are excised because they can delay healing and promote infection. Debridement is discontinued once necrotic tissue has been removed and granulation tissue is present. Enzymatic agents are also available and are useful when manual debridement is not possible [

         Deep wounds may require packing. Gauze is moistened with normal

         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. When the gauze is removed (preferably before it dries out), necrotic tissue is removed with it, which provides a form of debridement. However, once debridement is no longer necessary, the packing material should be changed from gauze to one that is less traumatic to the developing granulation tissue and new epithelial cells. Dressing changes may be required up to three times daily and are continued until the wound surface is mostly covered by granulation tissue. (See

         Dressings that maintain moisture and warmth facilitate healing [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Retention of moisture is important because wound fluids contain tissue growth factors that facilitate reepithelialization and promote autolytic debridement. Once necrotic tissue has been removed and the wound is granulating, these dressings can be changed once a day or every other day in order to avoid disturbing the healing process.
        </p>
        <p>
         The ideal dressing for healing wounds by secondary intention should absorb exudate without leakage, be impermeable to water and bacteria, lack particulate contaminants that could be left in the wound upon removal, and not be traumatic to granulation tissue [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7

         Negative pressure wound therapy (also called vacuum-assisted wound closure) can be used for wounds that have a clean, granulating base. The negative pressure reduces excess fluid accumulation and, with time, the size of large complex wounds. It also helps protect the patient's skin from irritation from frequent dressing changes since it is only changed every three to five days.
        </p>
        <p>
         When treating a surgical wound that is moderately large or is expected to take more than a week to heal, negative pressure wound therapy is preferred to conventional dressing due to decreased pain and skin trauma to the patient and convenience. In a trial of 539 patients with subcutaneous abdominal wounds, negative pressure wound therapy, when compared with conventional wound treatment, resulted in higher wound healing rate within 42 days (36 versus 22 percent) and shorter healing time (36 versus 39 days) but a greater number of wound-related adverse events in treatment-compliant patients (relative risk 1.51, 95% CI 0.99-2.35) [

         Wound infections associated with cellulitis alone (ie, no fluctuance) can be treated with a course of antibiotics without open drainage. Superficial incisional SSIs that have been opened can usually be managed without antibiotics. Topical agents (eg, povidone-iodine, sodium hypochlorite,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="113931" href="/z/d/drug information/113931.html" rel="external">
          hydrogen peroxide
         </a>
         ) do not offer any advantage over drainage and debridement and should be avoided since they may be toxic to fibroblasts and, as a result, impede wound healing.
        </p>
        <p>
         For more severe infections, as evidenced by extension into adjacent tissue or systemic signs, empiric treatment is started using broad-spectrum antibiotics with coverage of gram-positive cocci from the skin as well as the expected flora at the site of operation. Definitive antimicrobial treatment is guided by the clinical response of the patient and, when available, results of Gram stain, wound culture, and sensitivity. However, wound swab cultures often reveal polymicrobial growth, making it difficult to distinguish colonization from true infection. (See

          Use of electrocautery
         </strong>
         – Controversy persists regarding the choice of scalpel or electrocautery for incision of the subcutaneous tissues. Multiple strokes in the incision, whether by scalpel or electrosurgery, result in greater tissue damage. Excessive dissection of the subcutaneous tissues also increases the dead space, which can predispose to fluid collection and subsequent infection. We prefer to use a scalpel for the skin incision and electrosurgery for the subcutaneous tissue and fascia.

         Electrosurgery is associated with varying degrees of thermal damage to tissue. A concern is that the resulting necrotic tissue will become a focus of infection and potentially weaken the repair. However, when a nonmodulated (cutting) current is used with a peak voltage of 200 volts, tissue is vaporized with minimal thermal spread beyond the point of incision, thus producing tissue damage no worse than that resulting from a sharp scalpel. The use of electrosurgery rather than a scalpel for both incision of the skin and underlying tissues is also accepted. This practice is supported by a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing electrosurgery versus scalpel for incision of skin and subcutaneous tissue that showed no differences in the incidence of wound infection [

          Closure of subcutaneous tissue
         </strong>
         – Closure of the subcutaneous tissues following abdominal fascial closure has been studied as it relates to the incidence of wound infection in certain circumstances. In the general surgical literature, there is no evidence to suggest an increased incidence of infectious or noninfectious wound complications when the subcutaneous tissues are not sutured [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. However, in the obstetric literature, there is evidence that closure of Camper's fascia at the time of cesarean delivery reduces the incidence of superficial wound disruption, particularly in patients with at least 2 cm of subcutaneous fat [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>

         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Closure of the subcutaneous tissue at the time of hysterectomy in women with greater than 2.5 centimeters of subcutaneous fat resulted in a lower incidence of wound disruption. In these studies, superficial disruption often was associated with seroma, hematoma, or infection. (See

          Skin closure
         </strong>
         – Staples are less likely to obscure wound drainage and impending separation than subcuticular sutures. If part of the wound becomes infected, only a few select staples need be removed without opening the entire skin incision as generally occurs once a subcuticular suture is cut. (See

          Delayed closure

          17

         Delayed closure may be accomplished under local anesthesia using sutures or a nonocclusive adhesive bandage. Optimally, closure should be performed after granulation tissue has started to form, normally in four to five days, and before wound contraction has begun. Closure beyond 10 postoperative days is associated with greater risk of wound infection, making secondary intention preferable in this circumstance [

          Hypothermia
         </strong>
         – Body temperature and tissue oxygenation may significantly impact wound healing and the risk of SSIs. Perioperative hypothermia by 1 degree Celsius triggers thermoregulatory vasoconstriction, which decreases tissue oxygen tension and directly impairs antibody- and cell-mediated immune defenses. Reduced availability of tissue oxygen interferes with collagen deposition, which decreases tensile wound strength. Suppression of mitogen-induced activation of lymphocytes and reduced production of cytokines, IL-1beta and IL-2, may be responsible for the increased risk of SSIs.

          Adjunctive therapies
         </strong>
         – While delivery of adequate oxygen through the microcirculation is vital for optimal healing and resistance to infection, the benefit of supplemental oxygen in the perioperative period has not been substantiated. Surgical patients should continue to receive oxygen supplementation with cardiorespiratory physiology as the principal determinant. (See

         Fascial disruption is due to abdominal wall tension overcoming tissue or suture strength or knot security. It can occur early or late in the postoperative period and involve a portion of the incision (ie, partial dehiscence) or the entire incision (ie, complete fascial dehiscence). The incidence of fascial disruption ranges from 0.4 to 3.5 percent depending upon the type of surgery performed [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22-25

        </p>
        <p>
         With early fascial dehiscence, the skin closure may be intact depending upon the method of closure (ie, staples, sutures); the patient, nevertheless, is at risk for evisceration. Thus, early postoperative fascial dehiscence is a surgical emergency. The late complication of fascial disruption is incisional hernia. Incisional hernia is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

Randomized trials comparing paramedian, transverse, and midline incisions have reported no significant differences in the frequency of dehiscence or herniation [

         The main causes of wound separation are failure of suture to remain anchored in the fascia, suture breakage, knot failure, and excessive stitch interval, which allows protrusion of viscera [

          32

          33-35
         </a>
         ]. This is usually the result of fascial necrosis from sutures being placed too close to the edge or under too much tension. Sutures should be approximately 1 cm from the wound edge and approximately 1 cm from the adjacent suture to ensure that the tissue is strong enough to hold the suture. For continuous closure, the total length of the suture should be approximately four times the length of the incision [

         Nerve injury can lead to unexpected and distressing symptoms following an otherwise successful operation. Pain, loss of sensation, and abdominal wall weakness are the most common symptoms. Three mechanisms of nerve injury occur: transection (from incision), entrapment (from fascia closure), and compression/stretching (from retraction of tissues or patient positioning). Local nerve injury leading to chronic incisional discomfort is well recognized, but not all chronic incisional pain is due solely to nerve injury.

         Nerve injuries associated with pelvic surgery and hernia surgery are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         Obesity complicates incision selection because exposure is compromised, operating may be difficult, and wound healing may be compromised. Obesity is associated with an increased incidence of wound infection, hematoma formation, incisional hernia, and medical complications.

         <sup>

         </sup>
         , often results in a large protruding panniculus, which presents an especially difficult technical problem. Topography of the abdominal wall is distorted, displacing the umbilicus caudally in a position that does not accurately estimate the sacral promontory.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whether a transverse or longitudinal incision is superior in the patient with obesity remains a controversial issue. However, placing the incision in a deep transverse skin crease, which often contains macerated skin and a high concentration of microorganisms, may increase the risk of infection and should be avoided. Self-retaining retractors  (

        <p>
         In patients without a significant panniculus, traditional midline or transverse incisions can be used and extended, as needed, around the umbilicus [

         Panniculectomy may alleviate problems of surgical exposure, reduce operating time, and reduce postoperative problems with wound healing. Panniculectomy facilitates surgery when adipose tissue is so thick that even the longest instruments cannot reach the site of dissection and when the abdomen hangs down over the symphysis and onto the thighs, thus increasing the risk of poor wound healing. Panniculectomy is typically performed in association with the planned abdominal operation typically by a plastic surgeon, and on occasion by a general surgeon well versed with the procedure. The details of the technique are beyond the scope of this topic.

          Radiation

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Radiation effects can be divided into acute and chronic reactions. The acute reaction consists of rapid cessation of mitotic activity, followed by cellular swelling. Edema develops in the walls of small vessels, and connective tissue becomes edematous and congested because of dilated and engorged lymphatic channels and small vessels. Radiation inhibits differentiation of fibroblast from mesenchymal cells and proliferation of endothelial cells into vascular buds. If the injury is lethal, cellular dissolution and focal necrosis may be seen.
        </p>
        <p>
         Chronic radiation injury is caused by progressive vascular injury, a small vessel endarteritis. Endothelial swelling and proliferation narrows the vessel lumen, which restricts blood flow and may cause thrombosis. Similar effects occur in lymphatic channels. The supply of oxygen and nutrients is reduced to critical concentrations. The humoral and cellular immune defense systems function inefficiently. Proliferation of fibrous tissue causes the skin of the abdominal wall to lose suppleness, harden, and become atrophic, manifested as a shiny appearance with loss of the skin appendages. The skin becomes pigmented, and telangiectasias develop [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. These changes, more common with orthovoltage radiation techniques than newer linear accelerators, are progressive over several years and never heal or resolve.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients undergoing radiation therapy have a window of vulnerability to toxic effects. If 2.5 Gy is administered 24 hours before surgery, there is little impact on wound repair. However, the same dose administered 36 hours after surgery will maximally retard neovascularization and normal tissue contraction.
        </p>
        <p>
         Radiation effects are more harmful to an open wound than a closed wound; this effect diminishes five to seven days after the incision is made. A wound that has completely epithelialized and has no fluid or blood collection can be irradiated one week postoperatively without negative effects. Radiation has minimal effects on a mature wound; however, radiotherapy of an infected wound will result in formation of a chronic radiation ulcer. If bowel adhesions limit peristalsis, significant bowel injury may occur.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cancer has little direct effect on wound healing or fascial disruption, but associated poor nutrition resulting from limited intake or cancer-related compromised bowel function may slow the healing process. In addition, incisions placed in a previous irradiation field may heal poorly due to radiation-induced endarteritis. Cancer patients are more likely to have wound contamination from an opened viscus or intra-abdominal abscess, and postoperative ileus or collection of ascites may stress the fresh wound.

         Incision placement and timing may be modified to reduce the risk of wound complications. If possible, incisions should be placed outside the intended radiation field. Alternatively, surgery performed four to six weeks after radiotherapy will display relatively normal healing because postoperative inflammation is subsiding and blood supply is still adequate. Over time, the impact of diminished microcirculation from radiation presents an obstacle to wound healing, and the risk of surgery rises logarithmically as the dose of irradiation increases.
        </p>
        <p>
         Irradiated tissue may not have sufficient blood supply to withstand multiple incisions without necrosis. Therefore, skin incisions must never be crossed or made parallel in a field of irradiated tissue because of significantly increased risk of skin necrosis, poor healing, and infection. Pain in irradiated wounds may be from ischemia. Because of susceptibility to any type of injury, any insult may trigger a cycle of necrosis and infection.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients who have undergone preoperative radiation also have delayed healing, reduced tensile strength, and increased risk of infection. The increased risk of dehiscence warrants a closure technique utilizing permanent suture materials, which have been shown to reduce wound complications [
         <a href="#rid47">

         – Risk factors for surgical site infection include smoking, diabetes, malnutrition, cancer, obesity, immunosuppression, cardiovascular disease, prior incision, and irradiation at the surgical site. Meticulous surgical technique that avoids excessive tissue injury and ischemia while providing adequate hemostasis is important for preventing infection. (See

          Treatment
         </strong>
         – Infected wounds are opened, explored, drained, irrigated, debrided, and dressed open. If fascial disruption is suspected, drainage should be performed in the operating room. The severity of the infection determines the need for antibiotic therapy. Once the infection has cleared and granulation tissue is apparent, the wound can be closed secondarily or allowed to heal by secondary intention. (See

          Prevention
         </strong>
         – Surgeons can modify rates of wound infection with preventive measures that include avoiding surgery in patients with active infection, antibiotic prophylaxis, proper skin preparation, and maintenance of sterile conditions intraoperatively. Proper surgical technique with gentle tissue handling and a secure closure that does not cause tissue ischemia are equally important. (See

          Fascial dehiscence
         </strong>
         – Fascial disruption is due to abdominal wall tension overcoming tissue or suture strength or knot security. It can occur early or late in the postoperative period. With early fascial dehiscence, the skin closure may be intact depending upon the method of closure (ie, staples, sutures). The patient is at risk for evisceration, and early postoperative fascial dehiscence is a surgical emergency. The late complication of fascial disruption is incisional hernia, which can lead to bowel obstruction, ischemia, and even death. (See

         – Irradiated skin is also associated with an increased incidence of wound breakdown. Where possible, incisions should be placed outside the field of future or past radiation.
