It encompasses four guiding principles:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Autonomy </strong>– Literally, "self-rule," with the ability to make decisions for oneself free from controlling interference or limitation of inadequate understanding. In medicine, respecting autonomy means ensuring a patient's right to be informed and participate in medical decision-making, generally including the right to refuse a medical intervention for one's self.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Parental/caregiver authority</strong> – The right of parents and/or legal caregivers to serve as surrogate decision-makers for their infant who cannot make decisions on their own. With this right comes the obligation to act in the child's interests and the limitation that this authority can be overridden should a decision result in direct, unnecessary harm to the child. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Beneficence</strong> – Beneficence is defined as the clinician's obligation to weigh the benefit and burdens of medical treatment and provide care that will be in the best interests of their patient.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Non-maleficence</strong> – Non-maleficence is defined as the clinician's obligation to minimize unnecessary harms or unwanted complications that result from medical treatment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Justice</strong> – Justice requires that individuals be treated equally unless there is a morally relevant reason not to do so. In medicine, this translates to patients of similar prognoses being treated equally and health resources being used equitably. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1183940392"><span class="h1">ETHICAL FRAMEWORK</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Due to the high risk and clinical uncertainty regarding survival and long-term complications associated with periviable birth, management must take into consideration both clinically and ethically impactful factors. Thus, it is imperative that clinicians have a sound understanding of the ethical concepts related to periviability, and how they apply to the clinical scenarios. In this section, an ethical framework for approaching this decision-making is presented.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3819975500"><span class="h2">Key ethical questions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ethical questions that the clinician must consider in the care of the periviable neonate include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>What interventions should be performed?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Should resuscitation and intensive care measures (eg, intubation, chest compressions, administration of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13272" href="/d/drug information/13272.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a>, mechanical ventilation) be initiated in the delivery room?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Are these interventions ethically impermissible, optional, or obligatory?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Once intensive care measures (eg, intubation and mechanical ventilation) have been started, is it permissible to stop?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>What informs decision-making?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Should these decisions be based upon what is known about outcomes of periviable birth?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>To what degree should parental preference factor into these decisions?</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4165860718"><span class="h2">Rights and obligations of key stakeholders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The rights and obligations that we consider relevant to answering these questions include, but may not be limited to, the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The <strong>infant</strong> has a right to treatment, when feasible, that has a reasonable chance of saving their life. The infant also has a right to mercy, meaning a right not to be subjected to painful procedures that are extremely unlikely to benefit them (ie, improve survival and/or decrease morbidity) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The <strong>parents/caregivers</strong> have a right to information they need to make informed decisions on their child's behalf. They have a right to decide what is done to their child, but that may, in rare situations, be overridden by the child's rights (eg, if they refuse a treatment that would clearly and significantly benefit the infant or demand one that would be harmful to their child).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinicians</strong> have an obligation to present parents/caregivers with the relevant information, such as morbidity and mortality data (as well as the limitations of those data), and to help them with the profoundly difficult decisions for the care of infants in this age group. An honest presentation of the relevant information and the available options (including, if feasible, transfer to another institution with a different institutional policy) is paramount. The clinical team should recognize the enormous stress that decision-making in this setting causes parents/caregivers and work closely with them to reach management decisions together, based primarily on an assessment of the perceived benefits and burdens to the infant of treatments under consideration. In rare circumstances, the clinical team may determine that caregivers' preferences are clearly opposed to the child's interests, in which case those decisions may need to be overridden, by use of proper procedural channels as time allows.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For those infants that receive active resuscitation, as the neonate's clinical status changes over the course of hospitalization (and thus the prognosis changes), the clinical team should share that information with the parent/caregivers and revisit management decisions regarding life-sustaining treatments. For example, in some cases the initial decision to resuscitate and initiate intensive case measures may be reversed if the clinical course of the infant reveals that ongoing intervention is not beneficial and may be harmful to the patient [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2724389800"><span class="h2">Ensuring just care based on prognosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The principle of justice requires that the same treatment approach be offered to patients with similar prognoses. For management of periviable infants, this means ensuring a consistent (just) approach to care for all infants with similar estimated outcomes, tempered in many cases by parental preferences.</p><p>Based on consideration of the above ethical questions, rights, and obligations, providers need to determine if resuscitation is ethically obligatory, meaning the anticipated benefits clearly outweigh the risk of harm to the infant. If it is not obligatory, then providers must determine if attempting resuscitation is permissible, meaning the benefits might outweigh burdens, or impermissible if burdens clearly outweigh benefits.</p><p>Periviable infants can be assigned to one of these three ethical categories based on prognosis, which can guide initiation of resuscitative and intensive care interventions, ensuring consistent (just) care for all infants with similar estimated outcomes:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Poor prognosis</strong> – If the prognosis is very poor, the neonate should not be made to undergo any resuscitative and intensive care measures since the likelihood of benefit is disproportionally small when measured against the likelihood of harm. In this case, these procedures would be ethically <strong>impermissible</strong> and supportive comfort measures alone are provided.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Favorable prognosis</strong> – If the prognosis is favorable, feasible resuscitative and intensive care measures should be provided and are ethically <strong>obligatory</strong>.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Unclear prognosis</strong> – If the prognosis is worrisome or unclear, but survival is possible, it can be difficult to determine the relative benefit and burden of initiating resuscitative and intensive care measures for the infant. In this setting, clinicians should generally defer to the values and preferences of informed parents/caregivers. Attempted resuscitation in this setting is <strong>ethically permissible, but not obligatory</strong>.</p><p></p><p>Defining the boundaries of these three categories is challenging, but establishing institutional policies around them is a key method to ensuring just care. Review of local and published outcome data, as well as societal and national guidelines, is helpful when developing a consensus institutional approach to define these management categories. (See <a class="local">'Establishing institutional policy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Outcomes'</a> below and <a class="local">'Society guideline links'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1630670072"><span class="h1">OUTCOMES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In this section, we present key clinical outcome data and prediction tools used to inform decision-making. Based on analyses of the outcome data, prediction tools for survival, including the risk of profound disability, have been developed. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4157079489"><span class="h2">Survival</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The likelihood of survival is the most important outcome to consider in decision-making for periviable infants. However, the reporting of this outcome varies somewhat in the available published studies, with some reporting only short-term survival (to hospital discharge) while others report long-term survival (24 months corrected age [CA] or longer). In addition, some studies select survival without profound neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) as the primary outcome, which is typically assessed at 18 to 24 months CA. </p><p>Factors that impact survival, some of which are used in prediction tools, include the following [<a href="#rid3">3-7</a>] (see <a class="local">'Prediction tools'</a> below):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gestational age</strong> – Gestational age (GA) is the most commonly cited predictor of survival. Published survival rates based on GA (22 to &lt;26 weeks) during the initial neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission for infants are summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75260" href="/d/graphic/75260.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid8">8-22</a>]. Data are presented in the table that date back over two decades. However, it should be noted that a significant increase in predicted survival at 22 and 23 weeks gestation has been reported in recent years. These data span broad geographic areas (including Western Europe, Japan, the United States, and Canada), with a range of follow-up from six months to six years. Key observations from these data include: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Survival rates rise steadily as GA increases from 22 to 25 weeks.</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Survival for all GAs has increased over time.</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>There is variability in outcomes between studies, which may reflect differences in care (active versus comfort care).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Birth weight</strong> – A 2008 report from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network of 4446 infants born between 1998 and 2003 with birth weights (BWs) &gt;400 g and GA 22 and 25 weeks demonstrated that each 100 g increase in birth weight reduced the risk of death or neurodevelopmental disability for infants similar to the risk reduction from a one-week increase in GA [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In a 2019 report from the NICHD Neonatal Research Network of 205 infants born between 2008 and 2015 with a BW &lt;400 g and GA between 22 and 26 weeks, 26 percent of actively treated infants survived to discharge, although NDI was common [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Approach to initial management </strong>– Approach to initial management, specifically whether or not periviable neonates are actively resuscitated at birth, has been shown to influence overall survival rates. When accounting for variation in initial management among centers, studies report improved survival for those centers that generally provide more active resuscitative efforts compared with those that provide comfort measures only. This is supported by the following studies [<a href="#rid24">24-29</a>]: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A retrospective study from the Netherlands reported that implementation of guidelines supporting active initial care of infants born at 24 weeks GA resulted in an increase in NICU admission rates and postnatal survival [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Data from the NICHD Neonatal Research Network of infants (GA &lt;27 weeks) born between 2006 and 2011 showed that between hospital variation in survival among infants born at 22 to 24 weeks GA appeared to be due in part to whether active treatment was initiated [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Most centers provided active intervention for infants born between 25 and 26 weeks GA. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The highest published survival rates, 78 percent for infants born 22 to 23 weeks GA and 89 percent for those born at 24 to 25 weeks GA, come from a center that actively resuscitates all infants born ≥22 weeks [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Of note, this study excluded infants who died in the delivery room. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Having routine active initial management may provide better outcomes than trying to select certain infants prior to birth for active resuscitation. In other words, one reason for improved survival in centers that provide more active resuscitative efforts is that those who more often attempt resuscitation at the lowest gestational ages may develop greater proficiency. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">This is supported by a retrospective cohort study of 112 infants born at 22 weeks GA in two hospitals with different approaches to initial management of periviable neonates. Infants treated at a hospital with proactive management of all 22 week GA infants had in-hospital survival rates higher than those at an institution with selective resuscitation based on physician and parental preference (53 versus 8 percent, respectively) [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Among the subgroup of infants receiving proactive care, including antenatal steroids and neonatal resuscitation, survival was also higher in the center that routinely provided proactive care (53 versus 19 percent, respectively). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A trend for increased active treatment was reported in a study from a large United States database of neonates born at 22 weeks to &lt;26 weeks, which found that the frequency of active treatment for periviable neonates increased from 45.7 percent in 2014 to 58.8 percent in 2020 [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Antenatal corticosteroid therapy</strong> – The increased survival associated with antenatal corticosteroid therapy for periviable infants is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6796.html" rel="external">"Antenatal corticosteroid therapy for reduction of neonatal respiratory morbidity and mortality from preterm delivery", section on 'Less than 37 weeks'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sex </strong>– Male preterm infants have a higher mortality rate than female preterm infants [<a href="#rid32">32,33</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1688558257"><span class="h2">Neurodevelopmental outcome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) is a major long-term complication of periviable birth. NDI includes impaired cognition, motor and neurosensory deficits, and behavioral and psychological problems. The prevalence of these impairments from cohorts of survivors following birth at 22 to &lt;26 weeks gestation is displayed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63848" href="/d/graphic/63848.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4,14-16,22,34-36</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p>Several factors impact neurodevelopmental outcome, some of which also affect survival and are used in prediction tools for periviable outcome. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gestational age </strong>– The likelihood of surviving without long-term major NDI increases with increasing GA.

In addition, other variables include the timing of survival assessment (after delivery, at discharge from the neonatal intensive care, or later), as well as the timing of the assessment of neurodevelopmental outcome as noted below.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Uncertainty in GA estimates</strong> – Clinicians should recognize that there is often a margin of error in estimating GA. Thus, when using GA to predict the likelihood of survival for a periviable infant, the assigned GA should usually be considered a range rather than an exact number. The exception to this could be a pregnancy resulting from in vitro fertilization, wherein dating can be assumed to be accurate.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Typically, the GA of the fetus is determined by date of the last menstrual period (LMP) and/or ultrasound. For the latter, the timing of the ultrasound affects the accuracy (eg, the estimated GA may be off by five to seven days when the ultrasound is performed before 14 weeks gestation and as many as 14 days when performed beyond 22 weeks) [<a href="#rid44">44,45</a>]. Thus, depending on the date of the initial ultrasound assessment, an imminent delivery believed to be at 23 weeks could be under 22 weeks, with virtually no chance of survival, or more than 24 weeks, with a greater than even likelihood of survival if resuscitation and intensive care measures are initiated. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has stated that a pregnancy should be considered suboptimally dated if the estimated time of delivery is not confirmed or revised by ultrasound before 22 weeks. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5391.html" rel="external">"Prenatal assessment of gestational age, date of delivery, and fetal weight", section on 'Best estimate of delivery date'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5391.html" rel="external">"Prenatal assessment of gestational age, date of delivery, and fetal weight", section on 'Suboptimally dated pregnancies'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Postnatal assessments of GA are also prone to error because fetal development of external features is variable. Most postnatal assessment tools are only accurate to within one to two weeks gestation. Thus, it is not possible to accurately differentiate a neonate at 23 weeks from another at 22 or 24 weeks based on physical examination in the delivery room. The best obstetrical estimate should be used when counseling parents or making decisions unless there is a profound discrepancy between physical appearance and the obstetrical estimate of GA.

There is good but limited evidence that neurodevelopmental outcome is more accurately assessed at school age since there is potential for cognitive recovery as the brain continues to develop. Thus, predictions for a given newborn based on reported assessments of similar children at 18 to 26 months may overestimate the true likelihood of moderate or severe disability in the long-term. However, infants who are assessed as having severe NDI at 18 to 26 months CA are likely to continue to have significant NDI at an older age. In addition, assessment in infancy and early childhood identifies infants who may benefit from early intervention. Thus, though reported outcome measures of severe NDI at 18 and 26 months CA may overestimate the likelihood of severe impairment later in childhood, they remain clinically relevant when discussing management options with parents and caregivers. Moreover, assessment of NDI at 18 to 26 months may underestimate some long-term morbidities such as ADHD, autism, and learning difficulties.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The impact of age on assessment of neurodevelopmental outcome in EPT infants, including supportive evidence is discussed in greater detail separately.
