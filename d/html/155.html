Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease) results from disorders of the adrenal cortex, whereas secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency are due to dysfunction of the pituitary gland and the hypothalamus, respectively. Adrenal insufficiency leads to diffuse symptoms, may become life-threatening (adrenal crisis), and requires glucocorticoid replacement therapy. Primary adrenal insufficiency leads to both glucocorticoid (cortisol) and mineralocorticoid (principally aldosterone) deficiency. In contrast, central (ie, secondary or tertiary) adrenal insufficiency causes glucocorticoid, but not mineralocorticoid, deficiency because aldosterone is regulated primarily by the renin-angiotensin system, which is independent of the hypothalamus and pituitary. This distinction accounts for the different clinical presentation and management of these disorders.</p><p>The management of both acute and chronic adrenal insufficiency is reviewed here. The causes, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in adults are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/166.html" rel="external">"Causes of primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/159.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/157.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in adults"</a>.)</p><p>The management of adrenal insufficiency in children and in adults with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia is also reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5825.html" rel="external">"Treatment of adrenal insufficiency in children", section on 'Adrenal hormone replacement therapy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/136.html" rel="external">"Treatment of classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency in adults", section on 'Continued adrenal hormone therapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">ADRENAL CRISIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Adrenal crisis is a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate treatment with parenteral glucocorticoids and isotonic fluid administration  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67329" data-inline-graphics="67329" href="/z/d/graphic/67329.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Adrenal crisis denotes an episode of acute adrenal insufficiency and should be considered in any patient with shock. In addition to hypotension, patients commonly present with nonspecific signs and symptoms including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fever, fatigue, weakness, and confusion or loss of consciousness. If adrenal crisis is suspected, treatment should be initiated immediately. Adrenal crisis occurs in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency and central adrenal insufficiency, but it is very uncommon in patients with adrenal insufficiency due to prolonged administration of exogenous glucocorticoids. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/159.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency in adults", section on 'Adrenal crisis'</a>.)</p><p>Clinical data evaluating the management of adrenal crisis are limited. Our approach is consistent with society guideline recommendations [<a href="#rid1">1</a>] and based on the pathophysiology of adrenal crisis, the pharmacology of available treatment options, and clinical experience.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3514936551"><span class="h2">Emergency management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Adrenal crisis requires urgent diagnosis and intervention  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67329" href="/z/d/graphic/67329.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Treatment of patients who present in possible adrenal crisis should never be delayed to perform diagnostic tests. For all patients, initial treatment includes establishing intravenous (IV) access, isotonic fluid infusion, and parenteral glucocorticoid therapy. Laboratory tests (including serum electrolyte and glucose levels) should be sent. For patients without an established diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, additional hormone measurements (cortisol, corticotropin [ACTH], aldosterone, renin) should be obtained to facilitate the diagnosis; however, these measurements do not alter emergency management and should never delay treatment initiation. The precipitating cause of adrenal crisis (eg, bacterial infection, viral gastroenteritis, trauma) should be determined and treated appropriately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/159.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency in adults", section on 'Precipitating factors'</a>.)</p><p>The detailed steps of initial emergency management include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fluid resuscitation</strong> – After IV access is established with a large-gauge needle, we administer at least 1 liter of 0.9 percent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> or 5 percent dextrose in 0.9 percent saline within one hour. This fluid bolus may need to be repeated, as patients with adrenal crisis usually require at least 2 to 3 liters of isotonic fluids within the first 12 to 24 hours. Once the patient is volume resuscitated, maintenance fluids are administered as for the general medical population, which is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2296.html" rel="external">"Maintenance and replacement fluid therapy in adults", section on 'Maintenance fluid therapy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">We avoid hypotonic <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> because it can worsen hyponatremia. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="108196" href="/z/d/drug information/108196.html" rel="external">Lactated Ringer</a> solution also theoretically may worsen hyponatremia, although clinical data are limited.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial laboratory tests</strong> – Although initial laboratory tests are sent at the time of first clinical suspicion for adrenal crisis, presumptive management should not be delayed pending results.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>All patients in adrenal crisis</strong> – In all patients in known or suspected adrenal crisis, we measure serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), electrolyte, and glucose levels to evaluate for hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2314.html" rel="external">"Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia in adrenal insufficiency"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/159.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency in adults", section on 'Laboratory findings'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Additional testing for patients without a prior diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency</strong> – Prior to initiation of glucocorticoid therapy, additional laboratory tests should be sent for patients without an established diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. For all patients without a prior diagnosis, we send a serum cortisol level to verify cortisol deficiency. When clinical suspicion is high for adrenal insufficiency, we also measure plasma levels of ACTH, aldosterone, and renin to initiate the etiologic evaluation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/154.html" rel="external">"Determining the etiology of adrenal insufficiency in adults", section on 'Establish the level of defect'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Glucocorticoid therapy</strong> – For patients who present in known or suspected adrenal crisis, we recommend immediate administration of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8535" href="/z/d/drug information/8535.html" rel="external">hydrocortisone</a> (100 mg IV bolus), followed by 50 mg IV every six hours (or 200 mg/24 hours as a continuous IV infusion) for the first 24 hours [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. We then reduce the hydrocortisone dose to 50 mg IV every 12 hours. Continued taper is guided by the patient's clinical status. (See <a class="local">'Subsequent management'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">We prefer <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8535" href="/z/d/drug information/8535.html" rel="external">hydrocortisone</a> because it has both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid activity; this is particularly important in patients with known primary adrenal insufficiency or those with serum potassium &gt;6.0 mEq/L and/or clear evidence of volume depletion, which may indicate mineralocorticoid deficiency. If hydrocortisone is unavailable, alternatives include <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9639" href="/z/d/drug information/9639.html" rel="external">methylprednisolone</a> 40 mg IV or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a> 4 to 6 mg IV  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67329" href="/z/d/graphic/67329.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mineralocorticoid therapy for patients with known or suspected primary adrenal insufficiency</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Concurrent </strong><strong>hydrocortisone</strong><strong> treatment</strong> – In patients with known or suspected primary adrenal insufficiency (eg, based on the presence of hyperkalemia, skin hyperpigmentation, or overt volume depletion), <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8455" href="/z/d/drug information/8455.html" rel="external">fludrocortisone</a> is unnecessary during high-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8535" href="/z/d/drug information/8535.html" rel="external">hydrocortisone</a> therapy with isotonic fluid administration. At doses ≥40 mg daily, hydrocortisone has sufficient mineralocorticoid activity to serve as replacement therapy. In such patients, fludrocortisone should be resumed or initiated during hydrocortisone taper when oral intake is possible. (See <a class="local">'Patients with known adrenal insufficiency'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Concurrent treatment with </strong><strong>methylprednisolone</strong><strong> or </strong><strong>dexamethasone</strong> – In patients with known or suspected primary adrenal insufficiency, we add oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8455" href="/z/d/drug information/8455.html" rel="external">fludrocortisone</a> 0.2 mg daily during <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9639" href="/z/d/drug information/9639.html" rel="external">methylprednisolone</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a> therapy.

Therefore, patients with primary adrenal insufficiency usually require mineralocorticoid replacement. (See <a class="local">'Patients with known adrenal insufficiency'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Electrolyte management</strong> – Hyponatremia and hypoglycemia can evolve consequent to cortisol deficiency, whereas the presence of hyperkalemia indicates mineralocorticoid as well as glucocorticoid deficiency.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Hyponatremia</strong> – If hyponatremia is present and the patient is known to have central adrenal insufficiency, free thyroxine (T4) should be measured to exclude concurrent central hypothyroidism.

Parenteral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8535" href="/z/d/drug information/8535.html" rel="external">hydrocortisone</a> therapy and isotonic fluid administration correct hyponatremia due to adrenal insufficiency. If hyponatremia persists despite these interventions, it is not due to adrenal insufficiency, and additional evaluation is needed to determine the cause.

If present, hyperkalemia should correct within a few hours of hydrocortisone initiation. If hyperkalemia persists, additional intervention and evaluation for alternative causes are needed.

Additional dextrose should be administered acutely if hypoglycemia is severe enough to cause neuroglycopenia (ie, glucose &lt;55 mg/dL [&lt;3 mmol/L]). The glucose-raising effect of supraphysiologic glucocorticoid treatment is potent, and correction of hypoglycemia is not sufficient to confirm adrenal insufficiency as the underlying cause. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1805.html" rel="external">"Hypoglycemia in adults with diabetes mellitus", section on 'Reversing hypoglycemia'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1763.html" rel="external">"Hypoglycemia in adults without diabetes mellitus: Clinical manifestations, causes, and diagnosis", section on 'Causes of hypoglycemia'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H705524920"><span class="h2">Expected treatment response</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If hypotension is caused by adrenal crisis, it should improve rapidly (within a few hours) with parenteral glucocorticoid therapy and isotonic fluid administration.

Hydrocortisone is short-acting, does not require enzymatic activation, and is metabolized by the placenta. It therefore provides the most predictable dosing with lowest risk of glucocorticoid overexposure for the developing fetus.
