         Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents 15 percent of all lung cancers and occurs almost exclusively in smokers. It is distinguished from non-small cell lung cancer by its rapid doubling time, high growth fraction, and the early development of widespread metastases. Although considered highly responsive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, SCLC usually recurs within 14 to 15 months for patients with limited-stage SCLC and five to six months for patients with extensive-stage SCLC. Many of these patients are candidates for additional systemic treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         The median survival of patients with relapsed SCLC ranges from two to six months. The most important factors affecting prognosis are performance status, tumor extent (ie, limited versus extensive), and time to relapse after first-line therapy [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. For refractory disease (no initial response) or resistant relapse (disease-free interval less than three months from the last day of initial treatment), most agents or regimens demonstrate low response rates (&lt;10 percent). However, for sensitive relapse (time to relapse greater than three months from the last day of initial treatment), the response rate is approximately 25 percent [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Similarly, the likelihood of an objective response to second-line therapy depends upon the time from last therapy to relapse, the response to initial treatment, and the performance status.
        </p>
        <p>
         The treatment of relapsed and refractory SCLC will be reviewed here. The initial management of SCLC and experimental approaches to treatment are considered separately. (See

         The length of response to initial treatment influences the likelihood of response to subsequent treatment. If the disease free-interval was less than three months from the last day of initial treatment (

          sensitive relapse
         </strong>

Among patients with resistant relapse (chemotherapy-free interval &lt;90 days), the ORR was 22 percent with a progression-free survival (PFS) of 2.6 months and an overall survival (OS) of 5 months. For patients with sensitive relapse, the ORR was 45 percent with a PFS of 4.5 months and an OS of 11.9 months [

For topotecan versus CAV, the ORRs were 24 versus 18 percent, the median time to progression was 13 versus 12 weeks, and the median survival was 25 versus 24.7 weeks, differences that were not statistically significant. Control of several symptoms including dyspnea, anorexia, hoarseness, and fatigue was improved with topotecan. Severe neutropenia was less common with topotecan (38 versus 51 percent), but grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and anemia occurred more frequently (9.8 versus 1.4 percent and 17.7 versus 7.2 percent, respectively). The improvement in symptom control led to its FDA approval.

         For patients with late relapses (at least six months after completion of chemotherapy), who are on maintenance immunotherapy, there are no data regarding reintroduction of chemotherapy. However, we use this approach, given that chemotherapy is the backbone of all treatment for SCLC and has demonstrated benefit in patients receiving a platinum doublet  (

        </p>
        <p>
         For patients who did not receive immunotherapy, we offer reinduction with the original platinum-based combination, with the addition of immunotherapy, based on the benefit of added immunotherapy in the first-line setting (provided that the patient maintains a good performance status ). Treatment regimens for newly diagnosed SCLC are discussed elsewhere. (See

         Support for reinduction with the original platinum regimen comes from a retrospective analysis of 81 patients who received second-line chemotherapy for SCLC that was relapsed after 90 days (sensitive relapse) [

The median treatment-free interval prior to second-line treatment was 182 days in the rechallenge group and 197 days in the small non-rechallenge group. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.1 months in the rechallenge group and 3.4 months in the group that was not rechallenged with platinum-based chemotherapy, and median survival was 10.7 and 8.2 months, respectively. However, these differences were not statistically significant.

Although there was no statistically significant difference in PFS or OS between patients with treatment-free intervals between 90 and 150 versus ≥150 days, the number of patients with treatment-free intervals less than 150 days was very small (n = 21).

Symptom control and improved quality of life are the primary goals of treatment, and these must be clear to both patients and their families.

         Both the primary tumor and systemic metastases in patients with SCLC are generally chemosensitive, at least initially. A number of individual agents and combinations are highly active in this disease. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4633.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         The reported responses of brain metastases to systemic chemotherapy in previously untreated patients are discussed elsewhere. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Response rates in previously treated patients with brain metastases range between 22 and 50 percent and are comparable to the response rates with second-line chemotherapy observed in extracranial disease [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36-41
         </a>
         ]. As many patients with SCLC have received prior whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT), either therapeutically or in the form of prophylactic cranial irradiation, further radiation options at the time of brain relapse may be limited. Systemic therapies that may be considered in the setting of recurrent brain metastases from SCLC based on case series and phase II studies include:

         Adding WBRT to chemotherapy may increase the response rate of the brain metastases, but does not appear to improve survival and has not been widely adopted.

Most of the patients in this trial had received prior chemotherapy (73 percent). Of note, teniposide has limited commercial availability.

          Introduction
         </strong>
         – Although considered highly responsive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) usually recurs within 14 to 15 months for patients with limited-stage SCLC and 5 to 6 months for patients with extensive-stage SCLC. Many of these patients are candidates for additional systemic treatment  (

          Patients with relapse within six months of treatment

         – For patients with extensive SCLC who experience progression on or within six months of initial chemotherapy, we suggest treatment with

          Patients with relapse more than six months from treatment

          Later line options
         </strong>
         – Upon second progression, subsequent lines of therapy are generally less effective than the initial treatment, but can provide significant palliation for many patients. Symptom control and improved quality of life are the primary goals of treatment. For patients who remain candidates for further treatment, we offer single-agent chemotherapy rather than combination chemotherapy or immunotherapy. (See
