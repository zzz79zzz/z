         Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a rare, potentially life-threatening reaction to heparin in which a patient develops antibodies to a heparin-platelet factor 4 complex that induce platelet activation, thrombocytopenia, and a greatly increased risk for venous and arterial thrombosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis and management of HIT can be challenging, especially in patients who require systemic anticoagulation for cardiac or vascular surgery. Such patients often have thrombocytopenia due to other causes, may have clinically insignificant antibodies detectable on a HIT immunoassay, or may be in the midst of an evolving immune response. If urgent/emergency surgical intervention is necessary, full evaluation of the presence of HIT may not be possible in the preoperative period. Intraoperative management of HIT is also challenging in such patients, particularly if complete avoidance of exposure to heparin is not feasible. Available evidence to guide management in this setting is very limited.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic presents an approach to the perioperative management of individuals with suspected HIT, a previous diagnosis of HIT, or known active HIT who require elective or emergency surgery that typically includes heparin administration (eg, vascular surgery, cardiac surgery with or without cardiopulmonary bypass [CPB]).

         HIT is an adverse drug reaction that can occur following exposure to heparin of any type (any
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8518" href="/z/d/drug information/8518.html" rel="external">
          unfractionated heparin
         </a>
         [UFH] or low molecular weight [LMW] heparin), independent of the dose, administration route, or duration of exposure. Risk factors for HIT include surgery, female sex, and older age, as well as administration of UFH rather than LMW heparin and therapeutic rather than prophylactic heparin dosing. However, there is no dose of heparin that is too low to cause HIT, including heparin flushes or heparin-bonded catheters.
        </p>
        <p>
         Many of the risk factors for HIT (surgery, use of UFH, use of higher heparin doses) are present in cardiac and vascular surgical patients. As a result, the prevalence of HIT is as high as 1 to 3 percent in these patients, which is higher than most other populations. The following studies illustrate the range of findings:

         In a series of over 10,000 patients who underwent cardiac surgery with or without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), 153 (1.5 percent) were tested for HIT antibodies due to clinical suspicion based on platelet counts that had decreased by more than 50 percent or were below 50,000/microL [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. HIT was diagnosed with a positive functional assay (heparin-induced platelet activation [HIPA]) in 21 of these patients (14 percent of those with suspected HIT; 0.2 percent of the entire cohort). Postoperative thromboembolic complications occurred in 10 patients with a positive HIPA result (48 percent), compared with 2 of the 132 individuals with a negative test (1.5 percent).

         In a series of 329 patients who required more than seven days in the intensive care unit (ICU) following cardiac surgery with CPB, 70 developed thrombocytopenia (21 percent) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2

         ]. Testing for HIT was performed in approximately half of the patients, revealing only six positive results based on a functional assay (8.6 percent of those with thrombocytopenia; only 1.8 percent of the entire group). Among 2242 patients with shorter ICU stays who were also analyzed in this study, only three developed symptomatic HIT (0.1 percent).

         The mechanism of HIT involves formation of an immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibody directed against endogenous platelet factor 4 (PF4) in a complex with heparin. There is no IgM phase [

          4
         </a>
         ]. These antibodies are referred to as "HIT antibodies" or "anti-PF4/heparin antibodies" or simply "PF4/heparin antibodies" [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-7
         </a>
         ]. They coat and activate platelets, leading to thrombocytopenia and thrombosis:

         <strong>
          Thrombocytopenia
         </strong>
         – Thrombocytopenia occurs due to removal of IgG-coated platelets by macrophages in the liver or spleen, similar to other drug-induced thrombocytopenias. Typically, the platelet count decreases to &lt;50 percent of the patient's baseline within 5 to 10 days of initiating heparin, consistent with the time for IgG autoantibody production. A rapid drop in the platelet count can occur within one day of heparin exposure in an individual who received heparin in the previous one to three months and developed anti-PF4/heparin antibodies [

         <strong>
          Thrombosis
         </strong>
         – The mechanism of thrombosis is incompletely understood and is thought to include a number of procoagulant effects. Thromboembolic events may be venous or arterial. Thrombosis occurs in as many as 50 percent of patients who receive no treatment; these data are discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90261.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>

         Additional details regarding the clinical presentation and pathophysiology of HIT as well as studies from which the above prevalences are derived are presented separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90261.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In rare cases, HIT-type antibodies may develop in the absence of heparin exposure (or may persist for a prolonged period following heparin discontinuation). These antibodies can cause platelet activation, thrombocytopenia, and thrombosis (so-called "autoimmune HIT" or "refractory HIT"). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90261.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia", section on 'Terminology and HIT variants'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In contrast to HIT, some individuals develop thrombocytopenia within one to two days after heparin administration that is mild, transient, and not associated with platelet activation or thrombosis (sometimes termed "HIT type I"). In the absence of clinical information, distinguishing this entity from clinically significant HIT (ie, "HIT type II") is initially challenging, but diagnosis is usually straightforward once it becomes clear that thrombocytopenia is not severe or persistent or a negative immunoassay result is confirmed. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90261.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia", section on 'Terminology and HIT variants'

         Not all antibodies to PF4/heparin cause HIT. In some cases, antibodies with this specificity may be detected through routine screening programs (which are not recommended) or when testing is sent in an individual with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis caused by conditions other than HIT. Diagnosis of HIT requires a clinical syndrome of thrombocytopenia (or marked decrease in platelet count that remains within the normal range) together with anti-PF4/heparin antibodies that are capable of causing platelet activation. IgG-specific immunoassays are becoming more widely available, and many "false positives" can be attributed to nonspecific IgM antibodies seen with a polyclonal assay but absent on an IgG-specific assay [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         There are many immunoassay platforms available, both polyclonal (IgG, IgM, and IgA) and IgG-specific, complicating recommendations based on optical densities (ODs). Also, cutoffs for determining that an assay result is positive or negative differ among different immunoassay platforms. The definitions of low, intermediate, and high OD results should be determined and published by each local laboratory and are often accompanied by a measured heparin specificity or a heparin confirmatory step. Heparin specificity and a higher OD increase the likelihood of a positive functional assay, but evaluation is complex and expert opinion is helpful [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ].

         Our approach to evaluating clinically significant HIT and the importance of presumptive treatment while awaiting testing are outlined below. (See

         Management of HIT in individuals undergoing cardiac or vascular surgery can be challenging because avoidance of heparin is a key principle of HIT management, yet use of heparin is a key component of surgical procedures requiring intraoperative anticoagulation due to its favorable properties (eg, parenteral administration, easy monitoring, rapid reversibility with protamine) and extensive clinical experience with its use. Management goals in patients with HIT are to reduce the likelihood of potentially life-threatening thromboembolic complications related to platelet factor 4 (PF4)/heparin antibodies, while at the same time enabling performance of the surgical procedure as safely as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with active HIT, heparin should be scrupulously avoided (by delaying surgery altogether or by using an alternate anticoagulant) because heparin administration in the presence of these antibodies is likely to activate platelets and greatly increase thrombosis risk. If possible, heparin should also be avoided for patients who had HIT in the past due to the risk of creating an anamnestic response that causes HIT to recur. Thus, it is important to establish whether the original diagnosis of HIT was accurate and to determine whether PF4/heparin antibodies are present. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Confirm the diagnosis and determine PF4/heparin antibody status'

         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         If administration of heparin is absolutely necessary, its effects should be minimized, as illustrated in the algorithm (

         If HIT antibodies are present, an intervention to reduce the antibody effect should be used, such as intravenous

         If HIT antibodies are absent, the duration of heparin exposure should be limited to the day of surgery only; subsequent anticoagulation can be achieved with a non-heparin agent. (See
         <a class="local">
          'HIT antibodies absent'

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Anticoagulation with a non-heparin agent can be given despite thrombocytopenia because the platelet count is expected to increase rapidly once heparin exposure is stopped.

         Antifibrinolytic agents (

         ) are routinely used in cardiac surgery. Evidence is lacking regarding use of these agents in individuals with HIT; we are not aware of a reason to avoid them. Details of their use are discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94297.html" rel="external">

         Postoperative monitoring of the platelet count is appropriate. In some cases, the antibody status is also assayed. (See

         Patients who carry the diagnosis of HIT should be presumed to have had HIT until proven otherwise (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef118879" href="/z/d/graphic/118879.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). However, some individuals may be labeled as having had HIT when in fact they did not. A typical example of a patient who may be mislabeled is an individual with a low pretest probability and/or a low titer immunoassay (eg, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) that was not confirmed by definitive functional testing for HIT antibodies. This issue is further confounded by the fact that some laboratories report ELISA results without giving the optical density (OD) for this result. In such cases, evaluation of the likelihood of HIT based on the OD may not be possible without contacting the laboratory directly. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90261.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia", section on 'HIT antibody testing'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Review of the medical record and the results of prior laboratory testing is necessary to confirm a valid diagnosis. Involvement of the consulting hematologist or laboratory medicine specialist is very helpful when there is any confusion or disagreement regarding the prior diagnosis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Consult hematology or laboratory medicine'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In individuals with a previous diagnosis of HIT (confirmed or strongly suspected), PF4/heparin antibody testing is used to determine whether the antibodies are detectable or have declined to an undetectable level (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef118879" href="/z/d/graphic/118879.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). The rationale is that if the antibodies remain present, heparin exposure is likely to precipitate rapid-onset clinical HIT, with thrombocytopenia and possibly life-threatening thrombosis. In contrast, if antibodies are not detectable, heparin exposure may produce an anamnestic response, but patients often have a window of one or more days of heparin use before triggering clinical HIT. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90261.html" rel="external">

         Patients suspected to have clinical HIT before or during surgery should be evaluated as well as treated presumptively for HIT until results of the laboratory evaluation are available (

         Our approach to evaluation and presumptive treatment includes a close review of the history, medications, physical examination, and platelet counts to determine the likelihood (pretest probability) of HIT, which is estimated by calculating the 4 Ts score (

         ). The score takes into account four variables, each of which is given 0, 1, or 2 points (see

         For those with a low likelihood (low probability, 0 to 3 points on the 4 Ts score), or if HIT has been excluded, we look for other causes of thrombocytopenia (see
         <a class="local">
          'Other causes of thrombocytopenia and/or thrombosis'
         </a>
         above). We do not perform routine PF4/heparin antibody testing in individuals who are unlikely to have HIT (ie, individuals with normal [or stable] platelet counts who do not have thrombosis, or those with a low pretest probability of HIT based on the 4 Ts score). However, it should be noted that the 4 Ts score was not developed in the setting of cardiac surgery, which may affect predictive ability; the time course for any decrease in platelet count may be equally helpful [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11-13

         Test for PF4/heparin antibodies. Typically, an immunoassay such as an ELISA is done first. If the optical density (OD) is very low in this test, a diagnosis of HIT is ruled out; conversely, HIT is very likely if the OD is very high. Specific OD values and their implications are listed in the table (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117223" href="/z/d/graphic/117223.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ). For patients with uncertain diagnoses (ie, intermediate OD values), gold-standard functional testing is necessary using a serotonin release assay (SRA) or a heparin-induced platelet activation (HIPA) assay. Functional assays often have a longer turnaround time, particularly if these tests are sent to outside laboratories. Suspicion of an evolving antibody titer (eg, due to a strong clinical suspicion of HIT with a very low ELISA OD value early in the clinical course) may prompt a repeat ELISA.

         Once HIT has been diagnosed, we continue anticoagulation with a non-heparin agent (intravenous initially, then oral once platelet count has recovered) for three to six months. Decisions regarding the duration of anticoagulation with a non-heparin agent depend on whether the patient has had a thromboembolic event.

         Delaying surgery may be an appropriate option for individuals with functionally relevant PF4/heparin antibodies if the prior episode of HIT is still resolving (

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Delay of surgery until clinical HIT has resolved and PF4/heparin antibodies are negative, when possible, is consistent with expert opinion, a 2012 guideline from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), and a 2018 guideline from the American Society of Hematology (ASH) [
         <a href="#rid5">

        <p>
         Decision-making regarding risks and benefits of delaying surgery for a specific patient necessitates consultation with the surgeon to determine urgency, as well as input from the anesthesiologist and consulting hematologist or laboratory medicine expert regarding options for non-heparin therapy and laboratory monitoring.

         ). Even small amounts of heparin (eg, heparin flushes) can cause severe consequences, including life-threatening thrombosis, by creating the "HIT antigen" (heparin bound to PF4) on platelet surfaces, especially in individuals who have already developed PF4/heparin antibodies from prior heparin exposure.

         If anticoagulation is absolutely necessary for a given procedure, it may be in the patient's best interest to receive intraoperative heparin [

         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>

         The diagnosis of HIT and the need to avoid unnecessary heparin exposure should be communicated to all clinicians involved in the patient's care.

         The best parameter for assessment of clinical HIT is the platelet count. Clinically significant PF4/heparin antibodies cause platelets to be sequestered by deposition in the microvasculature, whereas clinically insignificant antibodies do not affect the platelet count.

         In emergency cases in which cardiac or vascular surgery cannot be delayed, there may not be sufficient time to determine whether platelet factor 4 (PF4)/heparin antibodies are present. These individuals are assessed for the likelihood of HIT, and in those with a high pretest probability of HIT, treated as if they have HIT until definitive testing is available (

        </p>
        <p>
         If the patient has a history of HIT or suspected HIT, the platelet count is initially used as a surrogate for testing for active HIT, and the interval since the previous episode of clinical HIT is used as a surrogate for estimating the likelihood of circulating PF4/heparin antibodies. Urgent consultation among the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and consulting hematology or laboratory medicine HIT expert is advised.

         If thrombocytopenia or an episode of clinical HIT occurred within approximately the previous three months (or approximately 100 days), pathologic anti-PF4/heparin antibodies are likely still detectable in the patient's plasma [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. The safest approach is treatment as if the patient has active HIT until definitive laboratory testing is available, as discussed below. (See

         If the platelet count is normal and there is a remote history of HIT (eg, years ago), the likelihood that the patient has clinically significant PF4/heparin antibodies is extremely low [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18

The probability of a positive functional test for PF4/heparin antibodies is estimated to be &lt;5 percent by three months and virtually zero by 12 months following an episode of clinical HIT, although exceptions have occurred [

         Patients with active HIT (or a diagnosis of HIT within the preceding three or so months) are in an extremely prothrombotic state because they are likely to have circulating anti-PF4/heparin antibodies that can activate platelets and can cause life-threatening venous and/or arterial thrombosis. Thus, we make every possible attempt to avoid use of heparin and to delay the surgical procedure in these individuals (

          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). If possible, we delay surgery until PF4/heparin antibodies become undetectable, which typically takes approximately three months (up to 100 days); if this is not possible, we use a non-heparin anticoagulant [

         However, if such antibody testing has been performed, the choice of heparin versus an alternative anticoagulant should be based on the clinical need for reversibility and risk of bleeding. If heparin is used, platelet counts should be subsequently monitored. If a functional assay is negative, retesting is prompted by clinical suspicion of HIT to determine whether there is an evolving antibody response.

This property is useful to achieve hemostasis in the postbypass and postoperative periods. However, perioperative deterioration of renal function reduces clearance, intraoperative hypothermia reduces metabolism, and administration of a large total dose (eg, during a long complex case) may prolong duration of action.

         All of these approaches may be reasonable options for managing individuals with active HIT antibodies, although the level of evidence is not high and there are no compelling reasons to select one over the other. In general, the choice depends on institutional expertise, experience, and availability. In some centers, plasmapheresis or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">
          IVIG
         </a>
         is preferred because these therapies allow the cardiac surgeon to use heparin per their normal protocol rather than managing an unfamiliar anticoagulant during CPB [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. IVIG is less invasive than plasmapheresis. However, plasmapheresis may have a longer-lasting effect on antibody titer and activity, and is often selected for patients who may be intolerant of postoperative anticoagulation. In other cases, concerns about catastrophic thrombosis with heparin may lead to a decision to use a non-heparin agent, typically

In all cases, close communication among the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and consulting hematology or laboratory medicine expert is advised throughout the perioperative period. (See

         If PF4/heparin antibodies are undetectable on a functional assay, use of intraoperative heparin for a short duration is reasonable in a patient who had a previous history of HIT and now requires a surgical procedure for which heparin is indicated [

         For such individuals, a brief exposure to heparin on the day of surgery may cause clinically significant PF4/heparin antibodies to be produced within 5 to 10 days by an anamnestic response, but heparin will no longer be present by the time the antibodies develop and clinical HIT is less likely to develop. Antibodies do not invariably recur [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]; however, delayed-onset HIT remains possible. Thus, daily platelet count monitoring, high clinical suspicion, and follow-up with hematology are prudent [

         In such patients, it is critically important to limit heparin exposure to the surgical procedure only, especially avoiding any heparin exposure in the preoperative period. All postoperative anticoagulation (eg, for thromboprophylaxis or other indications) should be done with a non-heparin agent. Heparin flushes and other sources of heparin (

         </a>
         ]. Thus, clinicians should be vigilant for signs of possible HIT in any patient who has received heparin. If HIT is suspected, initial evaluation should focus on the parameters assessed in the 4 Ts score (

         There are risks for failing to diagnose (and treat) clinical HIT when it is present, including potentially catastrophic thrombosis. However, unnecessarily treating a patient for HIT also incurs risks, including prolonging hospitalization or unnecessary anticoagulation with increased bleeding risk.
        </p>
        <p>
         Diagnosis of HIT can be challenging after cardiac surgery or vascular surgical procedures, particularly if cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was employed, due to these factors:

         Thrombocytopenia is common in such patients, with platelet count decreases of approximately 40 to 50 percent after CPB, typically occurring during the first 72 postoperative hours. In part, this is due to the prolonged contact of platelets with the artificial surface of an extracorporeal circuit [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,46,49
         </a>
         ]. Other potential causes for transiently decreased platelet counts include drug-induced thrombocytopenia and post-transfusion purpura. (See

         Clinically unimportant platelet factor 4 (PF4)/heparin antibodies often coexist with thrombocytopenia, but are typically causally unrelated [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. The incidence of heparin-induced antibodies to PF4/heparin is as high as 25 to 70 percent by immunoassay after CPB, and 4 to 20 percent by platelet activation assay [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47,50-53
         </a>
         ]. However, most patients with a positive immunoassay but negative functional assay for PF4/heparin antibodies do not develop clinical HIT [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,29
         </a>
         ]. A positive antibody test alone does not increase thromboembolic risk after cardiac surgery, and postoperative screening is not recommended [

         Typically, we obtain a platelet count daily. Platelet counts during the peak period of HIT (day 5 through 10 after heparin exposure) are the most critical. If the patient is discharged before hospital day 10, it is prudent to continue checking platelet counts in the outpatient setting every other day or every three days until day 10, if possible [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. We consider a secondary fall in the platelet count of at least 50 percent that begins between the fifth and tenth postoperative day, and without other apparent causes for the thrombocytopenia, to be highly concerning for HIT [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12,46,54
         </a>
         ]. We make a presumptive diagnosis of HIT in these patients and administer a non-heparin anticoagulant (

         – In individuals with a previous diagnosis of HIT, PF4/heparin antibody testing is used to determine whether the antibodies are detectable or have declined to an undetectable level (

          Management
         </strong>
         – Patients with active HIT or HIT within approximately the preceding three months are in an extremely prothrombotic state and at risk for life-threatening venous and/or arterial thrombosis. We make every possible attempt to avoid heparin or delay surgery in these individuals. Early involvement of the hematologist and/or laboratory medicine specialist is appropriate to facilitate risk assessment, rapid turnaround of laboratory testing, and management decisions, as outlined in the algorithm (

         – If possible, surgery may be delayed until PF4/heparin antibodies are undetectable. If emergency surgery cannot be delayed, management decisions are based on the platelet count and, if HIT was present before, the interval since the previous HIT episode. (See

          Monitor platelet count
         </strong>
         – We monitor the platelet count regularly, including the postoperative period; platelet counts from day 5 through 10 after heparin exposure are most critical. If the patient is discharged before hospital day 10, it is prudent to continue checking platelet counts after discharge. Postoperative testing for PF4/heparin antibodies is only done if HIT is suspected based on a secondary fall in platelet count. Patients should be educated about postoperative considerations and should have information available to present to other clinicians should the need arise. (See
