Neutropenia is usually defined (and defined herein) as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1500 cells/microL (&lt;1.5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L) in an adult. The ANC is equal to the product of the white blood cell (WBC) count and the percentage of neutrophils from the WBC differential (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/13483.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90654.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult with unexplained neutropenia", section on 'Definitions and normal values'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H957856"><span class="h1">INFECTIOUS RISK STRATIFICATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H960026"><span class="h2">Overview of risk stratification</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most important factor in managing a patient with neutropenia is determining the patient's risk of developing an infection and ability to respond to a severe infection. While most clinicians are familiar with the uniformly high risk of infection in those with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, the risk of infection in those with non-chemotherapy-induced neutropenia can be quite variable, ranging from no increased risk to severe, life-threatening risk. Details of the evaluation of adults with unexplained neutropenia are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90654.html" rel="external">"Approach to the adult with unexplained neutropenia"</a>.)</p><p>The main determinant of the infectious risk in patients with non-chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is the adequacy of the bone marrow neutrophil reserve (ie, the ability of the bone marrow to produce neutrophils)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71724" href="/d/graphic/71724.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). As a general rule, patients with an adequate bone marrow reserve may have chronic, non-life-threatening infections or no infections, while those with inadequate bone marrow reserve are at high risk of severe infection and sepsis. (See <a class="local">'Bone marrow evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>The ability of the bone marrow to produce adequate neutrophils can be assessed directly by bone marrow examination, or indirectly from clinical findings that suggest adequate delivery of neutrophils to the tissues. (See <a class="local">'Bone marrow evaluation'</a> below and <a class="local">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p>However, a patient may develop an infection before the adequacy of the bone marrow reserve is known. If a patient first presents with fever (ie, a single oral temperature &gt;38.3°C [101°F] or &gt;38.0°C [100.4°F] sustained for &gt;1 hour) and neutropenia of unknown cause, one must assume that the patient has inadequate marrow reserve and is at high risk. (See <a class="local">'Patients with inadequate bone marrow reserve'</a> below.)</p><p>Another factor that can increase infectious risk is the presence of disease states such as vasculitis and defective cellular immunity, which sometimes accompany neutropenia. The severity of these conditions can increase infectious risk independently of the bone marrow ability to produce neutrophils or the severity of the neutropenia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3980.html" rel="external">"The adaptive cellular immune response: T cells and cytokines"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3975.html" rel="external">"The adaptive humoral immune response"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H960033"><span class="h2">Bone marrow evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The gold standard for determining the adequacy of the bone marrow ability to produce neutrophils is examination of a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy specimen. Bone marrow examination is commonly performed in the course of the initial evaluation for patients with congenital neutropenias or pancytopenia. </p><p>Bone marrow neutrophil production is considered to be adequate if the cellularity and maturation of the neutrophil series is normal or increased. In contrast, reduced bone marrow cellularity or myeloid arrest at the myelocyte or metamyelocyte stage implies decreased bone marrow reserve. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4434.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of bone marrow aspirate smears", section on 'Estimation of cellularity and myeloid to erythroid ratio'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8380.html" rel="external">"Regulation of myelopoiesis", section on 'Neutrophil production and maturation'</a>.)</p><p>Bone marrow sampling may not be necessary (or indicated) for those with mild or transient neutropenia, lack of infections, or infections associated with signs of adequate neutrophil delivery. In particular, in patients with longstanding mild neutropenia suggestive of Duffy-negative associated neutrophil count (DANC; formerly called benign ethnic neutropenia [BEN]), bone marrow examination is uniformly uninformative and need not be performed. The diagnosis of DANC can be confirmed by determining Duffy-negative phenotype in the blood bank [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H960062"><span class="h2">Clinical features</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients who have not had a bone marrow evaluation or in whom the bone marrow findings are equivocal, the following clinical features may be useful in predicting the bone marrow reserve and/or the presence of an active infection  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62992" href="/d/graphic/62992.html" rel="external">table 2</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Purulent material or abscess formation suggests adequate bone marrow reserve and tissue delivery of neutrophils. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Markedly increased dental caries and/or ulcerations of the oral mucosa and severe gingivitis suggest an inability to deliver neutrophils. However, some lymphocyte and vascular disorders can cause similar lesions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Splenomegaly may be a sign of a chronic inflammatory state or an underlying hematologic disorder, both of which may impair an otherwise appropriate response to infection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7134.html" rel="external">"Splenomegaly and other splenic disorders in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7482.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Felty syndrome"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Elevations of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) suggest an ongoing inflammatory process, which may be a sign of other immune deficits or inadequate neutrophil production. However, elevated ESR or CRP should be interpreted with caution, as many co-morbid illnesses in adults (eg, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) can be associated with increases in these inflammatory markers. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7483.html" rel="external">"Acute phase reactants", section on 'Clinical use'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increased (or normal) absolute monocyte counts are seen in many patients with chronic forms of neutropenia. Monocytes are functioning phagocytes, but their motile response is sluggish and their presence may not suggest a decreased risk of infection [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lymphocytopenia (decreased absolute lymphocyte count) suggests an underlying immunodeficiency state, which can increase infectious risk independently of the neutropenia. Lymphocytopenia can occur in those with congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies, sepsis, malignancy, and in the postoperative period. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3903.html" rel="external">"Laboratory evaluation of the immune system"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8387.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with lymphocytosis or lymphocytopenia", section on 'Lymphocytopenia'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15215378"><span class="h2">Counseling regarding infectious risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For all patients with neutropenia, it is important to inform the patient and caregiver(s) about whether their risk of infection is high or low, and when they should seek medical attention. Although it is not our goal to unduly worry those with asymptomatic neutropenia, it can be reassuring if these individuals and their caregiver(s) are aware of the warning signs of a more serious condition.</p><p>While it is important to reduce infectious risk, it is also important to reassure patients that they do not need to sterilize their environment, and to help them find good sources of information about risk reduction [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. We also reassure patients with isolated chronic asymptomatic neutropenia that they are <strong>not</strong> at increased risk of developing leukemia.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15213234"><span class="h1">PATIENTS WITH INADEQUATE BONE MARROW RESERVE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15213430"><span class="h2">Overview of infectious risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Individuals with inadequate bone marrow production of neutrophils (eg, drug-induced neutropenia/agranulocytosis) are at increased infectious risk, the degree of which correlates with the absolute neutrophil count (ANC). An ANC &lt;500 cells/microL (500 x 10<sup>9 </sup>cells/L) in a patient with diminished bone marrow capacity carries a significant risk of infection, whereas an ANC &gt;1500 cells/microL carries a risk similar to the general population  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63903" href="/d/graphic/63903.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See <a class="local">'Infectious risk stratification'</a> above.) </p><p>The high risk of infection in a patient with an ANC &lt;100 cells/microL was demonstrated in a classic study of patients with leukemia published in 1966 [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. This study evaluated the relationship between the frequency, severity, and duration of neutropenia during 125 episodes of severe neutropenia and 733 episodes of moderate neutropenia. Infections occurred in 80 percent of patients with severe neutropenia (ANC &lt;100/microL) within two weeks of onset and in 100 percent at three weeks. However, it should be noted that patients in this study had leukemia and therefore had many reasons to have intercurrent infection related to the effects of chemotherapy on mucosal surfaces, indwelling intravenous catheters, and the other aspects of their disease and its treatment. </p><p>Patients with chronic idiopathic neutropenia may have a very benign course and tolerate an ANC &lt;100 cells/microL without experiencing infectious episodes, but others may experience gingivitis and painful mouth ulcers requiring treatment with G-CSF.</p><p>In most cases, individuals with post-infectious neutropenia and neutropenia due to nutrient deficiencies will experience a rapid resolution of neutropenia once the infection resolves or the nutritional deficiency is corrected, and these individuals can be presumed to handle infections adequately once the neutrophil count begins to improve.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15213457"><span class="h2">Preventing infection</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1412561"><span class="h3">Overview of infection prevention</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The major means of preventing infection in those with inadequate bone marrow neutrophil reserve include reducing exposures and raising the neutrophil count with myeloid growth factors.</p><p>We also suggest the following in all patients:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Emphasize dental hygiene and regular dental care to prevent oral infections and bacteremia from an oral source. Antibiotic mouthwashes, such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9244" href="/d/drug information/9244.html" rel="external">chlorhexidine</a> gluconate (0.12% oral rinse), can be used by individuals with gingivitis to reduce the severity of this condition.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Promote hand hygiene, which is especially important during influenza season, travel, and encounters with medical personnel. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4042.html" rel="external">"Infection prevention: Precautions for preventing transmission of infection", section on 'Hand hygiene'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Regularly update age-appropriate immunizations and annual influenza vaccines. Inactivated vaccines are appropriate for those with coexisting immunodeficiencies. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3884.html" rel="external">"Standard immunizations for nonpregnant adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3890.html" rel="external">"Immunizations for travel"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>We do not use any special dietary practices in individuals with neutropenia. Prophylactic antibiotics are also generally not of value in those with inadequate bone marrow reserve of neutrophils who do not have an active infection. Exceptions include antibiotics to prevent travelers' diarrhea and appropriate peri-procedural antibiotics.</p><p>If a patient requires treatment for severe or recurrent infections, we treat with G-CSF to maintain an adequate neutrophil count. Although there are no strict criteria by which we decide when to initiate this therapy, we treat most patients with an ANC &lt;500 who have recurrent aphthous ulcers, have had a single life-threatening unprovoked infection, or have had two or more serious infections over the course of a year. Patients who develop severe G-CSF-related side effects can have a trial off therapy to determine whether they need chronic cytokine support.</p><p>Prophylactic antibiotics have not been demonstrated to be of value in the setting of non-chemotherapy-induced neutropenia with frequent infections. The use of prophylactic antibiotics in individuals with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16141.html" rel="external">"Prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in adults with hematologic malignancies"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13951.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prevention of neutropenic fever syndromes in adult cancer patients at low risk for complications"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1153.html" rel="external">"Prophylaxis of infection during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in high-risk adults"</a>.)  </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15213471"><span class="h3">Myeloid growth factors to reduce infectious risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Myeloid growth factors, including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), have been used successfully in some neutropenic patients as a means of preventing infections. G-CSF should not be given based on the severity of the neutropenia, but rather based on the presence of recurrent infections. As previously noted, many patients with chronic idiopathic neutropenia are asymptomatic despite an ANC &lt;100 cells/microL, and do not require G-CSF. Use of G-CSF in those patients can be associated with severe side effects (eg, bone pain, nausea, vomiting, splenomegaly), supporting the practice of avoiding G-CSF administration that is not dictated by clinical presentation. In patients with recurrent infections, low doses of G-CSF (eg, 1 to 3 mcg/kg/day) may be used and may be well tolerated.</p><p>We use G-CSF to improve neutrophil production in patients with the following conditions when there is a strong history of infections:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Congenital neutropenias (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8373.html" rel="external">"Congenital neutropenia", section on 'Treatment'</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Aplastic anemia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Chronic idiopathic neutropenia with recurrent infections (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8371.html" rel="external">"Immune neutropenia", section on 'Chronic idiopathic neutropenia'</a>)</p><p></p><p>When using G-CSF, we use short-acting preparations, rather than long-acting pegylated G-CSF, because of increased side effects with the latter in this patient population. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8383.html" rel="external">"Introduction to recombinant hematopoietic growth factors"</a>.)</p><p>The potential efficacy of G-CSF in preventing infections in patients with inadequate bone marrow reserve can be illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A multicenter, phase III trial randomized 123 patients with severe chronic neutropenia and recurrent infection to either immediate treatment with G-CSF (3.45 to 11.5 mcg/kg per day) or a four-month observation period followed by G-CSF treatment [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].
