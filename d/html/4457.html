         After a primary cesarean birth, individuals who become pregnant again must decide between undergoing a repeat cesarean or a trial of labor. Issues specific to repeat cesarean birth will be discussed here. Primary cesarean birth, issues common to both primary and repeat cesareans, and trial of labor after a previous cesarean birth are reviewed separately.

         Timing of a medically or obstetrically indicated birth, whether by induction of labor or repeat cesarean, depends upon the particular medical or obstetric indication for delivery (eg, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, nonreassuring fetal testing, alloimmunization, cholestasis of pregnancy). The decision should be made by the obstetric care provider based on the disorder, with consideration of patient-specific factors (eg, severity of the disorder, comorbidities, patient values and preferences). (Refer to topic reviews on each disorder.)
        </p>
        <p>
         A consensus panel of experts did not consider "soft" indications for intervention, such as suspected macrosomia in the absence of maternal diabetes or a problem in a previous pregnancy that has not recurred, reasonable medical indications for early delivery [

         Planned repeat cesarean birth is typically scheduled before the onset of labor to minimize the risk of an emergency delivery due to uterine rupture in the setting of labor and the associated risk for fetal demise.

         The optimum gestational age for scheduling the birth balances these benefits with the potential risk of delivering a neonate who could benefit from additional maturation in utero. Since fetal exposure to labor (even if prior to cesarean birth) is associated with a lower rate of neonatal respiratory morbidity, it is particularly important to schedule planned cesarean births when gestational age-related respiratory morbidity is minimal [

         In patients with one or more previous lower uterine segment transverse hysterotomies, the optimum time for planned repeat cesarean birth appears to be in the 39
         <sup>
          th

         week of gestation (39+0
         <sup>

         to 39+6 weeks). We agree with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommendation to not perform nonmedically indicated births before 39 weeks of gestation [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. This recommendation is supported by a multicenter prospective study (Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [NICHD] Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network) on timing of cesarean birth including over 24,000 repeat cesarean births at term, of which over 13,000 were planned [

         The incidence of the composite primary outcome (neonatal respiratory problems, hypoglycemia, sepsis, seizures, intensive care unit admission, hospitalization ≥5 days, etc) by gestational age at planned repeat cesarean birth was 15.3 percent at 37 weeks, 11 percent at 38 weeks, 8 percent at 39 weeks, 7.3 percent at 40 weeks, 11.3 percent at 41 weeks, and 19.5 percent at ≥42 weeks [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Thus, there was a higher incidence of adverse neonatal outcome before and after 39 to 40 weeks, and this difference was statistically significant.

         Compared with pregnancy continuation, planned repeat cesarean birth at 37 and 38 weeks of gestation had a higher risk of adverse neonatal outcome (37 weeks: odds ratio [OR] 2.02, 95% CI 1.73-2.36; 38 weeks: OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.24-1.56) whereas delivery at 39 and 40 weeks had a lower risk (39 weeks: OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68-0.92; 40 weeks: OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.43-0.75).

         For the mother, compared with pregnancy continuation, planned repeat cesarean birth at 37 weeks of gestation had a higher risk of adverse maternal outcome (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.06-2.31), while planned repeat cesarean at 39 weeks had a lower risk (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.36-0.72) [

         Similar findings were published in a study of data from the Dutch birth registry involving nearly 21,000 planned cesarean births at term [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. The incidence of a primary composite of neonatal morbidity and mortality decreased from 20.6 percent at &lt;38 weeks and 12.5 percent at &lt;39 weeks to 9.5 percent at ≥39 weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
         Two potential disadvantages of waiting until 39 weeks are the risks of antepartum stillbirth and onset of spontaneous labor, but neither of these risks appear to be clinically meaningful. When only risk of stillbirth is considered, others have found that the reduction in nonmedically indicated early term births in favor of birth at ≥39 weeks was not associated with an increase in the rate of stillbirth in the United States [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]. In a clinical trial, approximately 13 percent (82 of 638) of participants went into spontaneous labor before planned cesarean at 39+3 weeks, and these patients did not have a high rate of adverse outcomes [

         <a href="#rid11">
          11

         ], but there is no consensus on best practice and others have advocated planned repeat cesarean at 39+0

         to 39+6 weeks to reduce the chances of newborn morbidity from early term birth [

         On uterine scar imaging, a thin scar is not highly predictive of rupture; therefore, imaging of the scar is not commonly performed as a component of delivery-planning. Antepartum incisional imaging and possible findings are reviewed separately. (See

         In patients with a prior lower segment vertical incision, we perform planned repeat cesarean birth in the 39

         week of gestation (39+0
         <sup>
         </sup>
         to 39+6 weeks). However, if review of the prior operative report, patient report, or clinical setting of the previous birth suggests that the thick muscular part of the uterus (active segment) was likely involved in the otherwise low-vertical incision, then we perform repeat cesarean at 37+0 to 37+6 weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
         Timing of repeat cesarean birth in patients with a prior low-vertical uterine incision is controversial. No trials have compared different gestational ages for repeat cesarean. In a review of 10 studies that included complete information about pregnancy outcome in 372 patients with prior low-vertical cesarean births and subsequent trial of labor, four uterine ruptures (1.05 percent) were reported, but only one of these occurred after a single prior low segment vertical cesarean incision that did not extend into the upper segment [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Two ruptures occurred elsewhere on the lateral or posterior aspect of the uterus in subsequent pregnancies, and the fourth rupture occurred at the juncture of prior low-vertical and -transverse incisions. We agree with the authors of this report who concluded that, in an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy, a patient with one previous nonextended lower uterine segment vertical cesarean incision should receive the same care, counseling, and caution as a patient with a prior low-transverse incision.

         In the stable patient with a previous classical uterine incision, we schedule repeat cesarean at 37+0 weeks. The ACOG recommendation for delivery is at 36+0 to 37+0
         <sup>
         </sup>
         weeks of gestation [
         <a href="#rid15">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         No randomized trials have evaluated the optimum timing of birth in patients with a prior classical hysterotomy incision. Intervention before 39+0 weeks of gestation reduces the chances of birth after spontaneous labor has begun and the associated risk of uterine rupture. However, intervention before 39+0 weeks of gestation can also lead to newborn complications from being born before fully mature, and it may not fully prevent uterine rupture since it has been reported as early as the second trimester and up to 50 percent of uterine ruptures will occur prior to labor onset.

         A decision analysis attempted to address the issue of timing delivery after a previous classical hysterotomy incision by analyzing the following four options [

        <p>
         The authors concluded that the strategy of delivery at 36 weeks of gestation without amniocentesis provided the lowest risk of a maternal-neonatal catastrophic outcome associated with uterine rupture. Their rationale was that, although complications of prematurity at 36 weeks of gestation occur more frequently than uterine rupture, these complications are often minor and transient and are, therefore, not as detrimental to maternal-neonatal quality of life as uterine rupture. In this model, there was no benefit of offering fetal lung maturity testing because it would lead, in cases of negative results, to further expectant management in an already risky situation.

         When the location of the prior uterine incision is unknown (eg, no operative note is available, patient was not told incision site), the clinician and patient should review the past obstetric history (gestational age at birth, birth weight, presentation, pregnancy and/or delivery complications, surgeon's comments about the delivery to patient and/or family). If the patient reports a previous term cesarean birth of a newborn weighing more than 5 pounds (2.3 kg) in an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy, then based on clinical experience and expert opinion, there is a high probability that the uterine incision was low transverse, especially if the skin incision is transverse. As a result, it is reasonable to schedule the repeat cesarean in the 39
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         week of gestation (39+0
         <sup>
         </sup>
         to 39+6 weeks).
        </p>
        <p>
         A classical hysterotomy should be suspected if the lower uterine segment was likely to be poorly developed at the time of the previous cesarean birth (eg, delivery before 28 weeks of gestation) or the patient had known pathology of the lower uterine segment (eg, large leiomyoma). In one large study, 50 percent of participants who underwent cesarean birth at 23 to 26 weeks had a classical hysterotomy [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         This approach is supported by studies of patients who underwent a trial of labor after one or more previous cesarean births [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,19
         </a>
         ]. Patients in whom the type of prior uterine incision was unknown had comparable uterine rupture rates as those with a known prior low-transverse incision. In the latter study, exclusions included multifetal gestation, previous myomectomy, any prostaglandin use, and birth weight &lt;500 grams (1.1 pound).

         Pregnant patients who have had a uterine rupture and a previous cesarean should undergo repeat cesarean birth to minimize the risk of another rupture. The author generally schedules the birth between 34+0 and 35+6 weeks of gestation. In a decision analysis to determine the optimal gestational age of delivery in patients with prior uterine rupture, a Monte Carlo simulation supported this approach, demonstrating that delivery at 35 weeks was the optimal strategy 37 percent of the time and 34 weeks was the optimal strategy 17 percent of the time [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. ACOG suggests managing these patients similar to those with a previous classical hysterotomy and thus scheduling delivery between 36+0 and 37+0 weeks of gestation, with individualization based on the clinical setting [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. For example, if the prior rupture occurred prior to 36 weeks, earlier delivery would be warranted, possibly after a course of antenatal corticosteroids. (See

         However, if the patient with a suboptimally dated pregnancy has a history of a prior classical hysterotomy, an unknown uterine incision that has a high likelihood of being a classical incision, or a previous uterine rupture, then the best estimate of gestational age should be made using the patient's last menstrual period (if known), and the earliest ultrasound available.

         Patients with GBS rectovaginal colonization who undergo planned cesarean birth in the absence of labor or rupture of membranes are at very low risk of GBS transmission to the fetus/newborn; therefore, these patients do not require GBS prophylaxis at any gestational age.

         We would consider making a midline vertical incision when it would provide more rapid exposure of the uterus. We would also consider a midline vertical or a Maylard incision in cases of suspected placenta previa or placenta accreta spectrum and in patients suspected to have extensive dense adhesions, as these incisions may provide better exposure. Patient body habitus is also a factor in determining the best skin incision. (See

         Formation of adhesions is common after cesarean birth, and the extent and density increase with increasing numbers of repeat cesarean births. The reported prevalence of adhesions is 12 to 46 percent of patients at their second cesarean and 26 to 75 percent of patients at their third cesarean [

        </p>
        <p>
         Because adhesions are often present in patients with prior abdominal surgery, the fascia and peritoneum should be entered carefully to avoid injury to underlying, possibly adherent bowel or bladder. For example, opening the peritoneum by blunt rather than sharp dissection and opening laterally or using a paravesical or supravesical extraperitoneal approach should be considered. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5405.html" rel="external">

         A surgeon experienced in complex abdominal surgery should be present if meticulous dissection of dense adhesions involving important structures is required. Some clinicians find insertion of ureteral stents can be useful to facilitate intraoperative identification (and avoidance) of the ureters, especially in cases of placenta previa or suspected placenta accreta spectrum.

         Ideally, the hysterotomy is performed through a low-transverse incision, even if prior cesareans were performed using a classical or other type of uterine incision. Sometimes, a classical uterine incision cannot be avoided because of pathology, such as uterine myomas or dense adhesions involving the lower uterine segment. In one large study, among patients who had prior classical cesarean birth, 31 percent of repeat cesarean births were performed via a classical hysterotomy [

         Information on management of patients with a uterine dehiscence (incidental finding of an asymptomatic disruption of the myometrium that does not lead to any serious maternal or neonatal consequences) found at cesarean is limited to case reports. The term "uterine window" is also sometimes used, but uterine dehiscence is preferred.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most dehiscences occur at the site of the prior uterine incision; they vary widely in length and depth. The amniotic sac remains intact.
        </p>
        <p>
         The goals of repair are to ensure the integrity of the myometrium; adequate myometrial contraction, including the lower uterine segment; and avoidance of any further injury to the uterus and/or surrounding organs and vessels, especially the bladder. If the dehiscence is vertical, we close it in three layers with a baseball stitch (ie, continuous running stitch) for the superficial layer, as with a classical hysterotomy. If the dehiscence is transverse, we close it in two layers with an imbricating stitch for the superficial layer to reduce the risk of bladder adhesions [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         If a significant uterine dehiscence is encountered at repeat cesarean birth and the patient desires to have additional children, we would consider planning repeat cesarean before 39+0 weeks. The precise timing depends on patient-specific factors (eg, severity of the dehiscence, appearance of the lower uterine segment on ultrasound).

         Single cystotomy incisions in the dome of the bladder are often repaired by the obstetrician. Repair of multiple cystotomy incisions or injury to the trigone or ureter is more complex; consultation with a urologist, urogynecologist, or gynecologic oncologist can be helpful to evaluate the integrity of the urinary tract and assist with the repair. Similarly, if bowel injury occurs, a general surgeon may be consulted to evaluate the bowel and assist in the repair. Obstetricians proficient in these repairs may choose to undertake the repair without assistance. (See

          Complications relating to adhesion formation
         </span>
         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The degree of adhesion formation after abdominal surgery varies widely among individuals and is generally unpredictable. Adhesions might develop each time the abdomen is entered and increase with an increasing number of abdominal surgeries. In one study, adhesions in the operative field were identified in 7 percent of primary cesarean births and 68 percent of third cesarean births [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. Some investigators have suggested that the sliding sign may help to identify significant intra-abdominal adhesions before repeat cesarean birth. On ultrasound examination in a sagittal plane lateral to the umbilicus, if the anterior uterine wall does not slide across the abdominal wall during maternal deep breathing, then the sliding sign is negative and moderate to severe intra-abdominal adhesions are likely to be present [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42-48
         </a>
         ]. A positive sliding sign is associated with a low risk of dense adhesions. We do not use this sign given the limited available data, and most importantly, the lack of data that its use results in improved surgical outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Dense adhesions can make the surgical procedure and fetal extraction more difficult, prolong the time to fetal extraction, and increase the risk of surgical complications such as bladder or bowel injury and excessive blood loss [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28,29,41,49,50
         </a>
         ]. Bladder injury is more common than bowel injury, and the frequency increases with an increasing number of cesarean births  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80662" href="/z/d/graphic/80662.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). Adhesions may cause the bladder to densely adhere to the lower uterine segment, eliminating the usual plane for blunt dissection, or they may distort the position of the bladder so that it is adherent to the midportion of the uterus. Cystotomy is more likely if an atypically located bladder is not recognized. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5405.html" rel="external">
          "Cesarean birth: Surgical technique", section on 'Avoiding visceral injury in patients with dense intraperitoneal adhesions'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Postoperatively, adhesions are a common cause of small bowel obstruction. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8037.html" rel="external">
          "Etiologies, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Adhesions can also cause subfertility as a result of tubal distortion. There is no strong evidence of a causal relationship between a cesarean birth in a first pregnancy and subfertility [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]; however, the effect of multiple cesareans on fertility has not been evaluated. (See

         The possible future desire for a vaginal birth after cesarean birth should also be considered by patients planning a repeat cesarean birth. There is a small risk of uterine rupture (although the event, when it occurs, is associated with adverse maternal and newborn outcomes). Patients with two prior cesarean births are generally considered to be acceptable candidates for a trial of labor after cesarean birth (TOLAC). Data are sparse for patients with three or more prior cesareans, and no consensus about the best approach. We often suggest repeat cesarean for these patients, but take into account other factors, such as prior vaginal births.

          Unknown hysterotomy incision
         </strong>
         – If documentation of the type of prior hysterotomy is not available, the clinician should obtain a thorough history of the delivery from the patient and use this information to estimate the most likely location of the prior incision. Timing of repeat cesarean is based on this estimate. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Unknown location of previous uterine incision'

          Complications of multiple repeat cesarean births
         </strong>
         – There is no threshold below which the number of repeat cesarean births can be guaranteed to be uncomplicated. Our approach is to discuss the increasing risk of complications with increasing numbers of cesarean births  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80662" href="/z/d/graphic/80662.html" rel="external">
          table 2

         and

          table 3
         </a>
         ). We inform each patient that the risk of placenta accreta rises in direct proportion to the number of previous cesareans, and this risk is dramatically increased if placenta previa is also present. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Is there an unsafe number of repeat cesarean births?'
