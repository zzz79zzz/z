(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4754.html" rel="external">"Treatment of favorable prognosis early (stage I-II) classic Hodgkin lymphoma"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/737.html" rel="external">"Overview of the treatment of newly diagnosed, invasive, non-metastatic breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p>These successes with RT, used either alone or in combination with other modalities, resulted in large cohorts of cancer survivors, who are subject to late complications from treatment. Analyses have shown that the therapeutic benefits from RT may be offset to some extent by delayed effects on the heart, thereby reducing the benefits of RT.</p><p>Irradiation of a substantial volume of the heart to a sufficiently high dose can damage virtually any component of the heart, including the pericardium, myocardium, heart valves, coronary arteries, capillaries, and conducting system. Pericarditis is the typical acute manifestation of radiation injury, while chronic pericardial disease, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, and conduction abnormalities can manifest years or decades after the original treatment. These complications can cause significant morbidity or mortality.</p><p>The data on the late cardiovascular toxicity of RT come primarily from survivors of breast cancer and HL, diseases in which RT is a frequent component of the initial management and in which survival is often prolonged. Similar effects may be present in other cancer survivors who receive thoracic RT, although data are more limited.</p><p>An awareness of the potential cardiotoxicity of RT led to the application of improved RT techniques that minimize irradiation to the heart. These contemporary techniques appear to have significantly decreased the incidence of delayed complications, but have not completely eliminated this risk.</p><p>The pathophysiology of RT-induced cardiac injury and the clinical data on the magnitude of risk are presented here. RT-induced cardiotoxicity associated with Hodgkin lymphoma and pediatric malignancies is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/111731.html" rel="external">"Cardiotoxicity of radiation therapy for Hodgkin lymphoma and pediatric malignancies"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pathophysiologic pathway responsible for most manifestations of cardiotoxicity appears to involve damage to blood vessels. This injury is thought to be due to the generation of reactive oxygen species that disrupt DNA strands. Secondary inflammatory changes then lead to fibrosis.</p><p>The histologic hallmarks of radiation-associated cardiotoxicity are diffuse fibrosis in the interstitium of the myocardium with normal-appearing myocytes and narrowing of capillary and arterial lumens [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Irregularities of the endothelial cell membranes, cytoplasmic swelling, thrombosis, and rupture of the walls are present. The ratio of capillaries to myocytes is reduced by approximately 50 percent, and this leads to myocardial cell death, ischemia, and fibrosis. Dense collagen and fibrin replace the normal adipose tissue of the outer layer of the heart, leading to pericardial fibrosis, effusion, and rarely, tamponade [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>These changes can have several consequences:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Coronary artery disease (CAD) results from injury to the intima of the coronary arteries. This initiates a cascade of events that is typical of atherosclerosis, including replacement of damaged cells by myofibroblasts and deposition of platelets [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The distribution of arteries affected by RT reflects the dose distribution. As an example, the left anterior descending and the right coronary arteries are most often involved in patients receiving mediastinal RT for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and the left anterior descending artery receives more radiation during treatment for left-sided breast cancer. Arterial narrowing is typically proximal and often involves the coronary ostia [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The cusp and/or leaflets of valves may undergo fibrotic changes with or without calcification. Changes to valves on the left side are more common than those on the right, regardless of the relative dose distribution of RT [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. This suggests that the higher pressures in the systemic circulation contribute to the pathogenesis of these lesions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Myocardial fibrosis can compromise cardiac compliance, leading to diastolic dysfunction [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fibrosis of cells in the conduction system can predispose to dysrhythmia [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>].</p><p></p><p>A number of risk factors for the development of RT-induced cardiac toxicity have been identified, including the total radiation dose, the dose per fraction, the volume of heart irradiated, and the concomitant administration of cardiotoxic systemic agents (eg, anthracyclines, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10101" href="/d/drug information/10101.html" rel="external">trastuzumab</a>). Patient-related factors that may increase the risk of radiation-induced cardiotoxicity include younger age at the time of treatment and the presence of other risk factors for coronary heart disease (eg, hypertension, smoking).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">BREAST CANCER</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Incidental radiation to the heart as part of the initial treatment of breast cancer can result in a range of cardiotoxic effects including coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, pericardial disease, valvular dysfunction, and conduction abnormalities. Cardiotoxicity is related to both the volume of heart irradiated and the radiation dose delivered to that volume.</p><p>Older RT techniques for treating the breast, chest wall, and/or draining lymph nodes delivered relatively high doses of radiation to portions of the heart. Contemporary techniques expose a smaller volume of the heart and are associated with a reduced risk of cardiotoxicity. However, it is unclear if there is a "safe dose" with no increased risk. Low radiation doses may initiate an inflammatory cascade that persists and augments the risk for cardiovascular events [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. A case-control study suggested that an increased risk of cardiac disease can be seen after relatively low doses of radiation (approximately 2 Gy averaged across the heart from higher doses to small cardiac volumes), that the clinical manifestation of this increased risk can be seen throughout a broad continuum of follow-up durations (eg, from &lt;5 years to ≥20 years), and the absolute magnitude of the effects of radiation are higher in patients with cardiac risk factors since the presence of cardiac risk factors markedly increases the baseline risk [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. Despite this, the absolute risk associated with RT is small and appears to be outweighed by the benefits in patients for whom radiation is typically recommended.</p><p>Randomized trials conducted over the last 40 years demonstrate the overall positive impact of post-lumpectomy/mastectomy radiation on local control and survival [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. These benefits were achieved despite the use of some older radiation techniques. With more modern approaches, the absolute benefits of radiation may be increased, as has been suggested in some reports [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/789.html" rel="external">"Radiation therapy techniques for newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Older evidence of cardiovascular toxicity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The cardiovascular toxicity of chest wall irradiation following mastectomy was initially identified in a retrospective analysis of 1461 long-term survivors of breast cancer who were treated from 1949 to 1955 and then followed for up to 34 years [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The women in this cohort had originally been randomly assigned to RT given immediately or delayed RT until the time of a local recurrence. After 15 years, there was a significantly increased mortality in those given immediate RT (relative risk [RR] 1.43) that was attributable to excess deaths from cardiovascular disease.</p><p>Subsequent meta-analyses confirmed these initial observations [<a href="#rid1">1,3,4</a>]. The largest, which explored the impact of RT on breast cancer mortality and on mortality from other causes, was conducted by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG), which evaluated 19,582 women enrolled in 40 randomized trials of RT versus no RT that were begun before 1990 [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. Although the use of RT decreased the annual mortality rate from breast cancer by 13 percent, the annual mortality rate from other causes was increased by 21 percent. The increased nonbreast cancer-related mortality was primarily due to an excess number of deaths from vascular causes (death rate ratio 1.30, compared with those not receiving RT).</p><p>Most, if not all, of the individual trials in the meta-analyses were initiated before 1975 and used RT techniques that would now be considered suboptimal because of excessive cardiac irradiation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Modified RT techniques</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once the potential cardiotoxicity of RT was recognized, treatment techniques were modified and continue to be altered to minimize incidental cardiac irradiation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/789.html" rel="external">"Radiation therapy techniques for newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p>Although the data from more recent studies suggest a decreased incidence of cardiotoxicity from decreased dose-volumes [<a href="#rid14">14</a>], the evidence indicates that there is at least some residual risk.</p><p>Approaches to assessing the relative risk of cardiotoxicity in breast cancer patients treated with modified RT techniques have included:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Comparison of the incidence of cardiac morbidity and/or mortality in those treated with RT (breast or chest wall) with those not receiving RT following surgery. (See <a class="local">'Meta-analyses and randomized trials'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Analyses of the effect of radiation dose to the heart on the incidence of cardiac morbidity and/or mortality. These have included case control studies comparing those who did and did not develop coronary events after RT for breast cancer, as well as studies comparing women with left-sided versus right-sided breast cancers (since the dose to the heart is generally less in patients irradiated for right-sided tumors). (See <a class="local">'Effect of radiation dose to the heart'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Radiographic assessment of cardiac injury following RT. (See <a class="local">'Surrogate endpoints of myocardial injury'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Meta-analyses and randomized trials</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Data have shown that radiation exposure of the heart increases the risk of ischemic heart disease and cardiac mortality, though the absolute risks are small, and less than the risk of omitting radiation for appropriately selected patients.</p><p>In a meta-analysis of 39 studies involving almost 1.2 million patients with breast cancer, those receiving radiotherapy experienced an increased risk of coronary artery disease (relative risk [RR] 1.3, 95% CI 1.13-1.49) and cardiac death (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.18-1.62) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. However, the absolute risk increase for coronary artery disease and cardiac death was only 76 and 126 cases, respectively, per 100,000 person-years. For coronary artery disease, the risk increased within the first decade, and for cardiac mortality, it increased in the second decade.</p><p>Although previous randomized trials have not suggested a difference between irradiated patients and controls in regards to cardiac morbidity or death, this may be due, in part, to a relatively shorter follow-up. For example, in randomized trials conducted by the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG 82b and 82c), among 3083 patients with high-risk stage II or III primary breast cancer randomly assigned to adjuvant systemic treatment with or without RT following mastectomy, there were no significant differences between irradiated patients and controls with respect to either death or morbidity from ischemic heart disease or acute myocardial infarction at a median follow-up of 10 years [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>Importantly, in these studies, postmastectomy chest wall irradiation improved survival in high-risk women with breast cancer, and the benefit of chest wall irradiation more than outweighed any increase in cardiac morbidity and mortality. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/739.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant radiation therapy for women with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer", section on 'Patients treated with breast-conserving surgery'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Effect of radiation dose to the heart</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There does not appear to be any minimum radiation dose that is entirely safe, and the effects of radiation on the heart increase with increasing doses of radiation [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The increased risk can be seen within the first five years and remains elevated for at least 20 years. Women with significant risk factors for an acute coronary event may be at a particularly increased risk.</p><p>This effect of RT was demonstrated in a population-based case-control study that included 2168 women who were treated for breast cancer with surgery and RT in Sweden and Denmark between 1958 and 2001. The study included 963 women who experienced a significant coronary event (myocardial infarction, revascularization, or death from ischemic heart disease) following their treatment for breast cancer. These women were compared with 1205 matched controls who received similar therapy for their breast cancer but did not have a cardiac event following breast cancer treatment. RT records were reviewed for all patients, and the dose of radiation to the heart estimated for each patient.</p><p>Results included the following [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There was increased risk of major coronary events following RT for all time periods from the period less than five years through greater than 20 years.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The estimated mean dose of radiation to the heart was 4.9 Gy (calculated by averaging a high radiation dose to a small cardiac volume across the entire heart); the dose of radiation to the heart was greater in those with a left-sided breast cancer (6.6 versus 2.9 Gy). The risk of a coronary event increased progressively with the radiation dose, with a relative increase of 7.4 percent for each 1 Gy of radiation to the heart.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A history of ischemic heart disease before cancer therapy was associated with an increased risk of a cardiac event after treatment for breast cancer (ratio 6.67, p &lt;0.001). Other factors associated with a significantly increased risk included other circulatory disease, diabetes, or a left-sided breast cancer (risk ratios 1.88, 3.23, and 1.32, respectively).</p><p></p><p>Only a very limited number of patients received potentially cardiotoxic medications (eg, anthracyclines, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10101" href="/d/drug information/10101.html" rel="external">trastuzumab</a>), which might substantially increase the risk associated with RT. However, this analysis did not take into account other cardiac complications of radiation (cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, arrhythmias).</p><p>The impact of radiation dose on the risk of ischemic heart disease was confirmed in a smaller study that analyzed cardiac outcomes in a population treated with a consistent RT technique [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p>Even in the relatively-modern era (eg, in patients treated from 1992 to 2012 when 3D planning was largely available), higher cardiac events are seen in a Swedish population study of women receiving left- versus right-sided RT (hazard ratio 1.18), thus suggesting that some modern technologies alone may not fully mitigate the risk [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p>Additional evidence comes from observational studies that have analyzed the rate of cardiac complications in breast cancer survivors [<a href="#rid12">12,19-27</a>]. These studies have yielded conflicting results but suggest that there is an increase in cardiac events in women with left-sided breast tumors compared with right-sided cancers since the latter received lower doses of irradiation to the heart. Three of the larger registry studies illustrate the potential impact of RT based upon the laterality of the tumor:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In one report, outcomes were analyzed from 115,000 women in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database who received adjuvant RT in the United States between 1973 and 2001 [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. For patients irradiated between 1973 and 1982, cardiac mortality was significantly higher in women with left-sided breast cancers and the difference was more pronounced with longer follow-up (cardiac mortality ratio [CMR] for left-sided versus right-sided cancers 1.20, 1.42, and 1.58, at &lt;10, 10-14, and &gt;15 years, respectively). However, for women treated from 1983 to 1992, the differences were less pronounced and not statistically significant, and none of the patients treated from 1993 onward had 10-year follow-up. This decrease in excess mortality may reflect improvements in RT techniques, shorter follow-up, or other unknown factors.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a second SEER database study, the risk of death from ischemic heart disease was analyzed in a cohort of 27,283 women with breast cancer whose treatment included adjuvant RT during the period 1973 to 1989 [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. For women diagnosed between 1973 and 1979, there was a significantly higher 15-year mortality rate from ischemic heart disease for women with left-sided versus right-sided tumors (13.1 versus 10.2 percent). For those diagnosed from 1980 to 1984, and from 1985 to 1989, the differences in 15-year mortality rates for women with left-sided versus right-sided tumors were not significant (9.4 versus 8.7 percent and 5.8 versus 5.2 percent, respectively). The overall incidence of death from cardiac disease decreased substantially with the later cohorts.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A large Danish registry-based study of patients treated from 1970 to 2009 suggested that both irradiation of the internal mammary nodes (IMN) and anthracycline-based chemotherapy can increase the risk of cardiotoxicity (in at least an additive manner, and perhaps synergistically). For example, overall, the hazard ratio for cardiovascular disease among those receiving radiation to the internal mammary chain without anthracyclines was 1.54 (95% CI 1.4-1.8) relative to those receiving neither internal mammary chain radiation nor anthracyclines, and 2.1 if anthracyclines were also administered (95% CI 1.6 -2.7) [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Absolute risk rates were increased over time and in patients with pre-existing cardiac risk factors. The authors of the study suggest that patients treated with these techniques might warrant more careful surveillance for cardiac disease.</p><p></p><p>The applicability of these studies to more recently treated patients is unclear since the cardiac radiation doses seen in the era studied were typically much higher than those seen in contemporary series using more modern techniques. Nevertheless, about 29 percent of the patients in the third study received radiation after 1999 (ie, with relatively modern techniques). This study highlights the ongoing controversy surrounding IMN RT as several contemporary prospective trials suggest that IMN RT can improve overall outcomes [<a href="#rid29">29-31</a>], but their follow-up is not as long as in this large population-based study.</p><p>The absolute increase in risk of a major coronary event or death from ischemic heart disease is small. In the case control study comparing women given RT who had a major coronary event with those did not have a coronary event [<a href="#rid11">11</a>], the authors calculated that the risk that a 50-year-old women with no other coronary risk factors would die of ischemic heart disease prior to age 80 years would increase from 1.9 to 2.4 percent if she received a mean dose of radiation of 3 Gy to her heart; the risk of having at least one major coronary event would increase from 4.5 to 5.4 percent.

Unfortunately, heart-specific toxicities were not assessed in this trial. These data suggest that to the degree that the poorer survival in the high dose arm was due to cardiac disease, RT-associated cardiac injury can occur relatively soon after RT.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In a series of 112 patients treated on several radiation dose-escalation trials, there was an association between the rate of subsequent cardiac events (including acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia, symptomatic effusions, and pericarditis) and both heart dose and baseline cardiac risk [<a href="#rid63">63</a>].

These findings are consistent with the findings of RTOG 0617, and support the contention that RT-associated cardiac injury can occur relatively soon following RT for lung cancer and that this might be clinically meaningful.

The key components of this approach include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>All patients</strong> – Individualized RT planning and treatment delivery methods that reduce both the volume and dose of incidental cardiac irradiation should be employed whenever possible (balanced with the need to provide adequate target coverage and risks to other organs; eg, involved-site RT, deep inspiration breath holding [DIBH]) [<a href="#rid70">70-73</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>In breast cancer</strong> – In patients receiving RT for left-sided breast cancer, reducing (and hopefully eliminating) the heart from the primary radiation beams is the optimal/preferred strategy. CT-based planning is critical in reducing incidental cardiac irradiation in these patients and can reduce the risk of RT-associated heart injury [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. DIBH is a particularly useful approach in this setting as well. Systematic cardiac blocking without DIBH often results in underdosage of portions of the breast/chest wall/internal mammary nodes (IMN) and thus may not be prudent, depending on the clinical setting. With DIBH, the heart is displaced inferior, medial, and posterior (ie, away from the left breast), and thus when the beams are shaped to exclude the heart, the amount of potential targets (ie, breast/chest-wall/IMN) that are underdosed is reduced. Thus, DIBH can improve the therapeutic ratio of RT, and enable cardiac sparing with lesser impacts on target coverage.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In two prospective trials, patients receiving RT with DIBH and conformal heart blocking were found to be without post-RT single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) cardiac perfusion abnormalities [<a href="#rid74">74,75</a>].

For example, a population-based Danish Breast Cancer Group analysis demonstrated that in patients treated for early breast cancer, among those treated using older (but modified/relatively modern) techniques (eg, without computed tomography [CT]-based planning, 1999-2007, but limited fraction size), the 10-year cardiac event risk in left- versus right-sided breast cancer was 1.4 (95% CI 1.1–1.9, thus demonstrating RT-associated risks); versus a 10-year event risk ratio in left- versus right-sided treatment of 0.90 (95% CI 0.7–1.2) in the most-modern era (eg, with CT-based planning, 2008-2016) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].
