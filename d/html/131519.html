         Tracheostomy is a procedure that creates an opening in the anterior wall of the trachea, through which a tracheostomy tube can be placed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tracheostomy can be performed as an open surgical procedure or percutaneously. An overview of the techniques involved and the intraoperative complications for both of these procedures is provided here. Indications, contraindications, non-intraoperative complications, and maintenance of tracheostomy are provided separately. (See

         Tracheostomy tubes are metal or nonmetal. Metal tracheostomy tubes, which are typically made of silver or stainless steel, are rarely used in the critical care setting as they do not have cuffs allowing for mechanical ventilation. For the purposes of this topic, we are mostly discussing nonmetal tracheostomy tubes, which are typically made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), silicone, or polyurethane.

         Nonmetal – Nonmetal tracheostomy tubes are cheaper than metal tubes. They are less rigid and more likely to conform to the airway shape; for example, PVC softens at body temperature, while silicone is naturally soft. Nonmetal tracheostomy tubes, unlike metal tracheostomy tubes, typically have an inflatable cuff and a universal adapter that attaches to ventilator tubing (typically a 15 mm connector). Sterilization is not necessary since they are generally replaced every six to eight weeks. Choosing the right one with the best fit is important for tolerance. (See
         <a class="local">

         Metal – Metal tubes are not used commonly since they are expensive, rigid, and do not have a cuff or a universal adapter that connects to a ventilator. Therefore, they cannot be used in patients who require positive pressure ventilation. Metal tracheostomy tubes are durable, more resistant to infection than nonmetal tracheostomy tubes, easy to clean, and can be repeatedly sterilized by autoclaving for reuse in the same patient. They may be suitable for life-long use in patients who have good pulmonary reserve and do not need ventilation (eg, following laryngectomy due to cancer or trauma).

         Tracheostomy tubes can have a single lumen (ie, single-cannula tracheostomy tube) or have an inner cannula (dual-cannula tracheostomy tube). The inner cannula is a narrower hollow cannula of the same length and shape as the tracheostomy itself and lies inside the main lumen of the tracheostomy tube (ie, a patent tube inside another patent tube  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef127992" href="/z/d/graphic/127992.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         )).
        </p>
        <p>
         The main advantage of an inner cannula is that it can be easily removed and cleaned regularly without removing the tracheostomy tube from its stoma, so the airway remains intact and stable.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is prudent that the clinician be familiar with the structure of an existing tracheostomy. For example, when tracheostomy tubes are used for mechanical ventilation, the inner cannula, due to its narrow lumen, can increase airway resistance and thereby increase the work of breathing. Thus, in many cases, the inner cannula can be removed during ventilation or bronchoscopy [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. However, sometimes the ventilator adapter is on the inner cannula, and the ventilator cannot be attached unless the inner cannula is in place, making passage of a bronchoscope a challenge (particularly a large therapeutic bronchoscope). (See

         The dimensions of tracheostomy tubes are measured in millimeters and include the following:

          Inner and outer diameter
         </strong>
         – For single-cannula tracheostomy tubes, the inner and outer diameter refer to the diameter of the tracheostomy tube at its smallest and widest dimensions, respectively  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef135097" href="/z/d/graphic/135097.html" rel="external">
          picture 3
         </a>
         ). The inner diameter roughly correlates with that used to describe the diameter of ETT. For example, a size 7 ETT approximates a size 7 tracheostomy tube and has an inner diameter of 7 mm.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For dual-lumen tracheostomy tubes, an inner and outer diameter is also provided for the inner cannula. It is important to note that although a tracheostomy tube may be listed as, for example, a size 7, the actual inner diameter may be smaller than 7 mm when the inner cannula is in place (eg, 6 mm). Further complicating matters, not all commercially available products adhere to these rules. Thus, it behooves the clinician to familiarize themselves with the measured diameters provided by manufacturers on the packaging and flange of the device.

         <strong>
          Length
         </strong>
         – This refers to the entire length of the tracheostomy tube from the adapter to the distal tip. Tracheostomy tube length varies to accommodate tracheas that are long or short in length (eg, 65 to 120 mm). Some tracheostomy tubes also have an adjustable flange for the purpose of lengthening or shortening the tube so that a good fit can be achieved.

         <strong>
          Shape
         </strong>
         – The shaft of tracheostomy tubes can be angled or curved  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef135099" href="/z/d/graphic/135099.html" rel="external">
          picture 4
         </a>
         ). Both are designed to accommodate the tract along which the tube lies; the initial portion of the tracheostomy tract is curved/angled, while the tracheal portion is straight. In angled tubes, the angle is generally acute, and the shaft is straight, while curved tubes are gently curved throughout. In theory, angled tubes may better conform to the shape of the tract, while curved tubes may increase the risk of posterior wall injury. While angled tracheostomy tubes are generally preferred, this selection is at the discretion of the surgeon or proceduralist.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         All dimensions can be found on the packaging and on the flange of the tracheostomy tube. Importantly, tubes of the same dimensions vary among manufacturers and may therefore look and feel differently to individual patients. This is particularly important for clinicians when exchanging a tracheostomy tube rather than during initial selection. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/131521.html" rel="external">

         ) and have an inflatable cuff, although variations exist. When mechanical ventilation is necessary via a tracheostomy tube, a nonfenestrated tracheostomy tube and an inflated cuff is mandatory to prevent air leak and ensure delivery of a set tidal volume or pressure.

         <strong>
          Fenestrations
         </strong>
         – Some tracheostomy tubes are fenestrated along their shaft. Fenestrations can be single or multiple and are located above the cuff. Fenestrated tracheostomy tubes are being used less frequently since they may be associated with granulation tissue formation, possibly due to turbulent flow through the fenestration onto the tracheal wall [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         While the cuff is inflated, fenestrations allow air to flow around the tracheostomy tube, thereby promoting respiration and phonation through the vocal cords and upper airway; by contrast, in a nonfenestrated tube, the cuff needs to be deflated for this to occur. This is more relevant for weaning and preparing for decannulation. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/131521.html" rel="external">
          "Tracheostomy: Postoperative care, maintenance, and complications in adults", section on 'Decannulation'

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Of note, an inner cannula will block fenestrations unless the inner cannula is also fenestrated. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Single cannula, dual cannula'

         <strong>
          Cuffs
         </strong>
         – While most tracheostomy tubes have an inflatable cuff, some do not. Similar to fenestrations, the absence of a cuff allows air to move around the tube, thereby facilitating phonation and respiration through the vocal cords. An inflated cuff, in theory, may help protect against aspiration of secretions, although this is an unproven benefit of cuffed tracheostomy tubes. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/131521.html" rel="external">

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         High-volume-low-pressure cuffs are typically used and are usually inflated with either sterile water or air. However, some cuffs are comprised of a "foam"-like material when inflated.

         Once the decision has been made to place a tracheostomy tube, an approach needs to be selected. For many years, surgical (open) tracheostomy was the only option. However, bedside percutaneous tracheostomy is being increasingly used since the late 1990s and has become a successful alternative to surgical tracheostomy in many patients [

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The rationale for this approach is that in the majority of percutaneous tracheostomies, the stoma is created caudal (ie, distal) to the tip of the endotracheal tube (ETT), resulting in derecruitment and ensuing hypoxemia. This is in contrast to a surgical tracheostomy, where the stoma is created cephalad (ie, proximal) to the cuff of the ETT such that derecruitment is unlikely to occur. A newer bronchoscopic approach for guidance during percutaneous tracheostomy to avoid derecruitment has also been described. (See

         Limited data suggest that percutaneous tracheostomy may be safely performed in patients taking antiplatelet therapy. Several retrospective studies of patients on single or dual antiplatelet therapy who underwent percutaneous tracheostomy reported no convincing increase in the rate of bleeding compared with patients who were not on antiplatelet therapy [

          17-19

        </p>
        <p>
         For initial selection in most patients, we use a standard commercially available, rather than a customized, tracheostomy tube. As examples:

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         For patients undergoing ventilator weaning with a view to decannulation, we generally select a size 6 to 8 nonfenestrated, cuffed tracheostomy tube.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         For patients with other indications including those who need airway access for secretion clearance and upper airway obstruction, a nonfenestrated, cuffed or cuffless tracheostomy tube is also appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Decisions then need to be made regarding the dimensions. A few examples of how a clinician might select an appropriate tube size are given below, but ultimately the tracheostomy tube can be easily changed at a later date to improve comfort and fit as the patients' needs evolve. (See

         <strong>
          Diameter
         </strong>
         – For adult patients who are underweight, young in age, or have a small body habitus, smaller tubes are generally selected (eg, a size 4 or 6 tracheostomy tube). For patients who may need bronchoscopy in the future (eg, obstructing tumors), a tracheostomy tube that can accommodate a diagnostic or therapeutic bronchoscope should be considered (eg, size 8). Males can generally also tolerate larger tubes compared with females since they have a larger airway diameter.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Appropriate diameter is important to maintain a good seal and minimize airway resistance and work of breathing. For example, when the inner diameter is too small, higher cuff pressures are generally needed to maintain a tight seal, thereby increasing the risk of tracheal injury and stenosis; in addition, airway resistance will be increased, thereby increasing the work of breathing, which may interfere with ventilator weaning. When the tracheostomy tube is too large in diameter, a fully inflated cuff will also result in increased tracheal wall pressure and therefore, increase the risk of stenosis. (See

          Length
         </strong>
         – Appropriate length is also important for comfort, fit, and final position of the tracheostomy tube within the tracheal lumen. Most tracheostomy tubes come as a "standard" length (eg, 60 to 65 mm targeted at 4 to 6 cm above the carina), although what is considered "standard" varies among manufacturers.

          29

Selecting a shorter tracheostomy tube could potentially lead to placement of the cuff in the stoma resulting in inadequate ventilation with air leak, high cuff pressures, and malposition of the distal opening of the tracheotomy; the latter can lead to formation of granulation tissue or to obstruction of the lumen by the posterior tracheal wall.

         Most tracheostomies should be placed between the second and third tracheal rings, provided it is feasible. Tracheostomy placement below this level increases the risk of innominate artery bleeding (which can be catastrophic), while placement above the first ring increases the risk of subglottic stenosis.

         If patients require heparin (eg, are receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) or direct oral anticoagulants, we ideally hold anticoagulation four hours pre- and two hours post-procedure. Communication with the ECMO and intensive care unit (ICU) teams is essential.

         Elective, open, surgical tracheostomy is most often performed under general anesthesia in the operating room (OR), although occasionally, it can be performed under local anesthesia (eg, submandibular space infections). The patient is supine with the neck extended by placing a small shoulder roll beneath the scapulae and the head supported by a small pillow. Details regarding patient preparation and anesthesia during tracheostomy are provided separately. (See

However, some surgeons still perform this maneuver, especially if the staff is unfamiliar with tracheostomy care. Regardless of the mechanism used to secure the tracheostomy, it should not be too tight or too loose (approximately one finger's width between suture/tie and the neck).

         All equipment (including ultrasound machine) should be confirmed to be available in the room. Percutaneous tracheostomy kits are commercially available. They usually contain a scalpel, introducer needle and syringe, guidewire, tracheal dilators (small dilator and single tapered dilator), protective sheath, and tracheal loading trocar  (

         ). Although many kits come with a loading mechanism for an included tracheostomy, any tracheostomy can be used. Most commercially available dilator kits employ a single tapered dilator that decreases procedure time and does not differ in the incidence of complications when compared with a multiple progressive dilator technique [

         Following a time-out for patient- and procedure-related identification, the patient is positioned supine with the neck extended by placing a small shoulder roll beneath the scapulae and the head supported by a small pillow. The patient should be monitored with telemetry continuously, blood pressure checked every two minutes, and an oximeter (preferably and audible device) in the contralateral upper extremity. Additionally, the bed should have all four bed rails down and headboard removed to ensure full access to the patient and equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
         The patient is sedated appropriately and the ventilator settings adjusted to provide audible alarms for high airway pressure and fraction of inspired oxygen at 1.0. Before a bronchoscopy adaptor is attached to the ETT, we typically suction with a closed-circuit system tubing.

         The tip of the bronchoscope is aligned with the caudal (ie, distal) tip of the ETT  (

         The bronchoscopist remains in the same position ("locked" position) at the ETT tip while providing full visualization of the tracheal lumen. The cuff of the ETT is deflated and the respiratory therapist along with the bronchoscopist slowly withdraw the ETT to the proximal end of the trachea (ie, the subglottic area  (

The surgeon/operator can palpate the subglottic area or use transillumination with the bronchoscopy light to facilitate the identification of this landmark. In patients who are very PEEP dependent, we typically pull the ETT back with the cuff inflated to avoid derecruitment.

         The tip of both the ETT and the bronchoscope provides a good field of view within the tracheal lumen, which avoids cuff disruption by the introducer needle. Avoidance of cuff disruption is critical in the event that a complication occurs necessitating rapid replacement of the ETT and resumption of mechanical ventilation. During local infiltration, the 25 gauge needle used can be visualized by the bronchoscope.

         Bronchoscopic – A newer bronchoscopic approach for guidance during percutaneous tracheostomy to avoid derecruitment has been described. In this technique, the existent ETT is advanced caudally (distally) into the trachea, and a bronchoscope is inserted parallel and external to the ETT, allowing full visualization of the anterior aspect of the proximal trachea, while keeping the ETT cuff fully inflated, thereby, avoiding loss of PEEP [

         Ultrasound – Percutaneous tracheotomy is less frequently performed under ultrasound guidance by interventional radiologists in the radiology suite. Ultrasound with a sterile cover for the probe is used to locate the landmarks and tracheal rings, and direct laryngoscopy is used to withdraw the ETT. Otherwise, the procedure is similar to that described above. (See

         Tracheostomy is considered a high-risk procedure for aerosolization. For patients who remain infectious at the time of the procedure, we prefer that tracheostomy be done at the bedside in an airborne isolation room with the minimum number of personnel present. All individuals should wear appropriate PPE. We typically use deep sedation or neuromuscular blockade (to minimize cough) and ensure that the tracheostomy tube has the syringe attached for immediate balloon inflation once inserted. In addition, adapters with inline suction catheters should be immediately attached after insertion. (See

         Bleeding is the most common intraoperative complication, especially when a bleeding diathesis is present. One study reported that bleeding complications could be predicted by a platelet count less than 50 x 10

         ]. Administration of prophylactic subcutaneous heparin did not increase the risk of bleeding.
        </p>
        <p>
         Bleeding may be less commonly encountered during percutaneous compared with surgical tracheostomy, since blood vessels are compressed during percutaneous tracheostomy rather than ligated or cauterized. Additional data describing the postoperative risk of bleeding are provided separately. (See

         Intraoperative bleeding may be minimized by the transfusion of blood products to correct a coagulopathy (eg, fresh frozen plasma, platelets), by paying careful attention to the anatomy  (

         Pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum can occur if the tracheostomy tube is placed into a false passage anterior to the trachea rather than the lumen of the trachea itself. Pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum can also occur if the guidewire punctures the posterior or lateral wall of the trachea during placement of a percutaneous tracheostomy.

         If suspected, a chest radiograph should be obtained and a chest tube placed, if indicated.

         Accidental extubation is a complication of both surgical and percutaneous tracheostomy, but it is more likely to occur with the percutaneous approach. During percutaneous tracheostomy, airway loss can occur when the patient is not adequately paralyzed and coughs during the procedure or when communication between the surgeon, respiratory therapist, and bronchoscopist is inadequate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loss of the airway is potentially catastrophic and can be minimized by adequate paralysis, good communication strategies among staff, and maintenance of cuff integrity in the event that ventilation needs to be resumed. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         If the airway is lost, a new one should be created either by reintubating the patient with a new ETT and/or completing the tracheostomy, whichever option is quicker. An advantage of using bronchoscopic guidance is that if the patient is accidentally extubated, the bronchoscope can be advanced and the ETT reinserted into the trachea over the bronchoscope.

         – Elective, open surgical tracheostomy is most often performed under general anesthesia in the operating room (OR), while percutaneous tracheostomy can be performed at the bedside or in the OR. Tracheostomy is an aerosol-generating procedure such that appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn for high-risk transmissible organisms. (See

         For surgical tracheostomy, a series of incisions and dissections are made until the trachea is exposed. Another incision is made between the second and third tracheal rings, through which a tracheostomy tube is inserted. (See

         In percutaneous tracheostomy, after a skin incision, pretracheal tissue is bluntly dissected to expose the trachea and under bronchoscopic guidance, the tracheostomy tube is placed using a Seldinger and a single progressive dilator technique. (See
