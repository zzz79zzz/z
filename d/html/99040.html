Normal wound healing is described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/112216.html" rel="external">"Risk factors for impaired wound healing and wound complications", section on 'Impaired wound healing'</a>.)</p><p>The precise timeline for complete epithelialization varies depending on numerous factors, including comorbidities (eg, diabetes, autoimmune disease, peripheral artery disease), increased body mass index, anatomic location, and medications. However, regardless of etiology, wound healing normally progresses at a sustained, measurable rate. Although there is no specific time frame that clearly differentiates an acute from a chronic wound, some suggest that the lack of approximately 15 percent reduction weekly or approximately 50 percent reduction of the surface area of the wound over a one-month period indicates a chronic state [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. </p><p>Examples of chronic wounds include nonhealing or infected surgical or traumatic wounds, venous ulcers, pressure ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, and ischemic ulcers. Chronic wounds related to malignancy require appropriate treatment of the malignancy, but in some cases, palliation may be all that can be offered [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. The clinical assessment and differentiation of these wounds is reviewed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15079.html" rel="external">"Clinical assessment of chronic wounds"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H45051304"><span class="h1">LOCAL CARE OF CHRONIC WOUNDS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Local treatment is directed toward reducing pain and itching, minimizing infection and bleeding from the wound, and dealing with the most troublesome chronic wound problems that affect the patient physically and emotionally, such as excess exudate that can lead to unpleasant odors. </p><p>As with acute wounds, local care of chronic wounds includes debridement and proper wound dressings. Frankly necrotic debris or nonviable tissue should be aggressively removed. Proper local care is an important element of preparing the wound bed to accept a skin graft or flap, or for closure, when indicated. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15912.html" rel="external">"Basic principles of wound management", section on 'Wound debridement'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15912.html" rel="external">"Basic principles of wound management", section on 'Wound dressings'</a> and <a class="local">'Wound bed preparation'</a> below.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H45051741"><span class="h2">Odor</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Wound odor can be controlled with interval mechanical debridement to decrease the microbial bioburden on the wound surface, with topical antimicrobial therapy (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9646" href="/d/drug information/9646.html" rel="external">metronidazole</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5-7</a>] and/or with odor-absorbing dressings such as those that have absorptive charcoal within the dressing (eg, Actisorb, Carboflex). Soaks of dilute <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9277" href="/d/drug information/9277.html" rel="external">acetic acid</a>, hypochlorous acid, or Dakin solution can also help to minimize odor. Long-term frequent use of potentially locally cytotoxic agents such as Dakin solution is not recommended.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H45052029"><span class="h2">Bleeding</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A nonadherent dressing can be placed directly on the friable wound to reduce bleeding and reduce pain associated with dressing changes. A second layer of alginate dressings that contain coagulants can also help to minimize bleeding  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef101893" href="/d/graphic/101893.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>Chronic wounds that are prone to oozing from the ulcer bed (eg, malignant wounds that cannot be excised) can be controlled with topical hemostatic agents or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9953" href="/d/drug information/9953.html" rel="external">sucralfate</a> [<a href="#rid8">8</a>] and gentle pressure in the form of elastic bandages, with focal points of bleeding managed with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9888" href="/d/drug information/9888.html" rel="external">silver nitrate</a>, handheld cautery, or local anesthetic with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a>. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15069.html" rel="external">"Overview of topical hemostatic agents and tissue adhesives"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6324.html" rel="external">"Subcutaneous infiltration of local anesthetics"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H45052036"><span class="h2">Pruritus</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Itching can be a complaint with chronic wounds. Itching and irritation are usually due to dry or wet skin or contact dermatitis. Keeping a proper moisture balance and the skin protected will help reduce itching and skin irritation, and, if necessary, topical corticosteroid creams can be applied. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13661.html" rel="external">"Irritant contact dermatitis in adults", section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H45052043"><span class="h2">Exudate</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An absorptive dressing should be placed over the nonadherent dressing to control drainage, reduce periwound maceration, and control the amount of exudate in the wound and should be tailored to the specific anatomic location and wound depth  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef101893" href="/d/graphic/101893.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). </p><p>Alternatively, wound drainage can be drawn away using a collecting device (eg, ostomy appliance, negative pressure wound therapy device), provided there are no contraindications. Topical exudate-absorbing topicals including cadexomer iodine and medicinal honey formulations may be helpful in removing scant to moderate exudate from the wound surface. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15912.html" rel="external">"Basic principles of wound management", section on 'Wound debridement'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15912.html" rel="external">"Basic principles of wound management", section on 'Wound dressings'</a> and <a class="local">'Negative pressure wound therapy'</a> below.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H45051780"><span class="h2">Pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pain associated with the wound, and specifically with dressing changes, should not be ignored. The World Health Organization analgesic ladder, which was developed for the treatment of cancer-related pain, is applicable to other types of chronic pain. For patients receiving stable doses of a long-acting opioid around the clock, supplemental doses of a short-acting agent should be considered prior to dressing changes, if they are painful. Topical or local anesthetics can be used but may have limited effect. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2814.html" rel="external">"Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2815.html" rel="external">"Cancer pain management: Role of adjuvant analgesics (coanalgesics)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83726.html" rel="external">"Management of acute pain in the patient chronically using opioids for non-cancer pain"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/126111.html" rel="external">"Approach to the management of chronic non-cancer pain in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H45051165"><span class="h1">SURGICAL APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In general, surgical intervention of chronic wounds, which may require multiple staged surgical procedures, is used to prepare the wound bed first by managing infection and handling any underlying factors contributing to wound chronicity (eg, bony deformities, foreign body, biomechanical instability), and then to subsequent coverage of the wound, which may require prior surgical revascularization. If these are successful in converting the chronic wound to an acute wound, provisional or definitive wound coverage can be performed. (See <a class="local">'Wound bed preparation'</a> below and <a class="local">'Wound coverage/closure'</a> below.)</p><p>Chronic wounds from cutaneous ulceration that occur in the setting of systemic disease states such as vasoocclusive, autoimmune, and inflammatory disorders (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, sickle cell disease, pyoderma gangrenosum, scleroderma) are difficult to treat and are often colonized with antibiotic-resistant bacteria [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Appropriate medical management of the underlying condition must be addressed prior to any planned definitive surgical procedure. As an example, pyoderma gangrenosum is a specific case of a chronic wound where surgical intervention is not typically indicated unless appropriate medical management has first been conducted. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13680.html" rel="external">"Approach to the differential diagnosis of leg ulcers"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83623.html" rel="external">"Pyoderma gangrenosum: Treatment and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p>Surgery has inherent risks associated with the procedure itself as well as anesthesia-related risks. Medical optimization is important to decrease the risk of intraoperative and postoperative complications. The risks and benefits of surgery should be assessed to determine if the surgical intervention is the best course of treatment. Chronic wounds associated with malignancy can often be approached surgically if there are no prohibitive comorbidities and doing so aligns with the patient's goals for care. Even with advanced systemic disease, surgical debridement of the wound is possible.</p><p>Some patients may be too sick or disabled to undergo repeated procedures, which are often necessary to achieve wound closure. For debilitated patients with chronic lower extremity ischemia or malignancy-related wounds on the lower extremity, primary amputation may be a more appropriate course of action. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16695.html" rel="external">"Lower extremity amputation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H45051884"><span class="h1">WOUND BED PREPARATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Wound bed preparation is defined as the process of removing local barriers to wound healing to maximize the potential for successful healing. This is accomplished primarily through debridement. Adjunctive methods to aid in preparing the chronic wound bed include negative pressure wound therapy and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which are discussed briefly below, and in more detail elsewhere. (See <a class="local">'Operative debridement'</a> below and <a class="local">'Adjunctive therapies'</a> below.)</p><p><strong>Cultures</strong> — Obtaining bacterial/fungal/acid fast bacilli cultures may be helpful if there are clinical signs of infection. A random culture will most likely yield a positive result in a chronic wound environment even though it may not be pathogenic [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. This may lead to unnecessary antibiotic treatment. In addition, biofilm cannot be detected through traditional agar culture methods. Other methods are necessary for biofilm detection such as 16S rDNA pyrosequencing [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The degree of impact of biofilm on chronic wounds has not been fully elucidated. If there is suspicion of infection (purulence, heavy drainage, clinical signs of infection in the surrounding tissue), a culture should be obtained. Cultures should be obtained from the deepest margins of the wound, and if possible, include tissue from the wound base. The bacterial flora may evolve to a more resistant bacterial phenotype over time. Thus, cultures should be obtained serially if warranted.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H450961"><span class="h2">Operative debridement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Debridement removes nonviable tissue, pathogens (biofilm), contaminants, and foreign (or other) material and also drains areas of infection. It is important that debridement includes the base of the wound as well as the wound perimeter. </p><p>Chronic wounds may require serial debridement in the operating room to sufficiently prepare the wound bed [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Clinic-based debridement often does not allow for sufficiently aggressive removal of nonviable tissue and biofilm due to inadequate pain control and the limited ability to achieve hemostasis. The operating room is a safer environment for the debridement of chronic wounds, which often require the management of deeper soft tissue and bone-related issues. In some cases, it is more appropriate to debride the wounds in the operating room, even if no definitive closure/coverage is planned, due to the degree of nonviable tissue/contamination/infection. </p><p>For chronic wounds that appear infected, wound/tissue cultures should be obtained during operative debridement to help direct antimicrobial therapy. If the etiology of the wound is unknown or the wound displays atypical characteristics, an excisional biopsy of the wound and/or wound perimeter should be also be obtained for histology. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1044338494"><span class="h2">Adjunctive therapies</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H450973"><span class="h3">Negative pressure wound therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), also called vacuum-assisted wound closure, refers to wound dressing systems that continuously or intermittently apply subatmospheric pressure to the surface of a wound. NPWT promotes the development of granulation tissue to cover deeper exposed tissues [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. NPWT is primarily used in situations where healing is expected. NPWT can also provide programmable intermittent fluid irrigation between operations [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Information regarding the mechanism of action and use of this device and contraindications (eg, malignancy in the wound) for its use is reviewed elsewhere. Innovations include NPWT with instillation (NPWTi). This therapy combines the benefits of traditional NPWT and irrigation. In the acute care setting, NPWTi can expedite wound bed preparation [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2881.html" rel="external">"Negative pressure wound therapy"</a>.)</p><p>NPWT may improve the healing of some types of chronic wounds/ulceration provided that they are well vascularized [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>]. Patients with extremity wounds and inadequate peripheral pulses should undergo noninvasive vascular testing to confirm adequate perfusion prior to instituting NPWT, especially patients with diabetes or other risk factors for peripheral artery disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8201.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive diagnosis of upper and lower extremity arterial disease"</a>.) </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Compared with conventional dressing changes, NPWT reduces time to closure of diabetic foot ulcers and wounds resulting from diabetic foot surgery. In this population of patients, NPWT is also associated with shorter length of hospitalization, decreased complication rates, and reduced costs. The use of NPWT in the management of diabetic foot lesions is discussed in detail separately. (See <a class="local">'Diabetic foot wounds'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Three randomized trials have evaluated the use of NPWT as an adjunctive therapy for the management of pressure (decubitus) ulcers [<a href="#rid16">16,19,20</a>]. No significant differences were identified with respect to quantitative wound healing measures (eg, wound surface area reduction). However, NPWT improved patient comfort and was less labor intensive [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>NPWT has been used instead of traditional bolstering methods to provide skin graft fixation [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. The NPWT dressing distributes negative pressure uniformly over the surface of the fresh graft, immobilizing the graft with less chance of shearing [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Improved qualitative skin graft take and quantitative improvements in skin graft success (eg, reduced number of repeat grafts) have been described in observational studies [<a href="#rid25">25-28</a>] and in two randomized trials [<a href="#rid29">29,30</a>]. In one of the trials, 60 patients were randomly assigned to conventional bolster dressing or NPWT following split-thickness skin graft [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. NPWT was associated with significant reduction in the loss of graft area (0 versus 4.5 cm<sup>2</sup> in the control group) and the median duration of hospitalization (13.5 versus 17 days).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The abdominal wall of patients undergoing exploration for severe abdominal trauma is frequently left open to facilitate second-look operations [<a href="#rid31">31,32</a>]. In this patient population, NPWT improves the success of both early and late (&gt;9 days) fascial closure. A general discussion of the management of the open abdomen is found elsewhere. (See <a class="local">'Abdominal wounds'</a> below.) </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H450979"><span class="h3">Hyperbaric oxygen therapy/topical oxygen therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been used as an adjunct to wound care in the treatment of chronic wounds [<a href="#rid33">33-39</a>]. HBOT has been shown to have in vitro effects on wound healing [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. HBOT may also aid wound bed preparation by increasing local tissue oxygen perfusion prior to the definitive surgical procedure, which may be particularly important for wounds that develop as a late effect of radiation therapy for the treatment of cancer [<a href="#rid33">33,41-43</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/326.html" rel="external">"Hyperbaric oxygen therapy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3365.html" rel="external">"Management of late complications of head and neck cancer and its treatment", section on 'Hyperbaric oxygen'</a>.)</p><p>Most studies of HBOT in chronic wounds are observational, and the few available trials are limited by small sample size and low quality [<a href="#rid44">44-46</a>]. Systematic reviews have concluded that, although hyperbaric oxygen may benefit some types of wounds (eg, postradiation therapy), there is insufficient evidence to support routine use [<a href="#rid47">47,48</a>]. </p><p>Although HBOT has been associated with more rapid ulcer healing in patients with diabetes, the indications for hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of nonhealing diabetic foot ulcers remain uncertain. Although a number of series and randomized trials of various sizes and quality have suggested its utility, later studies suggest that HBOT has no benefit for diabetic foot ulcer healing and limb salvage [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. HBOT for the management of diabetic foot ulceration is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a class="local">'Diabetic foot wounds'</a> below.)</p><p>Support for HBOT for venous or pressure ulcers, and wounds related to chronic ischemia due to peripheral artery disease, is lacking. (See <a class="local">'Venous stasis ulcers'</a> below and <a class="local">'Ischemic ulcers and gangrene'</a> below.)</p><p>There is increasing evidence to support the use of topical oxygen therapy [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. Topical oxygen therapy provides localized oxygen delivery directly to the wound bed and periwound surfaces. This option may be more acceptable to patients who are not candidates for HBOT or who find the frequency of HBOT cumbersome. To date there are no peer-reviewed studies directly comparing the outcomes of HBOT with topical oxygen therapy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H105660167"><span class="h1">WOUND COVERAGE/CLOSURE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surgical procedures that provide wound coverage/closure are briefly described below. It is important to address the underlying etiology prior to performing the definitive procedure. </p><p>If the wound is relatively small, it can be completely excised and closed primarily (sutures/staples) provided there is no to minimal skin tension. An understanding of appropriate tension and blood supply is paramount to allow for healing. In a previously infected wound, we avoid placing absorbable sutures deeply within the wound. In this situation, vertical mattress sutures may help bring the deep and superficial spaces together. </p><p>Larger or more complicated wounds may require graft or flap coverage. Procedures that provide coverage to the chronic wound are listed below and discussed in more detail in the linked topics. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Split-thickness skin graft – Split-thickness skin grafts (STSGs), also called partial-thickness grafts, are autologous epidermal/dermal grafts. Chronic wounds with a good bed of granulation tissue and without exposed tendon or bone are good candidates for skin grafting. STSGs may be complicated by secondary contracture and should be avoided in areas around joint surfaces. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15118.html" rel="external">"Skin autografting", section on 'Split-thickness skin grafting'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Full-thickness skin grafts – Full-thickness skin grafts (FTSGs) are autologous epidermal and full-thickness dermal grafts. These grafts have a decreased incidence of secondary contracture. FTSG is appropriate when a thicker autograft is necessary, such as for deeper wounds or in areas that require more durable tissue (eg, foot). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15118.html" rel="external">"Skin autografting", section on 'Full-thickness skin grafting'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Xenografts/allografts – If an autologous graft is not possible, a xenograft or allograft can be used. One strategy is to use a xenograft or allograft to build up a dermal tissue layer prior to STSG application. A xenograft or allograft will be replaced by the host tissue over time. There are a variety of xenografts/allografts that serve different purposes  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63852" href="/d/graphic/63852.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Porcine epidermis can be applied to the wound surface as a litmus test to ensure that adequate debridement was performed prior to the definitive closure/coverage procedure, or it can be used as a biologic dressing when there is low confidence in patient compliance. Other xenografts, including bovine collagen, can be used to cover deeper soft tissue defects to form a neodermis in preparation to receive a split-thickness skin graft. Allografts can be used for the same purpose. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Local tissue flaps – Local tissue rearrangement is useful in many circumstances when primary closure is not possible. These techniques involve recruitment of skin from surrounding areas and transposing it into the defect to allow for closure. Blood supply to the flap must be preserved. Common local tissue flaps include V-to-Y advancement, rotation flaps, and advancement flaps. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6670.html" rel="external">"Z-plasty"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/114188.html" rel="external">"Overview of flaps for soft tissue reconstruction", section on 'Skin'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pedicled flaps – Pedicled flaps are useful when muscle or fascia is needed to cover a large wound or deep wound that has exposed tendon or bone. The blood supply to the harvested muscle must be preserved, and the flap is rotated to cover the wound defect. Pedicled flaps include expendable muscles, such as the abductor hallucis muscle flap for coverage of medial foot or ankle defects, or the hemigastrocnemius muscle flap to cover knee defects. Another common flap is the soleus flap for coverage of mid-tibial defects. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15121.html" rel="external">"Surgical reconstruction of the lower extremity"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/114188.html" rel="external">"Overview of flaps for soft tissue reconstruction", section on 'Pedicled'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Free tissue transfers – Free tissue transfer is an important technique for closure of larger soft tissue defects that may not be amenable to pedicled or local advancement flaps. The muscle or fascia is harvested, with or without the overlying skin, along its vascular pedicle. The free flap is placed into the defect and the arterial and venous blood supply sutured to a local artery and vein nearby. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/114188.html" rel="external">"Overview of flaps for soft tissue reconstruction", section on 'Skin'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Once a wound is closed or covered, careful surveillance is needed. Recurrence of the wound at the same site or development of wounds at another location can occur after initial healing, especially in high-risk patients. As an example, diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy must be adequately protected with specialized accommodative inserts, shoes, and braces. Thus, it is important to address as the initial reason for the chronic wound.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H45051273"><span class="h1">SPECIFIC WOUND MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Management of specific chronic wounds is briefly discussed below. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H105660173"><span class="h2">Diabetic foot wounds</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diabetic foot ulcer is<strong> </strong>a unique category of chronic wound that requires multiple considerations  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef103017" href="/d/graphic/103017.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).

For patients who require operative debridement, or incision and drainage for infection, initial empiric antibiotic therapy is transitioned to more specific treatment based upon the results and sensitivities of intraoperative cultures. Prolonged antibiotic therapy may be needed, particularly for the treatment of osteomyelitis [<a href="#rid52">52</a>]. Further, specific therapy, such as negative pressure wound therapy, should be considered before surgery and in between surgical debridements [<a href="#rid53">53-55</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8175.html" rel="external">"Management of diabetic foot ulcers", section on 'Managing infection'</a>.)</p><p>Special attention should also be given to identifying and correcting any underlying bony deformities or biomechanical instability causing areas of focal pressure or shear stress as the source of delayed wound healing. Correction may require adjunctive surgery (eg, Achilles tendon lengthening to offload the plantar forefoot, free or pedicled flap to provide tissue durability) or more complex bony reconstruction/realignment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8175.html" rel="external">"Management of diabetic foot ulcers", section on 'Mechanical offloading'</a>.)</p><p>The weightbearing nature of the foot increases the risk for wound recurrence after closure/coverage, particularly when a skin graft is used, since these are insensate.

The dressing choice depends upon the level of anticipated drainage and the size of the wound. Dead space is usually managed with gauze packing. The extremity should be revascularized as soon as safely possible, if needed, after drainage/debridement and control of the infection. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with dry gangrene without cellulitis  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101202" href="/d/graphic/101202.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>), the limb should be revascularized first. The wound dressing is protective, reducing the risk for trauma or infection. The wound should be lightly wrapped with a bulky dry gauze bandage, avoiding excess pressure that could aggravate ischemia.

Thus, removal of affected materials will be necessary for definitive closure. Bone infection requires resection of the infected segment, long-term antibiotics, and/or use of antibiotic-impregnated cement. The skeletal framework must be addressed to provide stability of the overlying soft tissue envelope. Treatment of chronic or subacute osteomyelitis can occur over many months with standard antibiotic treatment regimens lasting typically six weeks, following a period of time off antibiotics, at which time bone culture is repeated. If the repeat culture or aspirate is negative, definitive soft tissue closure/coverage can proceed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7668.html" rel="external">"Nonvertebral osteomyelitis in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>Total joint implants pose a difficult problem. Expeditious soft tissue coverage or closure over noninfected joint implants or internal fixation is important. Infected internal fixation constructs and joint implants may require removal with subsequent reimplantation once the infection is resolved.
