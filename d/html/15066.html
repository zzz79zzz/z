         Esophageal perforation is a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge because of the rarity of the condition and the variability in presentation. Surgical management is primarily based upon small retrospective studies and expert opinion.

         The following basic principles are applied to the management of a patient with an esophageal perforation:

         </span>
         The esophagus has three anatomical points of narrowing: the cricopharyngeus muscle, the broncho-aortic constriction, and the esophagogastric junction  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54206" href="/z/d/graphic/54206.html" rel="external">
          figure 1

         ) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Perforation may occur anywhere along the esophagus, but there is a predilection for rupture at these key anatomic areas. As an example, iatrogenic injuries to the cervical esophagus can occur during endoscopy at Killian's triangle  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75732" href="/z/d/graphic/75732.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ), an area lacking a posterior esophageal muscularis and bordered by the horizontal cricopharyngeus muscle inferiorly and the oblique inferior constrictor muscles superiorly.

         Increased intraluminal pressure at the anatomic sites of narrowing, as well as sites narrowed by a malignancy, foreign body, or physiologic dysfunction, can lead to rupture of the esophagus  (

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         More than one-half of all esophageal perforations are iatrogenic, and most of these occur during endoscopy [

         </span>
         The major principles of the primary and immediate management of an esophageal perforation include prompt diagnosis, stabilization of the patient, and assessment for operative or nonoperative management. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Primary surgical repair'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="local">
          'Alternatives to primary surgical repair'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Regardless of etiology, an esophageal perforation is a surgical emergency [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]. Leakage of esophageal and gastric contents into the mediastinum creates a necrotizing inflammatory process that can lead to sepsis, multiorgan failure, and death [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. The near doubling of overall mortality from 14 to 27 percent with a delay in diagnosis greater than 24 hours after perforation emphasizes the importance of a prompt diagnosis and treatment  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82453" href="/z/d/graphic/82453.html" rel="external">
          figure 3
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The diagnostic studies performed to confirm the clinical suspicion of esophageal perforation are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2260.html" rel="external">
          "Boerhaave syndrome: Effort rupture of the esophagus", section on 'Diagnosis'
         </a>
         and
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2275.html" rel="external">
          "Complications of endoscopic esophageal stricture dilation", section on 'Diagnosis'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The rarity of the diagnosis and the variability in clinical presentation often lead to diagnostic treatment delays. This is especially true of spontaneous perforation where the clinical suspicion is low. This often leads to the evaluation of more common medical conditions such as myocardial infarction, pneumonia, and peptic ulcer disease. (See

         Following confirmation of the diagnosis and stabilization of the patient, the clinician must decide if the patient should undergo operative or nonoperative management. (See

         Primary repair of the perforation site is the optimal procedure, even if the diagnosis is delayed more than 24 hours. The exceptions to performing a primary repair include a cervical perforation that cannot be accessed but can be drained, diffuse mediastinal necrosis, a perforation too large for the esophagus to be reapproximated, an esophageal malignancy, preexisting end-stage benign esophageal disease (eg, achalasia), or if the patient is clinically unstable [

         The following general principles are used to perform a repair of a perforation of the cervical, thoracic, or abdominal esophagus  (

         First, devitalized tissue is debrided from the perforation site.

         </span>
         Second, the muscular layer is incised longitudinally along the muscle fibers superior and inferior to the perforation to expose the entire extent of the mucosal injury. Failure to visualize the proximal and distal extent of the mucosal disruption is the most common reason for a persistent leak.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Third, the mucosa is closed with absorbable interrupted sutures and the muscularis layer is closed with interrupted nonabsorbable sutures. Narrowing of the esophageal lumen should be avoided using precise reapproximation.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         When there has been a delay in diagnosis greater than 24 hours and/or substantial extraluminal contamination from the leakage of fluid and debris has occurred, the integrity of the repair can be enhanced with the use of a vascularized pedicle flap. The most common flap used is the intercostal muscle flap  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54219" href="/z/d/graphic/54219.html" rel="external">
          figure 5

          figure 6

         ). Other options for a flap include serratus muscle, latissimus dorsi muscle, diaphragm, parietal pleura, omentum, and gastric fundus.
        </p>
        <p>
         If the gastric fundus is used to buttress a lower esophageal repair, the gastroesophageal junction should be placed in the normal intra-abdominal location to avoid severe and debilitating gastroesophageal reflux. A Dor fundoplication (partial anterior wrap) is an excellent alternative for an intra-abdominal perforation.

         ]. A primary repair of a cervical perforation is performed if the perforation can be clearly visualized and there is no distal obstruction. Otherwise, drainage of the perforation is adequate to control the leak since the anatomic structures of the neck typically confine extraluminal contamination to a limited space and thereby enhance spontaneous healing  (

         The surgical approach to control a perforation in the cervical esophagus begins with an incision in the left neck along the lower third of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle  (

         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. The surgical dissection proceeds with identification of the anatomic structures such as the carotid sheath, trachea, spine, and recurrent laryngeal nerve, which should be preserved. Soft retractors, including the fingers of the surgeon and first assistant, are used to retract the esophagus and trachea in order to avoid recurrent laryngeal nerve injury.

         Blunt dissection should be carried into the mediastinum posterior to the esophagus and anterior to the prevertebral fascia to assure adequate drainage of the infection. The perforation should be primarily repaired when clearly visualized, as described above. However, if the perforation is not clearly visualized, then the perforation site is drained. (See

         The wound is irrigated, widely drained with Jackson-Pratt drains that are brought out through the bottom of the incision or through a separate dependent site, and loosely closed in layers with interrupted absorbable sutures. Alternatively, when heavy contamination is present, the wound may be left open and packed with wet-to-dry dressings or a wound vac (see

         A thorough knowledge of the relationship of the esophagus to the adjacent vital structures is necessary when planning the surgical approach to a thoracic perforation  (

         ). The level of the perforation of the thoracic esophagus determines the surgical approach to controlling the leak and repairing the perforation. As an example, a mid-esophageal perforation is approached through a right thoracotomy at the sixth or seventh intercostal space while a distal esophageal perforation is approached through a left thoracotomy at the seventh or eighth intercostal space  (

          figure 16

         Several approaches have been described for cases when a primary repair is technically not feasible, the patient is hemodynamically unstable, or the perforation is diagnosed immediately after an intervention. As an example, severe mediastinitis associated with extraesophageal tissue friability and necrosis from a delay in diagnosis can preclude a primary repair [
         <a href="#rid2">

         Endoscopic covered stent placement has been described as an alternative procedure to primary repair; however, there are no patient selection guidelines. For patients with a distal malignancy or achalasia, an esophagectomy may be warranted. Nonoperative management may be suitable for selected patients. (See

         Surgical drainage as the sole operative management is reserved for perforations of the cervical esophagus when the perforation site cannot be completely visualized and when there is no distal obstruction. Drainage alone is contraindicated in the management of a perforation of the thoracic or intra-abdominal esophagus because of uncontrolled leakage and contamination of adjacent spaces (ie, pleura, peritoneum).

         For patients with clinical evidence of mediastinal sepsis, significant comorbid illness, and large thoracic esophageal perforations, the author utilizes a hybrid technique that includes aggressive debridement, drainage, muscle flap coverage of the defect, and endoscopic stent placement (see
         <a class="local">
          'Endoscopic stent placement'
         </a>
         below). The goal of this approach is to reconstruct the esophageal lumen and control the leakage and septic contamination of adjacent tissues in patients unlikely to tolerate a second operative procedure to reestablish continuity of the esophagus. Alternatively, a T-tube may be inserted into the perforation to create a controlled fistula when a patient cannot tolerate more extensive surgery [

         A thoracotomy is typically performed to mobilize and resect the esophagus and debride and drain the mediastinum. Alternatively, for an intra-abdominal perforation, the thoracic esophagus may be bluntly dissected. A laparotomy is performed to insert a gastrostomy tube, a jejunostomy feeding tube, and to suture closed the diaphragmatic hiatus to prevent subsequent hiatal hernia formation.
        </p>
        <p>
         For the patient who is hemodynamically unstable and critically ill, a diversion without an esophageal resection is performed. The perforation site must be adequately drained to control esophageal contamination. A cervical esophagostomy is constructed and the distal esophagus divided at the diaphragmatic hiatus to exclude the site of perforation  (

         Stents may be appropriate for patients with extensive comorbidities, advanced mediastinal sepsis, or large esophageal defects, or for a patient's inability to tolerate more extensive surgery. Stents should be placed only by an experienced clinician, and decisions regarding stenting should be made by a multidisciplinary team including an experienced gastroenterologist and thoracic surgeon. Guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology support the use of stents in carefully selected patients, albeit "based on weak evidence" [

         Precise stent placement can restore luminal integrity and prevent further extraluminal soilage. However, control and drainage of the extraluminal contamination must be achieved for this approach to effectively manage the esophageal perforation.

         If a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement is considered in conjunction with stent placement for enteral access, it should be placed with minimal insufflation prior to stenting the perforation. Otherwise, stent migration can occur as the PEG tube is drawn through the stent lumen. Alternatively, a push technique utilizing T-fasteners can be utilized, thus avoiding drawing the end of the PEG tube through the area of injury.

         Stent positioning in the distal esophagus can be challenging as the distal flare of the covered stent is placed in the lumen of the stomach. This gastric position decreases the ability of the stent to anchor by radial tension and results in frequent migration. However, it is critical that the distal end of the stent be placed in this location to completely cover and control the distal esophageal perforation.

         Endoscopic clipping is generally best suited for iatrogenic injuries with minimal extraluminal contamination. Failure to control extraluminal contamination will result in a significant risk of fistulization. Postprocedure management would be similar to stent management and include a course of intravenous antibiotics with duration determined by extent of contamination, a period of gastrointestinal rest based on confidence with defect closure, and subsequent contrast esophagography prior to resuming oral intake. The technique of endoscopic clipping for perforation is further discussed elsewhere. (See

         For patients who have maintained an adequate nutritional status and do not have a dilated, tortuous thoracic esophagus (sigmoid esophagus), primary repair of the perforation site and a myotomy on the contralateral side of the esophagus with a fundoplication can be performed. Many surgeons perform a partial fundoplication procedure to prevent reflux as well as to buttress the repair. The edges of the fundoplication are sewn to the edge of the myotomy, and the stomach covers the repair. (See

         The role of nonoperative management has evolved rapidly in the past several decades, likely due to the increasing incidence of iatrogenic injuries, which are often diagnosed more quickly and are associated with less extraluminal contamination. Essential to nonoperative management is careful patient selection; appropriate patient selection can achieve 100 percent survival rates [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36-38
         </a>
         ]. This requires clinicians experienced in the care of esophageal pathology, careful patient monitoring, and early involvement of the appropriate surgical team.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cervical perforation is most commonly considered for nonoperative management due to the anatomic confinement of the esophagus by surrounding surgical structures. Perforation into the pleural or peritoneal cavity is a relative contraindication to nonoperative management due to the difficulties of controlling spillage of contaminated contents in large, free spaces.
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence-based criteria for patient selection for nonoperative management and the medical management of an esophageal perforation are discussed separately. (See

         The author utilizes nonoperative management in patients diagnosed early in settings where there is evidence of contained perforations and limited extraluminal soilage. Patients are maintained on intravenous fluids, nil per os (NPO), and broad-spectrum antibiotics for five to seven days. As long as patients remain clinically stable, contrast esophagography is performed at five to seven days, and resumption of oral intake under observation is considered depending on the results. We generally do not utilize

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Esophageal perforation is a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge because of the rarity of the condition and the variability in presentation.
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Prompt diagnosis and management is critical to minimizing mortality. A delay of greater than 24 hours in diagnosis and treatment of an esophageal perforation is associated with a higher mortality rate compared with an early diagnosis and treatment initiation (27 versus 14 percent). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Initial management'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>

         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         The mortality rate following operative management of an esophageal perforation is dependent on location of the perforation, with cervical perforations having the lowest mortality rate (6 percent) compared with thoracic perforations (27 to 34 percent) and intra-abdominal perforations (21 to 29 percent). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Outcomes following operative management'
         </a>
         above.)

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         A primary repair is the gold standard of care and should be utilized for perforations of the thoracic and abdominal esophagus, as well as for visualized perforations of the cervical esophagus. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Primary surgical repair'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Drainage alone should only be performed for perforation of the cervical esophagus when the perforation cannot be visualized and when there is no distal obstruction. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Drainage only'
         </a>
         above.)

         <span class="glyph">

         Diversion is appropriate when patients are clinically unstable and cannot tolerate a more extensive operative procedure, when patients have preexisting esophageal diseases that preclude repair, or when extensive esophageal damage precludes a primary repair. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diversion'

         Esophageal stents may be used to treat esophageal perforation in patients with extensive comorbidities, advanced mediastinal sepsis, or large esophageal defects, and in patients who cannot tolerate more extensive surgery (see
         <a class="local">
          'Endoscopic stent placement'
         </a>
         above). The stent should be placed by a clinician experienced with this procedure.

         </span>
         Endoscopic clipping may be used to treat small esophageal perforations with healthy, compliant surrounding mucosa that can be approximated with minimal tension and minimal extraluminal contamination. Following endoscopic clipping, epithelialization associated with chronic fistulas requires ablation, and foreign material at the site of the fistula must be removed. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Endoscopic clipping'
         </a>
         above.)

         Esophagectomy should be performed when the patient presents with malignancy, extensive esophageal damage that precludes repair, or end-stage benign esophageal disease. The patient must be hemodynamically stable and have minimal extraluminal contamination; otherwise, diversion is likely a more prudent option. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Esophagectomy'
         </a>
         above.)

         Nonoperative management should be reserved for clinically stable patients with no evidence of systemic inflammation, expediently diagnosed perforations, and no drainage of any collection into the pleura or peritoneum. (See
