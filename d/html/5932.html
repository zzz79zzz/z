Anemia is caused by one of three broad mechanisms: decreased production of red blood cells (RBCs), increased loss of RBCs, or premature destruction (hemolysis) of RBCs. A combination of these mechanisms can occur simultaneously in some conditions.</p><p>The approach to a child with hemolytic anemia is discussed here. A broader approach to the anemic child is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5927.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with anemia"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H178863723"><span class="h1">THE HEMOLYTIC PROCESS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>After release from the bone marrow, mature, non-nucleated erythrocytes (red blood cells [RBCs]) generally survive for 100 to 120 days in the circulation [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In the steady state, approximately 1 percent of the circulating erythrocytes are destroyed daily and are replaced by an equal number of new erythrocytes (reticulocytes) released from the bone marrow  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67042" href="/z/d/graphic/67042.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74294" href="/z/d/graphic/74294.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>). The basic pathophysiology of the hemolytic anemias is a reduced erythrocyte lifespan due to premature destruction, ranging from nearly normal to remarkably shortened. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7082.html" rel="external">"Red blood cell survival: Normal values and measurement"</a>.)</p><p>In compensation for reduced RBC lifespan, the bone marrow increases production of erythrocytes, a response mediated by increased erythropoietin. As an example, in adults with hereditary spherocytosis (HS), the bone marrow can increase output of erythrocytes six- to eightfold. With this maximal erythropoietic response, affected patients may not manifest anemia despite the substantially reduced RBC lifespan (fully compensated hemolysis). The limits of erythrocyte production in other hemolytic states have not been determined, particularly in infants and children, but they are probably lower in infants than in adults. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7161.html" rel="external">"Regulation of erythropoiesis"</a>.)</p><p>As a result of increased RBC production in response to hemolysis, the reticulocyte count often exceeds 2 percent, with an absolute reticulocyte count usually &gt;100,000/microL [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. When a chronic hemolytic process is present, hyperplasia of the erythropoietic marrow elements often occurs, with reversal of the myeloid-to-erythroid ratio from the normal 3:1 to 1:1 or less  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51478" href="/z/d/graphic/51478.html" rel="external">picture 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75057" href="/z/d/graphic/75057.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>). In the severe chronic hemolytic processes of childhood (eg, thalassemia major, congenital spherocytosis, sickle cell disease [SCD]), hypertrophy of the marrow may expand the medullary spaces, producing bony changes, particularly in the skull (ie, frontal bossing) and hands [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7119.html" rel="external">"Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease", section on 'Skeletal complications'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7076.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of hemolytic anemia in adults", section on 'High reticulocyte count'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7116.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of thalassemia (adults and children)", section on 'Skeletal changes'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSTIC PRINCIPLES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2477333775"><span class="h2">Overview</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A hemolytic process can be detected by the presence of increased levels of the metabolic products of hemolysis, including indirect bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and plasma free hemoglobin. In older children, a reduced haptoglobin level provides evidence of hemolysis; however, this is not a reliable marker in children &lt;18 months. In addition, a hemolytic process may be inferred, in a nonbleeding patient, by the presence of reticulocytosis. However, reticulocytosis also occurs in some nonhemolytic conditions such as the recovery phase after an aplastic event (eg, parvovirus infection or transient erythroblastopenia of childhood) or in a child with anemia caused by iron or vitamin B12 deficiency who is responding to treatment. The degree of hemolysis can also be measured directly via isotopic or non-isotopic erythrocyte survival studies; however, these tests are generally not necessary in clinical practice. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic approach'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7082.html" rel="external">"Red blood cell survival: Normal values and measurement"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Classification</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The hemolytic disorders are generally classified as either intrinsic abnormalities of the erythrocyte or extrinsic processes acting on a normal erythrocyte  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64454" href="/z/d/graphic/64454.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). These two categories are not mutually exclusive, and some hemolytic disorders are caused by a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms (eg, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [PNH]):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intrinsic</strong> hemolytic anemias generally result from inherited or congenital hemoglobinopathies (eg, sickle cell disease [SCD], thalassemia), erythrocyte membrane defects (hereditary spherocytosis [HS], elliptocytosis, pyropoikilocytosis, or stomatocytosis) or enzyme deficiencies (eg, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD], pyruvate kinase [PK]). (See <a class="local">'Intrinsic hemolytic anemias'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Extrinsic</strong> hemolytic anemias are typically acquired and result from forces or agents that immunologically, chemically, or physically damage the erythrocyte. These include autoimmune hemolytic anemias (AIHAs), hypersplenism, thrombotic microangiopathies, and many drugs including oxidant agents such as <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13205" href="/z/d/drug information/13205.html" rel="external">dapsone</a> and nitrites.

Thus, patients are often relatively asymptomatic despite significant anemia.</p><p>In contrast, acute hemolytic anemia, as may occur in the setting of infection or in AIHA, can cause significant symptoms despite relatively mild anemia, due to the abruptness of the drop in hemoglobin.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">INTRINSIC HEMOLYTIC ANEMIAS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Intrinsic hemolytic anemias include hemoglobinopathies, erythrocyte membrane defects, and enzyme deficiencies.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25094836"><span class="h2">Hemoglobinopathies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hemoglobinopathies are common causes of hemolytic disease and include sickle cell disease (SCD), the thalassemias, and unstable hemoglobins:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>SCD</strong> – SCD refers to any one of the syndromes in which the sickle mutation in the beta globin gene is coinherited with a mutation at the other beta globin allele that reduces or eliminates normal beta globin production. These include sickle cell anemia (homozygous hemoglobin S mutation), the sickle-beta thalassemias, hemoglobin SC disease, and others. In the United States, most children with SCD are diagnosed through newborn screening. The clinical manifestations of SCD are protean. The major features are related to hemolytic anemia, inflammation, and vaso-occlusion, which can lead to acute and chronic pain as well as tissue ischemia or infarction. Splenic infarction generally leads to functional hyposplenism early in life, which, in turn, increases the risk of infection. These complications have a major impact on morbidity and mortality. SCD is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7119.html" rel="external">"Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>The thalassemias</strong> – The thalassemias are a group of disorders characterized by reduced or absent production of one or more globin chains, resulting in disruption of the tightly regulated ratio of alpha and beta globin chains. The thalassemia syndromes are remarkable for their heterogeneity, particularly in terms of clinical severity. Beta thalassemia major is a severe form of thalassemia due to homozygous mutations associated with absent (or very severely reduced) production of beta chains. The diagnosis is usually made through newborn screening or at around 6 to 12 months of age due to the presence of pallor, irritability, growth retardation, abdominal swelling due to hepatosplenomegaly, and jaundice. The laboratory examination shows severe hemolytic anemia with markedly abnormal hypochromic, microcytic red cells  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76666" href="/z/d/graphic/76666.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>). The diagnosis is generally confirmed on hemoglobin analysis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef115337" href="/z/d/graphic/115337.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), though DNA testing may be necessary for confirmation of the exact type in certain situations. The thalassemias are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7116.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of thalassemia (adults and children)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Unstable hemoglobins</strong> – Unstable hemoglobin variants are rare inherited mutations affecting globin genes. Examples include hemoglobin Hasharon and hemoglobin Poole. Denaturation of hemoglobin leads to precipitation in the red blood cell (RBC), which causes Heinz body formation and both intravascular and extravascular hemolysis  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73790" href="/z/d/graphic/73790.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>). Although some can be identified in the newborn screen, most patients present in childhood or adolescence with varying degrees of hemolytic anemia and other manifestations of hemolysis such as jaundice, gallstones, splenomegaly, and/or hemoglobinuria. Initial testing includes routine laboratory studies for hemolytic anemia, review of the peripheral blood smear, and Heinz body preparation. Hemoglobin analysis may identify an unstable hemoglobin, but some variants are too unstable to be detected by this method. Genetic testing is the most definitive means of establishing the diagnosis and characterizing the variant. Unstable hemoglobin variants are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7086.html" rel="external">"Unstable hemoglobin variants"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1713996614"><span class="h2">Erythrocyte membrane defects</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Membrane defects include hereditary spherocytosis (HS), elliptocytosis, and other less common disorders:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>HS</strong> – HS is the most common erythrocyte membrane defect. It presents with hemolytic anemia of variable severity and spherical erythrocytes (spherocytes) on the blood smear  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70611" href="/z/d/graphic/70611.html" rel="external">picture 7</a>). HS results from heterogeneous alterations in one of six genes (most often the ankyrin gene) that encode for proteins involved in vertical associations that tie the membrane skeleton to the lipid bilayer. HS can present at any age and with any severity. Most affected individuals have mild or moderate hemolytic anemia. Neonates with HS often present with jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia; the serum bilirubin level may not peak until several days after birth. In older children and adults, the presentation may be that of an incidental finding of hemolytic anemia or spherocytes on the blood smear  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70611" href="/z/d/graphic/70611.html" rel="external">picture 7</a>) or the individual may be symptomatic from anemia, splenomegaly, or pigment gallstones. Exacerbations of anemia may occur in certain settings such as parvovirus infection, mononucleosis, or pregnancy. The diagnosis of HS requires specialized confirmatory testing. Management is generally supportive. Splenectomy may be performed in severely affected patients. The diagnosis and management of HS are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7079.html" rel="external">"Hereditary spherocytosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hereditary elliptocytosis (HE)</strong> – HE (also called hereditary ovalocytosis) is a heterogeneous group of inherited erythrocyte disorders, most of which are autosomal dominant, that have in common the presence of elongated, oval, or elliptically shaped RBCs on the peripheral blood smear  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63129" href="/z/d/graphic/63129.html" rel="external">picture 8</a>). The morphology of the erythrocytes is the most important diagnostic feature of HE. Hemolytic anemia in these disorders ranges from absent to life-threatening. The most severe form of HE is hereditary pyropoikilocytosis. HE is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7087.html" rel="external">"Hereditary elliptocytosis and related disorders"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hereditary stomatocytosis and hereditary xerocytosis</strong> – Hereditary stomatocytosis and hereditary xerocytosis are rare inherited disorders with altered RBC volume caused by mutations affecting ion channels. Patients may be completely asymptomatic or they can present with chronic hemolytic anemia of varying severity. Hereditary stomatocytosis is associated with stomatocytes on the peripheral blood smear  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75535" href="/z/d/graphic/75535.html" rel="external">picture 9</a>), and hereditary xerocytosis is associated with xerocytes and eccentrocytes  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62761" href="/z/d/graphic/62761.html" rel="external">picture 10</a>). Splenectomy in patients with these disorders has been associated with severe complications (eg, pulmonary hypertension and thromboembolic events), and it is therefore reserved as a last resort for patients with severe hemolysis and other complications. Hereditary stomatocytosis and hereditary xerocytosis are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7068.html" rel="external">"Hereditary stomatocytosis (HSt) and hereditary xerocytosis (HX)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18"><span class="h2">Enzyme deficiencies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hemolytic anemias caused by inherited enzyme deficiencies include those in the hexose monophosphate shunt and glutathione pathways (eg, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD], glutathione synthase) and those in the glycolytic pathway (eg, pyruvate kinase [PK], hexokinase, glucose phosphate isomerase, and others). Most are inherited as autosomal recessive disorders. With the exception of G6PD deficiency, these are rare disorders. Inherited enzyme deficiencies are reviewed briefly here, and more detail is provided in linked topic reviews.</p><p>This group of congenital hemolytic anemias are classified as "nonspherocytic" because spherocytic erythrocytes are generally absent from the peripheral blood smear. A diagnosis is established by demonstrating reduction of the enzyme as well as decreased levels of glycolytic metabolites downstream of the deficient enzyme. However, testing can be challenging in the setting of acute hemolysis due to the higher enzyme levels of surviving erythrocytes. Deficiencies of glycolytic enzymes compromise adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation. The metabolic energy requirements of the erythrocytes cannot be met, and the erythrocyte lifespan is shortened. Deficiencies of the enzymes in the glutathione pathway result in inadequate levels of glutathione in erythrocytes, which impair the ability to handle oxidant stress. In this setting, hemoglobin becomes denatured and precipitates into erythrocyte inclusions called Heinz bodies  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73790" href="/z/d/graphic/73790.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>). These bodies damage the erythrocyte membrane, resulting in acute intravascular and extravascular hemolysis [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>G6PD deficiency</strong> – G6PD deficiency is the most common erythrocyte enzyme disorder, affecting &gt;400 million people worldwide. G6PD deficiency is an X-linked inherited condition that can result in a spectrum of clinical severity:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Class II and III variants are quite common and typically mild. These variants lack chronic anemia and reticulocytosis but can lead to <strong>acute</strong> hemolytic episodes induced by infection or certain drugs  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74254" href="/z/d/graphic/74254.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Class I variants are rare and result in a severe chronic, nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia with acute worsening after exposure to oxidant stress.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Clinical manifestations of G6PD deficiency depend upon the severity of the deficiency as well as the inciting event. G6PD deficiency is diagnosed by detection of decreased enzyme activity in red cells. A number of screening tests are available for this purpose; however, false-negative results can occur during or immediately following an episode of hemolysis and, therefore, retesting at a later date is advised if clinical suspicion persists. "Bite cells" and Heinz bodies  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73790" href="/z/d/graphic/73790.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>) may be seen after an acute episode of hemolysis. Transfusion may be necessary in cases of severe hemolysis and symptomatic anemia. There is no specific treatment for subjects with class I variants who have chronic hemolysis. Avoidance of known triggers including oxidant agents is an important aspect of management. G6PD deficiency is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7111.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis and management of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7109.html" rel="external">"Genetics and pathophysiology of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>PK deficiency</strong> – An inherited deficiency of PK is the most common of the erythrocyte glycolytic enzyme deficiencies [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. PK activity, measured in the erythrocytes, is reduced markedly, but the enzyme activity in other blood cells and tissues is normal. The severity of hemolysis is highly variable, ranging from a life-threatening, transfusion-dependent hemolytic anemia to a fully compensated hemolytic process [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Laboratory tests are consistent with the presence of extravascular hemolysis with a brisk reticulocyte response. Demonstration of reduced erythrocyte PK enzyme activity and/or genetic testing for two relevant <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.omim.org%2Fentry%2F609712&amp;token=G%2BkOOgscg7PQzd0gXq5S90woi3v7XcjNOWY5%2BbSTAWLxvG3XGFHYMS%2B4YVwlYsxk&amp;TOPIC_ID=5932" target="_blank">PKLR</a> gene mutations is required for making a specific diagnosis. Treatment of PK deficiency depends upon the time when the disorder becomes evident. Phototherapy and/or exchange transfusion may be needed for severe hyperbilirubinemia during the neonatal period. If the hemolysis is fully compensated (ie, minimal to no anemia), observation is the general management approach. In patients with severe symptomatic anemia, splenectomy is an option for reducing symptoms and the frequency of red cell transfusions.

The increased excretion of bilirubin pigments that occurs in patients with chronic hemolysis also may lead to the production of pigmented gallstones that may develop in early childhood [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4099268666"><span class="h2">Serum LDH, haptoglobin, and plasma free hemoglobin</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Tests used to diagnose the presence of hemolysis include LDH and plasma free hemoglobin, which are released from hemolyzed RBCs, and haptoglobin, which binds to hemoglobin released during hemolysis. Because the synthetic and binding capacities of haptoglobin are limited, serum levels of haptoglobin in hemolysis usually are either decreased (&lt;20 mg/dL) or absent [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. There are some caveats in assessing these tests, as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Elevated LDH level is a nonspecific marker of tissue damage and can be found in many different conditions other than hemolysis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef98392" href="/z/d/graphic/98392.html" rel="external">table 7</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Haptoglobin is not a reliable indicator of hemolysis in infants &lt;18 months of age, because it is not synthesized well in young infants, it is an acute phase reactant, and its concentration may be elevated in the presence of infection or inflammation.
