         Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) occurs when pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) remains abnormally elevated after birth, resulting in right-to-left shunting of blood through fetal circulatory pathways. This in turn leads to severe hypoxemia that may not respond to conventional respiratory support.

         <strong>
          Fetal and postnatal circulation
         </strong>
         – In the fetus, the pulmonary and systemic circuits operate in parallel. Both the right and left ventricles (RV/LV) eject blood into the aorta with subsequent perfusion of the placenta, the fetal organ of respiration  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66765" href="/z/d/graphic/66765.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The RV is dominant, and blood is shunted right-to-left through the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus, mostly bypassing the lung, which is not participating in gas exchange.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In contrast, the mature postnatal circulation operates in series. All venous return passes through the right side of the heart and into the lung, where gas exchange occurs. The oxygenated blood returns to the left side of the heart and is pumped into the systemic circulation for oxygen delivery to the tissues. No mixing occurs between the two sides of the circulation.

         <strong>
          Transitional circulation
         </strong>
         – Major circulatory adjustments occur at birth as the organ of gas exchange changes from the placenta to the lung. Under normal circumstances, a progressive fall in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) accompanies the immediate rise in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) that occurs after birth. For a short period, a transitional circulatory pattern exists that combines features of both the fetal and adult circulatory patterns. The decline in the PVR/SVR ratio results in a steady increase in pulmonary blood flow and oxygen uptake in the lung.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The process of transition depends upon several factors. Factors that contribute to the postnatal increase in SVR include removal of the placenta, the catecholamine surge associated with birth, and the relatively cold extrauterine environment. Factors that promote the postnatal decrease in PVR include expansion of the lung to normal resting volume, establishment of adequate alveolar ventilation and oxygen tension, and successful clearance of fetal lung fluid.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Conditions that interfere with the normal postnatal decline in the PVR/SVR ratio cause the transitional circulation to persist and result in PPHN.

         <strong>
          Underdevelopment of the pulmonary vasculature
         </strong>
         – In abnormalities of underdevelopment, the cross-sectional area of the pulmonary vasculature is reduced, resulting in a relatively fixed elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Mortality risk is greatest in this category of patients, as adaptive postnatal pulmonary vasodilation is limited. Underdevelopment occurs with pulmonary hypoplasia associated with a variety of conditions. These include congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), congenital pulmonary (cystic adenomatoid) malformation, renal agenesis, oligohydramnios accompanying obstructive uropathy, and fetal growth restriction.

         <strong>
          Maldevelopment of the pulmonary vasculature
         </strong>
         – Maldevelopment is a perturbation that occurs in lungs that are otherwise structurally normal (ie, normal number of pulmonary vessels, normal branching, normal alveolar differentiation). The characteristics of maldeveloped pulmonary vasculature include abnormal thickening of the muscle layer of the pulmonary arterioles, and extension of this layer into small vessels that normally have thin walls and no muscle cells [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. The extracellular matrix that surrounds the pulmonary vessels also is excessive. In this disorder, remodeling of the pulmonary vascular bed is thought to occur during the first 7 to 14 days after birth, with an accompanying fall in PVR.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Conditions associated with PPHN caused by vascular maldevelopment include postterm delivery, meconium staining, and meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). In these disorders, the pulmonary vasculature responds poorly to interventions that usually are effective at reducing PVR (eg, supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4971.html" rel="external">
          "Meconium aspiration syndrome: Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Disorders that cause pulmonary overcirculation during fetal development also may predispose to vascular maldevelopment. These causes include premature closure of the ductus arteriosus (eg, caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) or foramen ovale, high placental vascular resistance, and total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage. It has been proposed that the use of NSAIDs in pregnancy is associated with PPHN due to ductal constriction in the fetus [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. However, subsequent data are conflicting on whether there is a true association between maternal use of NSAIDs and PPHN [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7998.html" rel="external">
          "Safety of rheumatic disease medication use during pregnancy and lactation", section on 'NSAIDs'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The mechanisms that stimulate maldevelopment of the pulmonary vasculature are uncertain, but vascular mediators appear to play a role. In one report, for example, infants with severe PPHN had, compared with healthy controls, higher plasma concentrations of the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 and lower concentrations of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (representing stimulation of guanylate cyclase by nitric oxide [NO], a vasodilator that cannot be readily measured) [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Genetic predisposition may influence the availability of precursors for NO synthesis and affect cardiopulmonary adaptation at birth. This was illustrated in a report in which infants with pulmonary hypertension (PH) had lower plasma concentrations of arginine, a precursor of NO and a urea cycle intermediate, and NO metabolites than control infants with respiratory distress [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. A functional polymorphism of the gene encoding carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, which controls the rate-limiting step in the urea cycle, occurred more frequently in all of the infants with respiratory distress, with or without PH, than in the general population.

         <strong>
          Maladaptation of the pulmonary vasculature
         </strong>
         – In maladaptation, the pulmonary vascular bed is normally developed. However, adverse perinatal conditions cause active vasoconstriction and interfere with the normal postnatal fall in PVR. These conditions include perinatal depression, pulmonary parenchymal diseases, and bacterial infections, especially those caused by group B streptococcus (GBS). The mechanism of increased PVR with GBS infection is activation of vasoactive mediators by bacterial phospholipid components. In a study in newborn lambs, PH was induced by infusion of cardiolipin and phosphatidylglycerol, phospholipids located primarily in the cell wall of GBS [

         Most neonates with PPHN present within the first 24 hours of life with signs of respiratory distress (eg, tachypnea, retractions, and grunting) and cyanosis. In one study, more than half of the infants had low apgar scores and almost all of the patients received delivery room interventions including oxygen therapy, bag and mask ventilation, and endotracheal intubation [

         Physical examination findings include cyanosis and signs of respiratory distress. In addition, there may be meconium staining of skin and nails, which may be indicative of intrauterine stress. The cardiac examination of infants with PPHN may be notable for a prominent precordial impulse, and a narrowly split and accentuated second heart sound. A harsh systolic murmur consistent with tricuspid insufficiency sometimes is heard at the lower left sternal border.

         Pulse oximetry assessment generally demonstrates a difference of &gt;10 percent between the pre- and postductal (right thumb and either great toe) oxygen saturation. This differential is due to right-to-left shunting through the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).

         The definitive diagnosis of PPHN is made by echocardiography. Echocardiography is an essential test in any infant with unremitting cyanosis that is unexplained by parenchymal lung disease, to exclude structural heart disease and confirm a diagnosis of PPHN.
        </p>
        <p>
         In PPHN, echocardiography demonstrates normal structural cardiac anatomy with evidence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) (ie, elevated right ventricle pressure [RVp]). Echocardiography also assesses ventricular function, which may be impaired.
        </p>
        <p>
         RVp can be estimated based upon Doppler measurement of the velocity of the tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jet, if present [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. If there is no TR, RVp can be assessed qualitatively (eg, flattened or displaced ventricular septum). In patients with severe PH (systemic or suprasystemic RVp), echocardiography may demonstrate right-to-left shunting through the patent ductus arteriosus and/or foramen ovale. (See

         Alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of the pulmonary veins (ACD-MPV) is a rare disorder that may have a similar presentation to severe PPHN (ie, severe hypoxia that is refractory to general supportive care). However, infants with ACD-MPV typically have an initial period of stability and develop severe hypoxemia later than PPHN after the first few hours or days of life. If a diagnosis of ACD-MPV is suspected further evaluation including catheterization and lung biopsy are needed to confirm the diagnosis. (See

         <strong>
          Pathophysiology
         </strong>
         – Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) occurs when pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) remains abnormally elevated after birth, resulting in right-to-left shunting of blood through fetal circulatory pathways  (

         ); this leads to hypoxemia, which may be severe. (See

         <strong>
          Associated conditions
         </strong>
         – PPHN is usually associated with an underlying respiratory or systemic condition, though 15 to 20 percent of cases are idiopathic. Associated conditions include (see

         <strong>
          Clinical manifestations
         </strong>
         – Neonates with PPHN typically present within the first 24 hours of life with signs of respiratory distress (eg, tachypnea, retractions, and grunting) and cyanosis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical manifestations'

         <strong>
          Evaluation and diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Initial testing includes pulse oximetry, arterial blood gas sampling, chest radiography, and sepsis evaluation. Diagnosis of PPHN is confirmed by echocardiogram, which shows normal cardiac anatomy with evidence of pulmonary hypertension ([PH]; ie, flattened or displaced ventricular septum, elevated right ventricular pressure [RVp]). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Initial evaluation'

          Differential diagnosis
