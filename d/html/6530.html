The tibiofibular joint is made up of the syndesmosis and anterior/posterior tibiofibular ligaments and provides stability for the distal tibia and fibula. This stable unit is the superior portion of the talocrural joint where the dome of the talus fits snugly inferiorly  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94921" href="/z/d/graphic/94921.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The talocrural joint is stabilized by ligamentous structures medially (deltoid ligament  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51952" href="/z/d/graphic/51952.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>)) and laterally (anterior talofibular, calcaneofibular, and posterior talofibular ligaments  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72462" href="/z/d/graphic/72462.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>)) and primarily moves in the sagittal plane (dorsiflexion, plantar flexion  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60173" href="/z/d/graphic/60173.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>)). The talus articulates with the superior aspect of the calcaneus at the anterior and posterior articulations of the subtalar joint. The interosseous ligament and the bone anatomy make this a relatively stable joint that moves in the combined motions of pronation and supination.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H416287937"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ankle pain in the young athlete can originate in the bones (fractures)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94921" href="/z/d/graphic/94921.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef93194" href="/z/d/graphic/93194.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>), ligaments (sprains)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72462" href="/z/d/graphic/72462.html" rel="external">figure 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51952" href="/z/d/graphic/51952.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>), nerves  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50910" href="/z/d/graphic/50910.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>), or muscles (strains) and tendons (tendinitis)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93692" href="/z/d/graphic/93692.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91478" href="/z/d/graphic/91478.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>).

class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Distal fibular fractures are the most common ankle fracture in children and adolescents. A child with a distal fibula fracture typically has a history of inversion of the ankle with swelling and pain localized over the lateral physis (lateral malleolus)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60173" href="/z/d/graphic/60173.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). Most patients are unable to walk or have significant limitation of ambulation. Physical examination demonstrates bony tenderness at the site of the fracture (fibular physis in the case of Salter-Harris I). Initial radiographs may <strong>not</strong> show a bony abnormality in patients with a Salter-Harris I fracture  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54582" href="/z/d/graphic/54582.html" rel="external">figure 10</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6547.html" rel="external">"Ankle fractures in children", section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of ankle fractures is made based upon physical examination and imaging with plain radiographs. Imaging should be obtained in any patient with deformity and when physical examination suggests a fracture. The Low Risk Ankle Rule  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90427" href="/z/d/graphic/90427.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>) and the Ottawa Ankle Rules  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69818" href="/z/d/graphic/69818.html" rel="external">figure 8</a>) have been used in the pediatric population to identify patients who warrant imaging with some evidence that they help to reduce the need for imaging. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6547.html" rel="external">"Ankle fractures in children", section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H50979827"><span class="h3">Anterior process fractures of the calcaneus</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>These fractures are commonly misdiagnosed as lateral ankle sprains based upon the location of pain and mechanism of injury. Anterior process fractures can occur as either an avulsion fracture at the insertion of the Y-shaped bifurcate ligament (that connects the anterior process to the cuboid and navicular bones) when the foot is forcefully adducted and plantar-flexed or a compression fracture secondary to forceful abduction of the forefoot. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6547.html" rel="external">"Ankle fractures in children", section on 'Fracture classification'</a>.)</p><p>Presentations of anterior process fractures of the calcaneus may be subtle, with the only findings being moderate pain and tenderness just distal to the insertion of the anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL). Plain radiographs are diagnostic. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indicated if plain radiographs are negative, but there is clinical suspicion or atypical ankle sprain progression. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16373.html" rel="external">"Calcaneus fractures", section on 'Anterior process fracture'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16373.html" rel="external">"Calcaneus fractures", section on 'Avulsion of extensor digitorum brevis origin'</a>.)</p><p>The management of ankle fractures is discussed separately.

The ATFL  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72462" href="/z/d/graphic/72462.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>) is the first or only ligament to be injured in the majority of children and young adolescents. More severe injuries may involve the calcaneofibular ligament, and the most severe sprains will involve all three lateral ligaments.

It is adjacent to the tuberosity of the navicular and is classified into three different types [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. In type I (30 percent), the ossicle is located in the posterior tibialis tendon and is relatively small (less than 3 mm). The most common, type II (55 percent), is larger, often heart shaped, and has a cartilaginous synchondrosis to the navicular. The type III or cornuate navicular (15 percent) has a bony attachment to the navicular. While most are asymptomatic, some will become painful with repetitive pressure on the medial foot (hockey and soccer players, skaters, skiers), with excessive tension from rearfoot pronation (runners with pes planus), or with acute eversion injury.</p><p>Radiographs are sufficient for classification of the ossicle type. In cases with severe pain or prolonged recovery despite adequate treatment, MRI is useful, especially in type II, to determine if there is an injury to the cartilaginous synchondrosis, which requires longer conservative management. MRI will also help to define the anatomy of the posterior tibialis tendon and evaluate for other possible diagnoses that mimic this injury, such as tarsal tunnel syndrome or rupture of the posterior tibialis tendon.</p><p>The diagnosis and treatment are discussed in further detail separately.

Patients with posterior tibialis tendinopathy typically complain of pain around the posteromedial ankle. Swelling may be present along the course of the tendon, particularly several centimeters proximal to its insertion on the navicular. However, as the condition progresses, partial tearing of the tendon or avulsion from its insertion on the navicular can occur, and the longitudinal arch may drop resulting in a "flat foot" (type III pes planus) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6521.html" rel="external">"Forefoot and midfoot pain in the active child or skeletally immature adolescent: Overview of causes", section on 'Type III'</a>). This collapse causes midfoot rotation and impingement of lateral structures. The patient may then complain of lateral ankle pain and a gradual "turning out" of the foot. In most cases of posterior tibialis tendinopathy, pain increases gradually over weeks and patients do not recall a traumatic event. Some patients may recall a twisting type of injury, such as stepping off a curb or stepping into a hole, and, in such cases, the condition is often misdiagnosed as a medial ankle sprain.

Tarsal tunnel syndrome often affects individuals with a prior injury to the medial ankle or a markedly pronated gait. When the arch of the foot collapses and the foot pronates excessively, the bones of the tibiotalar or subtalar joint may move and even sublux, and this too, can cause compression of the structures running through the tarsal tunnel. Pressure on the tibial nerve causes neuropathic pain that typically radiates to the heel and plantar surface of the forefoot. This is classic tarsal tunnel syndrome. Over time, compression of the tarsal tunnel can also result in injury of the posterior tibialis or flexor hallucis tendons with findings of tendinitis.

Excessive pronation elongates the anterior tibial tendon, which can predispose to tenosynovitis.

The groove for the flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendon on the posterior aspect of the talus has an elongated lateral wall called Stieda process. Between the ages of 8 and 11 years, separate ossification centers appear and usually rapidly fuse with the medial and lateral tubercles of the groove. Persistence of the lateral ossification center occurs in approximately 13 percent of the population; it occurs bilaterally in 50 percent of patients [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Acquired os trigonum syndrome can result from a fracture that fails to reunite (usually sustained in a hyper plantar flexion injury).</p><p>Os trigonum is seldom symptomatic; it is a normal structure and should not deter a career in dance or other athletic endeavor. The os trigonum syndrome results when the os trigonum causes posterolateral ankle pain. Os trigonum syndrome may be caused by a free accessory bone or a bone fused to the talus at Stieda process [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Although the pathogenesis of pain is not known, the most accepted theory proposes that the os becomes impinged between the calcaneus and the posterior lip of the tibia during extreme plantar flexion. Os trigonum syndrome is considered part of the posterior impingement syndrome, which can involve the os trigonum, Stieda process, or the FHL tendon.</p><p>Patients with os trigonum syndrome describe pain in the posterior lateral aspect of the ankle; symptoms may be exacerbated when walking downhill. Tenderness is present at the posterolateral aspect of the ankle [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Pain is accentuated by squatting, resisted plantar flexion, or dorsiflexion of the great toe because these maneuvers cause the flexor hallucis longus to push against the ossicle as the FHL passes over the talus. Plantar flexion of the foot with axial loading to the heel reproduces the symptoms. The plantar flexion sign is the key to diagnosis because it distinguishes posterior impingement from the other causes of posterior ankle pain (eg, Achilles tendinitis, bursitis, Haglund deformity).</p><p>Plain radiographs (lateral ankle and lateral ankle in plantar flexion) can demonstrate the presence of the os or Stieda process [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6030.html" rel="external">"Bacterial arthritis: Clinical features and diagnosis in infants and children", section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6030.html" rel="external">"Bacterial arthritis: Clinical features and diagnosis in infants and children", section on 'Indications for consultation'</a>.)</p><p>In regions where Lyme disease is endemic, Lyme arthritis is an important consideration. Most patients with Lyme arthritis can ambulate, and fever or erythema is less common. Serologic testing for Lyme disease should be performed in patients with arthritis who reside in or have traveled to an endemic region and have a risk factor for tick exposure. The diagnosis and management of Lyme disease is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7896.html" rel="external">"Treatment of Lyme disease", section on 'Arthritis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7914.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of Lyme disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H50978278"><span class="h2">Tumor</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Tumors, both benign and malignant, are rare causes of poorly localized ankle pain. The classic presentation is of night pain that is chronic and responsive to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13371" href="/z/d/drug information/13371.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a>). Benign tumors that may arise in the bones of the ankle consist of osteoid osteomas, osteoblastomas, and chondromyxoid fibromas. Ewing sarcoma may rarely be seen in the calcaneus and may be difficult to distinguish from osteomyelitis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6294.html" rel="external">"Nonmalignant bone lesions in children and adolescents", section on 'Osteoid osteoma'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7744.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, staging, and prognostic factors of Ewing sarcoma"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H101851667"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.
