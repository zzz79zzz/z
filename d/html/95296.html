However, increasingly, there is an understanding that promoting physical activity benefits the health and well-being of children and adults with CHD. The challenge for clinicians who care for these patients is to ensure safe participation in regular physical activity by tailoring recommendations to the individual's clinical status.</p><p>This topic reviews the risks and benefits of physical activity and provides an approach for the assessment and recommendation for regular physical activity in children, adolescents, and adults with CHD.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H97359754"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following definitions are used in this topic:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Physical activity</strong> – Physical activity is defined as bodily movement produced by the contraction of skeletal muscle that increases energy expenditure above the basal level. It includes recreational and competitive sports and daily living or transportation activities. In adults, a moderate amount of physical activity is roughly equivalent to physical activity that uses approximately 150 calories (kcal) of energy per day or 1000 calories per week. Examples of moderate physical activity include leisure cycling, moderate-effort swimming, playing golf (walking), general cleaning at home, or lawn mowing  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73838" href="/z/d/graphic/73838.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Vigorous activity includes running, rope jumping, and calisthenics. Of note, individuals can be physically active without demonstrating significant fitness.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Physical fitness</strong> – Physical fitness is a set of physical attributes that enables one to perform daily physical activities. Health-related physical fitness encompasses cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular strength and endurance, flexibility, and body composition.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Exercise</strong> – Exercise is a subset of physical activity that is planned, structured, repetitive, and purposeful, with a main objective of improvement or maintenance of one or more components of physical fitness. Exercise and sports can be divided into dynamic and static components, which can be classified along a spectrum of increasing static and dynamic intensity  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105651" href="/z/d/graphic/105651.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Dynamic exercise is joint movement through relatively small forces within the muscle</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Static exercise involves generating relatively large intramuscular force within the muscle with little joint movement</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A specific activity will have dynamic and static components at varying levels. Some sports, such as distance running, have a high dynamic but low static component. Weight lifting and martial arts have a high static but low dynamic component. Boxing, rowing, and kayaking have both high static and dynamic demands. (See <a class="local">'Classification of sport'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Competitive sport</strong> – Competitive sport is defined as an organized individual or team sport that requires regular competition with others. It typically requires systematic and intensive training and also is usually supervised by a coach [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Patients who wish to engage in competitive sports'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H97359912"><span class="h1">BENEFITS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The need to promote regular physical activity in patients with CHD is based on the following observations [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Regular physical activity in healthy individuals improves cardiovascular and mental health and decreases the risk of several chronic conditions, including obesity, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2786.html" rel="external">"The benefits and risks of aerobic exercise"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Advances in CHD management have led to increased long-term survival and a greater number of patients who reach adulthood. As a result, individuals with CHD can reap the benefits of regular physical activity seen in the general healthy population.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recognition that previous advice of avoiding physical activity due to concerns about worsening cardiovascular status or sudden cardiac death (SCD) may not be correct.</p><p></p><p>Routine physical activity in patients with CHD is associated with better cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal fitness, better quality of life, improved motor skills, and higher self-esteem [<a href="#rid3">3,5-16</a>]. Home-based exercise training programs and cardiac rehabilitation also have the potential to improve exercise capacity and quality of life in patients with CHD [<a href="#rid11">11,13</a>]. Routine physical activity also may have important long-term benefits of reducing obesity and cardiovascular disease, which are more prevalent in children and adults with CHD compared with the general population [<a href="#rid17">17-19</a>]. Several studies have reported that physical or exercise training improved exercise capacity and cardiovascular function in children with complex CHD with no significant adverse effects [<a href="#rid13">13,20-29</a>]. Data have also shown that physical training in children and adolescents with CHD is associated with a rise in daily physical activity and improved psychosocial well-being, with an increase in self-esteem and a decrease in withdrawal and somatic complaints [<a href="#rid24">24,30-32</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1004063044"><span class="h1">LACK OF BENEFIT OF RESTRICTING ACTIVITY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Based on the available evidence, activity restriction does not appear to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in most patients with CHD. However, unrestricted physical activity may be detrimental in certain conditions, as discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Conditions with potential risks of exercise'</a> below.)</p><p>Though the risk of SCD is higher in children with CHD compared with the general population, SCD is still a very rare occurrence in the CHD population. In addition, most SCD events in children with CHD occur at rest, not during exercise. Thus, activity restriction is unlikely to have a meaningful impact on SCD risk, and any potential benefit is likely outweighed by the downsides of reduced physical activity (eg, obesity, poor cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal fitness).</p><p>The rarity of SCD in CHD, lack of association between SCD and exercise in this population, and lack of apparent benefit of physical activity restriction have been described in several observational studies [<a href="#rid32">32-36</a>]. In a retrospective study of 403 patients with congenital aortic stenosis treated with balloon aortic valvuloplasty, 45 percent of patients were managed with physical activity restriction and 55 percent were not restricted [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. Over a mean follow-up of 13 years, outcomes were similar in both groups, with death or cardiac transplantation occurring in 6.5 percent in the restricted activity group and 3.2 percent in the unrestricted group. There was only one SCD event in this study, which occurred during rest in a child in the restricted activity group.</p><p>In a prospective population-based study of &gt;3,500 patients with repaired CHD, there were 41 sudden deaths during 45,857 patient-years of follow-up (0.09 per 100 patient-years); only 15 percent of SCDs occurred during exercise [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. In another population-based study of &gt;11,000 children with CHD followed for a mean of 10.6 years, 19 children (0.2 percent) experienced sudden unexpected deaths [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. None of the deaths occurred during physical activity; however, there were two episodes of aborted SCD that occurred during sports.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H97360719"><span class="h1">NEED FOR INDIVIDUALIZED COUNSELING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The challenge for clinicians is to balance routine daily physical activity and restricting inactivity for patients with CHD, while minimizing any potential risks from exercise. As a result, health care providers need to tailor recommendations for each individual based on a physical activity assessment and monitor the effect of routine physical activity on his or her clinical status. Adherence to an exercise program is challenging for many, including those with CHD, so clinician encouragement is critical [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Our approach'</a> below.)</p><p>Virtually all patients with CHD can participate in daily physical activity and exercise, and the majority can participate in recreational sports. For example, patients who underwent an arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries can achieve activity levels similar to those of patients free of cardiovascular disease, even though they have a decrease in exercise capacity [<a href="#rid37">37,38</a>]. Nevertheless, certain physical activities may be detrimental to the health of a patient with CHD; this may result in limiting the intensity of the activity <strong>but</strong> should not preclude participation in physical activity most days of the week. (See <a class="local">'Conditions with potential risks of exercise'</a> below.)</p><p>Discussion with both the patient and family/caregivers is important to understand and address concerns that may reduce daily physical activity [<a href="#rid39">39,40</a>]. Several studies have shown that patients with CHD have reduced levels of physical fitness and lower levels of physical activity compared with those without CHD [<a href="#rid2">2,19,23,39,41,42</a>]. The reasons for diminished activity are multifactorial and may be changing over time, but restriction from activity likely plays an important role. Children with CHD may be needlessly limited from physical activity by worried parents/caregivers [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. These restrictions are counterproductive and lead to unnecessary anxiety, reduced activity, and poor exercise tolerance later in life [<a href="#rid41">41</a>].</p><p>The clinician should ideally provide a management plan to the patient and family with realistic and measurable goals based on the individual's clinical status. Some providers forego specific counselling on physical activity due to limited time during visits or uncertainty about appropriate recommendations [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. In the absence of specific counseling, many patients with CHD avoid exercise altogether. (See <a class="local">'Routine physical activity'</a> below and <a class="local">'Goal setting'</a> below.)</p><p>It is also important to review with the family differences between competitive and noncompetitive exercise. Participating and training for competitive sports typically involves high intensity levels of activity, which are usually imposed by the coach or playing conditions. Competitive sports are felt to be of higher risk because the individual may lose the ability to self-regulate effort if symptoms should arise. It is important for both the participant and supervisors to understand and implement medically needed restrictions and to understand how to regulate and monitor activity levels even when participating in "noncompetitive" physical activity. (See <a class="local">'Patients who wish to engage in competitive sports'</a> below.)</p><p>The approach to athletic eligibility is not binary. Rather, there is a continuum of risk, and some physical activities may be "reasonable" or "could be considered" for an individual patient. This is reflected in the 2015 competitive sports eligibility statement from the American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC) [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. An open discussion of risk between the provider, patient, and family is necessary in order to tailor exercise recommendations to the individual patient [<a href="#rid45">45</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H97360749"><span class="h1">ROUTINE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H685253664"><span class="h2">Our approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Our approach to promoting physical activity in patients with CHD is generally consistent with guidance issued by the American Heart Association (AHA) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) [<a href="#rid2">2,4</a>]. It includes the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assessment and goal setting – Determine individual goals for each patient based on physical activity assessment, using history and evaluation of cardiorespiratory fitness; this may include formal exercise testing. (See <a class="local">'Assessment'</a> below and <a class="local">'Goal setting'</a> below and <a class="local">'Exercise testing'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Exercise prescription and counseling:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Clearly and specifically articulate the benefits of routine physical activity to the patient and family and the detrimental effects of prolonged sedentary periods (see <a class="local">'Benefits of physical activity'</a> above). For patients in whom activity restriction is medically necessary, ensure that the patient and family understand the reasons for restriction. Examples of acceptable activities based on the patient's current clinical status should be provided and promoted. It is important for the patient and family to understand that participation in less intensive regular activity is beneficial and should be encouraged.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Discuss recommendations with the patient/family and provide a written plan of physical activity and restrictions to the patient and family, which are documented in the medical record. (See <a class="local">'Goal setting'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Provide guidance on how to build activity time and level so that patients are able to reach a daily goal of moderate to vigorous activity most days of the week. For adults, the recommended duration of daily activity is 30 minutes and, in children, 60 minutes. Supervised exercise training programs may benefit patients with complex cardiac disease [<a href="#rid7">7,46</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Follow-up care – Assess and monitor ongoing routine physical activity and readjust goals as necessary. (See <a class="local">'Follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H921844469"><span class="h2">Assessment</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H97360757"><span class="h3">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinician should review the cardiac history to understand the patient's underlying CHD defect and cardiorespiratory status, ask about exertional symptoms, and review the patients current and prior physical activity routines.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1392155090"><span class="h4">Exertional symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Presence of exertional symptoms that may limit the intensity of activity, such as angina, dyspnea, palpitations, dizziness, syncope, and increasing cyanosis. For these patients, exercise testing may be needed to better define the risk of exercising and the current level of fitness [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Exercise testing'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H97360765"><span class="h4">Conditions with potential risks of exercise</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although the vast majority of patients with CHD can participate in daily physical activity and recreational sports with minimal risk, there are certain settings in which unrestricted intensity of physical activity may be detrimental. These include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Specific cardiac conditions including hereditary cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome, other congenital channelopathies, some arrhythmias, and congenital coronary artery anomalies. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/963.html" rel="external">"Overview of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death", section on 'Heart failure and cardiomyopathy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5786.html" rel="external">"Causes of wide QRS complex tachycardia in children", section on 'Congenital heart disease'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/988.html" rel="external">"Congenital long QT syndrome: Treatment", section on 'Physical activity and LQTS'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ventricular dysfunction – Although there is a lack of evidence, it is thought that patients with significant ventricular dysfunction are at risk for ventricular fibrillation if they participate in intense exercise and competitive sports [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. However, these patients can still participate in a wide range of daily physical activity and recreational sports. This was illustrated in one study that reported patients with single ventricle physiology who underwent Fontan procedure from 1994 to 2001 exceeded the recommended normal daily activity level of 60 minutes per day as measured by three-day accelerometer and questionnaire [<a href="#rid47">47</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other cardiac conditions – Although evidence is lacking, there is consensus that individuals with the following conditions should be encouraged to participate in noncompetitive activities that have low to moderate dynamic and static components  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105651" href="/z/d/graphic/105651.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Coronary artery compression or insufficiency.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Significant pulmonary hypertension – Right ventricular pressure approaching or exceeding systemic pressure with right ventricular dysfunction or symptoms.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Severe left or right ventricular outflow tract (LVOT/RVOT) obstruction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Dilation of the aorta – Severe dilation of the aorta is associated with increased risk of aortic dissection. Exertion results in a rise in blood pressure that increases the wall stress of the aorta, which may increase the risk of aortic dissection [<a href="#rid48">48</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypoxia – Although exertion may increase cyanosis in selected patients with elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and intracardiac shunting, hypoxia should not lead to elimination of daily physical activity [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Rather, physical activity should be targeted to a comfortable level for each patient. A walk test with oxygen saturation monitoring can be useful for assessment and for guiding recommendations.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Syncope – In patients with CHD and exertional syncope, further investigation is necessary to determine and manage the underlying cause (eg, arrhythmia) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Patients at risk for syncope should be counseled to avoid activity that would endanger themselves or others should an event occur (eg, horseback riding, scuba diving, rock climbing, and gymnastics). Other activities, such as swimming, ice skating, and bike riding, can be done with supervision. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1032.html" rel="external">"Syncope in adults: Management and prognosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6464.html" rel="external">"Emergency evaluation of syncope in children and adolescents", section on 'Diagnostic approach'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/126940.html" rel="external">"Syncope in adults: Risk assessment and additional diagnostic evaluation", section on 'Selected additional testing'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anticoagulation – Patients who are taking anticoagulation medications should avoid sports in which body impact is an intentional aspect (eg, boxing, tackle football, ice hockey, and combative martial arts), and those in which high speed impacts could be anticipated (eg, downhill skiing) in order to avoid bruising or bleeding, specifically head injury [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. For sports with unintentional contact, factors that are important to consider before approving participation include bleeding history, current medication and level of anticoagulation, patient skill, and specific activity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with pacemakers or implanted cardiac defibrillators (ICD), issues to consider are:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Protection of the device and leads, and prevention of any soft tissue injury due to impact to the device [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Therefore, activities with a high likelihood for direct blows to the device within the chest (eg, boxing, tackle football, ice hockey with body checking, and combative martial arts) should be avoided to prevent damage to the device and soft tissue injury to the patient.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Appropriate shocks from ICDs appear to successfully terminate arrhythmias during exercise and this should not be a concern [<a href="#rid49">49</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Data are limited, but there appears to be no or only a small increased risk of shocks during exercise in athletes with ICDs.

Formal exercise testing may uncover risks associated with exercise while the patient is still in a monitored, controlled setting.</p><p>In addition, patients with CHD are often unaware of their aerobic limitations. Because they have had abnormal physiology from birth, they do not perceive a decline or deficiency. This lack of awareness is most likely due to CHD patients adapting to their cardiovascular disease by self-regulating their aerobic participation. This is in contrast with patients with acquired heart failure who are more perceptive of their limitations [<a href="#rid52">52</a>]. As a result, exercise testing is more reliable than self-reporting in determining the functional exercise capacity of individuals with CHD.</p><p>Exercise testing uses a continuous, ramped increase in workload until the patient develops symptoms (eg, dyspnea, fatigue) that cause the patient to feel unable to exercise at a higher workload. The type of physiologic data depends on the type of equipment used for assessment. For example, treadmill exercise tests with continuous ECG and pulse oxygen monitoring, and periodic blood pressure provide important basic information of changes in ECG, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing, which is more expensive and less readily available, measures ventilation and respiratory gas parameters that are used to calculate maximal oxygen uptake (consumption), ventilatory efficiency, and anaerobic threshold.

The assessment may identify conditions that may require limiting the intensity of activity but do <strong>not</strong> preclude routine daily physical activity. (See <a class="local">'Need for individualized counseling'</a> above and <a class="local">'Routine physical activity'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The management approach consists of assessment and goal setting, exercise prescription and counseling, and follow-up of activity and readjustment of goals as necessary.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Assessment</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>History</strong> – The history should review the underlying cardiac defect and history, with a focus on identifying conditions that may limit the intensity of activity (eg, ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmias). In addition, the clinician should ask about exertional symptoms (eg, dyspnea and syncope) and current level of physical activity. (See <a class="local">'History'</a> above and <a class="local">'Conditions with potential risks of exercise'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Cardiorespiratory assessment</strong> – The cardiorespiratory assessment consists of a basic cardiac evaluation, including ECG, echocardiography to assess ventricular function, and, in patients with cyanotic heart disease, pulse oximetry. In some cases, exercise testing is used to assess risk and functional exercise capacity. (See <a class="local">'Basic cardiac assessment'</a> above and <a class="local">'Exercise testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Prescribing a physical activity regimen</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>For patients with successful repair and no residual sequelae, the physical activity goals are the same as those of the general population. This entails 60 minutes per day of physical activity for children between 6 and 17 years and 150 minutes per week for adults.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>For some patients, goals are modified in terms of the type and intensity level of activity. These include patients with compromised cardiac function (eg, ventricular dysfunction and/or outflow tract obstruction, elevated pulmonary artery pressure, or dilation of the aortic root and ascending aorta), arrhythmias, hypoxia, exertional syncope, or implantable cardiac defibrillators or pacemakers or those who receive anticoagulation therapy. (See <a class="local">'Goal setting'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Follow-up</strong> – Routine follow-up care includes evaluation of daily physical activity and adjustments based on activity history and clinical status. In some patients with activity restrictions, cardiorespiratory assessment including exercise testing may be indicated. (See <a class="local">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Competitive sports</strong> – Patients with CHD who wish to participate in competitive sports require a more detailed assessment than is performed for routine physical activity or noncompetitive exercise. This is because participants in competitive sports generally exert themselves to greater extremes and are often motivated to ignore symptoms of overexertion. Making a physical activity plan in this setting should be individualized and should balance safety restrictions with the patients' priorities in a shared decision-making process. (See <a class="local">'Patients who wish to engage in competitive sports'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2560657798"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges Sarah D de Ferranti, MD, MPH, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Levine BD, Baggish AL, Kovacs RJ, et al.
