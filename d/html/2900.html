(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129424.html" rel="external">"Basic genetics concepts: Chromosomes and cell division", section on 'Chromosome organization'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The default sex is female. The Y chromosome contains the <em>SRY</em> gene (sex-determining region, Y chromosome), which suppresses the formation of female gonads (via production of anti-Müllerian hormone) and initiates development of male reproductive organs. Individuals with a Y chromosome and an intact <em>SRY</em> gene are phenotypically male; those without a Y chromosome are phenotypically female. Exceptions include XY females with androgen resistance and rare XX males in XY translocation kindreds. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Between 1 and 2 percent of the sequence of the nuclear genome encodes for genes (discrete functional units) that provide instructions for making proteins. Together, the combination of parts of the genomes that encode for genes is known as the exome.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The exome contains approximately 21,000 different genes, although estimates vary greatly depending on how genes are defined and how the analyses are conducted [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Coding genes are transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) that is subsequently translated into protein. This information became available as a result of the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2001 to 2003 [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Some experts were surprised that the number was this small. Noncoding genes code for other RNA types, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snRNAs), with functional properties that do not require translation to protein. (See <a class="local">'Central dogma versus more complex regulation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In most cases, protein-coding genes consist of exons, which have segments that code for amino acids, introns (segments with code that are spliced out during transcription; many introns regulate the expression of genes), and other regulatory regions (5' and 3' untranslated regions)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67310" href="/z/d/graphic/67310.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). Alternative splicing uses different combinations of exons to produce different versions of proteins and expands the breadth of functions encoded by each gene. (See <a class="local">'Transcription'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>There are several ways to describe the physical position (locus) of a gene on a chromosome:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Data from completely sequenced genomes allows researchers to refer to chromosomal position at the resolution of a single base pair. Although the relative position of most DNA sequences is stable, absolute base pair numbering varies from one sequence build to another due to ongoing additions and editing of the genome. The build number must be noted when using absolute base numbering. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">This standardization of the reference genome is critical to ensure that pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in a gene (see <a class="local">'Clinical classification of pathogenicity'</a> below) are reported consistently across different laboratories.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prior to the completion of the Human Genome Project, genetic loci were described with reference to cytogenetic markers (dark regions on chromosomes that appear with Giemsa staining, also known as G-bands)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81862" href="/z/d/graphic/81862.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). High-resolution karyotyping allows greater subdivision. Although array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) has grown in popularity for assessing copy number variation at the chromosome level, karyotyping remains important clinically, such as when examining for a balanced translocation that may have been responsible for an offspring with an unbalanced chromosomal rearrangement (partial trisomy or monosomy), or in evaluating certain hematologic malignancies.

Their genome is 16,589 base pairs long and contains 37 genes, 13 of which are protein coding. Many of these are involved in mitochondrial respiration and the electron transport chain. Mitochondrial DNA is found within DNA-protein complexes called nucleoids, which are located in the mitochondrial matrix. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5148.html" rel="external">"Mitochondrial regulation and functions"</a>.)</p><p>During conception, mitochondria come exclusively from the egg. Thus, all mitochondrial DNA is maternally inherited, and mitochondrial disorders are exclusively transmitted through the maternal line. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2897.html" rel="external">"Inheritance patterns of monogenic disorders (Mendelian and non-Mendelian)", section on 'Mitochondrial inheritance'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h2">Gene expression</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Gene expression is the process in which the genetic information is converted to biochemical or biologic functions. The process is highly regulated on multiple levels.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h3">DNA and RNA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>DNA and RNA are nucleic acids (polymers with a repeating modular structure) in which nucleotide bases are bound to a sugar-phosphate backbone. The sugars are five-carbon rings, also called pentoses. The sugar in DNA is deoxyribose (hence, <strong>d</strong>eoxyribo<strong>n</strong>ucleic <strong>a</strong>cid) and in RNA is ribose (<strong>r</strong>ibo<strong>n</strong>ucleic <strong>a</strong>cid).</p><p>The sugar moieties are connected to each another by the formation of phosphodiester bonds between the 3rd and 5th positions of adjacent carbon rings. </p><p>The bases are covalently bound to the 1st position of the carbon ring. Bases with two rings are referred to as purines, and bases with one ring are referred to as pyrimidines  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60245" href="/z/d/graphic/60245.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>DNA</strong> – The four bases in DNA are:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Purines – Adenine (A) and guanine (G)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Pyrimidines – Cytosine (C) and thymine (T)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>RNA</strong> – RNA contains the same purines (A and G). The pyrimidines are C and uracil (U). U and T differ by a single methyl group (CH<sub>3</sub>). </p><p></p><p>DNA consists of a double helix (two paired, antiparallel strands in which noncovalent hydrogen bonds form between complementary bases on the opposite strand), forming a helical polymer (double helix)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56556" href="/z/d/graphic/56556.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>). A pairs with T and C with G. The rule of sequence complementarity (sequence conservation in newly transcribed RNA and newly synthesized DNA) provides the basis for accurate DNA transcription and replication. Adenine and thymine pair with two hydrogen bonds and cytosine and guanine pair with three hydrogen bonds. </p><p>RNA is usually single stranded, although some RNAs base-pair with other RNAs to regulate them. (See <a class="local">'Central dogma versus more complex regulation'</a> below.) </p><p>The difference in the sugar moiety between DNA and RNA affects the relative stability of the molecules. DNA is more stable because the carbon at position 2' is hydrogen-bonded rather than hydroxylated. In contrast, RNA is more susceptible to degradation by heat and ultraviolet light. RNases also greatly reduce the stability of RNA. This degradation is one method of rapid inactivation of gene expression. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3538064924"><span class="h3">Central dogma versus more complex regulation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The fundamental processes by which heritable information translated from genetic code to function in living organisms are common throughout all living organisms. The order in which these processes occur (transcription of DNA to RNA and translation of RNA to protein in a linear, unidirectional process) were termed the "Central Dogma of Molecular Biology" by Francis Crick in 1958. The figure illustrates the processes of transcription and translation  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef142009" href="/z/d/graphic/142009.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>).</p><p>However, regulation of gene expression is much more complex than simply the unidirectional copying of a sequence. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Proteins and RNA species regulate the expression of specific genes, and there are complex interactions between DNA, RNA, and protein. Examples of other types of RNA besides mRNA include snRNAs, miRNAs, ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See <a class="local">'DNA and RNA'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reversible epigenetic changes to the DNA also occur. These changes are modifications superimposed on individual DNA strands (eg, methylation) and/or on histones (eg, methylation, acetylation), which confer higher-order chromosome regulation.

Retroviruses use reverse transcription to integrate their genome into the host DNA-based genome, causing genetic information to flow from RNA to DNA and then back to RNA again [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1736659982"><span class="h3">Transcription</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The process of transcription transfers genetic information from DNA to RNA, mediated by new RNA synthesis using the DNA as a template. It occurs in the nucleus, at distinct genomic positions at defined times in response to various triggers, which may include internal programs related to development or maturation, or external triggers such as arrival of nutrients, starvation, or exposure to a number of substances or circumstances. </p><p>Transcription occurs from the antisense DNA strand, in the 5' to 3' direction. (See <a class="local">'DNA and RNA'</a> above.)</p><p>Transcription requires that cellular machinery unfold the DNA to allow transcriptional regulators (transcription factors) and the transcription machinery to bind a single-stranded region of the DNA. This is followed by a cascade of protein recruitment that ultimately leads to the binding of RNA polymerase to the 5' end of the DNA sequence. One type of RNA polymerase catalyzes RNA chain elongation by reading the DNA template and incorporating nucleotides (A, G, C, and U  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62789" href="/z/d/graphic/62789.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>)) into a new chain linked by phosphodiesterase bonds (other RNA polymerases have other functions). </p><p>Differences in DNA sequence that alter chromatin structure or affect the binding of transcription factors are often implicated as susceptibility factors for common, complex genetic traits [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Genetic variation'</a> below and <a class="local">'Modes of inheritance'</a> below.)</p><p>The first phase of transcription produces precursor messenger RNA molecules (pre-mRNA) that subsequently undergo modifications to make a stable mRNA transcript. These modifications are illustrated in the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70605" href="/z/d/graphic/70605.html" rel="external">figure 8</a>) and include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Splicing</strong> – DNA contains protein-coding exons and noncoding introns. Splicing is the process that removes the noncoding segments from pre-mRNA molecules and splices together the ends of the intervening coding segments to produce a seamless mature mRNA product. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Differential splicing allows a single gene to encode more than one protein  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68285" href="/z/d/graphic/68285.html" rel="external">figure 9</a>). Differences in splicing may be tissue-specific and may be highly regulated within the same tissue.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Splicing relies on spliceosomes (enzymatic ribonucleoprotein complexes). Intron boundaries are marked by conserved splice donor and splice acceptor sites on the pre-mRNA that provide sequence recognition sites for the spliceosomes. Mutations that disrupt splice sites can impair normal splicing and alter protein structure and function. (See <a class="local">'Genetic variation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Capping</strong> – Capping improves the stability and function of mRNA by linking an inverted methylated guanosine (m7G) to the 5' end. The cap prevents the 5' end from binding to other nucleic acid chains, protects the mRNA from exonucleases, promotes translocation of the mRNA from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm, and facilitates ribosomal binding to the 5' end of the mRNA to initiate translation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Polyadenylation</strong> – Polyadenylation improves the stability and function of mRNA by linking a long tail of adenine molecules (a polyA tail) to the 3' end. The polyA tail increases transcript stability, promotes the tertiary structure of the transcript, and facilitates the initiation of translation.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2844881857"><span class="h3">Translation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The process of translation uses the information in mRNA to create proteins (polypeptide chains of amino acids that fold into three-dimensional structures capable of interacting with each other). It occurs in the cytoplasm, as illustrated in the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132819" href="/z/d/graphic/132819.html" rel="external">figure 10</a>). </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The mRNA is transported from the nucleus to the endoplasmic reticulum  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132819" href="/z/d/graphic/132819.html" rel="external">figure 10</a>), where translation is initiated [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mature mRNA serves as the template that determines the linear sequence of amino acids.

The ribosome binds to transfer RNA (tRNA), which provides the nucleotide sequence. Each tRNA has a three-base sequence (an anti-codon) complementary to an mRNA triplet. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There are 20 amino acids, each encoded by a three-nucleotide mRNA sequence known as a codon  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57764" href="/z/d/graphic/57764.html" rel="external">figure 12</a>). There are 64 codons; thus, there is some redundancy in amino acid determination (some amino acids can be specified by more than one codon)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73711" href="/z/d/graphic/73711.html" rel="external">figure 13</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Each amino acid has an amino-carboxyl backbone with a unique side chain. They can be classified according to whether their side chain is polar or nonpolar, and for the polar amino acids, whether it is charged or not  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78753" href="/z/d/graphic/78753.html" rel="external">figure 14</a>). The collective interactions of the side chains confer tertiary structure (folding) and protein-protein interactions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There are three stop codons (UGA, UAA, and UAG); the presence of a stop codon is used to signify the end of the transcript. In the mitochondrial genome, UGA encodes tryptophan rather than a stop codon [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. AUG, which encodes methionine, also signals the start of each transcript. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ribosomes recognize and bind the start codon (methionine) at the 5' end of mRNA to initiate the translation process.

Small-scale variation (single nucleotide changes or small insertions or deletions) are thought to comprise the majority of genetic variation.

While the reference sequence is sometimes referred to as the "normal" sequence, this presumes that there is one true normal and does not account for a heavy bias toward reference sequences from certain populations such as those of European descent. </p><p>Difference from a reference DNA sequence is not inherently advantageous or deleterious. On the one hand, variation is responsible for genetic diversity and evolution. On the other hand, variation can interfere with normal gene functions and can increase the risk of deleterious traits or disease.</p><p>There is a wide range in the estimated frequency of DNA sequence variation, with some regions of the genome such as the major histocompatability cluster (MHC) showing high heterogeneity and others, especially coding regions, showing more restricted variation. It has been proposed that critical functional elements are less tolerant of variation [<a href="#rid9">9-13</a>]. </p><p>Common types of sequence variation include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Single nucleotide substitutions</strong> – These are variants in which one nucleotide is replaced with a different nucleotide. These primarily arise due to single-base slip mispairing during DNA replication and/or to cytosine deamination [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. Single nucleotide substitutions are thought to represent more than half of human DNA variation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Missense</strong> – Missense mutations substitute one nucleotide for another. The messenger RNA (mRNA) remains "in frame," meaning that only a single codon is affected and all downstream codons remain the same. In some cases, the mutation is "silent" (not changing the amino acid) and in others, one amino acid is substituted for another. This may or may not affect protein function depending on whether the residue is critical and/or whether the polarity and charge are maintained. (See <a class="local">'Translation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Nonsense</strong> – Nonsense mutations substitute one nucleotide for another, but the new nucleotide introduces a stop codon that was not previously present. When the mRNA is translated, the protein ends prematurely, creating a truncated form of the protein that may undergo nonsense-mediated decay and/or lack important functional domains. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Splice site</strong> – Single nucleotide changes can also alter sites where the protein-coding DNA (exons) are spliced together, referred to as splice site variants. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms</strong> – Indels are variants in which one or more nucleotides are removed or added, potentially changing the reading frame of the resulting mRNA  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69699" href="/z/d/graphic/69699.html" rel="external">figure 15</a>). Most indels range in length from one to four nucleotides; the vast majority are a single nucleotide [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Although less common than single nucleotide substitutions, indels are distributed throughout the genome and are thought to represent approximately 10 to 25 percent of human DNA variation [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Like single-base substitutions, most indels (particularly insertions) arise through slip-mispairing [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Frameshift</strong> – Most clinically significant indels introduce a shift in the reading frame  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69699" href="/z/d/graphic/69699.html" rel="external">figure 15</a>); codons downstream of the insertion or deletion are no longer in register with the original protein sequence and a premature stop codon may eventually be created. An example is a 32 base-pair deletion in the <em>CCR5</em> gene, which encodes the receptor used by the HIV virus to enter T cells. Homozygotes for <em>CCR5</em> Delta32 are protected from HIV infection, and heterozygotes have a slower rate of disease progression [<a href="#rid19">19-21</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">If a frameshift mutation causes a premature stop codon, the transcript may undergo nonsense mediated decay. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>In-frame</strong> – Insertions or deletions of three or six nucleotides can have pathogenic consequences despite preserving the reading frame for the downstream amino acids. As an example, a 3-nucleotide (CTT) deletion at codon 508 (phenylalanine) of the <em>CFTR</em> gene (DeltaF508) is responsible for approximately 70 percent of cystic fibrosis cases in populations of European descent. This variant prevents normal trafficking of mature CFTR protein to the cell surface [<a href="#rid22">22-24</a>].

The longer a repetitive segment, the more susceptible it is to slip-mispairing. As a result, these disorders may be associated with genetic anticipation (increasing disease severity and earlier age of onset in subsequent generations due to increasing numbers of repeats).

Unlike monogenic disorders for which there are laboratory tests (eg, iron studies for hemochromatosis), there are often no biochemical tests that could provide insight about the genetic risks in polygenic disorders. Early evidence suggests that behavioral modifications can be effective for mitigating high polygenic risks [<a href="#rid41">41</a>].</p><p></p><p>Another change has come with the marketing of genetic screening for common variants directly to consumers (DTC marketed genetics). This practice has accelerated discussions of bioethical issues and has raised a range of questions regarding the oversight of genetic testing, as discussed separately.

In addition to confirming a specific diagnosis in an individual with disease manifestations, diagnostic genetic testing can affect treatment strategies, including surveillance for pleiotropic outcomes that may manifest in the future. In general, diagnostic genetic testing is conducted on patients for whom the disease genotype is suspected based on a screening test.</p><p>This subject is discussed in detail separately (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2901.html" rel="external">"Genetic testing"</a>) and in disease-specific reviews. A brief summary is as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For many highly penetrant autosomal dominant disorders such as certain cancer syndromes, testing of asymptomatic relatives of an affected individual can have important benefits for those who test positive (carriers) and those who test negative (noncarriers) for a familial variant that had been identified in a relative. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The concept of testing relatives for an identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant is referred to as familial variant testing or cascade testing. Many clinical laboratories offer this testing at a reduced price if the laboratory identifies the variant in the proband. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2901.html" rel="external">"Genetic testing", section on 'Which relatives should be tested?'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>One example is familial adenomatous polyposis, due to pathogenic variants in the <em>APC</em> gene. Individuals who carry the familial disease variant can undergo endoscopic surveillance or colectomy, while those who do not carry the variant can be reassured that their risk for polyp development is not increased. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2485.html" rel="external">"Molecular genetics of colorectal cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Another example is hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in the <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2 </em>genes. Individuals who carry the familial variant may undergo increased surveillance and/or risk-reducing surgeries, while noncarriers can avoid these procedures. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/753.html" rel="external">"Genetic testing and management of individuals at risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Identification of genetic risk factors can influence how other health conditions are managed.

It consists of approximately 21,000 protein-coding genes, along with RNA-coding, regulatory, and structural sequences distributed among 23 pairs of chromosomes (46,XX in females and 46,XY in males). Mitochondrial DNA, inherited exclusively from the mother, encodes 37 genes, 13 of which are protein coding. (See <a class="local">'Nuclear genome'</a> above and <a class="local">'Mitochondrial genome'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>DNA, RNA, and protein</strong> – DNA consists of four bases (nucleotides; A, T, C, and G) on a sugar-phosphate backbone in two antiparallel strands with complementary base-pairing to form a double helix that supplies genetic information through its sequence. Transcription is the process by which messenger RNA (mRNA; a single-stranded, less-stable nucleic acid than DNA) is synthesized using the DNA as a template  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef142009" href="/z/d/graphic/142009.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>). Translation is the process by which proteins are synthesized using mRNA as a template  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef132819" href="/z/d/graphic/132819.html" rel="external">figure 10</a>), using a combination of 20 amino acids. (See <a class="local">'Gene expression'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inheritance patterns</strong> – Inheritance of single gene (monogenic) disorders can follow classic Mendelian patterns (autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked); sometimes these patterns can vary due to factors such as incomplete penetrance, variable expression, mosaicism, and other processes. Most common traits and disorders are polygenic or multifactorial and are further influenced by environmental factors. (See <a class="local">'Modes of inheritance'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2897.html" rel="external">"Inheritance patterns of monogenic disorders (Mendelian and non-Mendelian)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Types of genetic variation</strong> – Genetic variation can occur in the germline or in somatic tissues. The consequences can be advantageous (facilitating genetic diversity and evolution) or deleterious (leading to disease due to dysfunction of vital cellular proteins). Variation can occur on different scales, from single nucleotide differences, insertions, and small deletions; to epigenetic changes to alterations of large regions of chromosomes (copy number variants, translocations) or entire chromosomes (aneuploidies). Large-scale variation affecting entire chromosomes or larger regions of chromosomes is discussed in detail separately. (See <a class="local">'Genetic variation'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129424.html" rel="external">"Basic genetics concepts: Chromosomes and cell division", section on 'Numerical and structural chromosome variation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical implications</strong> – The clinical implications of genetics continue to expand. Examples include screening in healthy people; testing for disease risk, diagnosis, or disease stratification; or treating a variety of diseases from infections, to cancer, to various single gene disorders. By convention, variants are classified from pathogenic to benign according to the confidence in their association with disease.
