Chest CT is also frequently performed following this initial evaluation, primarily as an adjunct in patients with unclear progression and in patients with rapid deterioration of uncertain etiology, while bronchoalveolar lavage is frequently performed in patients with rapid respiratory worsening. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14870.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113935.html" rel="external">"Prognosis and monitoring of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis"</a>.) </p><p>Each follow-up CT should be specifically examined for the presence of new nodules, particularly given the greater difficulty of identifying nodules in the presence of potentially widespread parenchymal abnormalities. </p><p>Lesions suspicious for lung cancer that are discovered incidentally will require additional testing to confirm the diagnosis and identify the most appropriate treatment options for that individual. (See <a class="local">'When to pursue sampling for lung cancer in patients with ILD'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4027192271"><span class="h3">Lung cancer screening programs in patients with ILD</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with ILD and a history of cigarette smoking, the decision to participate in lung cancer screening requires consideration of the severity and trajectory of the ILD. Large clinical trials of predominantly older smokers have demonstrated substantial benefit from lung cancer screening programs in this relatively unselected population. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7566.html" rel="external">"Screening for lung cancer"</a>.)</p><p>For example, the National Lung Screening Trial enrolled 53,454 adults between the ages of 55 and 74 with at least a 30 pack-year smoking history and showed that annual low-dose CT over a period of three years reduced overall mortality by 6.7 percent [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Similar findings have been observed in other trials, including the NELSON randomized trial that used volume-based assessment of pulmonary nodules [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. While these studies have typically excluded patients with known pulmonary fibrosis, the increased risk of lung cancer in patients with ILD suggests that screening CTs are also likely able to detect early-stage lung cancer in this population; however, the sensitivity and specificity for lung cancer of screening CTs in fibrotic ILD are unknown and are likely lower compared with non-ILD populations. </p><p>Of note, plain chest radiography is inferior to chest CT in screening for malignancy in general populations [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], and even less likely to be useful in the context of ILD that could potentially mask small nodules.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient selection</strong> – The potential for screening programs to identify early-stage lung cancer in patients with ILD should be balanced against the lower likelihood of being able to effectively treat lung cancer in this setting. In the absence of direct evidence, these opposing considerations suggest it is appropriate to pursue lung cancer screening in patients with ILD who would be able to tolerate a curative intervention. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The benefit of lung cancer screening is less certain in patients unable to tolerate curative therapy, although advances in other therapeutic approaches may still justify early detection of lung cancer through screening programs. Lung cancer screening will similarly have limited benefit in patients who are unwilling or unable to tolerate further diagnostic tests, primarily including common histopathologic sampling techniques, such as bronchoscopy or a transthoracic needle biopsy. Decisions about lung cancer screening should be consistent with the individual patient’s goals of care. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7566.html" rel="external">"Screening for lung cancer", section on 'Our approach to counseling for screening'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95552.html" rel="external">"Discussing goals of care"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Importance of acquiring continuous images</strong> – Multiple ILD-related factors justify acquiring continuous computed tomography (CT) images when screening for lung cancer in patients with ILD. Acquisition of continuous images (ie, with no gap between CT slices) is necessary given the increased prevalence of lung cancer in patients with ILD and the potential to miss small nodules, rather than the historical practice of acquiring gapped images for patients undergoing high resolution CT. The predominance of lung cancer in areas of fibrosis can also confound identification and characterization of nodules in these regions [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1268737466"><span class="h3">Symptom-driven evaluation for lung cancer in patients with ILD</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Common symptoms of ILD overlap with those of lung cancer, most frequently including dyspnea, cough, and functional limitation. Additional symptoms and physical examination findings can infrequently occur as a direct consequence of ILD, including hemoptysis, weight loss, chest pain, clubbing, pleural effusion, and significant lymphadenopathy. The presence of these "red flag" features should prompt consideration of lung cancer and potentially further testing to evaluate possible causes, particularly if chest CT was not recently performed.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3879327544"><span class="h2">When to pursue sampling for lung cancer in patients with ILD</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The decision to pursue histopathologic sampling in patients with ILD who have potential lung cancer is primarily based on the pretest likelihood of cancer, balanced against the potential for the patient to tolerate diagnostic procedures and effective therapy. In selected patients, it may be appropriate to forgo sampling of a suspected malignancy altogether if there is no likelihood of therapy being offered (eg, very severe ILD, advanced frailty) or if the patient would consider such therapy unacceptable. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2729096012"><span class="h3">Assessing pretest likelihood of lung cancer</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pretest likelihood of lung cancer in patients with ILD can be estimated based on a number of clinical and radiologic variables, in a similar fashion to patients without ILD. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical risk factors</strong> – Common clinical variables that suggest a higher likelihood of a nodule being malignant include older age, history of cigarette smoking, shorter duration of smoking cessation, and the presence of additional symptoms (eg, hemoptysis, weight loss) or physical examination findings (eg, clubbing, although clubbing can be seen in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [IPF]). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6986.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic evaluation of the incidental pulmonary nodule", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Imaging features</strong> – Certain imaging features increase the likelihood of a nodule being malignant, such as pleural effusions and lymphadenopathy greater than 1.5 cm in short axis. These features are uncommonly related to ILD and should raise concern of malignancy or some other additional process. Patients with a milder extent of isolated lymphadenopathy (eg, without an associated nodule or suspected malignancy) are typically observed with serial chest imaging, with further diagnostics only pursued if there is substantial growth over time. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4632.html" rel="external">"Overview of the initial evaluation, diagnosis, and staging of patients with suspected lung cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk prediction tools</strong> – There are multiple risk prediction tools that estimate the likelihood of a lung nodule being malignant, such as the Brock University cancer prediction equation (<a class="calc calc_patient" href="/z/d/html/93393.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>], although these were developed and validated primarily in patients without ILD. These calculators are based on the integration of common lung cancer risk factors, including patient age, sex, family history, smoking history, and manifestations of smoking-related disease, in addition to various nodule characteristics (eg, nodule size, density, location, presence of spiculation, and number). Despite being derived from non-ILD populations, these types of risk prediction tools may still be helpful in patients with ILD given the absence of population-specific calculators. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6986.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic evaluation of the incidental pulmonary nodule", section on 'Assessing the risk of malignancy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Period of observation</strong> – For patients with a relatively small nodule, a period of observation with a repeat CT at three to six months can identify short-interval growth that would prompt a more aggressive approach toward histopathologic sampling, or stability in size that warrants continued observation. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Role of FDG-PET</strong> – In some situations, clinical features and CT findings are sufficient to justify sampling of a nodule; however, additional testing is sometimes necessary to further inform the likelihood of malignancy and justify sampling. This is particularly true in patients with a relatively small nodule in whom there is a higher likelihood of a nondiagnostic procedure and in patients who have severe ILD or other reasons for a higher risk of complications from any sampling approach, such as pneumothorax, and the decreased ability of patients with ILD to tolerate such complications.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">An 18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan is often the next step in patients who require further assessment before sampling of a lung nodule, helping to confirm a nodule's metabolic activity or suggesting other potential areas of distant spread that may be more amenable to sampling. An important caveat of FDG-PET scans in patients with ILD is that ILD itself can often produce low-grade background metabolic activity, although this is typically minor and does not confuse interpretation of findings related to a solitary pulmonary nodule. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6986.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic evaluation of the incidental pulmonary nodule", section on 'Positron emission tomography/computed tomography'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Importantly, the maximum standardized uptake of the background lung on FDG-PET is a potential risk factor for a post-operative acute exacerbation in patients with IPF and in the general population of patients with malignancy [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]; however, the impact of this risk factor on management decisions is unknown.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3018098508"><span class="h3">Assessing candidacy for diagnostic procedures and surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When evaluating a patient’s surgical risk in the context of known ILD, we review pulmonary function tests (spirometry and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide) and potentially additional measures of oxygenation (eg, walking tests and cardiopulmonary exercise tests) performed within the past three to six months and consider both the severity and overall trajectory of the patient’s ILD. Patients with severely abnormal pulmonary function tests or who require oxygen supplementation are infrequently candidates for surgical resection, although there may be rare exceptions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6973.html" rel="external">"Preoperative physiologic pulmonary evaluation for lung resection"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6917.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of perioperative pulmonary risk"</a>.) </p><p>The evaluation of perioperative risk in general is described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6917.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of perioperative pulmonary risk"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6616.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4043923915"><span class="h2">Diagnostic sampling for lung cancer in patients with ILD</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The approach to sampling a nodule in patients with ILD closely follows the usual approach for patients without ILD, but with some additional considerations. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6986.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic evaluation of the incidental pulmonary nodule"</a>.) </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Selecting a site for sampling</strong> – In patients with ILD, the increased risk of complications from invasive procedures (eg, respiratory compromise or pneumothorax) increases the desire to sample extrapulmonary sources of tissue, when possible. Accessing potential sites of extrapulmonary metastatic disease enables avoidance of respiratory complications associated with lung biopsy and also confirmation of the advanced stage. An FDG-PET scan may help identify extrapulmonary sites of disease. (See <a class="local">'Assessing pretest likelihood of lung cancer'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/89115.html" rel="external">"Procedures for tissue biopsy in patients with suspected non-small cell lung cancer", section on 'Sampling metastatic disease'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Choice of procedure</strong> – The yield from bronchoscopy and, particularly, ultrasound-guided sampling techniques is likely similar to patients without ILD, but the potential for complications favors the procedure with the highest yield, rather than blind sampling methods (ie, bronchoscopy without ultrasound guidance). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/89115.html" rel="external">"Procedures for tissue biopsy in patients with suspected non-small cell lung cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Transthoracic needle biopsies likely carry a similar greater risk of pneumothorax in patients with ILD, indicating the importance of carefully selecting patients, clearly communicating the increased risk of complication, and rapidly identifying any complications if they occur.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Interpretation of cytopathology</strong> – Caution is needed when interpreting the results of cytopathology in patients with fibrotic ILD, as atypical cells in bronchoalveolar lavage can be misinterpreted as malignant [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The atypical cells appear to be related to the underlying inflammatory and/or fibrotic processes seen with ILD [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Proceeding directly to wedge resection</strong> – Lung tissue sampling is not an absolute requirement prior to treatment. The risk of complications in patients with ILD indicates the potential utility of direct surgical resection of highly suspicious nodules, provided lung function is sufficient to support surgical resection.

The general paradigm of lung cancer management in the setting of ILD, therefore, favors a surgical approach wherever safe and technically feasible, even in borderline medically operable patients who, in the absence of ILD, might be favored for a radiation-based approach.

Furthermore, optimal management of stage III NSCLC requires the incorporation of systemic therapy for maximum survival gains, which carries additional risk of toxicity for patients with ILD. This includes both the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients undergoing surgery, and concurrent chemoradiation, followed by immunotherapy for others.

In patients with N2 disease without ILD, we typically suggest definitive chemoradiation over a surgical approach, even though the surgery may be technically feasible. In contrast, for patients with ILD, the risks of concurrent chemoradiation are higher than in the general population, and we therefore recommend surgical resection in the setting of N2 disease, if safe and feasible. </p><p>In patients with pathologic stage II or III disease without ILD who undergo resection, chemotherapy with a platinum-based regimen provides a survival benefit compared with observation alone. In the non-ILD population, adjuvant chemotherapy with vinorelbine-cisplatin or pemetrexed-cisplatin is not associated with a decline in pulmonary function, although a nonsignificant decrease in diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) with vinorelbine-cisplatin has been reported [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].

Very limited data are available on the treatment of unresectable stage III NSCLC in patients with ILD. One study of 37 patients with ILD receiving first-line chemoradiotherapy (in the pre-immunotherapy era) reported a median survival of 34.6 months, with only one ILD-related death. On multivariable analysis, the underlying ILD pattern was associated with adverse event rates: ILD-related adverse events occurred in 82 percent of patients with a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern on computed tomography (CT) and 31 percent of patients with a non-UIP pattern [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].

The use of consolidation durvalumab in patients with ILD post-chemoradiation must be carefully considered in the context of the patient's pattern of ILD, severity of pulmonary function abnormalities, and the risk of other concurrent therapies (eg, radiation pneumonitis). Discussion on a case-by-case basis by a multidisciplinary team, including respirology experts in ILD management, is recommended.

(See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above and <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis of lung cancer in patients with ILD</strong> – The approach to the diagnosis of lung cancer in patients with ILD is generally similar to patients without ILD, with the main exception that the consequences of potential pulmonary complications from invasive procedures are greater in patients with ILD. The decision to pursue histopathologic sampling must balance the pretest likelihood of cancer against the potential for the patient to tolerate diagnostic procedures and effective therapy. (See <a class="local">'Approaches to lung cancer detection'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7566.html" rel="external">"Screening for lung cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4632.html" rel="external">"Overview of the initial evaluation, diagnosis, and staging of patients with suspected lung cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">We use a risk prediction tool, such as the Brock University cancer prediction equation (<a class="calc calc_patient" href="/z/d/html/93393.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>), to help estimate the likelihood that a given lung nodule is malignant and guide which diagnostic methods to employ in an individual patient. (See <a class="local">'When to pursue sampling for lung cancer in patients with ILD'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong> – Management decisions in patients with ILD and lung cancer require careful consideration of potential toxicities weighed against the potential benefits. The risks of treatment should also be evaluated in light of the potential harms from untreated lung cancer. (See <a class="local">'Management of lung cancer in patients with ILD'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>NSCLC</strong> – For patients with ILD and adequate pulmonary function who have stage I or II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we suggest surgical resection as the initial treatment, rather than radiation therapy (RT) (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>), provided there are no other serious comorbidities. The extent of surgical resection must balance the risks of toxicity against the oncologic benefits of a wider resection, but in the setting of ILD, where lung function is expected to deteriorate over time, preservation of lung parenchyma with sublobar resection may be warranted.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">For patients who are not candidates for surgery, there is no clear evidence to suggest superiority of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy or radiofrequency ablation as a second-choice modality. (See <a class="local">'Non-small cell lung cancer'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>SCLC</strong> – For patients with ILD and T1 or T2, node negative small cell lung cancer (SCLC)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110964" href="/z/d/graphic/110964.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), we suggest surgery rather than other modalities, as initial treatment (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Surgery may also be considered in higher stage SCLC to avoid the risks associated with radiation therapy. (See <a class="local">'Small cell lung cancer'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Locally advanced disease (SCLC or NSCLC)</strong> – In locally advanced unresectable cancers (NSCLC or SCLC), concurrent chemoradiotherapy may be delivered, although the risks of toxicities are higher than in a non-ILD population. (See <a class="local">'Non-small cell lung cancer'</a> above and <a class="local">'Small cell lung cancer'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>General considerations regarding systemic therapy</strong> — The risks and benefits of systemic therapy with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitors should be assessed for each individual patient, considering the goals of therapy (curative versus palliative), the ILD diagnosis and severity, and the anticipated prognosis from ILD. Higher risk therapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, should be discussed on a case-by-case basis with a multidisciplinary team, including those with ILD expertise. (See <a class="local">'General principles'</a> above and <a class="local">'Palliative care'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4639.html" rel="external">"Overview of the initial treatment and prognosis of lung cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113935.html" rel="external">"Prognosis and monitoring of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis"</a>.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Brown SW, Dobelle M, Padilla M, et al.
