         Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), is a complicated disease characterized by unexplained, persistent, and relapsing fatigue. There is evidence of underlying abnormalities in the nervous system, the immune system, and metabolic function in affected patients. However, diagnosis can be difficult due to the lack of a test with adequate sensitivity and specificity. The treatment of CFS will be reviewed here. The clinical features and diagnosis of this disorder and the approach to the patient with fatigue are discussed separately. (See

         Many therapies have been tried in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), but none are curative. Thus, management should be supportive and focus on treating common symptoms and comorbid conditions, such as sleep disorders, pain, depression and anxiety, memory and concentration difficulties, and dizziness and lightheadedness. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Approach to common symptoms/comorbidities'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         When caring for patient with CFS, it is important that the clinician establish a rapport with the patient to be able to provide support and reassurance. Clinicians should:

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Explain to the patient that the severity is variable but can be completely incapacitating, and that the symptoms are valid. Tell the patient that authoritative institutions, such as the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, have concluded that CFS is a real illness; the symptoms are not imaginary or due to malingering [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. It is often helpful for patients and their family members to read the IOM document to underscore the validity of the patient's disease.

         </span>
         Explain that studies have identified underlying abnormalities in the nervous system, the immune system, and metabolic function in patients with CFS, although their relationship to the symptoms and etiology of the illness is unclear [
         <a href="#rid3">

         Explain that there is no diagnostic test that is accurate enough to prove a person has the illness, which has caused some doctors to question the validity of the illness and may cause some patients to experience feelings of guilt. The patient must believe that you understand they have a real disease or you will not be able to help them.

         Promise to be honest. Patients may be mistrustful because of prior negative experiences, and regaining trust may take a great deal of time. Accept that you may not be able to help all patients with this disease.

         Address the issue of specific diagnoses that concern or worry the patient. Many patients are concerned that they may have a terrifying disease, such as cancer or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), that has not yet been diagnosed. Try to elicit such unexpressed concerns and then respond to them.

         Explain to the patient that this is not a new disease, explain that it has been described in the medical literature for several centuries, and emphasize that research over the past 30 years has improved our knowledge about CFS.

        <p>
         When necessary, we discuss the possibility of work modifications with patients and their employers so that they can continue to work; examples of such modifications include working part-time, working from home, or taking a nap or break. Some patients need to go on either short- or long-term disability. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2791.html" rel="external">
          "Disability assessment and determination in the United States"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Many controversies remain about the optimal management of CFS. Clinicians and patients should be cautious about the use of unproven interventions that are potentially dangerous and often expensive. In addition, the benefit of counseling and exercise therapies (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy and graded exercise therapy), which can produce meaningful benefits in some patients, may be of limited value or cause post-exertional fatigue in others. (See
         <a class="local">

         Common symptoms and comorbid conditions associated with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) include sleep disorders, pain, depression and anxiety, memory and concentration difficulties, and dizziness and lightheadedness. In general, treatment must be individualized, addressing the most disruptive symptoms first. Our approach to the management of these symptoms is described below. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers additional patient advice on the management of each of these conditions [

         </span>
         The most characteristic sleep problems seen in patients with CFS are frequent awakenings during the night (difficulty staying asleep) and awakening unrested nearly every morning. Some patients also report difficulty falling asleep, extreme sleepiness, intense and vivid dreaming, restless legs, or nighttime muscle spasms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sleep hygiene measures should be discussed with patients with insomnia. If that does not result in improvement, evaluation for other sleep disorders should be pursued. If CFS is the only identified cause of the sleep disturbance, pharmacologic therapies, such as over the counter products, or tricyclic agents can be tried. Clinicians experienced with CFS report that patients treated with low-dose tricyclics describe having more hours of uninterrupted sleep, although no large randomized trials have been conducted.

          Amitriptyline
         </a>
         10 mg one hour before bedtime is a good starting dose. Even though this is a very small dose, some patients still may feel groggy upon awakening; this usually passes after about a week. If this low dose does not reduce frequent nocturnal awakenings, gradual escalation of the dose is warranted. Improved sleep is usually seen within 48 hours.

         Tension headaches, myalgias/arthralgias, and sensitive skin are common with CFS and can be managed symptomatically with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">
          acetaminophen
         </a>
         . Nonpharmacologic interventions may also be helpful. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3358.html" rel="external">
          "Tension-type headache in adults: Acute treatment"
         </a>

          "Approach to the management of chronic non-cancer pain in adults"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         If these interventions do not work, we often initiate therapy with a tricyclic agent. Several randomized trials have shown that low-dose tricyclic therapy is beneficial in fibromyalgia (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5627.html" rel="external">
          "Treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"
         </a>
         ), and given the similarity in epidemiology and symptoms, some clinicians consider CFS and fibromyalgia to be part of a spectrum of disorders. However, no large trials have been conducted in patients with CFS.
        </p>
        <p>
         When used for fibromyalgia or CFS, tricyclics do not seem to work via an antidepressant effect; when patients respond, the response is immediate (24 to 48 hours), not after a two- to three-week delay as would be expected with depression. In addition, doses much lower (10 to 20 mg at bedtime) than prescribed for depression typically are used; and in patients with coexisting mood disorders, those disorders do not seem to respond to such low-dose tricyclics.

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         Depression and anxiety may occur as a consequence of CFS, and screening for depression is advised (

          calculator 1
         </a>
         ). Patients diagnosed with either condition should be offered appropriate pharmacologic therapy and/or psychotherapy. (See

          "Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, antidepressants are not a direct treatment for CFS, and the results of small controlled studies of antidepressant medications have yielded conflicting results. As an example, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8465" href="/z/d/drug information/8465.html" rel="external">
          fluoxetine
         </a>
         in 96 patients, 45 percent of whom were depressed, showed no benefit of therapy at eight weeks [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. By contrast, a study of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9762" href="/z/d/drug information/9762.html" rel="external">
          phenelzine

          6

         We refer patients with substantial cognitive problems for neurocognitive evaluation. Deficits in attention, complex information processing, and initial acquisition of new information have been documented in patients with CFS. These deficiencies are not explained by coexisting psychiatric disorders, although patients who also suffer from depression may incur additional cognitive problems.

          8

         We do not routinely perform tilt-table testing on our patients with CFS since it is expensive, moderately uncomfortable, and without proven utility. However, we discuss the use of an empiric course of

         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. We begin with fludrocortisone at a dose of 0.1 mg daily. If there is no benefit in two weeks, we increase the dose to 0.2 mg daily. If this is not effective, we switch to atenolol at an initial dose of 25 mg daily, and increase the dose every two weeks up to a maximum of 100 mg daily, titrating it against pulse and blood pressure.

         Remaining physically active is important for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), as being active may improve fatigue and other symptoms in some patients, as well as physical functioning. However, the approach to physical conditioning must be individualize, since exercise can exacerbate post-exertional malaise (PEM), which is a worsening of symptoms following physical or mental exertion [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Symptoms of PEM typically present 12 to 48 hours after activity and last for days or even weeks after that. In a retrospective study of 150 patients with CFS, 90 percent experienced PEM; fatigue was the most commonly exacerbated symptom but cognitive difficulties, sleep disturbances, headaches, muscle pain, and flu-like feelings were also described [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         To minimize PEM, clinicians and patients must determine the patient's individual limits regarding the degree of activity that can be tolerated. We use a strategy for exercise therapy that includes establishment of a baseline of achievable patient-specific exercise or physical activity, usually determined by or in mutual decision with the patient, followed by a gradual, incremental increase in the duration of time spent physically active. We encourage patients to gently push themselves, but emphasize that they should not try to do too much, even if they happen to have much more energy one day. The objective is not an immediate return to pre-illness functioning, but rather maintenance of a slowly progressive level of activity. Overall, the type and amount of exercise should be discussed and individualized with each patient.
        </p>
        <p>
         Data to support the use of individualized pacing are based upon observational studies [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15-17
         </a>

          Antibiotics

         – There is often a great temptation to give patients empiric treatment with antibiotics, especially if the patient happens to have a positive Lyme serology. It is important to appreciate, however, that a positive Lyme serology does not diagnose Lyme disease, which is a clinical diagnosis. A true positive Lyme serology merely confirms past exposure to

          Graded exercise therapy

         – In a structured program such as GET, patients aim for a goal of 30 minutes of light exercise five times per week, after which the intensity and aerobic nature of the exercise can be gradually increased. A target heart rate range should be set to avoid overexertion, generally &lt;100 beats per minute, and GET should be supervised by a physical or exercise therapist.

         CFS is inherently difficult to study because there is no international consensus on the case definition. Patients' symptoms can also vary over time, and outcome measures are usually subjective in the absence of an accurate objective marker of disease severity. As an example, upon reanalyzing data from studies that used a stricter case definition, CBT decreased fatigue (low strength of evidence) but did not affect quality of life (also low strength of evidence), and there was insufficient evidence on impact on function, employment, and global improvement [

         Guidance from national organizations regarding these interventions is somewhat mixed. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention removed discussion of CBT and GET from its patient information website, and it suggests avoiding "push and crash" cycles [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines from 2007 endorsed CBT and GET and noted insufficient evidence to suggest pacing; these are undergoing review [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]. Guidance from a major physicians' organization in Alberta, Canada presents both GET and pacing as evidence-based strategies and acknowledges the debate about the relative merits [

         The short-term prognosis for recovery of function is generally poor in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The long-term prognosis appears to be better, although studies have been conflicting. In one report of 144 patients followed by questionnaire, for example, the proportion of patients with functional impairment was 73 percent at six weeks to six months and only 33 percent at two to four years [
         <a href="#rid60">
          60
         </a>
         ]. However, other studies noted a poorer outcome. A prospective study found that only 4 of 27 patients achieved sustained remission during a three-year observation period [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ], and a retrospective evaluation of 495 patients with CFS or idiopathic chronic fatigue (unexplained debilitating fatigue lasting more than six months that does not fulfill criteria for CFS) reported symptomatic improvement in 64 percent at 1.5 years but complete resolution in only 2 percent [
         <a href="#rid61">
          61
         </a>
         ]. In the latter series, patients with CFS had a greater symptom severity and a lower level of functioning at follow-up than those with idiopathic chronic fatigue. Regardless of the long-term prognosis, neither CFS nor chronic fatigue results in organ failure. CFS has not been associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality but may be associated with an increased risk for suicide [

         Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), is a complicated disease characterized by unexplained, persistent, and relapsing fatigue. There is evidence of underlying abnormalities in the nervous system, the immune system, and metabolic function in affected patients. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction'

         Management should be supportive and focus on treating common symptoms and comorbid conditions, such as sleep disorders, pain, depression and anxiety, memory and concentration difficulties, and dizziness and lightheadedness. (See
         <a class="local">

         Remaining physically active is important for patients with CFS, as being active may improve fatigue and other symptoms in some patients, as well as physical functioning. However, exercise may exacerbate post-exertional malaise (PEM), which is a worsening of symptoms following physical or mental exertion. To minimize PEM, clinicians and patients must determine the patient's individual limits regarding the degree of activity that can be tolerated. (See
         <a class="local">
          'The role of exercise'
         </a>

         </span>
         A number of medication, dietary, and behavioral interventions have been evaluated for the treatment of CFS. Many interventions have been found to be of no benefit. However, the benefit of others is unclear, and they should be considered on a case-by-case basis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Interventions of unclear or no benefit'

         The short-term prognosis for recovery of function is generally poor in CFS. The long-term prognosis appears to be better, although studies have been conflicting. (See
