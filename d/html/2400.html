         Seafood allergy is the most common food allergy in adults and among the six most prevalent food allergies in young children [
         <a href="#rid1">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The term "seafood" encompasses the following:

         The term "shellfish," a subset of seafood, includes crustaceans and mollusks.
        </p>
        <p>
         Seafood allergies are immunologic responses to proteins in these foods and include immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody-mediated allergy, as well as other allergic syndromes [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. They are distinct from adverse reactions due to toxins or infectious contaminants, which are not immune based [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. (See

        <p>
         In this topic review, the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of seafood allergies will be presented. Issues of cross-reactivity among different forms of seafood are also addressed. General discussions of food allergy are presented separately in appropriate topic reviews. (See

         Allergies to seafood are estimated to affect 1 to 3 percent of the population [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,5-11
         </a>
         ]. Allergy to shellfish is among the leading causes of food allergy in adults and the most common cause of food-allergic emergency department visits [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Several large studies have provided estimates of prevalence [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-8,10,13
         </a>
         ]. One multinational survey of 17,280 adults (aged 20 to 44 years) from 15 countries questioned participants about foods that "nearly always" caused "illness" or "trouble" [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Shrimp, oysters, and fish were implicated by 2.3, 2.3, and 2.2 percent, respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
         Internationally, patterns of seafood consumption likely influence the prevalence of specific fish and shellfish allergies. As examples, allergy to whelk is seen in Korea, where this mollusk is a popular form of seafood, and barnacle allergy has been reported in the Portuguese population [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,15
         </a>
         ]. A random calling survey in Singapore found a reported rate of shellfish allergy of 7.2 percent in 4- to 6-year-olds and 11.6 percent in 14- to 16-year-olds; applying features of a convincing history reduced these rates to 1.2 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. However, these rates are higher than similar studies from the United States [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6,10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A 2019 United States adult study that utilized a survey administered to United States population representative panelists, applying criteria to identify convincing allergy based on symptoms through self-reporting, found a rate of 2.9 percent shellfish and 0.9 percent finned fish allergy [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The same approach for children reported a rate of 1.3 percent for shellfish and 0.6 percent for finned fish allergy [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. A 2004 American study estimated the prevalence of seafood allergy using a nationwide cross-sectional telephone survey in which a standardized questionnaire was administered to households chosen by random calling [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Criteria were established in advance to define seafood allergy by either a convincing history of symptoms (eg, urticaria, angioedema, trouble breathing, oral pruritus, or throat closing) or a diagnosis of allergy by a clinician. A total of 5529 households completed the survey (67.3 percent participation rate), representing a census of 14,948 individuals. Fish or shellfish allergy was reported in 6 percent of households and among individuals as follows: 2.3 percent for any seafood allergy, 2 percent for shellfish, 0.4 percent for fish, and 0.2 percent for both fish and shellfish.
        </p>
        <p>
         This study also revealed the following findings:

         <span class="glyph">
          ●

         Prevalence rates in children were significantly lower than those in adults in all categories, as follows: any seafood allergy (0.6 versus 2.8 percent), shellfish (0.5 versus 2.5 percent), and fish (0.2 versus 0.5 percent). Boys were affected more often than girls.
        </p>
        <p>

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         In adults, the sex trend was reversed, and rates in females were significantly higher than in males for both shellfish allergy (2.6 versus 1.5 percent) and fish allergy (0.6 versus 0.2 percent).

         The highest rates of seafood allergy were reported by African Americans, with shellfish reported as the leading cause. In another study, the high rate of shellfish allergy in African American children (compared with White children) was substantially mediated by a higher rate of sensitization to cockroach and house dust mite, supporting the notion that sensitization to homologous tropomyosin proteins in the environmental allergens may influence shellfish allergy [
         <a href="#rid17">

         The major allergenic proteins in seafood that are responsible for IgE-mediated reactions have been identified [

         Parvalbumins are major allergens in fish [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Enolases, aldolases, and fish gelatin are also significant allergens [

         Tropomyosins, sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein, and glycogen phosphorylase proteins are major allergens in shrimp and possibly other shellfish [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21,22
         </a>
         ]. Other allergens, including the muscle protein myosin light chain, are prominent allergens in shrimp. Several additional proteins (eg, arginine kinase and hemocyanin) are also present in other arthropods (ie, dust mites, cockroaches), accounting for cross-reactivity between these groups [
         <a href="#rid23">

         The pathogenesis of non-IgE-mediated seafood allergy is unclear. A syndrome that clinically resembles protein-induced enterocolitis has been described in both children and adults. (See

         IgE-mediated allergic reactions are the most commonly described type of allergic reactions to seafood ingestion. These may present as generalized reactions, asthmatic reactions in response to occupational or household exposures, or as food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis.
        </p>
        <p>
         IgE-mediated reactions are rapid in onset (usually within minutes to one hour after ingestion), and extra-gastrointestinal manifestations, such as urticaria, angioedema, respiratory symptoms, and laryngeal edema, are common  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66333" href="/z/d/graphic/66333.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). These can range in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis; severe reactions are not uncommon [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,25
         </a>
         ]. The clinical features of IgE-mediated reactions are discussed in more detail separately. (See

          "Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Occupational and household exposures involving inhalation of cooking or processing vapors may cause asthma [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26,27
         </a>
         ]. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis to seafood has also been reported. In this condition, the food causes symptoms only if ingestion is followed soon after by exercise or exertion but is tolerated in the absence of exertion. Wheat products and seafood are the two most frequently implicated foods in this disorder [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28

         IgE-mediated fish and shellfish allergies can vary from mild to severe. In one United States prevalence study, 60 to 70 percent of respondents experienced urticaria/angioedema, and over one-half reported dyspnea or throat tightness [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Consistent with this, approximately one-half of reactions prompted evaluation by a clinician or care in an emergency department. Despite the severe symptoms, administration of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/z/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">
          epinephrine
         </a>
         was provided to only 16 percent of individuals treated in medical settings. In a study of adults, 57 percent of fish and shellfish allergies were classified as severe [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. In a study of children, 48.7 percent of shellfish and 49 percent of those with finned fish allergy reported severe reactions [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. In a retrospective chart review of 68 children with shrimp allergy from a referral center in Texas, the rate of anaphylaxis (compared with lesser reactions) was 12 percent [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Deaths from seafood allergy have been recorded. In a registry of food-induced fatal anaphylaxis comprised primarily of children, 1 of 32 deaths was due to fish [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25

         In some regions, particularly Spain, fish is a prominent cause of FPIES in infants and young children. FPIES is a non-IgE-mediated form of food allergy that presents with profuse vomiting and/or diarrhea several hours after ingestion of a given food [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31,32

         Seafood may also cause an enterocolitis-like disorder in adults, with delayed onset of nausea, crampy abdominal pain, and protracted vomiting or diarrhea [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,33,34

         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. This appears to be primarily reported in response to mollusks. Adults typically present after having experienced this on several occasions, reporting that they had attributed the first one or two reactions to possible food poisoning. Indeed, these reactions clinically mimic diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP), beginning one to six hours after ingestion and resolving within a few hours to three days, depending on severity. (See
         <a class="local">

        </p>
        <p>
         The etiology of these enterocolitis-like reactions in adults is unclear. Their repeated occurrence in certain individuals suggests either that some persons are more susceptible to toxic components in these foods or that this reaction represents a form of allergy. There are very few studies of the pathogenesis of these reactions, although one study of adults with isolated gastrointestinal symptoms to various types of seafood included six patients who reacted repeatedly to oyster in whom specific IgE was generally undetectable [

         A general discussion of the diagnosis of food allergy is presented elsewhere. A summary of this information, with a focus on those aspects that are most relevant to the diagnosis of seafood allergy, is provided below. (See

         For suspected IgE-mediated reactions, the history of an immediate reaction consisting of typical allergic symptoms supported by positive tests for specific IgE antibodies is sufficient to establish a diagnosis. Either skin prick tests or in vitro tests for IgE are usually performed initially. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2397.html" rel="external">
          "History and physical examination in the patient with possible food allergy"

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The positive predictive value of skin prick testing with commercial seafood extracts and IgE immunoassays has not been compared with clinical reactivity in appropriate populations using oral food challenges. This is true for seafood and for most foods.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, the negative predictive value of skin prick testing with commercial food extracts is generally high. In our clinic, we have found that negative skin tests with commercial seafood extracts that are in accordance with the clinical history are usually reliable. If there is uncertainty or the clinician has limited experience with a specific commercial extract, the actual food can be used for skin testing instead.
        </p>
        <p>
         If the history is suggestive of allergy and one or both forms of testing are negative, then it is useful to repeat skin testing using the implicated seafood, prepared in a manner similar to the exposure that caused the reaction (eg, raw if sushi caused the reaction). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnostic pitfalls'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Component-resolved diagnostics (CRD) refers to in vitro testing to determine if a patient's IgE binds to individual proteins within an allergenic food. Some CRD testing for allergenic proteins in seafood is commercially available, although these tests are not able to obviate the need for food challenge. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95766.html" rel="external">
          "Component testing for animal-derived food allergies", section on 'Shrimp'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In each case of diagnosed seafood allergy, possible allergy to cross-reactive fish or shellfish must be addressed. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Cross-reactivity'

         If the history and/or IgE test results do not clearly indicate an allergy, then clinician-supervised oral food challenges would be required to exclude the diagnosis. The use of challenges in the diagnosis of food allergy is presented separately. (See

         The diagnosis of enterocolitis in adults would also require challenge, although patients who have experienced these reactions on several occasions may decline, understandably.

         Allergy to the fish parasite
         <em>
          Anisakis simplex
         </em>
         represents another potential diagnostic dilemma [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55,56
         </a>
         ].
         <em>
          Anisakis simplex
         </em>
         is a nematode that infects fish worldwide and can cause several health issues in humans. Humans are accidental hosts who can become transiently infected as a result of eating the raw or undercooked flesh of infected fish (typically herring, hake, black plaice, and cod) [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55
         </a>
         ]. Deep freezing and rethawing of fish kills the parasite [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57
         </a>
         ]. Some countries (including the United States) have legislation requiring that any fish intended for raw consumption must be deep frozen for specified time periods (which differ depending on the temperatures used) [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57
         </a>
         ]. However, this may not be strictly enforced [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]. The majority of cases of
         <em>
          Anisakis simplex
         </em>
         reactions have been reported at the highest rates in Portugal and Norway, with reports from many other areas of the world [
         <a href="#rid56">

         One manifestation of
         <em>
          Anisakis
         </em>
         allergy is a generalized reaction involving urticaria, angioedema, abdominal pain, and/or anaphylaxis, which develops as the live larvae penetrate the gastric mucosa [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55,59
         </a>
         ]. Gastrointestinal symptoms may be minimal or absent, and a delay in the onset of symptoms of between 2 and 24 hours is typical [
         <a href="#rid60">
          60,61
         </a>
         ]. This delay between consumption of raw fish and onset of symptoms can be an important diagnostic clue to the presence of
         <em>
          Anisakis
         </em>
         allergy.

         A major allergenic protein (Ani s 7) in
         <em>
          Anisakis
         </em>
         species has been identified, although a test for the presence of specific IgE to Ani s 7 is not commercially available [
         <a href="#rid62">
          62
         </a>
         ]. It appears that parasite larvae must be viable to induce the reaction described previously, as neither skin testing with whole body extracts nor oral challenge with lyophilized parasites reproduces symptoms [
         <a href="#rid63">
          63-65
         </a>
         ]. Excretory or secretory proteins produced by the live larvae have been implicated as possible allergens [
         <a href="#rid60">

         <em>

         allergy likely contributes to occupational respiratory allergy and contact dermatitis in fish processing workers. In one study, sensitization to
         <em>
          Anisakis
         </em>
         was as common as that to fish [
         <a href="#rid65">
          65
         </a>
         ]. However, it is not clear what other clinical syndromes can be correctly attributed to
         <em>
          Anisakis
         </em>
         allergy. The optimal approach to skin testing is also uncertain, although prick-by-prick skin testing with live larvae appears to be most consistently positive in patients with urticaria/angioedema or anaphylaxis [
         <a href="#rid60">
          60

         can be confirmed with serologic and gastroenterologic tests and is presented separately. (See

         Parvalbumins in fish and tropomyosins in shellfish are responsible for the majority of IgE-mediated allergies [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,24,68

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Because the major allergenic proteins for fish and shellfish are different, individuals are usually allergic to one group or the other, although it is possible to be allergic to both. Allergy to both fish and shellfish was reported by approximately 10 percent of all those with any seafood allergy in the American telephone survey previously discussed [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. In a retrospective study of a referral population of children with seafood allergy, 21 percent with finned fish allergy reported allergy to shellfish; however, this overlap likely represents co-allergy because rates of hen's egg and peanut allergy were higher [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. Formal challenge studies with sufficient numbers of people would be required to establish definite estimates.
        </p>
        <p>
         Among persons with allergy to a fish or shellfish, approximately 30 to 75 percent will react clinically to more than one type of fish or shellfish [
         <a href="#rid69">
          69
         </a>
         ]. Conversely, it is also possible to be allergic to just one specific type of fish or shellfish, such as tropical sole, swordfish, or one type of shrimp [
         <a href="#rid70">
          70,71
         </a>
         ]. Patients in the latter group generally lack IgE antibodies to the major allergenic proteins and are presumed to be sensitized to a species-specific protein. Those with bony finned fish allergy may tolerate cartilaginous fish such as dogfish and ray [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42,72,73
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         As is the case for many foods that share homologous proteins, sensitization (ie, positive allergy tests) to multiple species is more common than clinical reactivity (ie, the development of actual symptoms on ingestion). A Spanish study evaluated the relevance of sensitization to six regionally important species in 79 children with fish allergy [
         <a href="#rid74">
          74
         </a>
         ]. While all subjects had positive skin tests to multiple species, only 39 percent had clinical reactions. Thus, positive test results alone are not sufficient to determine which related foods will cause symptoms.

         In summary, a fish-allergic patient is at high risk for reactions to other fish. There are insufficient data to predict which types of fish are more likely to be tolerated based on the known allergy. In addition, skin testing or in vitro tests alone are often not sufficient to identify which types will cause clinical reaction. Homologous fish and chicken proteins may account for rare co-allergy to both of these foods [

         It is also common for patients allergic to shellfish to react clinically to more than one type of shellfish. Extensive cross-reactivity among shellfish is explained by the fact that invertebrate tropomyosin is a pan allergen with significant sequence homology throughout many invertebrate species, including crustaceans, mollusks, squid, octopus, parasites, and non-marine insects (such as cockroaches, grasshoppers, and dust mites) [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,81-83
         </a>
         ]. However, there are clearly other factors that influence cross-reactivity as homology cannot be used to predict an individual patient's sensitivity patterns. Invertebrate tropomyosins demonstrate less homology with vertebrate tropomyosins [
         <a href="#rid84">
          84
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Overall, based on limited data, approximately 75 percent with a crustacean allergy react to more than one type, but less than 50 percent react to mollusks [
         <a href="#rid69">
          69
         </a>
         ]. Conversely, those with mollusk allergy are high risk (&gt;70 percent) to react to crustaceans. Among mollusk-allergic patients, approximately 50 percent report reactions to more than one type of mollusk. Between 10 to 15 percent of patients allergic to any shellfish are allergic to both crustaceans and mollusks.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the few studies examining cross-reactivity among foods within the crustacean or mollusk groups, sensitization was very high, and clinical reactivity was lower although very significant. The following studies provide information on these observations [

          Cross-contact
         </strong>
         – Patients must be counseled about accidental exposure to food allergens via cross-contact (ie, inadvertent exposure to the allergenic food by contamination of "safe" foods with small amounts of the culprit food). With seafood, this typically occurs at seafood counters in grocery stores, restaurants, and as a result of shared equipment (especially fryers). It is safer to buy seafood that is individually packaged and frozen. Reactions due to contact with contaminated saliva through kissing or sharing of utensils have also been reported [

          Food labels
         </strong>
         – Patients must read all food labels. Legislation has been enacted in the United States mandating that the ingredients labels on food packages plainly identify the presence of nine specified allergenic foods. These nine foods include fish and crustacean shellfish (as well as cow's milk, hen's eggs, tree nuts, peanuts, sesame, wheat, and soybeans) [

          Unexpected and nonfood sources
         </strong>
         – Seafood components can appear in unexpected foods as well as in nonfood items. As an example, fish gelatin is a food additive derived from fish skin. The use of fish gelatin as a food additive is increasing in parallel with concerns over the risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy with bovine gelatin [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. Usual doses of fish gelatin are tolerated by most fish-allergic persons, but anaphylactic reactions have been reported [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,96,97
         </a>
         ]. Results from one small series suggest that some individuals with fish allergy may tolerate fish oil supplements as well [
         <a href="#rid98">
          98

         Fish products can be used as clarifying (or fining) agents in the manufacture of some wines. However, available studies indicate that residual fining agents are unlikely to cause allergic reactions in fish-allergic individuals. (See

         – Many of the allergenic proteins in seafood are stable and could be vaporized or released in steam during cooking.

          Caution with antiulcer treatments

         – Antiulcer drugs increase gastric pH and may impair digestion of food proteins. In a mouse model, antiulcer drugs were reported to predispose to allergic reactions to caviar caused by unstable allergens that would be normally destroyed by digestion [

          100
         </a>
         ]. The codfish preparation digested at pH 3 produced symptoms in these patients at either a lower dose or after a shorter time interval compared with codfish digested at pH 2, suggesting that antiulcer therapy may place patients at increased risk for reactions to ingested seafood.

         Seafood is obviously not an essential component of the diet, and the most straightforward approach in managing any food allergy is
         <strong>
          complete
         </strong>
         avoidance of the culprit food and all similar foods. This strategy would be logically expected to minimize the chances of accidental exposure of the culprit food through cross-contact.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, there may be disadvantages to the strategy of avoiding all similar foods. There is some evidence, for example, that removing foods from the diet can increase the risk of becoming allergic to them. This appeared to be the case in a report of seven children with atopic conditions who were sensitized to fish but had no clinical symptoms upon ingestion [
         <a href="#rid101">
          101
         </a>
         ]. The children were placed on fish-elimination diets and followed prospectively. Within the ensuing two to five years, all of the children developed clinical allergy to fish, including two with anaphylaxis. Similar examples of this phenomenon exist for other foods [
         <a href="#rid102">
          102
         </a>
         ]. Possible reasons for the heightened sensitivity include both lack of exposure and the opposite explanation, namely, ongoing low-level exposure (through hidden sources or cross-contact).
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, if a patient with allergy to a certain fish or shellfish wishes to continue eating other forms of seafood, the clinician's recommendations must carefully balance the patient's preferences with what is known about cross-reactivity among seafood. The severity of the patient's reaction also influences the decision. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Cross-reactivity'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The following scenarios illustrate some of the issues involved and our management approach. Individual clinicians may decide to adopt different strategies depending on their level of expertise and the resources available (eg, ability to perform oral food challenges).

         For patients who have experienced life-threatening anaphylaxis to a specific shellfish, we advise avoidance of all shellfish, largely because of the higher chance of encountering a cross-reactive tropomyosin in these foods. Similarly, a person who reacted to one finned fish would usually be advised to avoid all finned fish. We typically do
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         advise patients with serious reactions to shellfish to avoid finned fish (or vice versa), since the major allergens in shellfish and finned fish are different. However, patients must be wary of settings in which cross-contamination is common, such as seafood restaurants. It may be wise to avoid these settings altogether.

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         For patients with non-life-threatening reactions, we are more flexible in our approach. If patients are content to avoid all shellfish or finned fish (depending on which group they reacted to), we do not discourage this approach. However, if a patient wishes to continue to include similar seafood in the diet, then a careful evaluation must be performed to determine which specific foods may be safely eaten. As an example, a patient who developed an allergy to codfish that is moderate in severity and has been avoiding all seafood for several months may ask about the safety of eating tuna, which had been a regular component of the patient's diet before the reaction.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In this case, we would first perform skin testing with commercial extracts of tuna. If negative, we would allow the ingestion of tuna because the experience in our clinic suggests that the negative predictive value of skin prick testing for seafoods is generally high.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         However, if there was any clinical suspicion of tuna allergy or if the clinician was uncomfortable proceeding without additional evaluation, skin testing and oral food challenge with fresh tuna should be performed. If skin tests were positive to tuna but the patient still had a strong interest in eating it, we would perform a cautious graded challenge to determine whether there was true clinical reactivity (because false-positive skin tests are not uncommon).
        </p>

         We allow persons to continue to eat seafood that has not caused symptoms in the recent past and which they have eaten regularly (similar to having just passed an oral food challenge). As an example, a patient with a newly diagnosed allergy to codfish who continued to eat tuna without incident after the reaction can simply continue to do so.

          Epidemiology

         – Allergy to fish or shellfish (crustaceans and mollusks) affects nearly 1 in 50 adults and is a leading cause of food-induced anaphylaxis. Fish is a common cause of food allergy in children, although rates of seafood allergy are lower than in adults. (See

          Immediate and delayed reactions

         – Manifestations of immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated seafood allergy include urticaria/angioedema/anaphylaxis, occupational asthma, and food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis. IgE-mediated seafood allergy can be severe and is usually long lasting. There are also non-IgE-mediated forms of allergy that present with delayed gastrointestinal reactions, although limited data are available about these reactions. (See

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Diagnosis of IgE-mediated seafood allergy is based on a careful history supported by skin prick tests or in vitro tests for specific IgE. Positive tests for food-specific IgE may be present to seafood that is clinically tolerated, and a supervised oral food challenge may be necessary for definitive diagnosis. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Diagnostic challenges
         </strong>
         – Several factors may alter the allergenicity of seafood and complicate diagnosis, including preparation method, changes as a result of digestion, and the specific part of the fish that is consumed  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65968" href="/z/d/graphic/65968.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). The differential diagnosis includes allergy to seafood parasites and nonallergic reactions to toxins in seafood. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnostic pitfalls'

         <strong>
          Cross-reactivity among types of seafood
         </strong>
         – Rates of clinical cross-reactivity to different types of seafood within a group are high (ie, a person allergic to one fish is likely to react to others). In contrast, a minority (approximately 10 percent) of those allergic to any seafood are allergic to both fish and shellfish, although this observation is based on limited data. Because false positives on skin testing are possible, supervised challenge may be needed to definitely determine if a patient reacts to a specific seafood. (See

         Patients with life-threatening reactions are generally advised to avoid all related seafood. Some patients will choose to avoid all seafood to minimize the risk of exposure through cross-contact. (See
         <a class="local">

         Among those with less severe reactions, some may wish to continue eating other forms of seafood in the future. In this case, testing and possibly oral challenges are needed to determine which specific foods are tolerated. (See
