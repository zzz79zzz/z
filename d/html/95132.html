The nature of the reaction may not be immediately apparent, because severe reactions begin with nonspecific symptoms such as fever or chills. In addition, patients receiving transfusions often have complex underlying clinical conditions, the symptoms of which may mimic a transfusion reaction. Thus, a patient experiencing symptoms or signs consistent with an acute transfusion reaction must be evaluated promptly, with input from the transfusion service, and treated as expeditiously as possible to minimize the impact of the reaction.</p><p>This topic describes our approach to determining the nature of a suspected acute reaction (the type of reaction and likely causes) following transfusion of blood products.</p><p>Specific acute transfusion reactions and details of their management are discussed more extensively in separate topic reviews listed below.

(See <a class="local">'Mortality'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H381690711"><span class="h3">Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>TACO is a form of pulmonary edema due to volume excess or circulatory overload; it typically occurs in patients who often have a preexisting positive fluid balance, receive a large volume of a transfused product over a short period of time, and/or have underlying cardiovascular disease. Management includes diuresis and supplementary oxygen; ventilatory support may rarely be required. TACO is a relatively common reaction. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7919.html" rel="external">"Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)"</a> and <a class="local">'Frequency of reactions'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3681907240"><span class="h3">Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>TRALI is a life-threatening form of acute lung injury that occurs when recipient neutrophils are activated by the transfused product in an appropriately primed pulmonary vasculature, due to the transfused product having either anti-HLA or anti-neutrophil antibodies. Presenting findings include fever, chills, and respiratory distress. Therapy is largely supportive and may include intubation and mechanical ventilation. A subsequent evaluation is directed at identifying an implicated donor so that individual does not continue to donate and potentially cause TRALI in other patients. The patient can receive blood products from other donors without restrictions but should not receive any remaining untransfused portion of the implicated product. Any other products from the implicated donor should be quarantined and not transfused to any patients until TRALI is excluded. Prior to mitigation strategies, TRALI was among the more common acute transfusion reactions despite being historically under reported. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7926.html" rel="external">"Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)"</a> and <a class="local">'Frequency of reactions'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4100886368"><span class="h3">Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>AHTR is a life-threatening reaction caused by acute intravascular hemolysis of transfused red blood cells (RBCs). This may be due to ABO incompatibility or caused by a reaction to alleles in other RBC antigen systems. ABO incompatible transfusion reactions are often the result of a clerical error leading to transfusion of a product not intended for the recipient. Presenting symptoms and/or signs include fever, chills, flank pain, and oozing from intravenous sites. It is critical to immediately stop the transfusion and communicate with the transfusion service; this allows for appropriate record checking, which may prevent administration of a wrongly labeled unit to another patient. Treatment involves aggressive hydration and diuresis. AHTRs are rare. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7924.html" rel="external">"Red blood cell antigens and antibodies"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7932.html" rel="external">"Hemolytic transfusion reactions", section on 'Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions'</a> and <a class="local">'Frequency of reactions'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4263004859"><span class="h3">Transfusion-associated sepsis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Transfusion-associated sepsis (or bacterial infection) is caused by transfusion of a product that contains a microorganism. Initial findings may include fever, chills, and hypotension. Unlike sepsis from an underlying localized infection, transfusion-associated sepsis may involve a large intravenous inoculum, which in the case of gram-negative organisms, could include an infusion of endotoxin, leading to high fever. Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics and hemodynamic support. Transfusion-associated sepsis is relatively rare. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3805.html" rel="external">"Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection"</a> and <a class="local">'Frequency of reactions'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1005707639"><span class="h3">Anaphylactic transfusion reaction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Anaphylactic reactions are severe allergic reactions that include angioedema, wheezing, and/or hypotension. Anaphylactic reactions may occur in IgA-deficient individuals who produce anti-IgA antibodies that react with IgA in the transfused product, or patients who have allergies to another constituent in the transfused product. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7947.html" rel="external">"Immunologic transfusion reactions", section on 'Anaphylactic transfusion reactions'</a>.)</p><p>Management may include <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/z/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a>, antihistamines, and vasopressors, depending on the degree of allergic symptoms. Anaphylactic reactions are relatively rare. (See <a class="local">'Anaphylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3649463482"><span class="h2">Non-life-threatening reactions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Non-life-threatening reactions are listed in order of frequency. (See <a class="local">'Frequency of reactions'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3298166854"><span class="h3">Allergic transfusion reaction (ATR)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Allergic transfusion reactions are most often associated with itching and hives. These reactions can be due to both recipient predisposition to allergic reactions and donor factors. The most common cause is an antigen-antibody interaction that occurs between patient and the product; commonly implicated antigens include a number of donor serum proteins. An allergic transfusion reaction is not a contraindication to continuing the transfusion as long as it is clear there are no other allergic symptoms. Antihistamines can be given, but are not indicated prophylactically. Allergic transfusion reactions are common. (See <a class="local">'Frequency of reactions'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7947.html" rel="external">"Immunologic transfusion reactions", section on 'Allergic reactions'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6713978"><span class="h3">Febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>FNHTRs are characterized by fever, usually accompanied by chills, in the absence of other systemic symptoms. Because the development of other symptoms is not known at the time of the initial fever, FNHTR is a diagnosis of exclusion; the possibility of other febrile transfusion reactions must be eliminated, including AHTR, sepsis, and TRALI. The most common cause of FNHTR is release of cytokines from white blood cells (WBCs) in a product that has not been leukoreduced. Management is symptomatic, generally with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a>. High quality evidence to support the prophylactic use of premedication with acetaminophen or antihistamines is lacking; this subject is discussed in more detail separately. FNHTRs are common. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7947.html" rel="external">"Immunologic transfusion reactions", section on 'Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions'</a> and <a class="local">'Frequency of reactions'</a> below.)</p><p>With platelet transfusion, a similar reaction to FNHTR can occur, with chills and/or rigors in the absence of fever.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3542146459"><span class="h3">Hypotensive transfusion reactions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hypotensive transfusion reactions are characterized by a drop in blood pressure without other causes of hypotension. Systolic blood pressure decreases by 30 mmHg or more and may fall to &lt;80 mmHg within minutes of onset of transfusion and returns to baseline once the transfusion is stopped. Other types of transfusion reactions associated with hypotension (eg, acute hemolytic reaction, transfusion-related acute lung injury [TRALI], sepsis, anaphylaxis), and underlying disease must be excluded before a diagnosis of primary hypotensive reaction is made.</p><p>Hypotensive transfusion reactions have been reported most commonly with platelet transfusion; they have also occurred during therapeutic apheresis procedures and in patients on extracorporeal circuits [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. Predisposing factors include use of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor by the recipient, or filtration through a negatively charged leukocyte reduction filter (which are no longer commonly used) [<a href="#rid1">1,4,5</a>]. The mechanism is thought to involve vasoactive kinins (eg, bradykinin). The reactions are rapidly reversible and generally do not require specific treatment or prevention, except for possible avoidance of ACE inhibitors prior to planned transfusion or apheresis. Hypotensive transfusion reactions are rare. (See <a class="local">'Frequency of reactions'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5406911"><span class="h1">FREQUENCY OF REACTIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute transfusion reactions range in frequency from relatively common reactions, such as allergic and febrile nonhemolytic reactions, to rare complications including anaphylaxis, fatal intravascular hemolysis due to ABO incompatibility, and sepsis.</p><p>The approximate frequency of reactions is as follows (expressed as reactions per number of transfused blood components) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Common reactions:</strong></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Allergic – 1 to 3 percent with platelet and plasma components; 0.1 to 0.3 percent with red blood cell (RBC) components.</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR) – 1 percent.

As an example, reactions are more common in children than adults. This was illustrated in a meta-analysis of three comparative studies that altogether evaluated &gt;1.3 million transfusion reactions (&gt;300,000 in children and &gt;1 million in adults) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The overall rate of transfusion reactions was higher in children (risk ratio [RR] 1.75, 95% CI 1.27-2.41). The higher risk was most significant for cellular components (RR 3.54 for RBCs and 3.62 for platelets) and was not seen with plasma or cryoprecipitate. The higher risk persisted for different types of reactions (allergic, FNHTR). The only types of reactions that were more common in adults were delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions and delayed serologic transfusion reactions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7932.html" rel="external">"Hemolytic transfusion reactions", section on 'Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions and delayed serologic transfusion reactions'</a>.)</p><p>The severity of acute transfusion reactions also varies, although the discomfort of the patient may not always parallel the risk of adverse outcomes. Potentially fatal acute reactions include TRALI, TACO, AHTR, sepsis, and anaphylaxis (see <a class="local">'Mortality'</a> below). Relatively benign reactions include FNHTR, allergic transfusion reaction (ATR), and non-immune hemolysis. Importantly, early signs and symptoms of an acute transfusion reaction may not distinguish between benign and more serious transfusion reactions; thus, all acute transfusion reactions must be considered potentially serious and evaluated accordingly until demonstrated to be otherwise.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3438146981"><span class="h1">MORTALITY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mortality from acute transfusion reactions is a rare event, with rates estimated at approximately 0.6 per million (commonly cited as 1 in 1.8 million) to 2.3 per million [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. These data come from various surveillance systems that may not be directly comparable, and mortality rates may differ depending on the patient population and local transfusion practices.</p><p>The reactions associated with the greatest number of deaths in the late 1990s and early 2000s were TRALI and AHTR [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Practices implemented since that time, including using Fresh Frozen Plasma and other plasma products from male donors exclusively (as part of an aggressive TRALI mitigation strategy), as well as testing of apheresis platelets for bacterial pathogens, have reduced the overall mortality rates and altered the relative contributions of different types of reactions [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7926.html" rel="external">"Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)", section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p>The acute transfusion reactions with the greatest likelihood of fatality appear to have shifted. In the United States, TRALI was the most likely to be fatal until approximately 2016, when TACO became the most likely to be fatal.

In such cases, Gram stain should be performed on the returned component, and cultures should be performed on both the remaining component and a post-transfusion blood sample from the patient. Some hospitals perform Gram stains and cultures on all transfusion reactions that present with a fever. A complete blood count (CBC) with white blood cell count (WBC) is also obtained. Other experts suggest culture only when fever is sustained or symptoms are more severe (temperature ≥39°C, temperature increase ≥2°C, and/or chills, rigors, myalgias, nausea or vomiting) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy should be administered based on the severity of clinical symptoms or suspicion of a septic transfusion reaction. Antibiotics may be adjusted based on the results of the Gram stain or culture of the product, but should not be withheld while awaiting these results. An infectious disease clinician may be consulted for advice on appropriate antibiotic therapy.

In some cases the distinction between these reactions is relatively obvious; in others it may be more difficult, or TACO and TRALI may both occur. (See <a class="local">'Patient with respiratory distress'</a> above.)</p><p>The initial evaluation includes imaging (such as chest radiography) and assessment of oxygenation status using pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas measurement. Patients with hypoxia should receive supplemental oxygen regardless of the underlying cause. Severe respiratory compromise may require transfer to an intensive care unit for possible intubation and mechanical ventilation. A cardiologist or pulmonologist may be consulted for cardiovascular and/or ventilatory management.</p><p>TACO is more likely in patients who have received a large volume of fluid over a short period of time, older individuals, very young individuals, or those with underlying cardiac disease. TACO is also supported by findings of acute respiratory distress, hypertension, heart failure, elevated central venous pressure, and elevated brain natriuretic protein (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BN (NT-pro BNP) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Pulmonary edema on chest radiography may be seen with TACO. If the clinical evaluation suggests TACO, the patient should be positioned in a seated posture and diuresis should be initiated, and the patient's response may be helpful in confirming the initial assessment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3450.html" rel="external">"Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: Specific therapies", section on 'Initial therapy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7919.html" rel="external">"Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)", section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>TRALI is more likely in patients who have respiratory distress out of proportion to the volume of fluid received or early on during the transfusion. Other findings in TRALI include respiratory distress of sudden onset, fever, hypotension, and pink frothy airway secretions. Unlike TACO, a diagnosis of TRALI requires hypoxemia and an abnormal chest radiograph showing bilateral infiltrates and no left atrial hypertension [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Until 2019, individuals with underlying acute lung injury or an alternative risk factor for acute lung injury have been referred to as having "possible TRALI"  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64212" href="/z/d/graphic/64212.html" rel="external">table 3</a>); a newer classification scheme, proposed in 2019, indicates that data from the individuals in this category be further evaluated and that each case either be classified as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or TRALI type II  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef122227" href="/z/d/graphic/122227.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7926.html" rel="external">"Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)", section on 'Terminology and diagnostic criteria'</a>.)</p><p>The blood collection facility should be informed of a suspected TRALI case so that appropriate specimens may be obtained from the donor (or donors) involved; this notification is done by the transfusion service. Patients with suspected TRALI (either type I or type II) may also have samples sent for HLA typing and possible testing for HLA and/or neutrophil antibodies, in consultation with the transfusion service. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7926.html" rel="external">"Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)"</a>.)</p><p>Analysis of the pulmonary edema fluid (obtained from a catheter inserted into a distal airway) may also be helpful in distinguishing TACO from TRALI, although this is rarely done [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. The pulmonary edema in TACO is cardiogenic; thus, the fluid in the alveoli is a transudate (ie, the ratio of protein in the edema fluid to protein in the plasma is &lt;0.65). The pulmonary edema in TRALI is non-cardiogenic; the fluid in the alveoli is an exudate (ie, the ratio of protein in the edema fluid to protein in the plasma is &gt;0.75).</p><p>Importantly, if TACO and/or TRALI do not appear to explain the clinical picture, assessment for other causes of respiratory distress should be pursued, including transfusion reactions such as sepsis and other coincident medical conditions such as pulmonary embolism or myocardial ischemia  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82700" href="/z/d/graphic/82700.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). The CDC Biovigilance Network includes a transfusion reaction classification of transfusion-associated dyspnea (TAD), which is defined as acute respiratory distress within 24 hours of the transfusion along with exclusion of all other transfusion reactions and underlying medical conditions that might explain the symptoms [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5406606"><span class="h2">Stable patient, mild reaction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The challenge when the patient appears to be having a mild reaction is that the ultimate course of the reaction is initially unknown.
