Larger diameter thoracostomy tubes require a blunt dissection technique procedure for placement  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef118625" href="/z/d/graphic/118625.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>), whereas smaller diameter tubes and catheters can be placed using a percutaneous technique (ie, Seldinger technique over a wire)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef118623" href="/z/d/graphic/118623.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) and cause less pain both during and after placement. Providers who place thoracostomy tubes (diameter ≥16 French [Fr]) or thoracostomy catheters (≤14 Fr) should be privileged to perform the procedure and treat/address the potential complications and should be well versed with all the options available as well as the equipment required for their placement and maintenance. As with all invasive procedures, hospitals should ensure appropriate training prior to granting privileges.</p><p>The literature regarding techniques for thoracostomy tube or catheter placement is mostly from the adult population. Few prospective studies are available in the pediatric population, in part due to the lower need for emergency invasive thoracic procedures in children. When a thoracostomy tube or catheter is required, the techniques for insertion are the same for adult and pediatric populations; however, in children, most tubes are smaller caliber and placed more often using the Seldinger technique. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7816.html" rel="external">"Thoracostomy tubes and catheters: Indications and tube selection in adults and children", section on 'Tube sizing'</a> and <a class="local">'Techniques'</a> below.)</p><p>The techniques for placement, management, and complications of thoracostomy tubes and catheters are reviewed, making appropriate distinctions between adult and pediatric populations when important. Specific medical and surgical conditions that result in the need to perform thoracostomy for pleural drainage are reviewed separately and discussed in more detail in separate topic reviews. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7816.html" rel="external">"Thoracostomy tubes and catheters: Indications and tube selection in adults and children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H694730529"><span class="h1">PATIENT PREPARATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3324371931"><span class="h2">Antibiotic prophylaxis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The need for prophylactic antibiotics prior to the placement of thoracostomy tubes depends upon the clinical circumstances. Most of the evidence for antibiotic prophylaxis is in the adult trauma population.

A meta-analysis of five trials that included patients with blunt or penetrating thoracic trauma found a significant reduction in the risk of empyema (relative risk [RR] 0.19, 95% CI 0.04-0.70) and pneumonia (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.15-0.87) for patients who received antibiotic prophylaxis compared with placebo [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Elective thoracic operations </strong>– In elective thoracic surgery, prophylactic antibiotic therapy is administered as a preoperative dose only  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79097" href="/z/d/graphic/79097.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). There is no evidence to support continuation of antibiotics. In a randomized trial that included 245 adults undergoing elective thoracic surgery who required thoracostomy and who received preoperative prophylactic antibiotics, patients treated with extended postoperative antibacterial prophylaxis (48 hours) had a rate of surgical site infections comparable to patients randomized to placebo (six versus five patients, risk difference -0.93, 95% CI -6.1 to 4.3) [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. In total, 13 patients (10.7 percent) receiving postoperative antibiotics and 8 patients (6.5 percent) receiving placebo developed an associated infection (ie, surgical site infection, empyema, or pneumonia) by postoperative day 28 (risk difference -4.3 percent, 95% CI -11.3 to 2.7). The antimicrobial agents used for prophylaxis are reviewed separately  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef87205" href="/z/d/graphic/87205.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).

Keep in mind the potential toxicity of lidocaine. The maximum allowable dose is 4 to 5 mg/kg without <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/z/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a> and 5 to 7 mg/kg with epinephrine  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56799" href="/z/d/graphic/56799.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). As always, slow instillation through a small-bore needle (27 or 30 gauge) and use of buffered lidocaine help limit the pain of injection and may help to avoid pain and anxiety.</p><p>In the elective setting, oral, intranasal, or intravenous sedation can be administered prior to tube insertion, in addition to local anesthetic infiltration. Non-critically ill pediatric patients may require additional distraction techniques, emotional support, or medications to help with anxiety. Benzodiazepines (intravenous or infusion) can be quite helpful. If families or other caretakers are present during the procedure (as is often the case in pediatrics), specific emotional support may be needed to help them distract the patient and maximize the chance of a stress-free procedure.

Larger diameter thoracostomy tubes (≥16 Fr) require a surgical cut-down procedure for placement. We refer to these as "surgically placed thoracostomy tubes." </p><p>We use "thoracostomy catheter" to refer to smaller diameter (≤14 Fr) tubes or flexible opaque specialty tubes (eg, pigtail). Thoracostomy catheters and smaller diameter thoracostomy tubes can be placed over a wire using a Seldinger technique [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. We refer to these as "percutaneously placed thoracostomy catheters" or "percutaneously placed thoracostomy tubes." </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3589708569"><span class="h2">Approach to placement by size of tube</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The way a thoracostomy tube or catheter is placed depends upon the stiffness of the tube and its diameter. </p><p>Most clinicians insert a larger diameter thoracostomy tube (≥16 Fr) with an open surgical technique. The open technique uses blunt dissection to access the pleural space. Thoracostomy tube trays that contain most of the required instrumentation (except the tube itself) are commonly though not universally available. Although some hospitals still carry and some clinicians still use a sharp trocar to aid in the insertion of a thoracostomy tube, we believe the trocar method should <strong>never</strong> be used since this technique significantly increases the risk of organ perforation [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Blunt dissection technique'</a> below.)</p><p>Smaller diameter (≤14 Fr) thoracostomy tubes and thoracostomy catheters (eg, pigtail) are typically placed using percutaneous techniques. The Seldinger technique accesses the pleural space with a needle and uses progressive dilatation of the tract over a guidewire. Commercially available kits are available that include the required equipment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3668806360"><span class="h1">INSERTION SITE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Generally, thoracostomy tubes and catheters are placed at the fourth or fifth intercostal space in the anterior axillary or midaxillary line [<a href="#rid11">11-14</a>]. In emergency situations, the landmarks are the nipple line in males and the inframammary crease in females  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef118375" href="/z/d/graphic/118375.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). Care should be taken to avoid potential damage to developing breast tissue in prepubescent females. Electively placed thoracostomy tubes, especially those designed to drain effusions, may be placed one to two rib spaces lower, or as low as possible in the chest with the use of ultrasound guidance, and may be tunneled in thin patients. Care must be taken to ensure the tube enters the pleural cavity. The technique for using ultrasound to guide the placement of a catheter to drain pleural effusion is discussed elsewhere. (See <a class="local">'Role of ultrasound or other imaging'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6686.html" rel="external">"Ultrasound-guided thoracentesis"</a>.)</p><p>The thoracostomy tube or catheter insertion positioning within the pleural cavity depends on the indication for tube placement; fluid collects in the dependent portion of the chest cavity, whereas air collects in the nondependent portion. For tubes placed in the anterior or midaxillary position, the tube should be directed anteriorly for air drainage or posteriorly for fluid drainage to keep the tube from tracking between the lobes, as could occur if passed straight in patients who have complete fissures. If this happens, the tube may become walled off by the lung and fail to drain the pleural air. A tube placed for fluid is likely more effective if it is lower in the chest. For draining a hemopneumothorax, the thoracostomy tube or catheter is directed posteriorly because the priority is to drain the blood and monitor blood loss.</p><p>A potentially better site for patients with only a pneumothorax is the second intercostal space in the midclavicular line. The anterior approach requires placing the tube through the pectoralis muscle. We recommend this approach only for a pneumothorax that is clearly seen on imaging and when a small thoracostomy catheter (eg, 10 to 14 French pigtail) is used, rather than a larger thoracostomy tube placed via the fourth or fifth intercostal space in the anterior axillary line. For patients with a simple, uncomplicated pneumothorax, placement via the anterior midclavicular approach is associated with reduced pain at the insertion site and can be performed at the bedside for most patients [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H160279803"><span class="h1">ROLE OF ULTRASOUND OR OTHER IMAGING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ultrasound or other imaging modalities (eg, fluoroscopy, computed tomography) can be used to guide thoracostomy tube or catheter placement. Placing a thoracostomy tube or catheter can be associated with severe complications, including damage to the lung, diaphragm, heart, liver, or spleen. The use of thoracic ultrasound can minimize complications, and ultrasound also accurately identifies the location of pneumothorax by an absence of lung sliding on two-dimensional and M-mode imaging [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. In the nonurgent setting, ultrasound is preferred when loculated effusion or adhesions from prior surgery are anticipated.</p><p>Ultrasound can localize a fluid collection and image the lung to help prevent lung laceration during tube placement. For pleural fluid drainage, the proposed site of thoracostomy tube or catheter insertion can be confirmed by first performing a thoracentesis using ultrasound guidance. If air or fluid is not obtained during diagnostic thoracentesis, the insertion site is reassessed by reviewing the available chest radiographs or computed tomography. Occasionally, fluid may not be able to be aspirated with a small needle because of high viscosity of the pleural fluid. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6688.html" rel="external">"Imaging of pleural effusions in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14888.html" rel="external">"Bedside pleural ultrasonography: Equipment, technique, and the identification of pleural effusion and pneumothorax"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6686.html" rel="external">"Ultrasound-guided thoracentesis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1796802359"><span class="h1">TECHNIQUES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Thoracostomy tubes or catheters can be inserted directly into the chest cavity through an incision or by using the Seldinger technique, which places the tube over a wire. These approaches are discussed separately below. (See <a class="local">'Blunt dissection technique'</a> below and <a class="local">'Seldinger technique'</a> below and <a class="local">'Needle thoracostomy'</a> below.)</p><p>Providers who place thoracostomy tubes or catheters should be well versed in all the options available and the potential complications and have privileges to perform this procedure at their home institution. In addition, as these are commonly placed in the emergency department, a plan should be in place for who will manage the tube once the patient is admitted. As with all invasive procedures, hospitals should ensure appropriate training prior to privileging. This procedure may be one where a facility or medical team requires participants to document competency on a recurring basis (eg, observation, simulation). The use of thoracic ultrasound can minimize complications, and ultrasound also accurately identifies the location of pneumothorax by an absence of lung sliding on two-dimensional and M-mode imaging as well as the location and amount of any pleural fluid.</p><p>Prior to thoracostomy tube or catheter placement, a pre-procedure timeout should confirm the side of placement by review of the radiographic studies to avoid placement on the wrong side. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H511031688"><span class="h2">Blunt dissection technique</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The open technique for thoracostomy tube placement is typically used to drain an effusion or hemothorax, more typically in older adolescents and in adults.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients who are hemodynamically stable, attention should be paid to providing adequate pain control for this procedure with local anesthetic infiltration and the use of appropriate sedation (if feasible).

Although the visceral pleura has significant structural integrity, once it is violated, the lung parenchyma is easily torn. Sweeping a finger through the lung can lead to significant bleeding and air leak, possibly requiring surgical intervention to repair.

If the patient is stable, chest imaging and consultation with thoracic surgery or interventional pulmonary service should be considered. If additional imaging is unable to be obtained and urgent placement is needed, using a more caudal rib space (by one or two ribs) may allow for safe placement of the tube in adult patients with non-traumatic indications.

In the authors' experience, this can cause problems such as macerating the skin, which may lead to infection after catheter is removed. Devices are available for fixation of thoracostomy tubes or catheters that eliminate the need for sutures. In our experience in the adult population, such devices risk dislodgement of the tube; however, there may be a role for these in the pediatric population.

This can be either with a thoracostomy or catheter (eg, pigtail), or angiocatheter. Simply inserting the introducer needle will release the pressure from tension physiology, stabilizing the patient. Needle thoracostomy can be performed on the affected side at the fifth intercostal space midaxillary line or in the midclavicular line through the second intercostal space with one of any readily available kits, a long angiocatheter (adult, pediatric), or the introducer needle for a pigtail catheter. While the 10<sup>th</sup> edition Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines recommend needle decompression from a lateral approach in adults, others support decompression and thoracostomy tube or catheter placement via the anterior approach [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. For patients who will require transportation, an anterior site may be more stable and easier to monitor. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13862.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of penetrating thoracic trauma in adults", section on 'Role of needle/finger chest decompression'</a>.)</p><p>The angiocatheter from the kit is placed first, which allows for immediate decompression. Because these catheters are small-bore thin-walled catheters, they are prone to kinking, and they may not completely relieve a tension pneumothorax. They can also be dislodged, leading to reaccumulation of air and recurrent tension pneumothorax. Thus, immediately following needle decompression, a thoracostomy tube or catheter should be placed, the diameter of which depends upon the expected pathology. As an example, for spontaneous pneumothorax, an appropriately sized catheter (eg, ≤14 French pigtail) can be placed immediately over a wire into the pleural space using a modified Seldinger technique. Alternatively, a larger thoracostomy tube can be placed, as described above. (See <a class="local">'Seldinger technique'</a> above and <a class="local">'Blunt dissection technique'</a> above.)</p><p>Following needle thoracostomy, the needle/catheter is attached to a syringe (5 or 10 mL in adults) and is inserted along the superior margin of the third rib in the midclavicular line or over the fifth rib in the midaxillary line. For adults, in our experience, a standard-length 14- to 16-gauge angiocatheter is nearly always successful; however, patients with obesity will need a longer catheter for adequate penetration of the chest. Such catheters are also effective in children, but a smaller needle/catheter is used in neonates and young children. As an example, a 20 or 22 gauge catheter ranging from 1.0 to 1.88 inches (2.54 to 4.77 cm) long is more appropriate for neonates and children to avoid injury to the lungs and surrounding structures. Butterfly needles can also be used in neonates.</p><p>Once the catheter has been placed, the needle is withdrawn and the angiocatheter is initially left open to air. An immediate rush of air out of the chest indicates the presence of a tension pneumothorax, which has now been converted to a large but simple pneumothorax. Tubing can be attached to the angiocatheter and the open end placed into a bottle of sterile water, which should be placed below the insertion site to avoid fluid being pulled into the pleural space; bubbles indicate the flow of air. This is a temporizing measure to emergently address an air leak that may be acutely problematic or is anticipated to rapidly reaccumulate. A definitive tube for continued drainage can then be placed in a less emergent fashion.</p><p>Catheter length should be chosen based upon the body habitus of the patient. In a systematic review that included 13 studies, a catheter length of 6.44 cm (2.54 in) would ensure that 95 percent of the patients would have adequate penetration to the pleural space during needle thoracostomy [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. In another study of 604 male patients and 170 female patients, mean chest wall thickness was 3.50 cm (2.17 in) at the left second intercostal space at the midclavicular line, and 3.51 cm (2.18 in) on the right [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. The mean chest wall thickness was significantly higher for females compared with males. A chest wall thickness greater than 4.5 cm (2.79 in) was present in up to 35.4 percent of females and 19.3 in males, respectively. In a comparative study of adults (age &gt;15 years), a longer (8 cm; 3.14 in) compared with shorter (5 cm; 1.96 in) needle was associated with a significant improvement in success rates (83 versus 41 percent) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1917592906"><span class="h1">DRAINAGE SYSTEMS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Wet or dry suction control, closed-drainage systems are typically used, and each is effective for draining pleural air and fluid.

If there is incomplete resolution of the pneumothorax, then we initiate suction at -10 cm of water and increase the amount of suction only as needed, as determined by the chest radiograph.

Even without symptoms, for patients without any signs of a mediastinal shift from the effusion, we limit initial fluid drainage (1.5 liters in adults, 20 mL/kg in children) by clamping the thoracostomy tube or catheter and waiting at least one hour before draining additional fluid. Patients with mediastinal shift contralateral to the tube or catheter may tolerate a larger amount of initial fluid removal, because a certain amount of fluid can be removed to return the mediastinum to midline before the lung starts to reinflate.

These studies suggest that use of pleural manometry may be useful in reducing the risk of the development of RPE, and not allowing the gradient to exceed 17 cm H<sub>2</sub>0 [<a href="#rid62">62</a>]. </p><p>Treatment is supportive (eg, positioning, positive pressure ventilation, fluid restriction), and the disease is usually self-limited [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. In a review of pediatric cases, no specific treatment was noted or recommended [<a href="#rid58">58</a>]. The commonly quoted mortality rate of 20 percent comes from one small review [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. Later and larger series report a mortality rate of less than 5 percent in adults [<a href="#rid54">54-56</a>]. The diagnosis and management of RPE are discussed in detail elsewhere.

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

These narratives may offer insights into patient values and preferences not included in other UpToDate topics. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/131727.html" rel="external">"Patient perspective: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3107678353"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thoracotomy tubes and catheters</strong> – Thoracostomy tube (diameter ≥16 French [Fr]) or thoracostomy catheter (diameter ≤14 Fr) placement into the pleural cavity is performed to drain abnormal collections of air or fluid or as a means of instilling agents (eg, talc). Indications include pneumothorax, hemothorax, and pleural effusion, including malignant effusion, chylous effusion, parapneumonic effusion, and empyema. Providers who place thoracostomy tubes or catheters should be privileged to perform the procedure and should be well versed with all the options available and the potential complications, as well as the equipment required for their placement and maintenance. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Imaging before placement</strong> – For patients with adhesions from infection, previous pleurodesis, or prior pulmonary surgery, a computed tomography scan of the chest should be obtained to guide thoracostomy tube or catheter placement. Blind insertion of a thoracostomy tube or catheter is dangerous in these patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7816.html" rel="external">"Thoracostomy tubes and catheters: Indications and tube selection in adults and children", section on 'Relative contraindications'</a> and <a class="local">'Role of ultrasound or other imaging'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prophylactic antibiotics</strong> </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients with <strong>penetrating</strong> thoracic trauma, we recommend administering prophylactic antibiotics prior to thoracostomy tube or catheter placement (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). Rates of empyema and pneumonia are significantly decreased when antibiotics are given prior to thoracostomy tube placement. No consistent reduction in infectious complications has been found in patients with blunt thoracic injury or nontraumatic indications for tube thoracostomy; thus, prophylactic antibiotic treatment in these populations is not necessary. (See <a class="local">'Antibiotic prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients undergoing elective thoracic surgery requiring a thoracostomy tube, we suggest administering preoperative prophylactic antibiotics only, rather than extending coverage into the postoperative period (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'Antibiotic prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Device selection and site</strong> – The choice of thoracostomy device, including its size, shape, and insertion site, depends upon the indication for placement (ie, nature of the fluid to be drained) and size of the patient. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7816.html" rel="external">"Thoracostomy tubes and catheters: Indications and tube selection in adults and children", section on 'Tube definitions and types'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Techniques</strong> – Two techniques are commonly used for placement of thoracostomy tubes and catheters following appropriate preparation and local anesthetic administration. Needle thoracostomy is used as a temporizing, life-saving measure for patients with tension pneumothorax. (See <a class="local">'Techniques'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Standard technique</strong> – The standard technique uses a small incision on the chest wall and blunt dissection to access the pleural space to place a thoracostomy tube. A sharp trocar should <strong>not</strong> be used to access the pleural space; the trocar can cause mediastinal injury and fatal exsanguination. (See <a class="local">'Blunt dissection technique'</a> above and <a class="local">'Organ injury'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Seldinger technique</strong> – The Seldinger technique uses a needle to access the pleural space and place a guidewire over which a thoracostomy catheter is placed. (See <a class="local">'Seldinger technique'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Needle thoracostomy</strong> – In hemodynamically unstable patients in whom there is a high suspicion for tension pneumothorax, needle thoracostomy should be performed as a lifesaving (albeit temporizing) measure by reducing the intrapleural pressure and restoring venous return to the heart. Following needle decompression of the chest, a thoracostomy tube or catheter should be placed as soon as possible because needle thoracostomy may not completely relieve the tension pneumothorax and technical issues may lead to recurrent tension pneumothorax (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'Needle thoracostomy'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preventing re-expansion pulmonary edema</strong> – RPE is a life-threatening complication that is usually due to the rapid expansion of a large pneumothorax, but it can also follow rapid drainage of large volumes of pleural fluid in patients with chronic lung collapse. (See <a class="local">'Managing initial drainage'</a> above and <a class="local">'Re-expansion pulmonary edema'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In the absence of an active air leak, to minimize the risk for RPE, we suggest limiting the initial drainage (1.5 liters in adults, 20 mL/kg in children) (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In the rare case of a large effusion and an active air leak, the tube or catheter cannot be clamped. However, to decrease the risk of RPE, the drainage tube can be draped to a position above the patient's head and then back to the drainage system, which is ideally situated on the floor. This creates a fluid trap that allows air to safely escape but slows the drainage of fluid.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Drainage systems</strong> – Dry and wet suction control and closed-drainage systems are both effective for draining pleural air and fluid. Unidirectional flutter valves can be used in selected patients to allow the patient to remain ambulatory. The level of suction used depends upon the indication. (See <a class="local">'Techniques'</a> above and <a class="local">'Drainage systems'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complications</strong> – The most common complication is malposition of the tube or catheter. Other complications are rare but include infection (eg, pneumonia, empyema), organ injury, and RPE. Death attributed to the procedure is uncommon. (See <a class="local">'Morbidity and mortality'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H588427682"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges Peter Doelken, MD, FCCP, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Olgac G, Aydogmus U, Mulazimoglu L, Kutlu CA.
