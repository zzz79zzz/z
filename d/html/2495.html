(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15802.html" rel="external">"Systemic therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer: General principles", section on 'Systemic therapy versus supportive care'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15802.html" rel="external">"Systemic therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer: General principles"</a>.)</p><p>On the other hand, surgery provides a potentially curative option for selected patients with limited metastatic disease, especially if located in one organ system (such as the liver or lung), an isolated local recurrence, or limited intra-abdominal disease. With aggressive management integrating chemotherapy and surgery, long-term survival can be achieved in as many as 50 percent of cases. In selected patients, even resection of metastases in more than one organ has been successful in achieving long-term survival [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Aggressive surgical cytoreduction with intraperitoneal chemotherapy has been applied to patients with isolated peritoneal carcinomatosis, but the benefits of this approach remain controversial. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2483.html" rel="external">"Potentially resectable colorectal cancer liver metastases: Integration of surgery and chemotherapy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2796.html" rel="external">"Surgical resection of pulmonary metastases: Outcomes by histology"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7815.html" rel="external">"Surgical resection of pulmonary metastases: Benefits, indications, preoperative evaluation, and techniques"</a> and <a class="local">'CRS with or without HIPEC for peritoneal metastases'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2528.html" rel="external">"Treatment of locally recurrent rectal adenocarcinoma"</a>.)</p><p>Surgical resection may also provide the best option for palliation of symptoms of obstruction and bleeding from the primary tumor in patients who are not candidates for a curative resection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/82949.html" rel="external">"Surgical resection of primary colon cancer", section on 'Complicated disease'</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the management of the primary tumor (surgical and nonsurgical options) in patients who present with stage IV CRC, and surgical cytoreduction and intraperitoneal chemotherapy for isolated peritoneal carcinomatosis. General surgical principles in patients with primary colon cancer, management of patients with isolated, potentially resectable liver metastases, surgical management of lung metastases, and post-treatment surveillance are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/82949.html" rel="external">"Surgical resection of primary colon cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2483.html" rel="external">"Potentially resectable colorectal cancer liver metastases: Integration of surgery and chemotherapy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7815.html" rel="external">"Surgical resection of pulmonary metastases: Benefits, indications, preoperative evaluation, and techniques"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2493.html" rel="external">"Post-treatment surveillance after colorectal cancer treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12027618"><span class="h1">OUTCOMES AFTER RESECTION OF ISOLATED METASTATIC DISEASE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surgery provides a potentially curative option for selected patients with limited metastatic disease.

Aggressive surgical resection for isolated adrenal metastases is described in only a few case reports or small series [<a href="#rid3">3-8</a>]. In the largest series, of eight patients with apparently isolated adrenal metastasis from CRC (all of whom underwent "adjuvant" chemotherapy), one remained alive and disease free 12 months after adrenalectomy, one was lost to follow-up, and six died of malignancy. The mean survival of the patients who died was 32 (range 12 to 60) months.</p><p>In contrast to the situation with isolated adrenal metastases, the development of adrenal metastases after liver resection for CRC liver metastases is associated with a poor prognosis, and adrenalectomy is probably not warranted [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Ovarian metastases</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The incidence of ovarian metastases (synchronous or metachronous) in patients with CRC is 1 to 14 percent. They are more common in premenopausal as compared with postmenopausal women, and with colonic rather than rectal primaries [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. While it is generally acknowledged that ovarian metastases (particularly if synchronous and bilateral) represent a poor prognostic factor, complete resection may improve survival [<a href="#rid11">11-13</a>].</p><p>Bulky ovarian metastases are often symptomatic and less responsive to systemic chemotherapy than are other sites of disease [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. Resection is associated with fairly low morbidity, and in some cases, may improve quality of life and prolong survival, even in the setting of widespread extra-ovarian metastatic disease [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12027710"><span class="h2">Retroperitoneal lymph nodes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An isolated retroperitoneal nodal recurrence occurs in less than 2 percent of patients following a curative-intent colon cancer resection [<a href="#rid17">17-20</a>]. Salvage surgery had previously been avoided due to the poor prognosis of this group of patients [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]. However, this concept has been challenged. These series were largely collected over a time period when new chemotherapy regimens were evolving (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10180" href="/z/d/drug information/10180.html" rel="external">oxaliplatin</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8573" href="/z/d/drug information/8573.html" rel="external">irinotecan</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9209" href="/z/d/drug information/9209.html" rel="external">cetuximab</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8683" href="/z/d/drug information/8683.html" rel="external">bevacizumab</a>). In more recent years, advances in chemotherapy and radiation therapy techniques have led to their use as potentially curative therapy for patients with apparently isolated paraaortic lymph node metastases (PALNMs) [<a href="#rid18">18,23-25</a>].</p><p>In this context, the role of resection was revisited in a systematic review of 18 retrospective, single-center case series of patients with apparently isolated PALNMs, published between 1998 and 2015; 5 series addressed management of synchronous PALNMs, 11 addressed patients with metachronous PALNMs, and 2 collectively addressed both populations [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. A total of 370 patients were included; 145 had synchronous, and 225 had metachronous PALNMs. Compared with patients who did not undergo a paraaortic lymph node dissection, the median survival was longer in those who did (34 to 40 versus 3 to 14 months, respectively). For synchronous PALNMs, the five-year survival after metastasectomy ranged from 23 to 34 percent, while for metachronous PALNMs, it was 15 to 60 percent. There were no surgical mortalities, and the overall surgical morbidity rate ranged from 8 to 33 percent. The role of adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not addressed. Others report that predictors of improved survival outcomes for patients with synchronous PALNMs include well-differentiated histology, a complete (R0) resection, and low-volume disease (ie, fewer than two PALNMs); among those with metachronous disease, a longer disease-free interval has been associated with improved survival [<a href="#rid17">17-19</a>]. These results are difficult to interpret because these are retrospective studies with a small number of patients, and some of the studies in this review included patients with local recurrence in the retroperitoneum as well as patients with extra-retroperitoneal disease.</p><p>In our view, resection is a reasonable option for patients with isolated retroperitoneal nodal metastases who have not progressed after systemic chemotherapy and who have no extra-retroperitoneal metastatic disease, those whose retroperitoneal lymph node metastases are located below the left renal vein, and those with metachronous disease and long disease-free intervals.</p><p>As is the case in patients with resected CRC hepatic or pulmonary metastases, it is unclear if the addition of chemotherapy improves the observed survival statistics. There are no data addressing the benefit of chemotherapy after resection of isolated retroperitoneal nodal disease. Consensus-based guidelines for management of resectable metachronous metastases from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network [<a href="#rid26">26</a>] do not distinguish among different sites of metastatic disease, and they recommend adjuvant therapy if there was no previous chemotherapy, and a variety of options for those who have received chemotherapy, including upfront resection or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In our view, management must be individualized and discussed in a multidisciplinary setting. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2796.html" rel="external">"Surgical resection of pulmonary metastases: Outcomes by histology", section on 'Benefit of postresection adjuvant therapy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2483.html" rel="external">"Potentially resectable colorectal cancer liver metastases: Integration of surgery and chemotherapy", section on 'Postoperative management'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT OF THE PRIMARY CANCER</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Initial management of the primary site in patients who present with stage IV disease is controversial, and there are no data from prospective randomized studies to guide treatment. In general, the choice and sequence of treatment of the primary tumor are guided by the presence or absence of symptoms from the primary tumor and whether or not the metastases are potentially resectable:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients who present with synchronous metastatic disease and a symptomatic primary tumor (obstruction, bleeding, perforation), resection of the primary tumor is warranted.

Issues related to the sequence and timing of resection of the primary and metastases in patients presenting with synchronous hepatic metastases are discussed elsewhere.

In general, patients with a perforated tumor need surgery, while for those with bleeding or obstruction, decisions regarding surgery are dependent on the clinical situation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/82949.html" rel="external">"Surgical resection of primary colon cancer", section on 'Complicated disease'</a>.)</p><p>Endoscopically deployed self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) may be used in the setting of obstruction, either as an independent solution or as a strategy to allow for bowel decompression to reduce the risk that operation leads to colostomy. (See <a class="local">'Intraluminal stent placement'</a> below.)</p><p>Initial systemic chemotherapy is an option for some patients, particularly those presenting with synchronous stage IV disease. Although with the newer chemotherapeutic regimens there may be a response in the primary tumor, this response may not be as robust in the primary site as it is in the liver metastases [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. As a result, for patients with an in situ primary tumor (whether symptomatic or not) who are receiving chemotherapy, it is imperative to endoscopically evaluate the primary site periodically. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15802.html" rel="external">"Systemic therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer: General principles"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2503.html" rel="external">"Systemic therapy for nonoperable metastatic colorectal cancer: Selecting the initial therapeutic approach"</a>.)</p><p>If the patient is not a surgical candidate because of comorbidities, high operative risk(s), decreased life expectancy, or refuses surgery, nonsurgical options can be considered. (See <a class="local">'Nonsurgical palliative options'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Asymptomatic</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In practice, the decision to pursue surgical resection of an asymptomatic primary site is based on the curability of metastatic disease.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h4">Potentially curable metastatic disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If the metastases are potentially resectable for cure, then an aggressive surgical approach is warranted for both the primary and metastatic sites with the aim of curing the patient. However, in our view, if there are five or more simultaneous, potentially resectable hepatic metastases (unless all are located in one lobe), extensive bilobar involvement, or if disease is borderline resectable due to location, initial chemotherapy followed by reassessment and delayed resection is probably a better strategy than upfront surgery. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2483.html" rel="external">"Potentially resectable colorectal cancer liver metastases: Integration of surgery and chemotherapy", section on 'Are there patients who might benefit from upfront chemotherapy?'</a>.)</p><p>There are considerable differences in the approach to synchronous potentially resectable metastatic disease. Some reports indicate a poor prognosis in such patients, at least in part attributable to the failure to resect clinically occult micrometastatic liver disease [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>].</p><p>One approach to address this concern is initial chemotherapy, which might also allow some patients with initially borderline resectable liver metastases to undergo successful hepatic resection. If there is widespread disease progression during chemotherapy, resection will likely provide no specific benefit. If, on the other hand, the disease has responded or is stable, resection of both the primary tumor and the metastatic disease could be attempted in either a single or separate operations. Survival rates after resection of colorectal carcinoma liver metastases are better in patients who experience an objective response to chemotherapy [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. This subject is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2483.html" rel="external">"Potentially resectable colorectal cancer liver metastases: Integration of surgery and chemotherapy", section on 'Are there patients who might benefit from upfront chemotherapy?'</a>.)</p><p>Another point of debate is whether the surgery should be carried out simultaneously or colorectal resection first followed by hepatectomy or hepatectomy first followed by resection of the primary tumor [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. For most patients, simultaneous resection of the primary and metastatic disease is clearly preferable from the patient's perspective, and several surgical case series and meta-analyses have failed to confirm inferior survival or greater morbidity for patients who undergo a one-stage procedure compared with delayed (staged) hepatic resection, unless major hepatic resection (three or more segments) is needed [<a href="#rid31">31-38</a>]. Factors that influence a decision on single operation versus a staged approach include the anticipated complexity of the colectomy or proctectomy, the size of the future liver remnant, the likelihood of major blood loss or prolonged hepatic ischemic times, and patient comorbidities. Because of the incidence of synchronous second primary CRCs (approximately 3 to 5 percent), complete colonoscopy prior to surgical resection should be undertaken, if feasible. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2493.html" rel="external">"Post-treatment surveillance after colorectal cancer treatment", section on 'Diagnosing second cancers and polyps'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h4">Incurable metastatic disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with incurable metastatic disease who are receiving systemic chemotherapy and who are asymptomatic from the primary tumor, there is no benefit for initial resection of the primary tumor, and we suggest not pursuing this approach.</p><p>The decision as to whether to resect the primary tumor is more complex for asymptomatic patients who have unresectable metastatic disease compared with those with potentially curable metastases; in such patients, the risk to benefit ratio of resecting the primary tumor must be carefully considered. Resecting the primary is not without risk. For patients with metastatic CRC who undergo surgery, there is a 20 to 30 percent risk of postoperative morbidity, and a 1 to 6 percent risk of perioperative mortality [<a href="#rid39">39-41</a>].

Total mesorectal excision improves rates of local control and recurrence-free survival compared with other surgical options. For patients with T3 or node-positive disease, the addition adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) and adjuvant chemotherapy improves outcomes over radical surgery alone. The combination of preoperative chemotherapy and RT in patients with locally advanced disease is association with fewer local recurrences and improved sphincter preservation rates, although a survival benefit compared with postoperative chemoradiotherapy has not been shown. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2529.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant therapy for resected rectal adenocarcinoma in patients not receiving neoadjuvant therapy", section on 'Stage II to III disease following transabdominal surgery'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2468.html" rel="external">"Neoadjuvant therapy for rectal adenocarcinoma", section on 'Long-course chemoradiation'</a>.)</p><p>There are no established guidelines for treatment of the rectal primary in patients with resectable, synchronous liver metastases, and in particular, the role of pelvic RT.

Thus, while RT has a clear role in improving rates of sphincter preservation for low-lying tumors, and in patients for whom the likelihood of achieving a complete (R0) resection is in doubt based on local disease extent, the omission of RT may be reasonable in patients without these issues who have a simultaneous diagnosis of resectable liver metastases.

Although long-term survival can be achieved in a small number of patients using multimodality approaches such as aggressive cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with or without heated (hyperthermic) intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) [<a href="#rid64">64</a>], there remains insufficient evidence to conclude whether any survival advantage seen in these patients is due to treatment or to biologic features that allow these patients to undergo complete CRS. Furthermore, because the quality of the CRS is dependent on the skills and level of experience of the surgeon, favorable results (particularly with regard to treatment-related toxicity [<a href="#rid65">65-67</a>]) achieved by international experts may not be replicated in routine clinical practice. The independent contribution of HIPEC to the success of this approach has not been proven, and a major unresolved issue is whether results with CRS with or without HIPEC are better than what could be achieved using modern oxaliplatin- and/or irinotecan-based systemic chemotherapy, with or without biologic agents.</p><p>For all of these reasons, in our view CRS with or without HIPEC should not yet be considered a standard approach for treatment of metastatic CRC with peritoneal metastases.

In general, patients with a perforated tumor need urgent surgery, while for those with bleeding or obstruction decisions regarding surgery are dependent on the clinical situation. Initial systemic chemotherapy is an option for some patients.

In the absence of widespread disease progression, reevaluation and resection of both the primary tumor and metastases is reasonable, if it is consistent with the patient's goals of care.
