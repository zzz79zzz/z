         The optimal treatment of lupus nephritis (LN) is informed by the morphological findings present on kidney biopsy. Immunosuppressive therapy is used to treat active focal (class III) or diffuse (class IV) LN or lupus membranous nephropathy (LMN; class V LN), whereas it is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         usually used to treat minimal mesangial (class I), mesangial proliferative (class II), or advanced sclerosing (class VI) LN.
        </p>
        <p>
         The treatment of LMN will be reviewed here. The various types of LN, the treatment of focal and diffuse LN, and management of the patient with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are presented separately:

         The goals of therapy in patients with lupus membranous nephropathy (LMN) include reduction of proteinuria, especially if the patient has the nephrotic syndrome and is at high risk for complications, as well as prevention of glomerular damage and progression of chronic kidney disease. In addition, another goal of therapy is to induce resolution of immunologic activity. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3059.html" rel="external">

         There is no consensus on the degree of proteinuria reduction that defines a complete or partial response in patients with LMN. We use the same definitions for reduction in proteinuria as those used in patients with focal or diffuse lupus nephritis (LN). Since patients with LMN who are nephrotic may have a higher degree of proteinuria in comparison with other histologic forms of LN, they may respond more slowly to treatment. (See

         In general, most experts agree that immunosuppressive drugs should be administered to patients with pure LMN who have nephrotic syndrome or, in the absence of nephrotic syndrome, persistent proteinuria &gt;3.5 g/day despite nonimmunosuppressive therapy; a progressive rise in serum creatinine above baseline; or mixed membranous and proliferative lesions on kidney biopsy. (See

         There is less agreement regarding the role of immunosuppressive therapy in patients with a lesser degree of proteinuria. The following represents the range of opinions:

         Some experts suggest that patients with LMN and proteinuria &gt;1 g/day without evidence of extensive chronic damage (eg, glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy) on kidney biopsy should receive immunosuppressive therapy. The rationale for this approach is that patients with LMN do not generally experience spontaneous remission and this amount of proteinuria increases the risk of progressive kidney damage long-term. The presence of chronic damage on kidney biopsy could suggest that proteinuria is associated more with glomerulosclerosis than with immune complex deposition and is less likely to respond to immunosuppressive therapy. This approach is consistent with the joint guidelines of the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (formerly known as European League Against Rheumatism)/European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (EULAR/ERA-EDTA) [
         <a href="#rid1">

         </span>
         In patients with proteinuria &lt;1 g/day (some experts use a threshold of &lt;0.7 g/day), some experts do not treat LMN with immunosuppressive therapy but rather base the need for immunosuppression on the presence of extrarenal manifestations. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4675.html" rel="external">

          •
         </span>
         Some experts suggest that all patients with LMN, regardless of the degree of proteinuria, should receive immunosuppressive therapy, given that patients with LMN often do not spontaneously remit.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         All patients with LMN should receive general supportive therapies as appropriate (such as renin-angiotensin system inhibition, dietary sodium and protein restriction, and antihypertensive therapy), as discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See
         <a class="local">
          'General supportive measures in all patients'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         There are no randomized trials in patients with pure LMN comparing immunosuppressive therapy in addition to nonimmunosuppressive therapy with nonimmunosuppressive therapy alone. Thus, decisions about which patients should receive immunosuppressive therapy are made based upon lower-quality data, including the clinical experience of experts.

We do

Complete remission was defined as proteinuria &lt;0.3 g/day, and partial remission was defined as proteinuria &lt;2 g/day with a &gt;50 percent reduction in proteinuria. At one year, the remission rate was higher with cyclosporine and cyclophosphamide compared with prednisone alone (83 and 60 versus 27 percent, respectively). Among the 19 remissions that occurred with either cyclosporine or cyclophosphamide, 12 were complete and seven were partial.

         After starting initial immunosuppressive therapy, patients are monitored closely to assess the renal response, control of extrarenal manifestations, and potential medication toxicity. In the beginning, patients are typically seen in clinic every one to two months, with less frequent visits over time if the patient responds and remains stable. If any significant changes are made to the immunosuppression regimen, we have patients return to clinic in two weeks to assess tolerance; if they are doing well, we return to follow-up visits every one to two months.
        </p>
        <p>
         Renal response is assessed by following the serum creatinine, urine protein excretion (usually with a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio), and urine sediment examination. Other laboratory tests, such as a complete blood count and liver function tests, are important for medication toxicity monitoring. Patients treated with CNIs should have monitoring of trough drug levels (ie,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9217" href="/z/d/drug information/9217.html" rel="external">

         levels). Patients treated with MMF who do not respond can have MMF levels measured to assess adherence and adequacy of dosing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Previous studies of LN patients have demonstrated that the tempo of proteinuria response to immunosuppressive therapy is slow. One longitudinal study of treated patients with various histopathologic classes of LN showed that recovery of proteinuria to &lt;0.5 g occurred in 28 percent of patients at one year and 52 percent at two years. In addition, the higher the level of baseline proteinuria, the longer the time to response [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Thus, changes in the immunosuppressive regimen should not be made too early during the course of therapy. Although each patient should be managed on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration renal response and extrarenal disease activity, the following generalizations may be helpful:

         If the clinical parameters are worsening after three months of initial therapy (eg, worsening proteinuria and/or worsening kidney function), a change in therapy is typically warranted. As an example, if a patient was initiated on MMF, the patient could be switched to

Thus, in such patients, those who do not respond to or who relapse despite cyclophosphamide treatment should be converted to a CNI, and those who do not respond to or who relapse despite CNI therapy should be converted to cyclophosphamide. However, if a patient who was successfully treated with a CNI relapses

          after

         the drug has been discontinued, the same therapy can be used a second time. There are insufficient data to recommend the use of a different CNI (eg,

         The reported kidney survival rates are generally favorable among patients with lupus membranous nephropathy (LMN) [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14-19
         </a>
         ]. Among patients with pure LMN, 10-year kidney survival rates range from 72 to 98 percent [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16,20
         </a>
         ]. However, patients who have concurrent proliferative lesions (ie, focal or diffuse lupus nephritis [LN]) have lower long-term kidney survival compared with those who have pure LMN [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,18,19
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in a retrospective study that examined the impact of concurrent proliferative lesions on long-term outcomes in patients with LMN, the percentage of patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) at five years was higher in those who had concurrent diffuse LN compared with those with pure LMN (43 versus 14 percent) [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. The mean rate of loss of kidney function (estimated from 1/serum creatinine) was lower in patients with pure LMN compared with those who had concurrent focal or diffuse LN (-4.5 versus -18.5 and -15.9 dL/mg per year, respectively).
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with LMN may have proliferative lesions at presentation or develop them over time, often in association with worsening kidney function or a substantial change in the activity of the urinary sediment [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,20
         </a>
         ]. In one series, 29 patients who were initially diagnosed with LMN with little or no mesangial proliferation underwent a second biopsy at a mean follow-up of 6.9 years [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. The probability of a transition from membranous to combined membranous and proliferative LN was 35 percent at 10 years.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other contributing factors to variable outcomes include differences in patient populations and in immunosuppressive therapies that may be used for extrarenal indications [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Exostosin-1 and -2 (EXT1/EXT2) have been identified as potential disease biomarkers in a proportion of patients with LMN [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22,23
         </a>
         ]. In a study of 374 patients with biopsy-proven LMN, of whom approximately one-third were positive for EXT1/EXT2, those who were EXT1/EXT2 positive were younger, had lower serum creatinine levels, and had fewer chronic features (ie, glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy) on kidney biopsy [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. Compared with patients who were EXT1/EXT2 positive, those who were EXT1/EXT2 negative progressed to ESKD more quickly and more frequently (19 versus 3 percent). These findings suggest that patients who are EXT1/EXT2 positive may represent a subgroup of LMN with a more favorable kidney prognosis. (See

         <strong>
          General principles
         </strong>
         – The goal of immunosuppressive therapy in patients with lupus membranous nephropathy (LMN) is reduction of proteinuria, as well as prevention of glomerular damage and progression of chronic kidney disease. While there is no consensus definition of a complete or partial response, we use definitions similar to those used to define clinical response in patients with primary membranous nephropathy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Goals of therapy'

          Indications for immunosuppressive therapy
         </strong>
         – The authors and reviewers of this topic do not agree about which patients with pure LMN should receive immunosuppressive therapy (see
         <a class="local">
          'Indications for immunosuppressive therapy'

         </span>
         In patients with pure LMN who have nephrotic syndrome or, in the absence of nephrotic syndrome, persistent proteinuria &gt;3.5 g/day despite nonimmunosuppressive therapy; a progressive rise in serum creatinine above baseline; or mixed membranous and proliferative lesions on kidney biopsy, we suggest treating with immunosuppressive therapy in addition to general supportive measures, rather than general supportive measure alone (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). There are no randomized trials in patients with pure LMN comparing immunosuppressive therapy in addition to nonimmunosuppressive therapy with nonimmunosuppressive therapy alone.

         There is less agreement regarding the role of immunosuppressive therapy in patients with a lesser degree of proteinuria. Some experts suggest that patients with LMN and proteinuria &gt;1 g/day without evidence of extensive chronic damage (eg, glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy) on kidney biopsy should receive immunosuppressive therapy. In patients with proteinuria &lt;1 g/day (some experts use a threshold of &lt;0.7 g/day), some experts do not treat LMN with immunosuppressive therapy but rather base the need for immunosuppression on the presence of extrarenal manifestations. Other experts suggest that all patients with LMN, regardless of the degree of proteinuria, should receive immunosuppressive therapy, given that patients with LMN often do not spontaneously remit.

         <strong>
          Monitoring response to therapy
         </strong>
         – After starting initial immunosuppressive therapy, patients are monitored closely to assess the renal response, control of extrarenal manifestations, and potential medication toxicity. In the beginning, patients are typically seen in clinic every one to two months, with less frequent visits over time if the patient responds and remains stable. If any significant changes are made to the immunosuppression regimen, we have patients return to clinic in two weeks to assess tolerance; if they are doing well, we return to follow-up visits every one to two months. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Monitoring the response to therapy'

         <strong>
          Other treatment considerations
         </strong>
         – General supportive measures in all patients with LMN include dietary sodium and protein restriction, blood pressure control, minimization of proteinuria with renin-angiotensin system inhibition, treatment of dyslipidemia, and in selected patients, anticoagulation. Immunosuppressive therapy with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">
          cyclophosphamide

         <strong>
          Resistant and relapsing disease
         </strong>
         – Patients require modification of immunosuppressive therapy if they have persistent heavy proteinuria (over 3 g daily) despite 6 to 12 months of adequate therapy (ie, are nonresponders) or have an initial response but then develop worsening proteinuria, a new active urinary sediment, or worsening kidney function (ie, have relapsing disease). A repeat kidney biopsy is required to confirm that these clinical scenarios are due to persistent LMN or conversion to a different LN class. (See

         </strong>
         – The reported kidney survival rates are generally favorable among patients with LMN. However, patients who have concurrent proliferative lesions (ie, focal or diffuse LN) have lower long-term kidney survival compared with those who have pure LMN. (See
