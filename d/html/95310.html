The immunologic responses to grain proteins can be immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated and/or non-IgE mediated. Food allergy to wheat is best known and manifests with a variety of symptoms and a wide range of clinical syndromes, such as atopic dermatitis exacerbations, exercise-induced anaphylaxis, eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), baker's asthma, and celiac disease. This topic review highlights wheat and also covers other cereal grains including rye, barley, oat, rice, corn, sorghum, and millet, as well as noncereal grains including quinoa, amaranth, and buckwheat  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95024" href="/d/graphic/95024.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of grain allergy are presented in this topic review.

It usually begins in early childhood and is outgrown by adolescence, although some retain it beyond the teenage years [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. IgE-mediated wheat allergy is reported to affect 0.2 to 1.3 percent of children in Europe [<a href="#rid2">2</a>] and 0.4 percent of children in the United States [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Onset of wheat allergy in adulthood is typically not seen unless it is related to an occupational exposure or due to sensitization to omega-5-gliadin (see <a class="local">'Baker's asthma'</a> below and <a class="local">'Wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis'</a> below). Epidemiologic data for the other grains are sparse.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20088515"><span class="h2">Referral populations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Wheat allergy was reported in 18 percent of patients seen in a university-based pediatric allergy outpatient clinic focusing on food allergies [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. It was among the most common reported triggers of anaphylaxis, following cow's milk, peanut, and tree nuts. Thirty-seven percent of children with atopic dermatitis referred to a university-based dermatology clinic had clinically significant IgE-mediated food hypersensitivity; of them, 13 percent had wheat allergy [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Other grain allergies are less common. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5545.html" rel="external">"Role of allergy in atopic dermatitis (eczema)"</a>.)</p><p>Oat sensitization is relatively common in patients with atopic dermatitis, particularly in those with wheat allergy, but clinical allergy is rare. In one series of children with atopic dermatitis, oat sensitization was seen in 19 percent of cases, and, of those, oral food challenge (OFC) was positive in only 16 percent [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In another series of patients with atopic dermatitis evaluated in a university-based clinic, oat sensitization was seen in one-half of the cases with confirmed wheat allergy, but clinical oat allergy was confirmed in less than one-third of those [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Likewise, corn (maize) allergy was confirmed by OFC in only 5 of 145 children (3 percent) with atopic dermatitis and sensitization to one or more cereal grains (wheat, rice, rye, barley, oat, corn) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20088521"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with grain allergy present with a wide range of IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated clinical syndromes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/90949.html" rel="external">"Grain allergy: Allergens and grain classification", section on 'Grain allergens'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2398.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20088527"><span class="h2">IgE-mediated reactions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>IgE-mediated food-triggered reactions generally occur immediately, within minutes to two hours after ingestion. These reactions can present with skin, oropharyngeal, upper and lower respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and/or cardiovascular signs and symptoms. Reactions can vary from mild cutaneous reactions to life-threatening anaphylaxis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58836" href="/d/graphic/58836.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). IgE-mediated food allergy is more common in children than adults. Occupational and household exposures involving inhalation of cooking or processing vapors containing grain proteins may cause respiratory symptoms. Casual contact by touching can cause localized urticaria. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2398.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview", section on 'IgE-mediated reactions'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2412.html" rel="external">"Respiratory manifestations of food allergy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2223398018"><span class="h3">Implicated grains</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>IgE-mediated reactions have been reported to all of the cereal grains (wheat, rye, barley, oat, rice, corn, and millet) except sorghum, as well as the noncereal grains (quinoa, amaranth, and buckwheat). Wheat is the most common grain to trigger these types of reactions, which include food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis and baker's asthma. Rice is an uncommon cause of IgE-mediated allergies, particularly with ingestion, but is a reported cause of occupational allergy with respiratory symptoms developing upon inhalation of raw rice dust or rice vapor when rice is boiled [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Oral allergy syndrome (food-pollen syndrome) has not been reported with grains, presumably because they are consumed in cooked forms rather than raw. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/384.html" rel="external">"Exercise-induced anaphylaxis: Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/537.html" rel="external">"Occupational asthma: Definitions, epidemiology, causes, and risk factors", section on 'High-molecular-weight'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2412.html" rel="external">"Respiratory manifestations of food allergy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2403.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)"</a>.)</p><p>A study using double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFCs) confirmed corn allergy, although rare, resulting in various symptoms including anaphylaxis [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Anaphylaxis to millet has been reported in sporadic case reports [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. In addition, millet is a potential inhalant allergen for atopic bird keepers in whom millet may subsequently also elicit food allergy [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. Sensitization but not confirmed clinical allergy to sorghum has been reported [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>There are case reports of IgE-mediated allergy to the noncereal grains. Several cases of buckwheat allergy have been described, including occupational allergy in patients working in the production of buckwheat-containing foods and food allergies [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. Manifestations include anaphylaxis confirmed by DBPCFCs [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>]. Anaphylaxis to quinoa has been described in two case reports from France and the United States [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>]. One single case of food anaphylaxis to amaranth seed has been described [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20088533"><span class="h2">Mixed IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated reactions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The mixed reactions may have either humoral and/or cell-mediated mechanisms and may present with acute and/or chronic symptoms.

Wheat is the third most common allergy (after hen's egg and cow's milk) reported in infants and young children with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The role of food allergy in atopic dermatitis is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5545.html" rel="external">"Role of allergy in atopic dermatitis (eczema)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20088545"><span class="h3">Allergic eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Wheat is also among the major allergenic foods, following cow's milk, in allergic eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), a disorder characterized by eosinophilic inflammation of the esophagus in both children and adults [<a href="#rid22">22-24</a>]. Other grain allergies reported in patients with EoE include corn and rice. Patients with this disorder have symptoms suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux but are unresponsive to conventional reflux therapies. Other presenting symptoms include feeding disorders, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysphagia, and food impaction. Patients with allergic eosinophilic gastroenteritis (eosinophilic gastroenteropathy of the stomach and intestines) may have symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or weight loss. The role of food allergy in eosinophilic gastroenteritis is less clear than in EoE. These disorders are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2243.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16604.html" rel="external">"Allergy testing in eosinophilic esophagitis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16606.html" rel="external">"Dietary management of eosinophilic esophagitis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2536.html" rel="external">"Eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20088551"><span class="h2">Non-IgE-mediated reactions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The non-IgE-mediated reactions usually have a delayed onset beyond two hours of ingestion and typically present with gastrointestinal symptoms.

The typical presentation is that of severe vomiting and diarrhea within two to four hours after ingestion of the offending allergen, causing profound dehydration, lethargy, and sometimes shock. The acute phase can be the first manifestation of FPIES or can occur when the allergen is removed from the diet and then reintroduced. Chronic exposure to the offending allergen may present with vomiting and diarrhea, failure to thrive, and hypoalbuminemia. FPIES is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16528.html" rel="external">"Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20088563"><span class="h3">Protein-induced proctitis/proctocolitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Protein-induced proctitis/proctocolitis usually presents by six months of life with bloody-streaked, mucousy, loose stools and occasionally diarrhea in breastfed or standard formula-fed infants who are otherwise well appearing. Cow's milk and soy are the major causative foods, and elimination of milk and soy from maternal diet has resulted in resolution of symptoms in some but not all infants, suggesting a role for other food allergens, although wheat is not among the most commonly implicated foods [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5897.html" rel="external">"Food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis of infancy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20088569"><span class="h3">Food protein-induced enteropathy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Infants with this disorder have malabsorption, failure to thrive, anemia, diarrhea, vomiting, and hypoproteinemia.

The grains that contain the triggering proteins are wheat, barley, and rye. Patients usually have gastrointestinal manifestations, which may include diarrhea with bulky, foul-smelling, floating stools and abdominal distension and pain, as well as weight loss from malabsorption. There are also numerous nongastrointestinal manifestations  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76474" href="/d/graphic/76474.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76981" href="/d/graphic/76981.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). The diagnosis is made by finding characteristic histologic changes on small intestinal biopsy and symptom resolution on a gluten-free diet. The range of clinical presentations of celiac disease and nonceliac gluten sensitivity are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5899.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4774.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4771.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of celiac disease in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20088581"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS OF WHEAT ALLERGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A general discussion of the diagnosis of food allergy is presented elsewhere. A summary of this information, with a focus on those aspects that are most relevant to the diagnosis of wheat allergy, is provided below. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2397.html" rel="external">"History and physical examination in the patient with possible food allergy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2396.html" rel="external">"Diagnostic evaluation of IgE-mediated food allergy"</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of grain allergy is based upon the history and laboratory testing when available. The gold standard for diagnosis is a clinician-supervised double-blind, placebo-controlled oral food challenge (DBPCFC), although an open challenge will often suffice. Measurement of grain-specific IgE can aid in the diagnosis of IgE-mediated allergy and may eliminate the need for oral food challenges (OFCs). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2399.html" rel="external">"Oral food challenges for diagnosis and management of food allergies"</a>.)</p><p>With the exception of in vitro immunoassays for specific IgE, other diagnostic allergy procedures, including skin testing and food challenges, should be performed by allergy specialists with training in the management of serious allergic reactions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5541.html" rel="external">"Overview of skin testing for IgE-mediated allergic disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2399.html" rel="external">"Oral food challenges for diagnosis and management of food allergies"</a>.)</p><p>Component-resolved diagnosis to help determine when sensitization is clinically relevant may become more widely available in the future [<a href="#rid8">8,28-30</a>].

It usually affects young children and is outgrown by adolescence, although some retain it into adulthood. The history of an immediate reaction consisting of typical allergic symptoms, supported by positive tests for specific IgE antibodies, is sufficient to establish a presumptive diagnosis for suspected IgE-mediated reactions. Skin prick tests (SPTs) with a commercial wheat extract and/or in vitro tests for wheat-specific IgE are usually performed initially. Higher concentrations of food-specific IgE and larger skin test wheals generally correlate with an increased likelihood of a reaction upon ingestion, although these findings are based upon a limited number of clinical studies and the positive predictive values for wheat are low. In addition, these values are not predictive of the nature or severity of a reaction. Elimination of wheat, followed by an OFC, can help confirm the diagnosis in unclear cases.

The low positive predictive value of serum-specific IgE to wheat is mainly due to crossreactivity with grass pollen and to the incomplete representation of wheat proteins in the available diagnostic tests, which do not include all the allergens derived from the three wheat protein fractions with different solubility [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1243914843"><span class="h3">Wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>WDEIAn is a rare form of wheat allergy that is most often caused by sensitization to omega-5-gliadin, and "omega-5 gliadin allergy" has been proposed as a more precise term [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. This type of wheat allergy usually presents in adolescents or adults with severe reactions and anaphylaxis. Reactions occur unpredictably with some but not all wheat ingestions, in part because most patients have one or more cofactors that must be present for a reaction to occur. Exercise or physical exertion is the most common, although concomitant ingestion of alcohol or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is also typical. In some, reactions can be elicited at rest, without cofactors [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. Omega-5 gliadin sensitization is best demonstrated by immunoassay for IgE specific to the allergen, which is commercially available but is a specialty test [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].

The gold standard for diagnosis is an inhalational challenge with wheat and rye flours, but this may be difficult in nonspecialty centers or dangerous in patients with severe bronchospasm. In such situations, the combination of serum-specific IgE to wheat and rye and skin testing with whole wheat and rye flour extracts is recommended instead [<a href="#rid41">41,42</a>].

OFCs may need to be performed to other grains to which the patient is sensitized to confirm that there is clinical reactivity. Concomitant clinical reactivity to wheat, rye, and barley occurs more frequently than to oat, corn, and rice.

Over half of patients with wheat allergy in this study had a positive feeding test to barley, but corn and rice challenges were negative.
