Passage of legislation in multiple states in the United States regarding mammography reporting of breast density and follow-up for women with dense breasts has led to renewed discussion about the optimal screening protocol for early detection of breast cancer in women who have dense breast tissue on mammography [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss the classification of breast density and data regarding possible pros versus cons of obtaining supplemental testing beyond mammography. Screening for breast cancer and breast imaging are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7564.html" rel="external">"Screening for breast cancer: Strategies and recommendations"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/87311.html" rel="external">"Screening for breast cancer: Evidence for effectiveness and harms"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7561.html" rel="external">"Breast imaging for cancer screening: Mammography and ultrasonography"</a>.)</p><p>In this topic, we will use the term “woman/en” to describe genetic females. However, we recognize that not all people with breasts identify as female, and we encourage the reader to consider transgender and gender nonbinary individuals as part of this larger group.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1339759230"><span class="h1">DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Breast tissue comprises skin, blood vessels, ductal and stromal elements of the glands (which appear radio-opaque or white on mammography), and fat (which appears radiolucent or black on mammography). Mammographic breast density is defined as the relative amount of radio-opaque (white) elements to radiolucent (black) fat on the image.</p><p>Breast density does not correlate with physical examination findings [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. Breast density is a radiologic finding and cannot be predicted without obtaining a mammogram [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. Increase in the proportion of radio-opaque elements leads to greater mammographic breast density. Having mammographically dense breasts is normal and common, occurring in 47 to 50 percent of the population [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>].</p><p>Increased breast density may obscure the detection of a benign mass or, more importantly, a breast cancer. Reduced sensitivity of mammography in younger women in part is related to increased mammographic density due to a higher proportion of breast epithelial and stromal elements in younger breasts [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H748000470"><span class="h2">Classifying breast density</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are several ways to report mammographic breast density. The most commonly used method is the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS), fifth edition, 2012, in which the determination of breast density is made by the radiologist using visual assessment that is subject to inter-rater variability.</p><p>Computerized quantification programs are available, but are used largely as research tools. As these objective computer-based methods are not widely adopted, most state laws requiring breast density notification to patients are based on the less reproducible method of visual assessment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3792719"><span class="h3">BI-RADS classification</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>BI-RADS is based on a scale that identifies breast tissue density as being in one of four categories [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A – Almost entirely fatty</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>B – Scattered areas of fibroglandular density</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>C – Heterogeneously dense (may obscure small masses)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>D – Extremely dense (lowers the sensitivity of mammography)</p><p></p><p>For most purposes, the term "dense breasts" refers to either heterogeneously dense or extremely dense breasts (categories C or D), accounting for approximately 47 to 50 percent of women in the general United States screening population [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. Mammographic examples of each of these categories of breast density are shown in the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef107388" href="/z/d/graphic/107388.html" rel="external">image 1</a>).</p><p>The 2012 fifth edition BI-RADS lexicon assigns breast density based on the presence of any patch of dense tissue [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Earlier editions of BI-RADS used percentages of dense tissue relative to fat to report a quartile (&lt;25 percent, 25 to 50 percent, 50 to 75 percent, and &gt;75 percent dense).</p><p>Moderate variability among readers in the assignment of dense breast tissue categories (BI-RADS C and D) has been reported at both the interobserver and intraobserver level (kappa values from 0.4 to 0.6) [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. As an example, in one observational series of 83 radiologists interpreting 216,783 screening mammograms of 145,123 women aged 40 to 89 years, the percentage of mammograms categorized as dense breast tissue ranged from 6 to 85 percent [<a href="#rid11">11,13-15</a>]. Additionally, there is variability over time in the density of a patient’s breast density, especially with changes in weight or hormonal status (eg, phase of menstrual cycle, postmenopausal versus premenopausal status, or exogenous hormone use) [<a href="#rid16">16-20</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1339759328"><span class="h3">Computer-based breast density assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>With computer-based assessment of breast density, assignment of breast density categories is less variable than among human readers [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. This computer-based technology performs an automated volumetric assessment using digital mammography data, although it can fluctuate based on patient positioning as the amount of retroglandular fat included in the measurement can vary [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. Computer-based systems demonstrate moderate to substantial agreement (kappa values ranging from 0.6 to 0.7) with BI-RADS categorization by human readers [<a href="#rid24">24-26</a>]. However, there is up to 14 percent variability among vendor systems in assignment of a dense breast category [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4067508319"><span class="h2">Factors affecting breast density measurement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is much variation in the physical composition of the breast. Differing proportions of fat, connective tissue, and ductal and lobular elements contribute to differences in mammographic breast density. Mammographic density is not related to the size or the firmness of the breast [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. Breast density is greater in younger women and also varies with menopausal status, genetic factors, parity, use of estrogen, use of chemoprevention (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/z/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a>), and body habitus [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>]. There is also operator dependence in interpreting breast density on mammography [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>Breast density can vary during different phases of the menstrual cycle, with slightly increased density in the luteal as compared with the follicular phase [<a href="#rid16">16,29</a>]. This suggests that mammographic sensitivity may be slightly improved in menstruating women by obtaining mammograms during the follicular phase (ie, first and second weeks after menses), particularly for women who have ever used oral contraceptives [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p>Use of menopausal hormone therapy slows the age-related change from dense to fatty breast tissue. In a longitudinal study, this was more pronounced for women taking combination estrogen and progestin than for those taking estrogen alone [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Short-term (one to two months) cessation of hormone therapy prior to mammography, although advised by some clinicians, had no effect on mammographic recall rates in a randomized trial [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p>Breast density is inversely related to patient age, and dense breasts are most commonly associated with women under age 50 years or in those who are premenopausal. An international cross-sectional study showed that breast density declines are greatest during transition to menopause [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. However, many older women still have dense breasts (up to 44 percent of women in their 60s and 36 percent of women in their 70s) [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p>Finally, there is evidence that interpreting breast density may be somewhat subjective, with variability between radiologists. In a retrospective study of approximately 217,000 mammograms interpreted by 83 radiologists, 37 percent of mammograms overall were rated as showing dense breasts [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Across radiologists, this percentage ranged from 6 to 85 percent. Among patients with consecutive mammograms read by different radiologists, 17 percent had discordant results in regards to a dense versus a nondense assessment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1339759335"><span class="h1">BREAST DENSITY AND BREAST CANCER RISK</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The presence of dense breast tissue on mammography affects breast cancer risk in two ways: dense tissue can obscure an underlying cancer, decreasing the sensitivity of mammography to detect small lesions [<a href="#rid34">34-37</a>]; and increased density is an independent risk factor for breast cancer [<a href="#rid38">38</a>], as most cancers develop in the glandular parenchyma. However, increased breast density is not associated with increased mortality from breast cancer [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].</p><p>While increased breast density is an independent risk factor for breast cancer, the extent to which breast density affects risk for breast cancer is not absolutely established. The best estimates are that, compared with the general population, the relative risk of developing breast cancer is 1.2 for women with heterogeneously dense breasts and 2.1 for women with extremely dense breasts [<a href="#rid40">40,41</a>]. Reports indicating a relative risk of four- to sixfold are based on a comparison of women in the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile to women in the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile for breast density [<a href="#rid35">35,42,43</a>], which inflates the risk and does not represent the average population [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. Absolute risk, rather than relative risk, is a more meaningful reflection of the impact of breast density. In terms of absolute risk, a 45-year-old woman with average breast density, no family history of breast cancer, and no prior breast biopsy has a 0.7 percent five-year breast cancer risk compared with a woman with similar characteristics, except for extremely dense breast tissue, whose five-year breast cancer risk is 1.3 percent [<a href="#rid45">45</a>].</p><p>Breast density alone does not determine breast cancer risk: the relative risk conferred by breast density in part depends on a woman's other risk factors for breast cancer (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/792.html" rel="external">"Factors that modify breast cancer risk in women", section on 'Dense breast tissue'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Breast density was not an independent risk factor for breast cancer in a cohort of women at very high risk for breast cancer who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href="#rid46">46</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Black women have a higher likelihood of having fatty breasts (and therefore less dense breasts) than White women, but they have a higher risk for developing aggressive breast cancers, suggesting differences in the biology of the tumors [<a href="#rid5">5,6,47</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Asian individuals have higher breast density but a lower than average incidence of breast cancer [<a href="#rid5">5,48-50</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increasing age increases the risk for breast cancer, as does increasing body mass index (BMI), but age and obesity are associated with decreasing breast density [<a href="#rid51">51,52</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A large study using data from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) noted that the interval cancer rate was highest in the subset of women with dense breasts who also had an elevated five-year risk for breast cancer, which was less than a quarter of all women with dense breasts (24 percent) [<a href="#rid53">53</a>].</p><p></p><p>A risk assessment calculator for persons with dense breast is available. (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/141331.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16928732"><span class="h1">BREAST DENSITY AND PRIMARY SCREENING FOR BREAST CANCER</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mammography is the primary screening tool for breast cancer and has been shown in multiple randomized controlled trials to reduce the death rate from breast cancer. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7564.html" rel="external">"Screening for breast cancer: Strategies and recommendations"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/87311.html" rel="external">"Screening for breast cancer: Evidence for effectiveness and harms"</a>.)</p><p>However, even in the best circumstances, mammography may miss up to 20 percent of underlying breast cancers [<a href="#rid54">54</a>]. The sensitivity of mammography is inversely correlated with breast density, especially with older film-screen analog techniques [<a href="#rid55">55</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1037635246"><span class="h2">Digital mammography</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Digital mammography is more sensitive than film mammography for dense breasts [<a href="#rid56">56,57</a>] and is preferred (when available) for women with increased breast density [<a href="#rid58">58</a>].</p><p>In the United States, digital mammography has largely replaced film mammography [<a href="#rid59">59</a>]. Data from the Breast Cancer Screening Consortium (BCSC), a database of multiple screening programs in the United States, showed that in women with fatty or scattered fibroglandular breasts, the sensitivity of film-screen mammography is 85 to 86 percent but decreases to 79 percent in women with heterogeneously dense breasts and further decreases to 68 percent in women with extremely dense breasts [<a href="#rid60">60</a>]. Using digital mammography, the sensitivity of mammography for women without dense breasts (fatty or scattered fibroglandular breasts, 78 to 87 percent) was similar to the sensitivity for women with heterogeneously dense breasts (82 percent) and women with extremely dense breasts (84 percent). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7561.html" rel="external">"Breast imaging for cancer screening: Mammography and ultrasonography", section on 'Digital mammography'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2565592038"><span class="h2">Digital breast tomosynthesis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The technique of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is increasingly available in the United States. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has updated its guidelines for women with an average risk of breast cancer by adding "consider" annual tomosynthesis screening starting at age 40 years [<a href="#rid61">61</a>]. For average-risk women, there is no need for additional supplemental screening with other modalities when DBT is performed as the initial screening examination.</p><p>If women who have dense breasts have access to tomosynthesis screening, some experts suggest that tomosynthesis may be preferred over standard mammography, although this is not the standard of care [<a href="#rid62">62</a>]. DBT techniques, DBT among women with average breast density, and the potential for higher radiation exposure are described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7561.html" rel="external">"Breast imaging for cancer screening: Mammography and ultrasonography", section on 'Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT)'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7561.html" rel="external">"Breast imaging for cancer screening: Mammography and ultrasonography", section on 'Digital versus film screen mammogram'</a>.)</p><p>Although no randomized controlled trials comparing DBT and digital mammography in women with dense breasts have been performed, clinical studies suggest that, compared with digital mammography, screening DBT has greater sensitivity for cancer detection while decreasing the recall rate from screening mammography [<a href="#rid63">63-70</a>]. In one prospective observational study including approximately 2600 women with dense breasts, three-dimensional (3D) mammography detected an additional 5.4 to 6.2 cases of cancer per 1000 screens performed in women with dense breasts [<a href="#rid71">71</a>].</p><p>Multiple studies have shown that DBT may have the greatest effect at reducing false-positives in women with dense breasts and may have the greatest impact on improving cancer detection in women with heterogeneously dense breasts [<a href="#rid66">66,68,72,73</a>]. In one study, among approximately 3200 self-referred asymptomatic women with dense breasts and negative digital mammograms, an additional four breast cancers per 1000 screens were detected by DBT (95% CI 1.8-6.2) [<a href="#rid73">73</a>]. While breast ultrasound detected even more occult cancers (7.1 per 1000 screens, 95% CI 4.2-10.0), more than half of additional breast cancers in women with dense breasts could be detected by DBT. The risk profile of this self-referred group is not known, which makes it difficult to generalize these results to any specific population.</p><p>DBT may have a particular value for breast cancer screening in women with dense breasts <strong>and</strong> who are at increased risk of breast cancer. In an observational study including over 500,000 participants, screening with DBT versus digital mammography was associated with a lower risk of advanced breast cancer among the 3.6 percent of participants who had extremely dense breasts <strong>and </strong>≥1.67 percent five-year risk of breast cancer (absolute risk difference -0.53, 95% CI -0.97 to -0.1) [<a href="#rid74">74</a>]. However, no benefit for DBT was observed among those with extremely dense breasts but without an increased risk.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2480795846"><span class="h1">BREAST DENSITY AND SUPPLEMENTAL SCREENING FOR BREAST CANCER</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some cancers are mammographically occult and can be detected only by other breast imaging studies or physical examination. Whether performing supplemental screening to identify mammographically occult cancers provides more benefit than harm is not established.</p><p>Approximately one-half of women undergoing screening mammography have dense breasts, making dense breasts both normal and common [<a href="#rid75">75</a>]. Implementing supplemental screening after negative mammography in women with dense breasts (including heterogeneously dense and extremely dense breasts) could expose 48 to 50 percent of the screening population to potential false-positive screening results with associated anxiety and the need for breast biopsy, and there is no direct evidence that such supplemental screening affects mortality from breast cancer.</p><p>A smaller percentage of the population (about 10 percent) have BI-RADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System) category D extremely dense breast tissue, and therefore focusing supplemental screening on this population separately has been evaluated in some studies. (See <a class="local">'BI-RADS classification'</a> above.)</p><p>Evidence and expert consensus remains unclear as to the risk-benefit balance of supplemental screening for the modalities discussed below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2852895389"><span class="h2">Modalities under investigation for supplemental screening</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16928751"><span class="h3">Whole-breast ultrasound screening</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Two types of ultrasound have been investigated for supplemental screening: handheld ultrasound and automated breast ultrasound. Automated breast ultrasound uses an automated transducer to standardize image acquisition; however, these automated systems are not widely available.
