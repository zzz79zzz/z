Joint and soft tissue structures that are common sources of pain include the epicondyles and their tendon attachments (medial and lateral), the olecranon bursa, and the radial, median, and ulnar nerves, which course near the elbow joint. Referred pain most commonly arises from a cervical radiculopathy or from the shoulder.</p><p>This topic will discuss how to approach the adult patient with nontraumatic elbow pain systematically and identify the most common causes for such pain. Discussions of specific conditions and traumatic injuries affecting the elbow are found separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/248.html" rel="external">"Elbow tendinopathy (tennis and golf elbow)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13796.html" rel="external">"Elbow fractures and dislocation in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5282.html" rel="external">"Overview of upper extremity peripheral nerve syndromes"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The elbow joint is formed by the articulation of the distal end of the humerus with the proximal radius (radial head) and ulna  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81300" href="/z/d/graphic/81300.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68107" href="/z/d/graphic/68107.html" rel="external">figure 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82540" href="/z/d/graphic/82540.html" rel="external">figure 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66874" href="/z/d/graphic/66874.html" rel="external">figure 4</a>). Flexion/extension occurs at the ulnohumeral joint and is powered by the biceps  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59976" href="/z/d/graphic/59976.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>) and triceps  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108295" href="/z/d/graphic/108295.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>) muscles, respectively. The normal arc of motion ranges from full extension (0 degrees) to full flexion (135 degrees). Some individuals demonstrate the ability to extend the elbow beyond normal; this condition is referred to as "cubitus recurvatus" or cubital recurvatum  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62841" href="/z/d/graphic/62841.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). This condition may occur in isolation or stem from a hypermobility connective tissue disorder. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5591.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and hypermobility spectrum disorder"</a>.) </p><p>Supination-pronation (rotation) occurs at the radiohumeral and proximal radioulnar articulations of the elbow joint. The biceps muscle supinates and the pronator teres muscle pronates the elbow. The elbow can rotate from 0 to 180 degrees.</p><p>The epicondyles are bony prominences easily palpated on the medial and lateral sides of the distal humerus, proximal to the elbow joint, and they are a common source of pain. The tendinous origin of the muscles that flex and extend the wrist and fingers are located at the medial and lateral epicondyle, respectively.</p><p>Multiple bursae have been identified around the elbow joint; the olecranon bursa is the most superficial, and swelling of this bursa is both common and easily observed  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64359" href="/z/d/graphic/64359.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>).</p><p>A number of ligaments support the elbow joint; clinically important is the ulnar collateral or medial ligamentous group that assists in providing valgus stability  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97474" href="/z/d/graphic/97474.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>). The anterior bundle or band runs from the medial humeral condyle to the coronoid process of the ulna and provides the principal resistance to valgus stress. A second clinically important structure is the annular ligament, which is a component of the lateral collateral ligament complex and a major stabilizer of the proximal radioulnar joint. </p><p>The ulnar nerve courses through the elbow joint in the ulnar groove posterior and medial to the elbow  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81300" href="/z/d/graphic/81300.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68935" href="/z/d/graphic/68935.html" rel="external">figure 8</a>). Its course is contiguous with the joint capsule; thus, any process that distends the joint tends to impinge upon the ulnar nerve, causing paresthesias in the ulnar aspect of the hand and occasional weakness in the flexor digiti quinti. The median nerve runs anteromedial to the joint capsule and in close proximity to the brachial artery  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82540" href="/z/d/graphic/82540.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>); entrapment in this region typically is due to elbow trauma, repetitive elbow flexion, or supination and pronation of the forearm. The radial nerve passes posterior to the humerus, and then ascends anteriorly over the lateral epicondyle before dividing into superficial and deep branches in the forearm  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82540" href="/z/d/graphic/82540.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5282.html" rel="external">"Overview of upper extremity peripheral nerve syndromes"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGY AND COMMON PRESENTATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many of the common causes of elbow pain are periarticular, including epicondylitis (inflammation or degeneration of underlying tendons), olecranon bursitis, nerve entrapment syndromes, and referred pain. Systemic diseases (eg, rheumatoid arthritis) usually have polyarticular involvement that is revealed by a careful musculoskeletal history and examination. However, oligoarticular involvement can occur, as in the seronegative spondyloarthritides. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7502.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7795.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of peripheral spondyloarthritis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7794.html" rel="external">"Reactive arthritis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7784.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis"</a>.)</p><p>Patients who are experiencing a problem unique or intrinsic to the elbow typically present with complaints of pain (eg, epicondylitis or tendinopathy), swelling (eg, olecranon bursitis), or a loss of motion (eg, joint injury). Each of the more common presentation patterns is discussed below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Lateral elbow pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Lateral elbow pain is the most common complaint at the elbow. The source of pain may be the lateral epicondyle and the common extensor tendon origin, the radiohumeral joint, or referred pain from the shoulder or neck. A more complete list of the causes of lateral elbow pain is found in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73460" href="/z/d/graphic/73460.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The pain of lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) is typically well localized (the patient often points to the lateral epicondylar region) and is aggravated by activity that contracts the wrist extensors, including repetitious use of the forearm and wrist, and shaking hands. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/248.html" rel="external">"Elbow tendinopathy (tennis and golf elbow)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pain arising from the elbow (radiohumeral) joint is located slightly more posterior to the epicondyle (between the epicondyle and the olecranon process), is not well localized, and is readily distinguished from the pain of lateral epicondylitis by its effect upon joint motion (it is exceedingly rare for lateral epicondylitis to affect elbow range of motion). A joint effusion reduces elbow extension.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pain referred to the lateral elbow is suggested by the absence of increased pain with palpation or elbow movement, a vague description, and aggravation of the pain with provocative movement of the shoulder or neck.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Medial elbow pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Medial elbow pain is the second most common complaint at the elbow. It frequently arises either from the medial epicondylar region or the ulnar nerve as it travels through the cubital tunnel. A more complete list of the causes of medial elbow pain is found in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52503" href="/z/d/graphic/52503.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>As with lateral epicondylitis, the pain of medial epicondylitis is well localized and is aggravated by actions that contract the wrist flexors and pronators, such as lifting or repetitious use of the forearm and wrist. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/248.html" rel="external">"Elbow tendinopathy (tennis and golf elbow)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pain arising from the ulnar nerve is suggested by radiation into the ulnar side of the hand and associated sensory (or occasionally motor) symptoms in the fourth and fifth fingers. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5282.html" rel="external">"Overview of upper extremity peripheral nerve syndromes"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Elbow swelling</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who complain of elbow swelling most often have olecranon bursitis, however, other more serious conditions may occur. The warmth and redness that accompany the swelling, and the rapidity with which symptoms and signs develop, are clues to distinguish among potential underlying causes (usually trauma, sepsis, or gout). The ability of the patient to extend and flex the elbow completely generally excludes an intra-articular process as the cause of the elbow pain. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Impaired range of motion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with an intraarticular process occasionally complain of elbow swelling as well as elbow pain. However, these symptoms are virtually always overshadowed by their universal complaint, "I cannot straighten my elbow." Causes of synovitis include rheumatoid arthritis, seronegative spondyloarthropathies, such as reactive arthritis, psoriasis, or inflammatory bowel disease, crystal-induced synovitis due to gout or pseudogout, and septic bacterial arthritis.</p><p>Loss of smooth elbow motion without signs of inflammation occurs almost exclusively in athletes, particularly throwers (eg, baseball players), boxers, and gymnasts, who sustain trauma to the joint through repetitive throwing, punching, or upper extremity loading, respectively. This presentation, in particular in an adolescent athlete, can suggest the presence of osteonecrosis (osteochondritis dissecans) of the humerus. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/17003.html" rel="external">"Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD): Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Referred pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cervical radiculopathy and shoulder pathology, particularly rotator cuff tendinopathy and shoulder instability, may refer pain to or "through" the elbow [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Such pain is typically a deep ache that is not affected by elbow motion. These diagnoses are suggested by associated symptoms (paresthesias or hypesthesias) and signs, possibly including focal weakness and the absence of local tenderness and swelling at the elbow, in addition to aggravation of symptoms with shoulder or neck movement.</p><p>As an example, lateral herniation between C6-7 produces pain at the shoulder blade, pectoral area, and medial axilla with radiation to posterolateral upper arm, dorsal elbow and forearm, index and medial digits or all of the fingers, and sensory impairment in these areas. There is also weakness in extension of the forearm and sometimes the wrist and diminished or absent triceps reflex. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7773.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the adult patient with neck pain"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H595517803"><span class="h1">HISTORY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A careful history should be performed prior to the examination. The history should seek to identify an acute versus a chronic complaint, and detail a mechanism of injury (eg, traumatic or secondary to overuse) if one occurred. The onset of the injury and a history of prior interventions (eg, surgeries, rehabilitative therapy, and injections) may offer important insights into etiology. </p><p>Indolent pain with no specific history of injury, and symmetric involvement of both elbows, should prompt consideration for rheumatoid arthritis. The pain is frequently described as dull and throbbing and may be associated with some loss of motion. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7502.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis"</a>.)</p><p>Critical to the diagnosis is an assessment of any functional impairment compared to baseline, including any sport-related or occupational dysfunction, and any limitations of activities of daily living. The history should include arm dominance, and conditions and interventions affecting the entire kinetic chain, particularly proximal structures (eg, neck, shoulder, and scapular stabilizers).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h1">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>High quality studies of techniques commonly used to examine the elbow are lacking [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. A systematic review of 10 studies of the diagnostic accuracy of examination maneuvers (24 in total) used for assessing elbow conditions concluded that none of the described tests provided adequate certainty to rule in or rule out a specific condition [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Nine of the 10 studies included in the review had a high or unclear risk of bias. Nevertheless, observational evidence and clinical experience suggest that a careful examination can aid diagnosis [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Efficient examination of the elbow involves a systematic approach, including inspection, palpation, range of motion assessment, motor and sensory evaluation, special tests, and examination of related areas. The elbow, remainder of the affected upper extremity, and cervical spine should be examined. Key diagnostic findings are described in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79000" href="/z/d/graphic/79000.html" rel="external">table 3</a>): </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2881966552"><span class="h2">Inspection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The examination of the elbow begins with systematic inspection. Look for joint swelling, discoloration, atrophy  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114867" href="/z/d/graphic/114867.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>), hypopigmentation, nodules, and asymmetry. The carrying angle (humerus to ulna; normal is 5 to 15 degrees) should be noted, paying close attention to any angular deformities and asymmetries. </p><p>Inspect the olecranon bursa for swelling and thickening. If the bursa is noted to be enlarged, flex the elbow to 90 degrees and palpate for ballotable cystic swelling  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58894" href="/z/d/graphic/58894.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>). An acutely swollen, warm, and erythematous bursa suggests the diagnosis of acute bursitis, while a swollen and thickened bursa is consistent with a flare of chronic bursitis; a thickened bursa alone, without swelling, suggests chronic bursitis. Fluid should be aspirated to determine the underlying cause of swelling if there is associated pain, local inflammation, or if the patient is febrile.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2856366519"><span class="h2">Palpation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Palpate the radiohumeral joint to determine the presence of an effusion or focal tenderness. The lateral and medial epicondylar regions are palpated for tenderness with the elbow flexed at 90 degrees  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64356" href="/z/d/graphic/64356.html" rel="external">picture 5</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55147" href="/z/d/graphic/55147.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>). Local tenderness is the hallmark feature of lateral and medial epicondylitis, respectively. Patients with pain in one of these areas should go on to have confirmatory special testing as outlined below.</p><p>While not directly palpable, the general locations of the medial and lateral collateral ligaments are palpated for tenderness in patients, particularly throwing athletes, suspected of ligamentous injury. (See <a class="local">'Ligamentous injury'</a> below.) </p><p>The insertion of the triceps tendon and olecranon are palpated for tenderness, particularly in patients with posterior elbow pain.</p><p>If present, nodules of rheumatoid arthritis are varied in size, generally subcutaneous, circular in shape, firm, and non-tender  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74194" href="/z/d/graphic/74194.html" rel="external">picture 7</a>). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Range of motion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Elbow motion should be assessed; normal values are provided in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70587" href="/z/d/graphic/70587.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). Elbow flexion, extension, pronation, and supination should be tested.</p><p>Passive range of motion testing of the ulnohumeral joint assesses the integrity of the elbow in flexion and extension  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54946" href="/z/d/graphic/54946.html" rel="external">picture 8</a>). Full arm extension and flexion are compared side to side.</p><p>Full elbow extension dramatically reduces the intraarticular volume of the joint. With an inflammatory synovitis, the elbow joint assumes a position of flexion in order to increase the joint volume, thereby reducing the intraarticular pressure and associated pain felt within the elbow. Thus, full elbow extension will cause pain with an elbow synovitis, but not with olecranon bursitis.</p><p>Loss of full extension with end-point stiffness suggests the presence of a small effusion with mild arthritis. Loss of full extension AND flexion suggests the presence of a large effusion with moderate to severe arthritis. A joint effusion related to either an inflammatory arthritis or hemarthrosis can be readily excluded by documenting normal range of motion.</p><p>Osteoarthritis of the elbow is uncommon, unless there is a history of elbow fracture or repetitive loading of the upper extremity. A fracture involving the elbow is uncommon in patients who are able to perform full elbow extension [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>].</p><p>Passive range of motion of the radiohumeral joint assesses the integrity of the elbow in supination and pronation  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51261" href="/z/d/graphic/51261.html" rel="external">picture 9</a>). Passive supination and pronation are compared side to side while palpating the radial head.</p><p>Loss of full supination or pronation suggests previous fracture or dislocation of the elbow or osteonecrosis. Loss of full supination also occurs with congenital dislocation of the radial head.

(See  <a class="medical medical_society_guidelines" href="/z/d/html/117959.html" rel="external">"Society guideline links: General issues in muscle and tendon injury diagnosis and management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_society_guidelines" href="/z/d/html/139186.html" rel="external">"Society guideline links: Muscle and tendon injuries of the upper extremity (excluding shoulder)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1198165"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical anatomy</strong> – Elbow pain may be due to disorders involving the joint itself or surrounding structures, such as the epicondyles (medial and lateral) and their related structures (ligaments; origin of wrist flexors and extensor muscles), olecranon bursa, distal biceps tendon, and the radial and ulnar nerves. Referred pain may arise from the neck (cervical radiculopathy) or shoulder. (See <a class="local">'Clinical anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Etiology and common presentations</strong> – Lateral elbow pain is the most common complaint at the elbow  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73460" href="/z/d/graphic/73460.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The source may be the lateral epicondyle, radiohumeral joint, or referred pain. Medial elbow pain is the second most common complaint  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52503" href="/z/d/graphic/52503.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), and frequently arises either from the medial epicondyle or the ulnar nerve as it travels through the cubital tunnel. Patients who complain of elbow swelling most often have olecranon bursitis. Limited elbow motion suggests an intra-articular process. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Potential diagnoses based on the location of symptoms and the presentation are described in the section on etiology  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79000" href="/z/d/graphic/79000.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) (see <a class="local">'Etiology and common presentations'</a> above), while greater detail about each of the common and important diagnoses is provided in the section on differential diagnosis. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Physical examination</strong> – Efficient examination of the elbow includes inspection, range of motion testing, and palpation of the following structures  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef79000" href="/z/d/graphic/79000.html" rel="external">table 3</a>): </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Lateral epicondyle and extensor tendons </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Medial epicondyle and flexor tendons</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Radiohumeral joint</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Olecranon bursa</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Normal range of motion of the elbow effectively rules out involvement of the elbow joint itself. More specific tests that are performed based on the history and preliminary findings to establish a diagnosis are described in the text. (See <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> above and <a class="local">'Confirmatory tests'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic imaging</strong> – Radiographs of the elbow are usually unnecessary in patients with nontraumatic pain. Musculoskeletal ultrasound (US) is often a valuable tool for assessing the elbow, as many structures are relatively superficial. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H106988649"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges Ron Anderson, MD and Bruce Anderson, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Gunn CC, Milbrandt WE.
