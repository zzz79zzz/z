This is the most common form of hydrocephalus in children and is almost always associated with increased intracranial pressure (ICP). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6174.html" rel="external">"Hydrocephalus in children: Physiology, pathogenesis, and etiology", section on 'Obstruction'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Communicating hydrocephalus</strong> – Communicating hydrocephalus refers to CSF accumulation due to impaired absorption in the subarachnoid spaces. Rarely, it is caused by excessive CSF production. Communicating hydrocephalus is also typically associated with increased ICP. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6174.html" rel="external">"Hydrocephalus in children: Physiology, pathogenesis, and etiology", section on 'Impaired absorption'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6174.html" rel="external">"Hydrocephalus in children: Physiology, pathogenesis, and etiology", section on 'Excessive production'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Arrested hydrocephalus</strong> - arrested hydrocephalus refers to hydrocephalus that is nonprogressive because alternate pathways of CSF absorption develop or because normal mechanisms for CSF handling become re-established. </p><p></p><p>There is some overlap in these categories. Many causes of hydrocephalus have both obstructive and absorptive components (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82965" href="/d/graphic/82965.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), and the absorptive component of the hydrocephalus may change over time.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Normal pressure hydrocephalus</strong> – In normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), the cerebral ventricles are pathologically enlarged, but the ICP is not elevated. NPH is most often seen in adults over the age of 60 years. NPH is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5069.html" rel="external">"Normal pressure hydrocephalus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ventriculomegaly</strong> – Ventriculomegaly is a general term used to describe enlargement of the ventricles as seen on neuroimaging. Ventriculomegaly is a common finding in all forms of hydrocephalus. It is also seen in other conditions that are not associated with hydrocephalus (eg, brain atrophy).</p><p></p><p>The forms of hydrocephalus described above are distinct from two radiographic findings that include the same word:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>"Hydrocephalus ex-vacuo"</strong> – This term refers to enlargement of the CSF spaces caused by reduced volume of brain tissue due to atrophy (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61731" href="/d/graphic/61731.html" rel="external">image 1</a>) or malformation. It is not accompanied by increased ICP.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>"Benign external hydrocephalus"</strong> – Benign external hydrocephalus (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef111489" href="/d/graphic/111489.html" rel="external">image 2</a>) (also called "benign enlargement of the subarachnoid space" or "benign extra-axial fluid of infancy") is a relatively common cause of macrocephaly in infancy and frequently occurs in other family members [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. As the name implies, the condition is self-limited and affected infants usually do not require any intervention. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2849.html" rel="external">"Macrocephaly in infants and children: Etiology and evaluation", section on 'Benign enlargement of the subarachnoid space'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H755626470"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3362302304"><span class="h2">Overview</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Timely referral to a pediatric neurosurgeon is important to ensure appropriate management of children with hydrocephalus. In addition, referral to a pediatric neurologist is often warranted, particularly if there are associated conditions such as seizures and/or developmental delays.</p><p>Most cases of hydrocephalus are progressive, meaning that neurologic deterioration will occur if the hydrocephalus is not effectively and continuously treated. For most patients, the most effective treatment is surgical drainage, using a shunt or third ventriculostomy. Rare exceptions include cases of hydrocephalus caused by a vein of Galen malformation, in which embolization of the malformation may be more appropriate than surgical drainage [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>].</p><p>Rarely, hydrocephalus is not progressive because alternate pathways of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption develop or because normal mechanisms for CSF handling become re-established. This is known as "arrested hydrocephalus." In this case, shunting is unnecessary. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1040940676"><span class="h2">Management approach</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The need for and timing of surgical intervention in patients with hydrocephalus is determined by the severity of symptoms and the neuroimaging findings:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3149466940"><span class="h3">Acute rapidly progressive hydrocephalus</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with acute rapidly progressive hydrocephalus require urgent surgical intervention, typically with a CSF shunt or endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV). If the hydrocephalus is due to a structural cause such as a resectable brain tumor, the appropriate intervention consists of removal of the tumor, often with intraoperative external ventricular drain (EVD) placement. (See <a class="local">'CSF diversion procedures'</a> below.) </p><p>Temporizing measures may be needed for patients with a life-threatening presentation (eg, signs of herniation) and those who are too unstable to undergo surgery, and may include: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ventriculostomy</strong> – In cases of rapidly progressive hydrocephalus, a temporary EVD may be needed until a permanent shunt can be placed or until the hydrocephalus resolves spontaneously [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. EVD placement can be lifesaving in this setting. An EVD is a small catheter inserted through the skull usually into the lateral ventricle, which is typically connected to a closed collecting device to allow for drainage of CSF (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56391" href="/d/graphic/56391.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The EVD can also be connected to a transducer to measure ICP. The major complications associated with EVD are catheter occlusion and infection.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diuretics</strong> – The diuretics <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13329" href="/d/drug information/13329.html" rel="external">furosemide</a> and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13213" href="/d/drug information/13213.html" rel="external">acetazolamide</a> decrease CSF production. They have been used for short periods in slowly progressive hydrocephalus in patients too unstable for surgery, but they are generally less effective than ventriculostomy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In newborn infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus, treatment with diuretics is generally not effective and is associated with complications. This issue is discussed in a separate topic review. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5000.html" rel="external">"Germinal matrix and intraventricular hemorrhage (GMH-IVH) in the newborn: Management and outcome"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Serial lumbar punctures</strong> – Serial lumbar punctures are <strong>not</strong> recommended as a temporizing measure for most patients with acute rapidly progressive hydrocephalus. An exception is for preterm infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus, for whom repeated lumbar punctures are sometimes used as a temporizing measure prior to placement of a more definitive CSF diverting device. However, the routine use of serial LPs as a preventive measure in neonates with intraventricular hemorrhage does not appear to be effective and is <strong>not</strong> recommended [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. This issue is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5051.html" rel="external">"Germinal matrix and intraventricular hemorrhage (GMH-IVH) in the newborn: Risk factors, clinical features, screening, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3169960317"><span class="h3">Symptomatic and high-risk patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surgical intervention (with CSF shunt or ETV) is generally indicated in patients with hydrocephalus if <strong>any</strong> of the following are present:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Symptoms (eg, headaches, vomiting, irritability, developmental delays, focal neurologic deficits, papilledema)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Progression of ventriculomegaly on neuroimaging</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clear obstruction of the CSF pathway evident on neuroimaging </p><p></p><p>The choice of surgical procedure is based largely on the age of the patient and the underlying cause. (See <a class="local">'CSF diversion procedures'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H39177165"><span class="h3">Asymptomatic and low-risk patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Asymptomatic patients who lack findings suggestive of elevated ICP (eg, papilledema, bulging fontanel), are achieving expected developmental milestones, and do not have severe ventriculomegaly or obvious obstruction of the CSF pathway on neuroimaging can be managed with watchful waiting. Young infants are followed with serial head measurements, monthly or bi-monthly head ultrasounds, and assessment of gross motor skills. Ultrasound is generally preferred for this monitoring because it is time-efficient, inexpensive, and doesn't require sedation. If there is ongoing clinical concern after the anterior fontanelle closes, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred modality for follow-up neuroimaging. Limited imaging with ultrafast MRI can also be used as an alternative to ultrasonography in young infants. If signs or symptoms of increased ICP develop and/or there is progression of ventriculomegaly on imaging, surgical intervention is generally warranted. (See <a class="local">'CSF diversion procedures'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H635770891"><span class="h1">CSF DIVERSION PROCEDURES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H891153344"><span class="h2">Choice of procedure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts have long been the standard treatment for hydrocephalus in children (see <a class="local">'CSF shunt'</a> below). Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an alternative approach that has several advantages over CSF shunting in that it is relatively low-cost, durable, and potentially avoids the long-term complications that frequently occur with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts (ie, infection and/or malfunction). However, ETV is not effective in all patients. As discussed below, the success of ETV depends upon the age of the patient, the cause of hydrocephalus, and upon previous complications [<a href="#rid10">10-14</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Endoscopic third ventriculostomy'</a> below.)</p><p>Criteria for selection of patients for ETV versus shunting are not standardized and practice varies considerably. The 2014 evidence-based guidelines of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) concluded that outcomes of the two procedures are generally equivalent and they did not advocate for one approach over the other [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. </p><p>The ETV success score can help identify patients who are likely to benefit from ETV (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111224" href="/d/graphic/111224.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Higher values of the success score appear to predict the probability of ETV success. Ideally, the success score should be 80 or greater; however, some experts may recommend ETV if the score is greater than 50.</p><p>In our practice, we use the following approach: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We generally perform ETV for patients with third or fourth ventricular outlet obstruction or with clear aqueductal stenosis and for those with pineal region tumors and tectal tumors, because these respond well to ETV.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We generally perform a CSF shunt procedure rather than ETV in patients with a history of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), meningitis, or previous shunting, because the likelihood of success with ETV is low in this setting. However, if patients with these disorders also have acquired aqueductal stenosis, we generally attempt ETV prior to pursuing shunting, because we have had moderate success with this approach.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We generally do not perform ETV for treatment of obstructive hydrocephalus in infants &lt;3 months old, because the likelihood of success is low (around 25 percent) in this age group [<a href="#rid13">13,16</a>]. These infants may need a CSF shunt. Alternatively, ETV with choroid plexus cauterization may be an option. (See <a class="local">'ETV with choroid plexus cauterization'</a> below.)  </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For children in whom ETV is unsuccessful (ie, hydrocephalus progresses following ETV), we generally perform a shunting procedure, because repeating the ETV acutely is not likely to be successful [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2687704701"><span class="h2">CSF shunt</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1451906101"><span class="h3">Shunt procedure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A mechanical shunt system is placed to prevent the excessive accumulation of CSF. The shunt allows CSF to flow from the ventricles into the systemic circulation or to the peritoneum where it is absorbed, bypassing the site of mechanical or functional obstruction to absorption. Shunts consist of the following components (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110669" href="/d/graphic/110669.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ventricular catheter</strong> – A catheter is placed into one of the lateral ventricles (usually the right). In placing the ventricular catheter, entry from the skull is directed to access the ventricle without penetrating eloquent cortex. Frontal or occipital-parietal entry points are most commonly used, with the aim of positioning the tip of the catheter in the frontal horn, away from the choroid plexus. The optimal entry point is unclear. A 2014 systematic review of five studies that evaluated the impact of entry point on shunt survival concluded that the available evidence is insufficient to recommend one entry point (frontal or occipital) over the other. Technical adjuvants such as ventricular endoscopic placement, computer-assisted electromagnetic guidance, or ultrasound guidance are sometimes used to guide placement or the ventricular catheter; however, the available data are insufficient to determine if use of these technologies is associated with reduced complication rates and/or improved shunt function [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Valve</strong> – The catheter is connected to a one-way valve system (usually placed beneath the scalp of the postauricular area) that opens when the pressure in the ventricle exceeds a certain value. The ventricular pressure decreases as fluid drains, resulting in closure of the valve until the pressure increases again. Many different shunt system components are available and they function with a variety of pressure, flow, and siphon control characteristics [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. The design of these systems has evolved with the aim of reducing failure rates and other complications. Antisiphon devices (either intrinsic in the valve mechanism or as a separate device) have been developed to provide progressive resistance to flow to counteract the siphoning that occurs when negative pressure is exerted with vertical positioning. Programmable valves allow alterations in valve function to be made without a surgical procedure. A 2014 systematic review of 22 studies comparing different shunt components concluded that the available evidence did not demonstrate a clear advantage for any specific shunt component, mechanism, or valve design over another [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Distal catheter</strong> – The distal end of the system is connected to a catheter that is most commonly placed in the peritoneal cavity (VP shunt). Less commonly (eg, if peritoneal placement is not feasible), the distal catheter is inserted in the right atrium of the heart (ventriculoatrial [VA] shunt) or pleural space (ventriculopleural shunt).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3981094519"><span class="h3">Shunt complications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In general, complications of shunted hydrocephalus are due to malfunction of the shunt. If the shunt malfunctions and if the mechanism causing the hydrocephalus is still active, symptoms of hydrocephalus recur, and a shunt revision or other drainage procedure is required. (See <a class="local">'Shunt malfunction'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H595070781"><span class="h4">Shunt malfunction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Malfunction may be caused by infection or mechanical failure. Approximately 40 percent of standard shunts malfunction within the first year after placement, and 5 percent per year malfunction in subsequent years [<a href="#rid20">20-22</a>]. Prompt evaluation for possible shunt malfunction should be performed in patients with shunts who develop new or worsening signs or symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) (eg, headache, vomiting, lethargy, papilledema, irritability). Consultation with a neurosurgeon should occur early in the evaluation.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Infection</strong> – Patients with CSF shunts (eg, ventriculoperitoneal, ventriculoatrial, or ventriculopleural shunts) are at risk for shunt infections. Shunt infection is a common complication, occurring in approximately 5 to 15 percent of procedures [<a href="#rid21">21,23,24</a>]. This may lead to ventriculitis [<a href="#rid25">25</a>], may promote the development of loculated compartments of CSF, and may contribute to impaired cognitive outcome and death [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. The risk of shunt infections appears to be higher in newborns compared with older infants and children [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Infections can occur at any time, but most occur in the first six months after shunt placement. This is an important consideration in deciding when to tap shunts to evaluate a fever, especially when there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of mechanical shunt failure. Increasing abdominal pain associated with peritoneal signs and/or fever is a common presentation of shunt infection in patients with VP shunts. Abdominal ultrasound may demonstrate pseudocyst. Shunt infection must be considered in a child with a shunt who develops persistent fever. Antibiotics should be started, but this treatment alone is often not effective. In most cases, an infected shunt must be removed, and an external ventricular drain must temporarily be placed.

Like shunt infection, it is most common during the first year after shunt placement [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. The majority of shunt failures result from obstruction at the ventricular catheter [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Fractured tubing is the cause of shunt failure in approximately 15 percent of cases. Other causes include shunt migration (partial or complete) and excessive CSF drainage (overdrainage). Mechanical failure requires prompt recognition and surgical intervention.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation and diagnosis</strong> – Evaluation for shunt malfunction typically includes a detailed neurologic examination, neuroimaging (usually with computed tomography [CT] or rapid brain magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), and plain radiographs of the shunt tubing pathway (shunt series).

Most shunt failures result from obstruction of the ventricular catheter. Shunt infections are managed with both medical and surgical interventions (ie, externalization of the shunt and intravenous antibiotics) as discussed in detail separately.

Overdrainage greatly reduces the size of the ventricles causing the catheter to lie against the ependyma and choroid plexus, and these tissues block the holes in the catheter. Overdrainage can lead to slit-ventricle syndrome, which is characterized by small or slit-like ventricles, coupled with transient episodes of symptoms of raised ICP [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Changes in shunt design to address the problem of overdrainage include valves designed to open at different pressures and selected based upon the patient's characteristics; anti-siphoning devices to minimize the siphon effect caused by changes in posture; and valves that regulate by flow rather than by pressure differences.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3450030067"><span class="h4">Other complications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Other less common complications are related to the end site of CSF drainage. Potential complications in patients with VP shunts include perforation of viscus and intestinal obstruction. Patients with VA shunts may develop thrombosis associated with the atrial catheter, cor pulmonale, or very rarely may develop glomerulonephritis ("shunt nephritis"), which is related to chronic infection. Patients with ventriculopleural shunts may develop pleural effusions which occasionally produce symptoms.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H548807590"><span class="h2">Endoscopic third ventriculostomy</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3546393117"><span class="h3">ETV procedure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ETV involves creating an opening in the floor of the third ventricle to allow CSF to flow into the prepontine cistern and the subarachnoid space. ETV may be used in the initial treatment of selected cases of obstructive hydrocephalus and as an alternative to shunt revision; it is generally not effective for patients with communicating hydrocephalus (ie, hydrocephalus resulting from impaired CSF absorption). Some experts consider ETV the treatment of choice for aqueductal stenosis, although approximately 20 percent of patients still require shunting [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. The success of the procedure depends upon the age of the patient, the cause of hydrocephalus, and upon previous complications [<a href="#rid10">10-14</a>].</p><p>If ETV is performed, it is important to monitor the patient postoperatively with serial clinical examinations and imaging to determine if the procedure was successful. If the hydrocephalus progresses, a shunting procedure generally is performed, because repeating the ETV acutely is not likely to be successful [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].

The score was developed and validated using a dataset of 618 consecutive ETV procedures performed at 12 international institutions [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Older age at the time of the procedure (ie, &gt;1 year old) is the strongest predictor of success; other important predictors include noninfectious hydrocephalus etiology (eg, aqueductal stenosis, tectal tumor, myelomeningocele, IVH), and lack of previous shunt. </p><p>In an analysis of 618 ETV procedures performed at 12 international institutions, the overall success of ETV assessed six months after the procedure was 66 percent [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. In a follow-up study, the same investigators compared outcomes with ETV and shunting in a cohort of children with newly diagnosed hydrocephalus treated with either ETV (489 patients) or shunt insertion (720 patients) [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Among patients with high predicted ETV success (ie, ETV success score ≥80), cumulative reoperation-free survival at 36 months was greater with ETV compared with shunting (72 percent versus 54 percent). However, among patients with moderate and low ETV success scores, outcomes were similar with the two procedures. For patients with moderate ETV success scores (ie, 50 to 70), reoperation-free survival at 36 months was approximately 50 percent in both groups; and for those with low ETV success scores (ie, ≤40), reoperation-free survival at 36 months was approximately 38 percent in both groups.</p><p>In another multicenter, prospective study involving 336 children who underwent initial ETV and were followed for at least 18 months, 42 percent of patients had documented failure of their ETV requiring repeat hydrocephalus surgery during follow-up [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Two-year reoperation-free survival was 58 percent. The majority of failures (83 percent) occurred within six months of surgery and the ETV success score was a strong predictor of success. The cohort represented a selected group of patients; most patients (85 percent) were older than 12 months and most (81 percent) had not undergone prior shunt placement. The most common etiologies were aqueductal stenosis (25 percent) and midbrain or tectal lesions (21 percent).</p><p>Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating outcomes with ETV compared with shunting in children with communicating [<a href="#rid31">31</a>] and noncommunicating hydrocephalus [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H639227070"><span class="h3">ETV complications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Complications of ETV were described in a 2012 systematic review of 24 case series reporting outcomes of &gt;2500 ETV procedures in children and adults with hydrocephalus due to a variety of etiologies, most commonly tumor (37 percent) and aqueductal stenosis (26 percent) [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. The overall complication rate was 8.8 percent, including intraoperative hemorrhage (3.9 percent), infection (1.8 percent), CSF leak (1.7 percent), and other surgical complications (eg, thalamic infarct and subdural, intracerebral, and epidural hematoma: [1.1 percent]). Permanent morbidity, including hemiparesis, gaze palsy, memory disorders, altered consciousness, and/or hypothalamic dysfunction, occurred in 2.1 percent. Postoperative mortality was 0.2 percent, and two patients experienced delayed sudden death (ie, &gt;2 years following ETV) due to acute hydrocephalus from stoma occlusion.</p><p>In a subsequent multicenter prospective study involving 336 ETV procedures in pediatric patients, postoperative complications included CSF leak (4.4 percent), hyponatremia (3.9 percent), pseudomeningocele (3.9 percent), severe bleeding (1.8 percent), thalamic contusion (1.8 percent), venous injury (1.5 percent), hypothalamic contusion (1.5 percent), and major arterial injury (0.3 percent) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].

Based on results from studies performed predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa [<a href="#rid34">34,35</a>], the combined ETV and CPC procedure was introduced in the United States and Canada beginning in the late 2000s to early 2010s [<a href="#rid36">36-38</a>]. However, a 2020 systematic review, with five studies (two prospective) and 963 patients found no significant difference in success rates comparing ETV with ETV plus CPC, with the exception of a subgroup analysis suggesting benefit in sub-Saharan African populations [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. Further data are needed, particularly regarding the long-term effects of CPC, before ETV with CPC can be recommended as a routine practice.</p><p>CPC is technically challenging and requires skill with the flexible endoscope. In order to perform the procedure successfully, the surgeon must access the entire lateral ventricle choroid plexus bilaterally. Inadequate lighting in the ventricle may limit the amount of choroid plexus cauterization, and possibly complicate the procedure. In addition, the choroid plexus is not the only site for CSF production, so even if cauterization is successful, the procedure may not adequately address the hydrocephalus in some cases.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3460058265"><span class="h1">FOLLOW-UP</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Office visits and examination</strong> – Patients who undergo surgical treatment for hydrocephalus require long-term follow-up with a neurosurgeon.
