         Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an acute, diffuse, inflammatory form of lung injury that is associated with a variety of etiologies. Recognizing and promptly treating ARDS is critical to reduce the associated high mortality.
        </p>

         The clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and complications of ARDS are reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, etiology, management, and prognosis of ARDS are discussed separately. (See

         Patients with ARDS present with the features of ARDS itself as well as features due to the inciting event [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. However, the manifestations are so nonspecific that the diagnosis is often missed until the disease progresses.

         </span>
         ARDS should be suspected in patients with progressive symptoms of dyspnea, an increasing requirement for oxygen, and alveolar infiltrates on chest imaging within 6 to 72 hours of an inciting event  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58759" href="/z/d/graphic/58759.html" rel="external">

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         </span>
         Patients typically present with dyspnea and a reduction in arterial oxygen saturation after 6 to 72 hours (or up to a week) following an inciting event  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58759" href="/z/d/graphic/58759.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). On examination patients may have tachypnea, tachycardia, and diffuse crackles. When severe, acute confusion, respiratory distress, cyanosis, and diaphoresis may be evident. Cough, chest pain, wheeze, hemoptysis, and fever are inconsistent and mostly driven by the underlying etiology.

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Laboratory tests are nonspecific. A complete blood count may reveal a range of white blood cell counts (normal, elevated, or decreased) with or without a left shift (stress response). Routine chemistries may have evidence of organ injury reflective of severe hypoxemia or associated shock and systemic inflammation (eg, acute kidney injury [AKI] or transaminitis). The prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time may be prolonged, and D-dimer elevated, but laboratory evidence for disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) is generally limited to patients with associated sepsis or malignancy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1306.html" rel="external">
          "Evaluation and management of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in adults"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         By definition, arterial blood gas analysis shows hypoxemia, which is often initially accompanied by acute respiratory alkalosis, and an elevated alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (
         <a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/13447.html" rel="external">
          calculator 1
         </a>
         ). The development of acute hypercapnic respiratory acidosis is an ominous sign and may represent severe ARDS with impending respiratory arrest. Metabolic acidosis from hypoxemia is unusual and, if present, is more likely to be due to the precipitating etiology (eg, sepsis) or associated organ injury (eg, AKI).

         Imaging findings are variable and depend upon the severity of ARDS. The initial chest radiograph typically has bilateral diffuse alveolar opacities with dependent atelectasis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53014" href="/z/d/graphic/53014.html" rel="external">
          image 1

         ), although findings can be subtle [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest may show widespread patchy and/or coalescent airspace opacities that are usually more apparent in the dependent lung zones  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71931" href="/z/d/graphic/71931.html" rel="external">
          image 2

         ) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5
         </a>
         ]. The opacities can be subtle (eg, patchy ground glass), particularly in early ARDS, but can become consolidative in appearance as severity worsens [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The radiographic appearance of ARDS changes over time, the details of which are discussed below. (See

        <p>
         Bedside lung ultrasound remains investigational but preliminary studies report an 83 to 92 percent sensitivity for the diagnosis of ARDS compared with CT chest [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>

         Clinical findings related to the underlying etiology may also exist at presentation  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58759" href="/z/d/graphic/58759.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). As an example, in patients with ARDS due to pneumonia-induced sepsis there may be fever, hypotension, leukocytosis with left shift, lobar consolidation, and lactic acidosis; or patients with shock may also have evidence of organ failure, including transaminitis and AKI.
        </p>
        <p>
         Presenting features of the inciting event frequently mask the manifestations of ARDS. As an example, the opacities from pancreatitis-related atelectasis may mimic ARDS, ultimately leading to a delay in diagnosis.

          A thorough history and clinical examination
         </strong>
         – Clinicians should inquire about fever, productive cough, pleuritic chest pain, and witnessed aspiration (may suggest infectious or aspiration pneumonia), orthopnea (may suggest cardiogenic pulmonary edema), and hemoptysis (may suggest cancer, vasculitis, or alveolar hemorrhage). They should also inquire about history of asthma (may suggest vasculitis), cardiac dysfunction, cancer, stem cell transplant, or pulmonary fibrosis (may suggest cardiogenic pulmonary edema, lymphangitic tumor spread, immune reaction, or interstitial pneumonitis, respectively), and about abdominal symptoms (pain, vomiting, or diarrhea may suggest pancreatitis, colitis, or viscus rupture). Clinicians should seek evidence of recent trauma, surgery, smoke or other toxin inhalation, sick contacts, environmental or occupational exposures (eg, animal exposure and fire eating), travel, pregnancy, transplant, transfusions, fetal delivery, illicit drug use (inhaled, intravenous, and oral), and recent changes in prescribed medications (eg, antibiotics,

         On examination, the clinician should assess for signs of acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (eg, raised jugular venous pressure, crackles, murmurs, S3/S4 gallops, and lower extremity edema) and pneumonia (eg, dullness on percussion, rales, egophony, or bronchial breath sounds). The abdomen should be examined for tenderness and distension and/or absent bowel sounds to suggest subdiaphragmatic etiologies for ARDS. The skin should be examined for burns, rashes, wounds, track marks, and systemic manifestations of septic emboli; lymph nodes should be examined for size and tenderness (eg, possible infections or cancer); and dentition examined for possible source of sepsis. Volume status (eg, mucus membrane assessment and skin turgor) should also be assessed and fluid balance calculated, if feasible.

          Laboratory studies

         – Laboratory studies should include complete blood count, chemistries, liver function tests, coagulation studies, and arterial blood gas analysis. Some clinicians also measure D-dimer, troponin, and lactate levels to investigate common etiologies that can cause or mimic ARDS. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are often ordered when assessing cardiogenic pulmonary edema (see
         <a class="local">
          'Excluding acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema'

          Imaging
         </strong>
         – All patients with suspected ARDS should have a chest radiograph since abnormal imaging is essential for the diagnosis of ARDS. Chest radiography is also critical to evaluate for etiologies of ARDS (eg, lobar consolidation and air bronchograms consistent with pneumonia) as well as for conditions that mimic ARDS, particularly acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (eg, pulmonary venous congestion, pleural effusions, Kerley B lines, and cardiomegaly).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         While CT of the chest is not necessary for the diagnosis, it may be helpful when there is a need for a more detailed pulmonary evaluation (eg, seeking evidence for cavitation or pleural effusions or chronic interstitial lung disease that may be missed on chest radiograph).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Additional imaging may be performed when specific etiologies for ARDS are suspected. For example, CT or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (eg, for trauma patients), or CT of the abdomen (eg, for patients with suspected pancreatitis, abscess, colitis, peritonitis, appendicitis), or pelvis (for patients with suspected retained fetal products) may be useful to search for evidence of associated pathologies.

         The most important condition to exclude is acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, which can be difficult to distinguish from ARDS. In practice, most clinicians use clinical evaluation and BNP or N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP), with or without transthoracic echocardiography to confirm or exclude pulmonary edema:

          Clinical assessment
         </strong>
         – Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is usually due to left ventricular systolic or diastolic dysfunction, but may also be due to fluid overload, severe hypertension, or severe kidney disease. It may be distinguished from ARDS by evidence of cardiac dysfunction (eg, an S3 or S4 gallop, new or changed murmur), elevated right-sided filling pressures (eg, elevated jugular venous pressure, leg edema), or related radiographic abnormalities (eg, pulmonary venous congestion, Kerley B lines, cardiomegaly, and pleural effusions). A response to diuresis can also confirm the diagnosis retrospectively. (See

         <strong>
          BNP or NT-proBNP
         </strong>
         – In patients with suspected ARDS, BNP alone in general is not a reliable indicator for distinguishing ARDS from edema. Rather, it should be used in conjunction with clinical assessment to make this distinction. One observational study found that a plasma BNP level less than 100 pg/mL identified ARDS with a sensitivity and specificity of 27 and 95 percent, respectively [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Thus, a plasma BNP level below 100 pg/mL may favor ARDS, but higher levels neither confirm heart failure nor exclude ARDS [

          7,8

          Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)
         </strong>
         – In patients with suspected ARDS, TTE may be performed to seek evidence of cardiac dysfunction when cardiogenic pulmonary edema cannot be excluded by clinical evaluation, laboratory findings, or imaging. TTE is not routinely needed if clinical suspicion for cardiogenic pulmonary edema is low and the workup clearly points to noncardiogenic causes of pulmonary infiltrates. (See

         A normal ejection fraction may favor ARDS while severe aortic or mitral valve dysfunction, severe diastolic dysfunction, or a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction may favor cardiogenic pulmonary edema. However, these findings are not specific. For example, some precipitants of ARDS (eg, septic shock) can cause an acute cardiomyopathy that develops concomitantly with ARDS [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. Conversely, if left heart function appears normal, pulmonary edema may occur due to volume overload (eg, pulmonary edema from blood product transfusions, fluid overload from aggressive fluid resuscitation). In addition, ARDS can coexist with cardiogenic pulmonary edema; while the diagnosis of ARDS requires that hydrostatic edema be excluded, it is clear that patients with volume overload can develop acute lung injury, supported by the observation of elevated pulmonary artery wedge pressures when pulmonary artery catheters are placed in patients with ARDS [

         Bronchoscopy is most useful when the cause of ARDS is uncertain and concern is raised that the etiology may require specific treatment. For example, bronchoscopy may help clinicians identify infectious etiologies for ARDS, typically pneumonia, by providing specimens for culture when sputum is unavailable or unrevealing (eg, invasive mycotic infections, tuberculosis [TB], or pneumocystis). Bronchoscopy may also help clinicians diagnose specific noninfectious causes of ARDS (eg, acute eosinophilic pneumonia [AEP]) or conditions that mimic ARDS (eg, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, lymphangitic carcinomatosis) by providing specimens for cytologic or biochemical analysis.

          Occult infection/pneumonia

         – Bilateral pneumonia is both a cause and mimicker of ARDS. Thus, many patients with ARDS end up being treated empirically with antibiotics. This was illustrated by an autopsy study that found pneumonia in 58 percent of patients with ARDS, although pneumonia was suspected antemortem in only 20 percent [

          16

Bronchoscopy may be useful when specific organisms need to be ruled out or are suspected. Examples include patients with a history of TB exposure, immunosuppression, risk factors for fungus (travel history, neutropenia), select viruses (eg, cytomegalovirus [CMV] in transplant patients, varicella in pregnant women) or parasites (eg, travel), suspected

         Once the decision is made to proceed with bronchoscopy, the airways should be visually inspected for edema, infections, secretions, foreign bodies, lipid or food particles, and endobronchial masses. Lavage fluid, with or without bronchial brushings, should be taken from the most affected regions of the lung. Samples should be analyzed for cell count (including eosinophils), microbiologic analysis (routine, fungal, viral), galactomannan level, and cytologic analysis for organisms (eg, fungus, CMV,

         Bronchoscopy in mechanically ventilated patients with hypoxemia has a similar spectrum of complications to that in spontaneously breathing patients (eg, barotrauma, bleeding, hypotension, hypoxemia) but the risk of complications is assumed to be higher (particularly barotrauma and hypoxemia). The performance of bronchoscopy in mechanically ventilated patients as well as contraindications and complications of bronchoscopy in this population are discussed separately. (See

         The decision to proceed with bronchoscopy should weigh the procedural risk against its diagnostic sensitivity for the suspected condition(s). Conditions with a high sensitivity include infections (particularly before antibiotics are started), DAH, and AEP. In contrast, its diagnostic sensitivity for many of the interstitial lung diseases (eg, acute interstitial pneumonitis [AIP], acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [AEIPF], cryptogenic organizing pneumonia [COP], acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia [AFOP]) or pulmonary vasculitis is poor. If bronchoscopy is not considered safe, mini-BAL may be an alternative, although the sensitivity is likely lower than bronchoscopy. The role of bronchoscopy in the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia is discussed separately. (See

         Lung biopsy is rarely performed during the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected ARDS. In most circumstances, sufficient evidence is available from less invasive studies to provide a diagnosis of ARDS and identify the etiology or a mimicking disorder. Indications for lung biopsy vary but include patients in whom a diagnosis has not been achieved with less invasive means, patients in whom a specific pathology and/or reversible etiology is suspected (eg, lupus vasculitis, COP), or those in whom diagnostic information may inform therapeutic and prognostic decisions including withdrawal of ventilator support [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17-19
         </a>
         ]. Examples where a lung biopsy may be useful include suspicion for an invasive fungal or other lung infection, COP, AEIPF, suspected AIP, pulmonary vasculitis, or invasive cancer (eg, leukemic infiltrates, lymphangitic spread, tumor emboli). The decision to biopsy is an individualized one that needs to be discussed with surrogates; in all cases, the risk of biopsy should be weighed against the benefits of obtaining diagnostic information that can inform therapeutic and prognostic decisions. Importantly, the sensitivity or lack thereof of biopsy and the uncertain likelihood of identifying irreversible etiologies should be clearly explained before proceeding with biopsy. (See

         In a meta-analysis of 14 case series (total of 512 patients), the most common diagnoses were "fibrosis/pneumonitis" (25 percent), infection (eg, CMV, fungus; 20 percent), and diffuse alveolar damage ([DAD]; ie, ARDS or AIP; 16 percent) [

         In contrast, in a smaller review of 30 patients, a larger proportion (almost three quarters) had DAD (the most common pathology that underlies ARDS) on biopsy [

        <p>
         This variability likely reflects the wide variation in practice among clinicians when choosing lung biopsy in this population. Therapeutic decisions were altered in the majority (up to two-thirds) of patients who underwent biopsy, ranging from the implementation of a new or escalation of a prior therapy (most often steroids) to the withdrawal of unnecessary therapy or life-sustaining treatment [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,20-24
         </a>
         ]. Approximately one-third of patients experienced complications that were generally well tolerated (eg, pneumothorax). While studies report no procedure-related deaths, the mortality after diagnostic biopsy is generally greater than 50 percent, likely reflecting identification of etiologies not responsive to therapy. Survival tends to be best in those in whom a steroid-responsive disease is identified.

         In most cases, although the risk of complications is likely greater, video-assisted lung biopsy is preferred over transbronchial biopsy since, in general, it has a higher diagnostic yield for the potential etiologies of interest in this population and the majority of reported studies only include patients that have undergone surgical biopsy. However, two small retrospective studies have reported a diagnostic yield for transbronchial biopsy in ventilated critically ill patients [

         Several conditions are associated with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), a condition that mimics ARDS  (

Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are also helpful in distinguishing DAH from ARDS. In DAH, the clinician may appreciate frothy bloody secretions throughout the airways, increasing red blood cells in serial BAL specimens, and hemosiderin-laden macrophages in the BAL fluid. However, these findings are not specific and more subtle forms of hemorrhage may not be evident on BAL. (See

         Several specific acute inflammatory conditions may mimic ARDS but can be distinguished by a more indolent time of onset (eg, longer than one week) and by specific pathological findings on biopsy. Some conditions may present in a manner that is indistinguishable from ARDS with the acute onset of bilateral lung infiltrates and hypoxemia. Whether the term ARDS should be used to describe these conditions is a matter of uncertainty; nonetheless, it is important to consider these diagnoses, some of which are reversible with specific treatments. With the exception of acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP), which can be diagnosed bronchoscopically, most can only be definitively distinguished from ARDS on lung biopsy.

         AIP is a rare and fulminant form of diffuse lung injury that has a presentation similar to ARDS. Many people consider AIP a subset of idiopathic ARDS since its clinical manifestations are similar and both demonstrate diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) on histopathology.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is also typically abrupt in onset but bilateral opacities are unusual unless complicated by infarction and pneumonitis. PE can be easily distinguished on CT pulmonary angiography. Air embolism should always be suspected when patients experience sudden-onset respiratory distress in the setting of a known risk factor, intravenous catheter insertion, or trauma. A transthoracic echocardiogram may identify air in the intravascular space. (See

         For most patients, ARDS is a clinical diagnosis. Although ARDS can be diagnosed histopathologically (eg, classically diffuse alveolar damage [DAD] in the early stages), clinicians typically only perform lung biopsy to confirm or exclude other important etiologies that can cause or mimic ARDS. Because it is under-recognized, it is essential to have a high clinical suspicion for ARDS in those at risk.

         ARDS can be diagnosed once cardiogenic pulmonary edema and alternative causes of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and bilateral infiltrates have been excluded. The "global definition" proposed in 2024 expands on the previous Berlin definition [

         Respiratory symptoms must have begun within one week of a known clinical insult, or the patient must have new or worsening symptoms during the past week.

        <p>
         Because the international consensus definition of ARDS specifies no criteria relating to the underlying etiology, some uncertainty remains with respect to which conditions should or should not be included under the ARDS diagnostic umbrella. Generally included are disorders that are known to cause diffuse alveolar damage and have the potential to resolve over time. Thus, viral or diffuse bacterial pneumonia and acute inhalational injuries are included, whereas eosinophilic pneumonia

         and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage associated with collagen vascular diseases are not.

Pneumonia was the most common pathologic finding among patients who met clinical criteria for ARDS but did not have DAD. Further investigation is needed to determine whether DAD can predict prognosis or response to therapy.

         The first several days of ARDS are characterized by hypoxemia requiring a moderate to high concentration of inspired oxygen and positive end-expiratory pressure. The bilateral alveolar infiltrates and diffuse crackles are persistent during this period and patients may be tenuous due to severe hypoxemia. Most patients who survive this initial course begin to exhibit better oxygenation and decreasing alveolar infiltrates over the next several days. This may permit the amount of ventilatory support to be decreased and weaning to begin. (See

         Some patients, the proportion of which is unknown, have persistent, severe hypoxemia and remain ventilator-dependent, which may represent the fibroproliferative phase of ARDS. The fibroproliferative phase of ARDS is characterized radiographically by progression from airspace opacification to a coarser reticular pattern of lung infiltration. These changes within the lung parenchyma are often accompanied by persistent hypoxemia, low lung compliance, high dead space, and sometimes by progressive pulmonary hypertension. The course may become dominated by persistent ventilator dependence. This phase needs to be distinguished from ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The lungs of patients who survive the fibroproliferative phase enter into an extended phase of resolution and repair. Hypoxemia and pulmonary infiltrates gradually improve over weeks to months. Cardiopulmonary function often returns to near baseline levels by six months or longer after the initial lung injury. However, many survivors of severe ARDS are left with lung function, cognitive, emotional, and physical deficits. (See

          Clinical features
         </strong>
         – Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) should be suspected in patients with progressive symptoms of dyspnea, an increasing requirement for oxygen, and alveolar infiltrates on chest imaging within 6 to 72 hours (and up to one week) of an inciting event  (

          Clinical course
         </strong>
         – Patients who survive the initial course usually begin to exhibit better oxygenation and decreasing alveolar infiltrates over the next several days such that ventilator weaning may begin  (
