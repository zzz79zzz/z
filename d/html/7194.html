         A large number of radiologic studies are used to evaluate patients with kidney disease. These tests are performed alone or in combination for the detection, diagnosis, and/or the evaluation of multiple conditions. They are most often used to assess urinary tract obstruction, kidney stones, kidney cyst or mass, kidney size, disorders with characteristic radiographic findings, renal vascular diseases, and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).

         Because of safety, ease of use, and the information provided, the most commonly used radiographic technique in patients presenting with kidney disease is kidney ultrasonography. Since obstruction is a readily reversible disorder,
         <strong>
          all
         </strong>
         patients presenting with kidney failure of unknown etiology should undergo ultrasonography, the modality of choice to detect possible obstructive disease. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7174.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction (UTO) and hydronephrosis"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The following is a brief introduction to the use of radiologic studies in the evaluation of patients with a variety of suspected or confirmed kidney disorders. Detailed discussions concerning the findings and optimal use of these modalities, as well as other techniques, are presented separately in topics reviewing individual diseases for which these modalities are routinely employed.

         B-mode ultrasonography is the most appropriate imaging modality for evaluation of chronic kidney disease and should be part of the initial workup. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/102837.html" rel="external">
          "Chronic kidney disease (newly identified): Clinical presentation and diagnostic approach in adults"

        <p>
         It can detect advanced irreversible parenchymal disease, cystic diseases, and chronic urinary obstruction. It is also the initial imaging study of choice in evaluating unexplained acute kidney injury, specifically to exclude urinary tract obstruction since it allows the patient to avoid the potential allergic and toxic complications of radiocontrast media  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef94099" href="/z/d/graphic/94099.html" rel="external">
          image 1
         </a>
         and
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef94100" href="/z/d/graphic/94100.html" rel="external">
          image 2
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Ultrasound can, in the majority of affected patients, diagnose hydronephrosis and often establish its cause. Since urinary tract obstruction is easily diagnosed and reversible when treated early, ultrasonography should be performed in
         <strong>
          all
         </strong>
         patients presenting with kidney failure of unknown etiology. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7174.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction (UTO) and hydronephrosis"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         While ultrasound is useful for detecting proximal obstruction of the ureter  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef94101" href="/z/d/graphic/94101.html" rel="external">
          image 3
         </a>
         ), it is less sensitive for showing the level and cause of obstruction when obstruction is in the lower abdomen or pelvis because the ureter is usually obscured by overlying bowel. One exception is when a stone is impacted at the ureterovesical junction; when this is suspected, a pelvic ultrasound examination may be useful. The bladder should be examined in all cases of hydronephrosis, whether or not the proximal ureter is dilated.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although less sensitive than computed tomography (CT) in detecting kidney masses, ultrasonography can be useful in differentiating cystic from solid masses that can be indeterminant on CT [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1681.html" rel="external">
          "Simple and complex kidney cysts in adults"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         It is also commonly used to screen for and diagnose polycystic kidney disease and to assess prognosis through measurement of kidney length [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1678.html" rel="external">
          "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in adults: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnosis'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Ultrasonography should also be considered in patients with pyelonephritis in certain situations (males, recurrent infections, and incomplete response to antimicrobial therapy) to rule out the presence of obstruction, kidney or perinephric abscesses, and other complications of pyelonephritis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62046" href="/z/d/graphic/62046.html" rel="external">
          image 4
         </a>
         ). However, CT is more sensitive and accurate in identifying abscesses. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16109.html" rel="external">
          "Acute complicated urinary tract infection (including pyelonephritis) in adults and adolescents", section on 'Imaging'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Findings on ultrasonography can provide evidence of irreversible kidney disease, based upon kidney size and cortical thickness. Increased echogenicity is a nonspecific finding seen with many diffuse kidney diseases that does
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         necessarily indicate irreversible disease. In contrast, the combination of increased echogenicity and kidney length &lt;10 cm almost always indicates untreatable disease [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, ultrasound is also useful in detecting tubular interstitial disorders that can present as increased medullary echogenicity, nephrocalcinosis, and loss of papillae [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. While it is a reasonable initial imaging study for kidney stones, ultrasonography can miss small stones, and CT should be the initial exam in patients with acute renal colic since the stone is likely to be in the ureter and not visible by ultrasound.

         Doppler ultrasonography can be used to evaluate renal vascular flow in patients with possible renal

         </em>
         artery stenosis, renal vein thrombosis, or kidney infarction. There are two components of this examination: direct interrogation of the renal artery and vein, and indirect assessment through measurement of velocity waveforms in intrarenal arteries (spectral analysis). Spectral analysis is far easier to perform; the tardus-parvus pattern is most specific (96 percent) for renal artery stenosis but has a sensitivity of only 43 percent [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. CT and magnetic resonance (MR) are more sensitive and are usually required for confirmation. Conversely, direct Doppler of the renal artery is technically challenging [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ] and is only reliable in high-volume centers when performed and interpreted by experienced radiologists. The sensitivity and specificity range from 65 to 75 percent and 80 to 90 percent, respectively, with a negative predictive value of 70 to 90 percent [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. (See

         The resistive index is calculated by the following:

        </div>
        <p>
         A high renal resistive index (&gt;0.7) can be observed in a wide variety of disorders but is dependent primarily upon extrarenal hemodynamics rather than intrarenal factors [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. As a result, the renal resistive index is of
         <strong>
          no

         utility in the diagnosis of kidney parenchymal disease. Resistive index is commonly measured in transplanted kidneys but is an insensitive and nonspecific indicator of rejection [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13-15
         </a>
         ]. While the resistive index has prognostic value, this is probably related to systemic factors rather than kidney abnormalities [

         CT often provides complementary information to that obtained with kidney ultrasonography. In particular, CT with contrast is used to evaluate complex kidney cysts and possible masses detected by ultrasonography [
         <a href="#rid16">

         CT (or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) is used to evaluate kidney masses that are detected by ultrasonography. This usually requires administration of intravenous contrast, but some masses, specifically angiomyolipomas, can be diagnosed without contrast. (See

         CT is used to confirm, localize, and identify the cause of ureteral obstruction that is suspected, but not visible, by ultrasonography. This is usually performed with intravenous contrast for optimal visualization of the ureters, but the ureters can often be visualized without intravenous contrast.

         Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in the earliest stages can be diagnosed by CT with a higher sensitivity than with kidney ultrasonography, particularly in younger patients. However, ultrasonography is usually the preferred initial screening test, and CT scanning is rarely required. (See

While it has lower spatial resolution than CT, the sensitivity for detecting renal artery stenosis is 90 percent or greater and does not necessarily require administration of gadolinium as a contrast agent [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Administration of gadolinium during MRI was strongly linked to an often severe disease called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) among patients with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), particularly those requiring dialysis. As a result, the US Food and Drug Administration recommended that gadolinium-based imaging be avoided, if possible, in patients with an eGFR &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         . However, the risk of NSF varies considerably among the different gadolinium compounds and may be minimal with some, so prior consultation with the radiologist is advised. The use of gadolinium in patients with reduced kidney function is discussed at length elsewhere. (See

         Antegrade pyelography has been largely supplanted by ultrasonography and CT and is generally performed only during therapeutic nephrostomy or ureteral stent placement. However, retrograde pyelography may be indicated when findings on CT are uncertain or after trauma to the lower urinary tract. Retrograde studies can also be useful for localizing the site of obstruction when there is insufficient kidney function to excrete intravenous contrast. Advantages of these procedures are avoidance of intravenous contrast and the ability to perform therapeutic procedures.

         Kidney ultrasonography is the initial test of choice to exclude urinary tract obstruction, thereby avoiding the potential allergic and toxic complications of radiocontrast media. Although less sensitive than computed tomography (CT) for initially detecting a kidney mass, ultrasonography can also be useful in differentiating a simple benign cyst from a more complex cyst or a solid tumor and in detecting complications of pyelonephritis in a patient who has an incomplete response to antimicrobial therapy. In addition, ultrasonography can identify cortical thinning and decreased kidney size, indicative of irreversible kidney disease. (See

         Doppler kidney ultrasonography can be used to evaluate renal vascular flow in multiple disorders, including renal vein thrombosis, kidney infarction, and renal artery stenosis, but lacks sensitivity and requires a high level of expertise. (See

         Noncontrast, low-dose CT scanning is the gold standard for the radiologic diagnosis of kidney stone disease, including the detection of stones not visualized on plain films or sonography. In addition, CT is also used to confirm and localize ureteral obstruction and to evaluate and stage kidney tumors. CT angiography is the best method to diagnose renovascular disorders such as renal artery stenosis and renal vein thrombosis. (See

         Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the kidneys is performed in a variety of clinical settings, including suspected renovascular hypertension, renal vein thrombosis, and in the evaluation of kidney masses, including suspected or confirmed kidney malignancy. While administration of gadolinium during MRI has been linked to nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) among patients with reduced kidney function, this does not appear to be an issue with newer gadolinium compounds.
