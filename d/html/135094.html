         Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) occurs when pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) remains abnormally elevated after birth, resulting in right-to-left shunting of blood through fetal circulatory pathways. This in turn leads to severe hypoxemia that may not respond to conventional respiratory support.
        </p>
        <p>
         The management and prognosis of PPHN are discussed here. The pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis are discussed separately. (See

         Patients should be cared for in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) with staff experienced in the care of patients with PPHN. Patients with severe/refractory hypoxemia should be managed in centers where multiple modes of respiratory support, rescue therapies, and use of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) are available; extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) should be available at the center or there should be an established arrangement for timely transfer to an ECMO center [

         The following sections detail our suggested approach to managing neonates with PPHN. Initial measures include general supportive cardiorespiratory care for all neonates with PPHN. For neonates who fail to respond to supportive measures, pulmonary vasodilator therapy (typically with inhaled nitric oxide [iNO]) is used to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Patients with severe hypoxemia and/or ventricular dysfunction that is refractory to medical management may require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to maintain adequate tissue oxygenation until PVR falls. Additional details regarding these interventions are provided below. (See
         <a class="local">

         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         PPHN can be caused by a variety of different primary disorders (eg, meconium aspiration syndrome [MAS], respiratory distress syndrome [RDS], congenital diaphragmatic hernia [CDH], sepsis/pneumonia) or it may be idiopathic and may develop in a newborn with little to no parenchymal lung disease. The course and response to therapy vary substantially from one patient to another. Thus, individualized management and frequent reassessment are critical.

         Most neonates with PPHN in the setting of severe lung disease require intubation and mechanical ventilation. We begin with conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) using a patient-triggered volume-targeted mode. We start with tidal volumes (Tv) of 4 to 6 mL/kg and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 to 7 cm H
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         O, depending on the appearance of the chest radiograph (eg, if lung volumes are low on chest radiograph, we would start at the higher end of this range). In general, we use a high PEEP strategy to recruit atelectatic segments, maintain resting lung volume, and ensure adequate oxygenation. If gas exchange targets are not met with low Tv ventilation, the Tv setting can be liberalized. However, if the neonate requires Tv &gt;7 to 8 mL/kg to maintain gas exchange targets, we suggest transitioning to high frequency ventilation (HFV). (See

         A key to optimizing CMV in neonates with PPHN is providing adequate sedation and, if needed, neuromuscular blockade. This is because agitation and dyssynchrony with the ventilator can increase PVR and worsen hypoxemia. Opioid analgesia with or without a benzodiazepine provides sufficient sedation in most cases; neuromuscular blockade is occasionally necessary. (See

         In conjunction with providing respiratory support, most neonates with PPHN require hemodynamic support, which may include vasopressors and/or inotropic support.

         For patients requiring FiO2 &gt;0.6 to achieve the target oxygenation saturation, other interventions should be implemented. These may include optimizing respiratory support (eg, increasing PEEP or transitioning to HFV) and optimizing hemodynamic support. In addition, factors contributing to hypoxemia and right-to-left shunting (eg, metabolic acidosis, inadequate sedation, pneumothorax) should be identified and addressed. (See

         We initially manage neonates in this category with 100 percent oxygen administered noninvasively (eg, low flow nasal cannula, high flow nasal canula [HFNC], or continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]). This may be sufficient for some neonates. (See

         For neonates who have persistent shunting and hypoxemia but who are ventilating adequately, iNO can be administered noninvasively (typically via HFNC or CPAP). (See

         Neonates who fail noninvasive iNO require intubation and mechanical ventilation. In these neonates, we start with modest levels of PEEP (5 cm H

          2
         </sub>
         O) and minimize mean airway pressure (MAP) by using low inspiratory pressures and short inspiratory times or volume targeted ventilation. This is because high PEEP levels are often ineffective in improving oxygenation in this setting and may in fact worsen the patient's clinical status by impeding cardiac output. (See

         Serial blood gases – Arterial blood gases (ABGs) are obtained to measure the PaO2 and calculate the OI at least every four to six hours initially; they are subsequently spaced out once the neonate's clinical status stabilizes. Most neonates with PPHN undergo arterial line placement, either with a UAC or radial artery catheter. This facilitates both ABG sampling and continuous BP monitoring. ABGs drawn from a right radial catheter provide measurements of preductal oxygenation, whereas ABGs drawn from left radial catheters and UACs measure postductal oxygenation. If a post-ductal arterial line is used, preductal oxygenation is monitored with pulse oximetry. (See

Serial echocardiograms should assess ventricular function, estimate right ventricular pressure, and assess the degree of right-to-left shunting.

         Oxygen is a pulmonary vasodilator and it should be initially administered at a concentration of 100 percent to infants with PPHN in an attempt to reverse pulmonary vasoconstriction. However, there is no advantage to maintaining an elevated PaO
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         . Moreover, the administration of high oxygen concentrations, even for a short time period, may cause lung injury. Thus, the oxygen concentration should be adjusted to maintain the target oxygen saturation (ie, preductal oxygen saturation 90 to 95 percent) (see
         <a class="local">
          'Gas exchange targets'
         </a>
         above). Although uncommon in PPHN, persistent hyperoxemia should be avoided.
        </p>
        <p>
         The initial mode of oxygen administration (low flow nasal cannula, high flow nasal canula [HFNC], or continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]) depends on the infant's underlying pulmonary condition and degree of respiratory distress. Most infants with moderate to severe PPHN require intubation and mechanical ventilation.

         When PPHN is associated with lung disease, atelectasis and the resulting maldistribution of ventilation may exacerbate high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Mechanical ventilation uses an open lung strategy, providing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to recruit atelectatic segments, maintain adequate resting lung volume, and ensure appropriate oxygenation and ventilation. We typically use a patient-triggered volume-targeted mode. Additional details regarding different modes of mechanical ventilation in neonates are provided in a separate topic review. (See

         In infants without associated lung disease, hypoxemia is caused by right-to-left shunting rather than ventilation-perfusion imbalance. As a result, hypoxemia may not respond to conventional ventilator maneuvers. In this circumstance, strategies that elevate mean airway pressure (MAP) may actually impede cardiac output and increase PVR. Thus, we minimize MAP by using low inspiratory pressures and short inspiratory times or volume targeted ventilation. However, it is essential to maintain adequate lung recruitment with modest levels of PEEP.

         Patients with PPHN often require high ventilator settings. We typically transition to HFV when peak pressures on conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) reach 28 to 30 cm H
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         O, or if the neonate develops significant air leak. It is reasonable to transition to HFV sooner, particularly if the neonate is persistently requiring high FiO2. Ideally, the transition to HFV should take place before the neonate becomes clinically unstable. The theoretical rationale for HFV in this setting is that it may be "lung-protective" relative to CMV, particularly when high CMV settings are required to achieve adequate gas exchange (ie, HFV may limit lung-injury from the tissue stretch that can occur with cyclic peak inflations in CMV).
        </p>
        <p>
         The use of HFV in this setting is supported by a clinical trial involving 205 infants with severe PPHN, of whom 60 percent were refractory to initial therapy with either iNO with CMV or HFV alone (without iNO) [
         <a href="#rid10">

          Sedation

         – Sedation is appropriate for infants with PPHN who have significant agitation and/or ventilator dyssynchrony despite efforts to optimize ventilator settings (eg, using a patient-triggered mode). This is because pain and agitation cause catecholamine release, resulting in increased PVR and increased right-to-left shunting. In addition, agitation may result in ventilator asynchrony which can worsen hypoxemia.

         iNO is a potent pulmonary vasodilator that decreases pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary-to-systemic arterial pressure ratio [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12

         ]. Oxygenation improves as vessels are dilated in well-ventilated parts of the lung, thereby redistributing blood flow from regions with decreased ventilation and reducing intrapulmonary shunting. In the circulation, NO combines with hemoglobin and is rapidly converted to methemoglobin and nitrate. As a result, there is little effect on systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and systemic blood pressure.

          Weaning

         – We begin weaning iNO once the infant’s FiO2 is ≤0.6. The iNO concentration is decreased slowly as oxygenation improves [

         Surfactant should be administered early in the disease course if the neonate has an associated condition for which surfactant has established efficacy (eg, respiratory distress syndrome [RDS], meconium aspiration syndrome [MAS]). (See

        </p>
        <p>
         For neonates with severe PPHN without RDS or MAS, it is unclear whether surfactant is beneficial. Our practice is to administer surfactant in patients with severe PPHN associated with significant parenchymal lung disease, even if the etiology is not clearly RDS or MAS. For patients with idiopathic primary PPHN without associated lung disease, surfactant therapy does not appear to be beneficial [

        </p>
        <p>
         The evidence regarding surfactant use in infants with PPHN is inconclusive. In a placebo-controlled trial of 328 neonates with severe hypoxic respiratory failure (OI&gt;20), surfactant reduced the need for ECMO (29 versus 40 percent; absolute risk reduction [ARR] 11 percent) [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. The absolute benefit was greatest among patients with MAS (n=168) or sepsis (n=99) as the underlying diagnosis (ARR 15 and 10 percent, respectively); whereas patients with isolated primary PPHN (n=61) had only modest benefit (ARR 2 percent). Similar findings were noted in a subsequent placebo-controlled trial involving 100 neonates with OI ≥20, in which surfactant reduced the composite outcome of death or need for ECMO (16 versus 36 percent; ARR 20 percent) [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. As in the earlier trial, approximately half of patients in this trial had MAS as the underlying diagnosis. Thus, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from these trials as to whether surfactant is beneficial for infants without MAS. Other important limitations of these trial data include small sample size and limited follow-up. In addition, one trial was performed in a resource-limited setting, so the findings may not be generalizable to other settings [

          Dopamine

         is the most commonly used agent in neonates requiring hemodynamic support. Dopamine is often chosen because there is extensive experience with this agent in neonates and most neonatal providers are familiar with its use. Some experts have raised concerns that dopamine may not be an optimal vasoactive agent for PPHN since it nonselectively increases afterload (ie, it increases PVR just as much as it increases SVR) and this may counteract any beneficial inotropic effect [
         <a href="#rid41">

This target is higher than the target used in other neonatal populations (eg, preterm neonates). The rationale for maintaining a higher Hgb level in neonates with PPHN is based upon the following:

        </p>
        <p>
         In a report based on a state-wide dataset of records from 2005 to 2012, the discharge mortality during birth hospitalization was 6.5 percent and one-year postdischarge mortality was 0.7 percent [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. There was a 28.6 percent readmission rate to the hospital within the first year of life for survivors with PPHN compared with 9.8 percent of infants without PPHN. Approximately one-third of readmissions were due to respiratory disease. Adjusted analysis (gestational age, sex, birth weight, and ethnicity) showed survivors compared with controls without PPHN were more likely to have died postdischarge or be readmitted to the hospital within the first year of life (adjusted relative risk [aRR] 3.5, 95% 3.3-3.7). In a subgroup analysis, infants with mild PPHN (no evidence of positive pressure ventilation) were also more likely than those without PPHN to have died or be readmitted within the first year of life (aRR 2.2, 95% CI 2.0-2.5). Of note, infants with congenital pulmonary anomalies (eg, diaphragmatic hernia) who have a higher risk of mortality and morbidity were included in this analysis. As a result, the risk of mortality and readmission may be lower in term infants without congenital pulmonary anomalies. Nevertheless, these data underscore the need for close follow-up for all survivors, even those with mild disease, and ongoing research efforts to identify measures that will prevent PPHN.

         Survivors of severe PPHN and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment are at increased risk of developmental delay, motor disability, hearing deficits, and chronic health problems compared with individuals without PPHN [

          Definition and severity
         </strong>
         – Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) occurs when pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) remains abnormally elevated after birth, resulting in right-to-left shunting of blood through fetal circulatory pathways. This in turn leads to severe hypoxemia that may not respond to conventional respiratory support. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction'

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The severity of hypoxemia in PPHN is determined by calculating the oxygenation index (OI) (

          Management approach
         </strong>
         – Patients with PPHN should be cared for in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) with experienced staff and where multiple modes of respiratory support, rescue therapies, and inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) are available. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) should be available at the center or there should be an established transfer arrangement to an ECMO center. (See

         <strong>
          Mechanical ventilation
         </strong>
         – Most neonates with severe lung disease require intubation and mechanical ventilation. We begin with conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) using a patient-triggered volume-targeted mode. Ventilator settings are adjusted to maintain preductal oxygen saturation of 90 to 95 percent and normal ventilation initially. Once the neonate’s respiratory status is more stable, we allow mild hypercapnia. (See

          PPHN without severe lung disease
         </strong>
         – In neonates with idiopathic PPHN (ie, without underlying parenchymal lung disease), hypoxemia is predominantly caused by severe right-to-left shunting. Our suggested approach for such patients is as follows (see
         <a class="local">
          'PPHN without severe lung disease'

         Management begins with 100 percent oxygen administered noninvasively (eg, low flow nasal cannula, high flow nasal canula [HFNC], or continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]). This may be sufficient for some neonates. (See
         <a class="local">

          Monitoring

         – Infants with severe PPHN who remain severely hypoxemic (OI ≥40) on maximal ventilatory support despite administration of iNO are candidates for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). (See

          Follow-up
