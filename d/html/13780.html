         Panniculitis (inflammation of the subcutaneous fat) is a relatively uncommon condition that usually presents with inflammatory nodules or plaques. A wide variety of subtypes of panniculitis exist, including panniculitides related to infection, external insults, malignancy, and inflammatory diseases  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef85714" href="/z/d/graphic/85714.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis of panniculitis can be challenging because different forms of panniculitis may present with similar clinical findings, and many types of panniculitis are rare. A careful clinical assessment that includes an evaluation of patient risk factors, lesion distribution, and associated clinical findings (eg, ulceration, sclerosis, atrophy) can provide valuable clues for diagnosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although histopathologic examination of the affected area can be of benefit, interpretation of the biopsy findings must be approached with discretion. In the absence of careful clinical correlation and thorough consideration of the clinical and pathologic differential diagnoses, an incorrect diagnosis may be selected.
        </p>
        <p>
         The approach to the recognition and diagnosis of panniculitis will be discussed here. The clinical features and management of specific forms of panniculitis are reviewed in greater detail separately.

         </span>
         The term "panniculitis" refers to a group of inflammatory disorders in which the primary site of inflammation is in the subcutaneous fat. In contrast, inflammatory disorders that mainly involve the overlying dermis or underlying fascia and incidentally extend into the nearby subcutaneous fat are not considered types of panniculitis.
        </p>
        <p>
         The nomenclature of the panniculitides has been inconsistent and a potential source of confusion. For example, "stasis panniculitis," "lipodermatosclerosis," "sclerosing panniculitis," "hypodermitis sclerodermiformis," and "chronic panniculitis with lipomembranous changes" are synonymous terms [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In other cases, one name has been given to multiple different conditions. Weber-Christian disease, which was once thought to be a distinct entity, appears to have been an overly inclusive term applied to multiple disorders, including alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency panniculitis, pancreatic panniculitis, factitial panniculitis, lymphoma panniculitis, and others [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. With improved ability to identify these conditions, the term "Weber-Christian disease" has largely been abandoned by dermatologists in favor of the more specific diagnoses.

         Suspicion for panniculitis typically first arises from the physical examination. Although the visible findings may be limited to a nonspecific area of erythema, palpation of an affected area reveals the deep-seated nodules and plaques characteristic of an inflammatory process located beneath the dermis. Depending on the type of panniculitis, additional features such as ulceration, atrophy, or sclerosis may also be detected. Associated tenderness is common but is not always present.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, deep inflammatory nodules and plaques are not exclusive to panniculitis, and based upon the clinical scenario, disorders involving the deep dermis or fascia may need to be considered. For example, plaque morphea involving the deep dermis and eosinophilic fasciitis may be difficult to distinguish from deep morphea, which may present with true panniculitis  (

         ). (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, benign and malignant tumors can manifest as subcutaneous nodules. If incidental inflammation is also present, it may be difficult to distinguish these tumors clinically from panniculitides. Nodules associated with deep bruising may also be mistaken for panniculitis.

         Once panniculitis is suspected, the clinical and/or histopathologic evaluation will help to confirm the presence of panniculitis and to identify the subtype of panniculitis, thereby allowing for proper patient management. Most panniculitides can be placed in one of several etiologic categories. These categories are listed below:

         Definitive information about the relative frequency of panniculitides is not available, but there is general agreement that erythema nodosum is the most common form of panniculitis. Stasis panniculitis is likely an underappreciated, but relatively common, phenomenon. Other panniculitides that, while not common, are seen on occasion in a general dermatology practice include traumatic panniculitis, lupus panniculitis, erythema induratum, cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa, subcutaneous granuloma annulare, subcutaneous sarcoidosis, and factitial panniculitis. Selected examples of panniculitides in each etiologic category are described below; a more extensive list is provided in a table  (

         Infectious panniculitis usually presents as a primarily lobular panniculitis that may be caused by bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, protozoal, or viral infections [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. It may occur as a result of hematogenous dissemination of microorganisms, direct extension from a nearby focus of infection, or direct inoculation. The appearance of the lesions is dependent on the underlying cause and the severity of infection, ranging from indolent nodules to acute fluctuant abscesses. Immunosuppressed individuals are at increased risk for infectious panniculitis. Microbial cultures and histopathologic stains are useful for diagnosis.

         Factitial panniculitis is a form of panniculitis that results from the injection of foreign substances into the subcutaneous fat [

          16
         </a>
         ]. Factitial panniculitis should be considered when lesions are in atypical locations or have unusual shapes. Although some cases result from the injection of medical therapies, other cases result from the inappropriate injection of substances for cosmetic purposes (eg, paraffin) or the injection of harmful substances (eg, urine, feces, foods, or chemicals) by patients with emotional disturbances or psychiatric disorders. It is common for patients who deliberately inject harmful substances to deny self-injection.

         Because inflammatory nodules and plaques occur in various forms of panniculitis as well as other types of disorders, diagnosing a specific form of panniculitis based only on examination of the affected area is usually difficult. The patient history and an assessment of additional clinical findings, such as ulceration, atrophy, sclerosis, and livedo racemosa, can be useful for diagnosis:

         Biopsies can provide valuable information for diagnosis and are indicated in cases in which the diagnosis is uncertain or to confirm the diagnosis in cases in which the clinical course of a panniculitis does not proceed as expected. Biopsies are most useful when findings characteristic of a specific form of panniculitis are identified. However, the histopathologic findings are often ambiguous. In many cases, clinical correlation and careful consideration of the differential diagnosis is required to arrive at a correct diagnosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although biopsies are usually well tolerated, potential consequences include scarring, infection, and poor wound healing. Therefore, in situations in which the clinical evaluation yields a relatively certain diagnosis, the decision to perform a confirmatory biopsy is individualized. As an example, the benefit gained from the histologic confirmation of the diagnosis of erythema nodosum is not necessarily worth the resulting scar from deep excisional biopsy in a typical, short-lived case. Similarly, the benefit gained from histologic confirmation of lipodermatosclerosis may or may not be worth the risk of having a chronic wound on the lower leg. However, in other situations, a biopsy is critical for proper patient evaluation and management. For example, the attainment of a tissue specimen for histopathologic examination and microbial studies is essential when infectious panniculitis is suspected.

         In order to achieve the highest diagnostic yield, the biopsy specimen must include a generous sample of the subcutaneous fat. This is best accomplished by an elliptical excision performed with a scalpel. Alternatively, a large (6 to 8 mm) punch biopsy may be performed. Elliptical excisions often result in more cosmetically satisfactory scars. (See

         Subcutaneous fat has a fairly simple structure, consisting mainly of fat cells that are organized in lobules divided by fibrous septa, together with vessels and nerves. The panniculitides are often classified based on the histologic findings, particularly the location of the pathologic process (septal versus lobular) and the presence or absence of vasculitis  (

         Although evaluation of the pathology in the context of the clinical findings often establishes the diagnosis, there are limitations to consider during the interpretation of the biopsy findings. These include the following:

         <span class="glyph">

         The relative lack of complexity of subcutaneous tissue means that there is a relatively small number of ways the subcutaneous fat can appear histologically. Even with an optimal sample, it may not be possible to narrow the histologic differential diagnosis to one entity.
        </p>

         Inflammatory infiltrates are not absolutely confined to septa in septal panniculitis and are not limited to lobules in lobular panniculitis. The fundamental distinction between a septal and a lobular panniculitis is based on the predominant location of the infiltrate. In practice, this can be a difficult distinction to make, particularly if the sample size is small.

         The biopsy may not include a sufficient amount of subcutaneous fat. This is particularly likely with small punch biopsies but can also occur with excisions if the practitioner is not careful to include an adequate sample of subcutaneous fat.

         An inadequate biopsy or insufficient sampling of an adequate biopsy may affect the ability to detect the presence of vasculitis. For example, a biopsy that may initially appear to be erythema nodosum may be revealed to be polyarteritis nodosa when additional sections are examined.

         In some cases, obtaining a diagnosis may require investigation beyond the clinical evaluation and routine histopathologic examination. When infection is in the clinical differential diagnosis, tissue cultures and histologic stains for organisms are usually indicated. If malignancy is suspected, special studies to determine cell type may be required. In cases of panniculitis where the diagnosis is not straightforward, the tissue sample should be polarized to look for foreign material.

         The term "panniculitis" is used to refer to inflammatory disorders in which the primary site of involvement is the subcutaneous fat. Many types of panniculitis have been described, including immune-mediated, infectious, trauma-induced, malignant, and other types of panniculitides  (

         Suspicion for panniculitis typically arises upon the detection of the clinical findings of one or more deep-seated inflammatory nodules or plaques. Depending on the type of panniculitis, additional features such as ulceration, atrophy, or sclerosis may be present. (See
         <a class="local">

         Certain types of panniculitis are more likely to occur in children than adults. Examples include subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn and sclerema neonatorum, which typically occur in the neonatal period. Cold panniculitis and poststeroid panniculitis are also most likely to occur in children. (See

         Biopsies are indicated when the diagnosis is uncertain, when the attainment of a tissue specimen may yield information useful for patient management, or when the clinical course does not proceed as expected. An elliptical excision is the preferred procedure for biopsy. A large punch biopsy (6 to 8 mm) may be performed as an alternative. (See

         Certain features aid in the evaluation of a biopsy specimen. The status of panniculitis as lobular versus septal, the presence or absence of vasculitis, the nature of the inflammatory infiltrate, and the visualization of distinctive features assist with diagnosis  (

         The limitations of histology in diagnosis must always be considered. Careful clinical correlation with biopsy findings is essential. If there is discordance between the clinical and histologic findings, or if disease fails to respond as expected to therapy, the diagnosis should be reassessed. (See
