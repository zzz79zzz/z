         Achondroplasia is the most common bone dysplasia in humans, with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 20,000 live births. It is an autosomal dominant condition caused by pathogenic variants in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (
         <em>
          FGFR3
         </em>
         ) gene. The most salient clinical features include disproportionate short stature (adult height is approximately 4 feet), long-bone shortening that predominantly affects the proximal aspects of the upper and lower extremities (rhizomelic shortening), and macrocephaly. Patients with achondroplasia may have delayed motor development early on, but cognition is normal. There are a number of medical comorbidities associated with this disorder.
        </p>
        <p>
         The clinical findings, diagnosis, treatment options, and anticipatory guidance are discussed in this topic review. An overview of the diagnostic approach to skeletal dysplasias is presented in detail separately. (See

         Achondroplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Approximately 80 percent of cases are the result of new (de novo) pathogenic variants, while the remaining are inherited. When both parents have achondroplasia, the risk to their children of having homozygous achondroplasia (a lethal skeletal condition) is 25 percent and 50 percent of having achondroplasia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with achondroplasia have gain-of-function variant in the
         <em>
          FGFR3
         </em>
         gene [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Two specific pathogenic variants in the
         <em>
          FGFR3
         </em>
         gene account for almost all cases of achondroplasia. These variants occur at the same nucleotide in the
         <em>
          FGFR3
         </em>
         gene, 1138G&gt;A (98 percent) and 1138G&gt;C (1 percent), in both cases resulting in a glycine-to-arginine substitution in amino acid 380 (p.Gly380Arg) in the transmembrane domain of the
         <em>
          FGFR3
         </em>
         gene. This variant permanently activates the FGFR3 receptor, inhibiting chondrocyte proliferation, which ultimately leads to impaired endochondral bone formation, growth restriction, bone shortening, and other skeletal anomalies [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Achondroplasia most often results from spontaneous or new pathogenic variants (de novo variants). A well-known risk factor for achondroplasia and other autosomal dominant conditions is advanced paternal age. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication defects in spermatogenesis is increased in males older than 45 years secondary to an increase in point mutations in the sperm [

         Achondroplasia is a panethnic disorder with an average prevalence of approximately 1 in 20,000. Population studies in South America, Europe, and the United States showed a prevalence that ranges from approximately 1:7000 to 30,000 [

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Achondroplasia is characterized by distinctive craniofacial features, disproportionate short stature with rhizomelic shortening of the arms and the legs  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108746" href="/z/d/graphic/108746.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ), brachydactyly (shortening of the fingers and toes)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108747" href="/z/d/graphic/108747.html" rel="external">
          picture 2
         </a>
         ), kyphoscoliosis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51638" href="/z/d/graphic/51638.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ), and accentuated lumbar lordosis. The craniofacial features and bone shortening are clearly present at birth. The craniofacial features include macrocephaly, frontal bossing, and midface retrusion. The nose is flattened out, often referred to as saddle nose deformity. The kyphoscoliosis can be seen from birth through infancy. The lumbar lordosis is typically seen after ambulation starts at approximately 1.5 years of age. Narrowing/stenosis of the craniocervical junction and the spine is variable in pediatric patients but has been reported in up to 50 percent of cases [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. Only a small number of those may require surgical correction.
        </p>
        <p>
         The chest is often narrow. The back displays kyphosis of the thoracolumbar junction, which is prominent during the first year of life and mostly resolves as the spine straightens, the muscle tone improves, and ambulation starts. Exaggerated lumbar lordosis is a common finding that becomes prominent after walking begins  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108746" href="/z/d/graphic/108746.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). The lumbar spine may become stenotic at a later age, typically not until after the second and third decades, with a prevalence as high as 80 percent is some reported studies [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The extremities have shortening that is more pronounced in the proximal/rhizomelic segments  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108746" href="/z/d/graphic/108746.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). Because of this, children with achondroplasia often have redundant skin folds that are most noticeable in their upper extremities. The elbows may have limitations, primarily affecting extension and oftentimes limiting complete supination. The hands show short fingers with a trident appearance of the hands secondary to short metacarpal bones  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108747" href="/z/d/graphic/108747.html" rel="external">
          picture 2
         </a>
         ). Joint laxity is common. The knees often have varus deformities, initially due to joint laxity and later on secondary to tibial bowing and fibular overgrowth.
        </p>
        <p>
         Achondroplasia is associated with slow motor development  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108610" href="/z/d/graphic/108610.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). These children hold their head at approximately 4 to 7 months of age, sit alone at 9 to 11 months, crawl at 9 to 10 months, and walk alone by 16 to 22 months. The delay in these motor milestones is the result of a combination of joint laxity and a large head to support [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. These delays resolve by age two to three years provided no other medical problems exist, such as cervical medullary compression. Persons with achondroplasia have normal intellectual development and satisfactory life adjustments [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13

        <p>
         Prenatally, achondroplasia is suspected when shorter long bones and macrocephaly are present. Fetuses affected with achondroplasia born to average-stature females may sometimes require cesarean delivery due to cephalopelvic disproportion. Affected females with achondroplasia require a cesarean delivery when pregnant due to pelvic abnormalities [

        </p>
        <p>
         Postnatally, a radiographic skeletal survey is strongly advised if achondroplasia is suspected based upon clinical manifestations, including distinct craniofacial features and bone shortening. The most useful radiographs are the anteroposterior (AP) view of the thorax and pelvis to look for the lack of widening of the interpedicular distances of the vertebral bodies, iliac abnormalities, and shortening of the long bones with metaphyseal abnormalities and hand films to look for shortening, brachydactyly, and trident deformity. Radiographs are characteristic in achondroplasia and valuable in cases where molecular diagnosis is not obtained.
        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis is confirmed by molecular testing. Most laboratories offer targeted testing for the classical 1138 variant in the
         <em>
          FGFR3
         </em>
         gene. Broader sequencing of the
         <em>
          FGFR3
         </em>
         gene, including multiple exons or the full gene, is suggested if the clinical diagnosis is in doubt and other conditions such as hypochondroplasia are suspected. Parents should consult with a geneticist during the initial evaluation to discuss diagnosis, recurrence risk, and prenatal testing, when applicable. (See

The leg bowing in later childhood, typically after five to six years of age, can be the result of tibial bowing and fibular overgrowth. The bowing can interfere with ambulation, causing stress in the joints and subsequent pain in the knees and ankles and, in some cases, tripping and frequent falling. (See

          Cervicomedullary compression
         </strong>
         – One area of controversy in achondroplasia is the prevalence and management of cervicomedullary compression due to narrowing of the foramen magnum [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23,24
         </a>
         ]. It is estimated that 5 to 10 percent of patients with achondroplasia develop true cervical medullary stenosis even though some degree of narrowing occurs in many more. Cervicomedullary compression is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, including an increased risk of sudden infant death [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. The maximum anatomical narrowing occurs at approximately 12 months of age. Thus, all infants should have computed tomography (CT) or MRI of the cervical medullary junction for surveillance around that time.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Signs of narrowing of the cervical medullary junction should be closely followed, but rushing to surgical intervention should be avoided in the absence of other clinical findings. Warning signs for compression include motor delay that is more severe, persists in time, or is associated with an abnormal neurologic exam. Other concerning findings include clonus, hyperreflexia of the lower limbs, central apnea/hypopnea, and a rapidly growing head circumference. A thorough evaluation should be performed to rule out cervicomedullary compression, and urgent referral to a neurosurgeon should be initiated if any of these findings are present. It is best if these evaluations and surgical decisions involve a multidisciplinary team including geneticists, orthopedists, neurologists, and neurosurgeons.

         This evaluation includes a complete neurologic assessment, CT scan of the head with foramen magnum measurements, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow studies of the cervical spine done with MRI with flexion-extension images and sleep studies to assess sleep apnea.

         MRI studies with T2-weighed images in conjunction with flow studies can be valuable in assessing cord compression. Lack of CSF flow signal anteriorly and posteriorly suggests compression (spinal effacement) [

         – The limb shortening can interfere with daily self-care tasks such as reaching out, feeding, bathing, dressing, and independent toileting and self-care. Thus, adaptive arrangements are very important. An example is adapting furniture used in the home and school environment, such as using lower chairs and desks or using stools to reach the toilet seat or sink. In addition, hand extenders can be used for reaching objects or self-cleaning. Occupational therapy is an option in individuals with achondroplasia to achieve their best functional potential, unless there are concerns for spinal compression.

         – Limb-lengthening surgeries have been used in the past and are resurging due to emerging surgical techniques. However, these therapies have a high financial and social cost. In the past, these surgeries were performed by surgical distractions of the long bones (humeri, femurs) followed by the use of external fixators (Ilizarov procedure) [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31

         ]. The best results with this technique were seen if it was performed after the completion of growth. This technique is being replaced by the use of rodding technologies that use limb distraction followed by implantation of intramedullary magnetic nails. The rods can then be stretched by the aid of powerful external magnets. The rods are used in place of external fixators that often led to infection, scarring, and other complications [
         <a href="#rid32">

          Otitis media
         </strong>
         – An aggressive approach to preventing and treating otitis media in infancy and childhood is required to avert problems related to speech development. In some instances, otolaryngology evaluation and placement of tympanostomy (pressure equalization [PE]) tubes are necessary in those children with recurrent otitis media.

Patients with cervical medullary compression should avoid contact sports, trampoline use, diving, and gymnastic exercises or other athletic activities that could aggravate the compression. Some providers recommend avoidance of the previously mentioned sports and physical activities in all children with achondroplasia. Those requiring decompression surgery typically undergo a suboccipital craniectomy, as well as posterior C1 and C2 laminectomies.

Narrowing of the cervical medullary junction in infants should be closely followed, but rushing to surgical intervention should be avoided in the absence of other clinical findings. (See
