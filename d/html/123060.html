         The basic requirements of an optimal insulin regimen include administration of a basal insulin plus mealtime boluses of a rapid-acting, faster rapid-acting, or short-acting insulin. Basal insulin can be delivered by daily or twice-daily injections of an intermediate-acting (neutral protamine Hagedorn [NPH]) or long-acting (glargine, detemir, degludec) insulin preparation or by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) via a pump using a rapid-acting or faster rapid-acting insulin preparation (lispro, aspart, glulisine). Providing physiologic insulin replacement requires adjustment of doses to match requirements and relies on glucose monitoring and lifestyle modifications.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will review CSII (insulin pump) therapy. Physiologic insulin replacement, choice of insulin delivery (multiple daily injection [MDI] insulin regimens versus CSII), and designing an MDI regimen are reviewed separately.

          Continuous insulin infusion
         </strong>
         – Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII; insulin pump therapy) provides subcutaneous infusion of insulin, usually a rapid-acting or faster rapid-acting insulin analog. Basal insulin requirements are supplied in the form of mini-boluses delivered every five minutes. This "continuous" infusion generally constitutes 40 to 50 percent of the total daily insulin dose. In addition to basal insulin delivery, mealtime insulin bolus doses are given to minimize postprandial glucose excursions. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Dosing'

          Rapid-acting insulin analogs
         </strong>
         – We suggest rapid-acting insulin analogs (most commonly lispro and aspart) rather than

          regular insulin
         </a>
         for CSII. In a meta-analysis of trials comparing rapid-acting insulin analogs with regular insulin for use in CSII, there was a small but significant reduction in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) with use of insulin analogs (mean difference -0.26 percent, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.06 percent) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. It was difficult to analyze hypoglycemia as it was defined differently in the various trials, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was not available. The convenience of being able to administer a rapid-acting insulin immediately before the meal (compared with needing to administer preprandial boluses of regular insulin 30 to 45 minutes before meals), as well as the ability to more quickly correct hyperglycemia, also favor rapid-acting formulations.

          Insulin pump components
         </strong>
         – A variety of insulin pumps are available, and the choice among pumps is largely a matter of individual preference, cost, lifestyle, and compatibility with CGM devices. (See

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In a traditional pump, insulin is infused from a reservoir/cartridge within the pump through tubing to a cannula or needle that is inserted subcutaneously  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef129862" href="/z/d/graphic/129862.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The infusion set and site of infusion are changed by the person with diabetes (or their caregiver) every two to three days. The tubing, which connects the infusion set to the insulin cartridge/reservoir in the pump, can be connected to and disconnected from the infusion site without removing the cannula. Some traditional insulin pumps can be used with a CGM device as part of a hybrid closed-loop system. (See

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For the patch pump, the insulin reservoir, batteries, and cannula are in a wearable disposable device ("pod"), which delivers insulin subcutaneously  (

         ). The pod is changed every two to three days. Insulin delivery from the pod is controlled wirelessly by a handheld "controller," compatible smartphone, or personal diabetes manager (PDM). (See

          Glucose monitoring
         </strong>
         – For most adults with type 1 diabetes, frequent testing of glucose levels is necessary to achieve A1C targets safely without frequent or severe hypoglycemia. Self-monitoring allows the user to adjust the doses and timing of insulin administration based on both immediate glucose data and the user's behaviors (eg, exercise and food intake). Many people with type 1 diabetes use a combination of blood glucose monitoring (BGM) by fingerstick with a glucose meter and, when available, CGM. Some insulin pumps can receive and display glucose data from CGM devices, and others use such data to automatically adjust basal rate delivery to address both low and high glucose levels. (See

         When converting a person with type 1 diabetes from a multiple daily injection (MDI) insulin regimen to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), the pre-pump level of chronic glycemia will help determine the initial pump basal rate and preprandial dosing. As an example, for a person who has met glycemic goals on the previous MDI regimen (eg, A1C &lt;7 percent), the initial total daily dose (TDD) of insulin administered by pump may be 10 to 20 percent less than the TDD (both short-acting and long-acting insulin) of the previous regimen. Conversely, individuals who are above glycemic targets (high A1C with no hypoglycemia) may be started with the same TDD (both short-acting and long-acting insulin) as they had been using with their injection regimens.

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         In general, approximately 40 to 50 percent of the TDD is administered as the basal rate (divide by 24 to get units per hour). This proportion can be higher or lower depending on a number of factors, including if the individual consumes a low- or high-carbohydrate diet, respectively. For most adults, basal rates are in the range of 0.01 to 0.015 units per kg per hour (ie, for a 60 kg woman, approximately 0.6 to 0.9 units per hour).
        </p>
        <p>
         The basal rates are adjusted empirically (eg, by approximately 10 percent) based on glucose monitoring results. The basal rate adjustment depends upon a number of factors, including the individual's glycemic goals, degree of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, fears of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, current use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with alarms, age, and presence or absence of comorbidities (eg, more cautious adjustments in older adults with hypoglycemia unawareness or cardiovascular disease).
        </p>
        <p>
         Certain time periods during the day may require higher or lower infusion rates depending on individual factors including lifestyle patterns and the "dawn phenomenon," which results in an increased need for insulin between 2:00 and 8:00 AM. Most pumps allow for preprogrammed changes in basal rate to accommodate these requirements. The "dawn phenomenon" is thought to result from diurnal secretion patterns of hormones, particularly increased growth hormone at midnight to 2:00 AM, that tend to antagonize the actions of insulin in the early morning hours and so raise blood glucose concentrations. The overnight basal rate(s) can be adjusted to maintain the pre-breakfast blood glucose in the target range [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ], although this strategy is not always effective and may confer risk of hypoglycemia [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Temporary basal rates can also be programmed for defined periods of time. For example, a reduced temporary basal rate can be used to avoid hypoglycemia associated with aerobic activities.
        </p>
        <p>
         When changing the subcutaneous basal insulin infusion rate, a delay in the actual increase or decrease in plasma insulin levels must be taken into account, based on the kinetics of absorption and time to reach a new steady state [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Therefore, basal rates of rapid-acting insulin should be changed approximately two hours before the change in plasma level is required.

         </span>
         The pre-meal bolus dose should be based primarily upon the carbohydrate content of the intended meal and the blood glucose level immediately before the meal. If CGM data are available, use of glucose trends (trend arrows) can help the person with diabetes fine-tune dosing [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. High fat and protein meals (eg, steak and potatoes or pizza) can cause a prolonged rise in glucose and need for a higher insulin dose and longer duration of insulin action [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. (See

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Insulin pumps have insulin calculators for bolus dosing for meals and for correction of hyperglycemia. The use of calculated "active insulin" or "insulin on board" helps prevent hypoglycemia that can occur from overcorrecting for hyperglycemia with multiple correction boluses administered close together in time ("stacking"). Insulin pumps also allow for delivery of extended or dual-wave boluses to help manage the prolonged or delayed rise in glucose concentrations that occur after ingesting higher fat and protein meals or in the presence of gastroparesis.
        </p>
        <p>
         The timing of dosing preprandially will depend on the insulin used. The kinetics of

          regular insulin
         </a>
         require administration approximately 30 to 45 minutes before eating so that the insulin peak matches the peak glucose after the meal. Rapid-acting insulin can be administered 10 to 15 minutes prior to eating; rapid-acting and faster rapid-acting insulins can also be given immediately before eating, or even during the meal in specific circumstances (eg, presence of gastroparesis or pre-meal hypoglycemia).

          Causes of apparent pump failure
         </strong>
         – Pump failure may occur due to mechanical failure or detachment, blockage-kinking, or leakage in the infusion set/cannula, syringe, or connectors, causing an interruption of insulin flow [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12-14
         </a>
         ]. The pump may be in suspension mode or may need a battery change. Air in the infusion set may cause reduced insulin delivery in the absence of true pump failure. Use of expired or damaged insulin (exposure to high temperatures or freezing) will also present as pump failure. A poor infusion site can impede insulin delivery; infusion sites may not absorb insulin well due to overuse, scarring, or lipohypertrophy [

          Acute management
         </strong>
         – Since the subcutaneous depot is very small and only rapidly acting insulin is administered, any interruption in continuous flow can lead very quickly to hypoinsulinemia and potentially diabetic ketoacidosis. If there is no glucose response to insulin boluses, the infusion set should be immediately changed and a new insertion site chosen. Failure of insulin delivery despite these actions usually indicates pump failure.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         If pump failure occurs, individuals can replace basal insulin with rapidly acting insulin injections every three to four hours (each dose equivalent to three to four times the hourly basal rate) with careful, frequent blood glucose monitoring (BGM) or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). If the anticipated interruption in pump therapy is more than a few hours, individuals should transition to an intermediate-acting or long-acting basal insulin to replace the basal infusion. Using the total daily basal insulin dose as a guide, a similar dose can be given as one or two injections of glargine or detemir or divided into two injections of NPH daily. In this setting, we do not use basal insulin with a very long duration of action such as

         – If problems with infusion sets recur, the individual's insertion technique should be reviewed. A different type of infusion set (eg, metal needle instead of Teflon catheter) can be considered. All pump users should know how to check for ketones (either blood or urine) and have a back-up plan for both basal and mealtime insulin (ie, insulin vials and syringes or insulin pens) to use in the event of pump failure.

         Adults who are treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) may rarely develop infections at the site of catheter insertion. This is more likely to occur if the infusion set has not been changed for &gt;72 hours, if the site was not properly prepared, or if the infusion set was not properly inserted. If the infusion site is red, swollen, painful, draining purulent material, or has increased warmth, the infusion set should be immediately removed and discarded and a new set placed at another site. The old site should be cleaned and treated with warm soaks; occasionally, oral antibiotic therapy is needed.

         If meeting their glycemic goals, people with type 1 diabetes who are using a nonautomated insulin delivery system (eg, sensor-augmented insulin pump) and are not eating (nil per os [NPO]) in preparation for a procedure may continue with their usual basal infusion rate. Depending on overall glycemia before the procedure, the length of the procedure, and degree of concern about hypoglycemia, the basal rate may be reduced by up to 20 percent for at least two to three hours pre-procedure or once the individual becomes NPO to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia. People using automated insulin delivery (AID) systems who are concerned about hypoglycemia while NPO may instead set a temporary, higher target glucose (or target glucose range) prior to a procedure; the methods for adjusting the target glucose vary across AID systems and can include the use of an "exercise" or "activity" mode.

         A variety of insulin pumps are available, some of which communicate with specific continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices. Others use CGM feedback information to automatically adjust basal rate delivery and mitigate both low and high glucose levels. The choice among pumps is largely a matter of individual preference, cost, and lifestyle.
        </p>
        <p>
         Insulin pumps can be used alone or in conjunction with a CGM device to give the person with diabetes more information about their blood glucose levels and allow them to make better informed decisions about insulin dosing. This approach is known as sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy. When the insulin pump uses an algorithm (based on parameters including CGM results and target glucose) to control basal insulin infusion, the system is termed a partially automated (hybrid) closed-loop system (artificial pancreas or automated insulin delivery [AID]). Some advanced automated (hybrid) closed-loop systems administer automatic insulin correction doses as well. The user must still determine and administer pre-meal bolus insulin (hence the term "hybrid"), with dose selection based on insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios and "correction" factors to address ambient glucose levels at the time of the meal. Use of sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy and the hybrid closed-loop system can reduce time in hypoglycemia.

In contrast to low glucose threshold suspend, in which insulin delivery is suspended when the glucose reading reaches the threshold value (eg, 70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]), predictive low glucose threshold suspend reduces or suspends insulin infusion when the trend in CGM results predicts that hypoglycemia will occur.

         When using these insulin pump/CGM systems in the "auto" or "automatic" mode, instead of infusing basal insulin in mini-boluses every five minutes according to the programmed basal rates ("manual" mode), the system automatically gives a mini-bolus (or no bolus) of rapidly acting insulin every five minutes determined by an algorithm that uses parameters including CGM results and target glucose  (

         With these "hybrid" closed-loop devices, the user still needs to determine and administer pre-meal insulin boluses, which is facilitated with an individualized insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio set in the pump's bolus calculator. Some systems require periodic fingerstick capillary glucose measurements for calibration and to address high or low values, and some have limited choices for the target glucose. Each of the available devices can transmit insulin dosing data (display of basal and bolus insulin delivery), CGM and BGM data, as well as pump and CGM settings to cloud-based systems.

         All individuals with type 1 diabetes may be candidates for AID therapy if adequate infrastructure and resources are available to support its use. The strongest evidence supporting use of AID systems is in individuals with high risk of hypoglycemia or impaired awareness of hypoglycemia and individuals who have not achieved glycemic goals on current therapy [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38-40
         </a>
         ]. AID therapy also may provide greater benefit when initiated closer to the time of type 1 diabetes diagnosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Structured and individualized training and support are essential prior to initiation of AID therapy [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]; rather than reducing demands of care, AID therapy requires that individuals have extensive knowledge of both general diabetes care and device management. After initiating AID therapy, close monitoring and support remain critical, particularly over the first three to six months of use when discontinuation rates are highest [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38

         ]. Improvements have been made in the newer, advanced hybrid closed-loop systems to reduce burden and improve effectiveness, with additional advancements anticipated in future models. Individuals receiving MDI insulin therapy may transition directly to hybrid AID systems without prior insulin pump experience [

         In contrast to partially automated hybrid closed-loop systems, an insulin-only, more fully automated system enables initiation of insulin pump use solely on the basis of user body weight and without input of basal insulin doses or insulin dosing parameters. Once initiated, the system automatically calibrates and adjusts insulin delivery based on glycemia. This system also requires only qualitative descriptions of carbohydrate intake (eg, "usual for me," "more," or "less" for the specific meal type). As carbohydrate counting is not needed for pre-meal insulin dosing, the fully automated system eliminates a major challenge to more widespread use of insulin pump therapy. In the United States, this more automated system has regulatory approval for use in individuals with type 1 diabetes aged ≥6 years [

The delivery of the insulin and glucagon during the closed-loop arm was determined completely automatically by an algorithm that was, in turn, dependent on CGM results. During the closed-loop system part of the trial, patients could electively "announce" meals, allowing a "priming" dose to be administered. Participants continued all normal activities, including exercise and driving. Fingerstick plasma glucoses were checked at least four times daily; however, the closed-loop system was driven entirely by the CGM using commercially available devices.

         The use of do-it-yourself automated insulin delivery (DIY AID) systems or "looping" by individuals with type 1 diabetes to automatically infuse insulin has increased in the United States and globally. The systems use commercially available insulin pumps and CGM devices, smartphones, and experimental applications that control insulin infusion. Additional hardware and communication devices may be needed. Free open-source resources for each of the available DIY looping systems are offered on their websites. None of these systems are US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, all are considered experimental, and all involve a high degree of involvement by the person with diabetes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Limited clinical trial data support the utility of open-source AID systems for selected individuals willing to learn these systems. As an example, in a 24-week trial comparing an open-source DIY AID system with sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy in 97 people with type 1 diabetes (48 children [median age 13 years] and 49 adults [median age 40 years]), the improvement in percentage of time spent in target glucose range was greater in participants using the open-source AID system (adjusted difference 14 percent, 95% CI 9.2-18.8 percent) [

         </a>
         ]. All participants underwent a four-week run-in period before randomization to gain experience with the study devices, and all had at least six months' prior experience using an insulin pump. Since the design of this study did not incorporate a comparison of the open-source non-FDA approved DIY AID system with a currently commercially available FDA-approved AID (hybrid closed-loop) system, it could not compare their safety or effectiveness.

          General principles
         </strong>
         – With continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII; insulin pump therapy), basal insulin is supplied in the form of mini-boluses of insulin delivered every five minutes (usually constituting 40 to 50 percent of the total daily dose [TDD]) with pre-meal bolus doses given to minimize postprandial glucose excursions. We suggest rapid-acting insulin analogs (lispro, aspart, and glulisine) rather than

          TDD
         </strong>
         – For individuals meeting glycemic goals who are transitioning from a multiple daily injection (MDI) insulin regimen to CSII, the initial TDD of insulin administered by pump may be 10 to 20 percent less than the TDD (both short-acting and long-acting insulin) of the previous regimen. Conversely, people who are above glycemic targets (high glycated hemoglobin [A1C] with no hypoglycemia) may be started with the same TDD (both short-acting and long-acting insulin) as they had been using with their injection regimens.

         <strong>
          Basal rate
         </strong>
         – Approximately 40 to 50 percent of the TDD is administered as the basal rate (divide by 24 to get units per hour). This proportion can be higher or lower depending on a number of factors, including if the individual consumes a low- or high-carbohydrate diet, respectively. For most individuals, basal rates are in the range of 0.01 to 0.015 units per kg per hour (ie, for a 60 kg woman approximately 0.6 to 0.9 units per hour). (See

         <strong>
          Bolus dosing
         </strong>
         – The pre-meal bolus dose should be based primarily upon the carbohydrate content of the intended meal and the blood glucose level immediately before the meal. Many insulin pumps have insulin calculators for bolus dosing for meals and for correction of hyperglycemia. Extended or dual-wave boluses can be used to help manage the prolonged or delayed rise in glucose that is commonly observed after eating higher fat and protein meals or in the presence of gastroparesis. The use of calculated "active insulin" or "insulin on board" helps prevent hypoglycemia that can occur from overcorrecting for hyperglycemia with multiple correction boluses ("stacking"). (See

          Types of insulin pumps
         </strong>
         – A variety of insulin pumps are available, and the choice among pumps is largely a matter of individual preference, cost, lifestyle, and compatibility with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices  (

         ). Use of sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy and hybrid closed-loop systems can reduce time in hypoglycemia. (See

          Low glucose threshold suspend or predictive low glucose suspend systems

          Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems
         </strong>
         – These systems comprise an insulin pump and a CGM device with integrated function. When partially automated insulin delivery systems are in the "auto" or "automatic" mode, the system automatically gives a mini-bolus (or no bolus) of rapidly acting insulin every five minutes determined by an algorithm that uses parameters including CGM results and target glucose  (

         ). Automatic correction insulin doses are also provided in advanced hybrid closed-loop systems. With these "hybrid" closed-loop devices, the user still needs to determine and administer pre-meal insulin boluses. With more fully automated systems, insulin pump use can be initiated solely on the basis of user body weight. Once initiated, the system automatically calibrates and adjusts insulin delivery based on glycemia. (See
