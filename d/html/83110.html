         For patients with severe calcific native aortic valve stenosis (AS) with an indication for valve replacement, intervention options include surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI, also known as transcatheter aortic valve replacement or TAVR). A multidisciplinary team approach is recommended in approaching patients with severe AS, as the decisions involved are complex.

         This topic will review the choice of therapy (SAVR, TAVI, or palliative medical therapy) for patients with severe AS with an indication for valve replacement.

         For patients with asymptomatic severe AS with an indication for valve replacement (eg, presence of LV ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;50 percent, very severe AS, or fall in systemic blood pressure with exercise), the choice of SAVR versus TAVI is based upon an individualized risk-benefit assessment including the estimated surgical risk (with intermediate or higher estimated surgical risk favoring TAVI and low estimated surgical risk favoring SAVR) and estimated risk of complications with TAVI (with feasibility of transfemoral TAVI and absence of high risk anatomic features favoring TAVI). For asymptomatic patients with severe AS and an abnormal exercise test, very severe AS, rapid progression, or an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide, the 2020 ACC/AHA valve guidelines favor SAVR rather than TAVI [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. There is limited evidence comparing SAVR versus TAVI in asymptomatic patients as these patients were excluded from most of the supporting trials. (See

         Asymptomatic patients with severe AS who lack an indication for valve replacement should have frequent clinical evaluation to monitor for symptom onset so that timely treatment is provided for symptomatic patients. (See

Accurate estimation of the risk of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) performed by an experienced cardiothoracic surgeon and multidisciplinary valve team is vital to appropriate evaluation of potential candidates.

         Of note, TAVI outcomes may also be related to institutional factors, with an inverse relationship observed between procedural volume and 30-day mortality, as discussed separately. (See

        <p>
         The effect of bicuspid aortic valve (other than heavily calcified bicuspid valve) on TAVI outcomes is uncertain and is of less impact with the use of newer-generation transcatheter valves, as discussed separately (see

         ). While a congenitally bicuspid aortic valve was previously considered an exclusion criterion for TAVI, TAVI has been successfully performed in many patients with this disorder, as discussed separately. Once severe calcific stenosis is present, reliable identification of the number of valve leaflets is problematic, so it is likely that TAVI has been performed in many patients with a congenital bicuspid valve.

         Female sex – Although females experience more major bleeding and vascular complications with TAVI, female sex is an independent predictor of lower mortality after TAVI compared with females undergoing surgery (as well as compared with males undergoing TAVI). Thus, sex-specific mortality risk following TAVI is opposite of that following SAVR, for which females have higher mortality risk than males. We suggest including female sex as a factor since a mortality benefit has been observed with TAVI versus SAVR among females with intermediate to high surgical risk. (See

         For the majority of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), any one of the commercially available valves is suitable. In the United States, these include the balloon expandable (SAPIEN 3 and SAPIEN 3 Ultra) valves and the self-expanding valves (Evolut R, Evolut PRO, and PRO+). Approved valves in Europe include the preceding valves as well as the balloon-expandable Myval valve, the self-expanding ACURATE neo and neo 2, and Portico valves (the latter is repositionable prior to deployment).

         For patients treated at a center having sufficient experience with and access to many types of valves, there are certain patient-specific issues that might influence the choice of valve system type:

         In a patient deemed to be at high risk of annulus rupture (eg, a patient with a small, highly calcified annulus), a self-expanding rather than a balloon-expandable valve may be chosen to reduce the risk of annular rupture (as one of several potential strategies to attempt to reduce the risk of rupture). Annular rupture has been observed almost exclusively after use of a balloon-expandable valve and very rarely after use of a self-expandable valve [

         Operators have generally selected the type of TAVI valve to implant based upon local practice, operator training, medical center experience, and availability (based upon the regulatory approval status) rather than specific patient-related factors. Individual center procedure volume is an important factor in establishing and maintaining optimum patient outcomes. As a consequence, many centers have acquired experience with three or less valve systems. While this situation is changing, particularly in countries where there are multiple approved devices, maintenance of sufficient experience with each device used continues to be important for optimum patient outcomes. The differences in patient selection and procedural steps among competing device types are greater for various TAVI systems than for most other interventional cardiovascular procedures.

         Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) indications and techniques are rapidly evolving with published randomized trials in patients with symptomatic AS in patients with extreme, high, intermediate, and low surgical risk as described below.
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence on the use of TAVI in asymptomatic patients with AS is largely indirect, as these patients were excluded from randomized trials in intermediate and higher surgical risk patients and only a small minority of patients in the low surgical risk trials were asymptomatic. The ongoing EARLY TAVR trial is comparing TAVI with clinical surveillance in patients with asymptomatic severe AS [

         The Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves (PARTNER) multicenter trial (cohort B) in 358 inoperable patients with severe AS demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality and improvement in functional class in inoperable patients with balloon-expandable TAVI compared with standard medical care [

         While individual trials comparing TAVI versus SAVR have targeted specific surgical risk groups, meta-analyses have pooled these groups to examine pooled outcomes and subgroup differences.

The mortality reduction with TAVI versus SAVR was robust among patients undergoing transfemoral TAVI (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69-0.93) but not present among patients undergoing transthoracic TAVI. Similarly, there was a borderline significant interaction for sex (p = 0.05), with a significant mortality reduction with TAVI versus SAVR among females (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.50-0.91) but not among males (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.77-1.28).

         Limitations of studies included in these meta-analyses include use of transcatheter valves that are no longer in use (and cause higher rates of paravalvular aortic regurgitation than current models), use of transthoracic access routes that are now used less commonly than the subclavian/axillary approach, use of only bioprosthetic valves for SAVR in the included randomized trials, and limited duration of follow-up. In addition, in the second meta-analysis, the transthoracic component of the meta-analysis pooled data from the STACCATO trial (comparing transapical TAVI with SAVR) with the transthoracic subgroup of the PARTNER 2A trial. Limitations of the STACCATO trial include use of transapical access, which is a less common route, lack of preprocedural multidetector computed tomography (unlike PARTNER 2A and current clinical practice), the device success rate was unusually low (79 percent) compared with rates seen in higher-risk patients, and the rate of adverse events was unusually high, which triggered early termination of the study [

         Differences between the two trials limit the validity of trial comparisons. There were some differences in patient populations as well as composite endpoints between the Evolut Low Risk (self-expanding valve) and PARTNER 3 (balloon-expandable valve) trials. In the PARTNER 3 trial, a greater proportion of screened patients were excluded for risk factors such as severe left ventricular outflow tract calcium, adverse aortic root (small sinus of Valsalva or small, calcified sinotubular junction), and poor transfemoral access; these exclusions may have contributed to the low rates of TAVI complications, such as need for permanent pacemaker insertion and paravalvular regurgitation, in this trial. The PARTNER 3 trial included rehospitalization at one year in the composite endpoint but the Evolut Low Risk trial did not. However, the Evolut Low Risk trial reported a reduction in hospitalizations for HF at one year, so one-year outcomes for TAVI with the self-expanding valve and the balloon-expandable valve may be similar.

         A study of 241 patients (mean age 79 years) from the UK TAVI registry found that 91 percent of patients were free of structural valve degeneration at 5 to 10 (median 5.8)-year echocardiographic follow-up [

         As described above, patients undergoing transfemoral TAVI have better outcomes than patients undergoing alternative (nontransfemoral) access TAVI, as indicated by subgroup analyses of meta-analyses and individual trials. As an example, a meta-analysis of 27 observational studies and one randomized trial with a total of 17,020 patients undergoing TAVI found that 30-day mortality was 4.7 percent with the transfemoral approach and 8.1 percent with an alternative approach [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ]. One-year mortality was 16.4 percent with transfemoral access and 24.8 percent with nontransfemoral access. Transfemoral access was associated with a higher rate of vascular complications (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.48-2.99) but a lower rate of surgical conversion (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.42-0.81), while rates of bleeding and cerebrovascular events were similar to those with alternative access. However, the available data are not adequate to determine how much of the excess mortality seen in patients undergoing alternative access TAVI is caused by the alternative access procedure and how much is caused by excess comorbidity associated with the need for alternative access.

         Although females experience more major bleeding and vascular complications, female sex is an independent predictor of lower one-year mortality after TAVI. Thus, sex-specific mortality risk following TAVI is opposite of that following SAVR, for which females have higher mortality risk than males. We suggest including female sex as a factor when weighing the potential risks and benefits of TAVI versus SAVR, since the data suggest that TAVI is superior to SAVR for females with high-risk symptomatic AS.

         Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are the mainstays of treatment of severe calcific aortic stenosis (AS), as they improve symptoms and prolong survival. (See

         A multidisciplinary heart valve team (including cardiologists, structural valve interventionalists, cardiovascular surgeons, anesthesiologists, and nurses) should collaborate to optimize care for patients with severe AS with indication for valve replacement. The Heart Valve Team should assess an individual patient's life expectancy, frailty, comorbidities, specific anatomy, values, and preferences. (See

         For patients with asymptomatic severe AS with an indication for valve replacement (eg, presence of left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;50 percent, very severe AS, or fall in systemic blood pressure with exercise), the choice of SAVR versus TAVI is based upon an individualized risk-benefit assessment including the estimated surgical risk (with intermediate or higher estimated surgical risk favoring TAVI and low estimated surgical risk favoring SAVR) and estimated risk of complications with TAVI (with feasibility of transfemoral TAVI and absence of high risk anatomic features favoring TAVI).

Further study, including an adequately powered study with long-term outcomes, is needed to compare balloon- and self-expanding valve types. (See

          'Transcatheter valve type'

         above.)
