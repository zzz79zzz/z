         Respiratory distress results when breathing does not match the body's metabolic demand for oxygen due to failure of oxygenation and/or ventilation. In children, respiratory distress is typically characterized by signs of increased work of breathing, such as tachypnea, nasal flaring, use of accessory muscles, and/or retractions [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Head bobbing and grunting are additional signs more commonly seen in infants and toddlers. A respiratory rate that is inappropriately slow for the child's age and clinical condition may also be a sign of respiratory distress and may be a sign of impending respiratory arrest  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ). An abnormal pattern of respiration is a sign of respiratory distress that may offer clues to etiology. (See

         </a>

         </span>
         Respiratory disorders account for almost 10 million of the 30 million emergency department visits by children in the United States annually, and acute respiratory infections, particularly pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, and asthma, are among the leading causes of death in young children worldwide [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. Respiratory distress in children, particularly neonates and infants, must be promptly recognized and aggressively treated because they may decompensate quickly. Factors that contribute to rapid respiratory compromise in children include smaller airways, increased metabolic demand, decreased respiratory reserve, and inadequate compensatory mechanisms compared with adults. Respiratory arrest is the most common cause of cardiac arrest in children, and outcomes are poor for patients who develop cardiopulmonary arrest because of respiratory deterioration. (See

         Respiratory distress must be promptly recognized and treated. Delay may result in respiratory failure [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ], cardiopulmonary arrest, and death. Airway and breathing interventions in patients with signs of impending respiratory failure should be initiated prior to full evaluation. Definitive diagnosis based on history, signs and symptoms of illness, underlying conditions, and evaluation should be established as expeditiously as possible to guide treatment of specific underlying conditions  (

         The pediatric assessment triangle (PAT) focuses the initial evaluation of acutely ill or injured children on appearance, breathing, and circulation to quickly identify conditions that require immediate intervention. The PAT is reviewed separately. (See

          Breathing
         </strong>
         – Tachypnea is usually the initial sign of respiratory compromise. Abnormal airway sounds (eg, stridor, wheezing), nasal flaring, head bobbing, increased accessory muscle use, and positioning to maximize airway opening are other indicators of respiratory compromise. Children with upper airway obstruction often assume a "sniffing" position (neck flexed, head extended  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76538" href="/z/d/graphic/76538.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         )), while those with lower airway obstruction may sit in the "tripod" position (upright and leaning forward on outstretched hands  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79826" href="/z/d/graphic/79826.html" rel="external">
          picture 2
         </a>
         )). Nasal congestion in neonates and young infants may result in significant respiratory distress. Inability to handle secretions and/or swallow are signs of oropharyngeal or laryngotracheal obstruction.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         As respiratory distress progresses, respiratory rate often decreases and the pattern of respirations becomes irregular and, particularly in neonates and young infants, may progress to apnea. These are ominous signs. Without intervention, respiratory arrest quickly ensues.

         <strong>
          Circulation
         </strong>
         – Pallor, ashen color, and cyanosis are concerning findings that may indicate hypoxemia but may also be observed in patients with shock.

        <p>
         This assessment should take less than one minute. Throughout this evaluation, every reasonable effort must be made to keep the child calm and comfortable because anxiety and crying can substantially increase the work of breathing in young children by decreasing upper airway diameter and increasing metabolic demand for oxygen. The child should be positioned or allowed to maintain the position that best supports their respiratory effort.

         Children with upper airway symptoms such as choking, gagging, changes in voice, and/or stridor are likely to have an upper airway obstruction as the etiology of their distress. Initial management depends upon the degree and cause of obstruction  (

         Complete upper airway obstruction caused by a foreign body warrants immediate basic life support interventions (ie, back blows under one year of age versus abdominal thrusts over one year of age, a finger sweep for a visible foreign body, and attempted bag-mask ventilation), an emergency call to an anesthesiologist and, if less invasive measures fail, advanced airway procedures to reestablish oxygenation and ventilation  (

         Given the risk of sudden decompensation, patients with significant laryngotracheal injury, thermal or chemical epiglottitis, and progressive partial upper airway obstruction warrant immediate preparation for airway management and an emergency consultation, as available, with an anesthesiologist, pediatric intensivist, and/or an otolaryngologist to help secure the airway. Bag-mask ventilation may temporarily provide oxygenation until a definitive airway is established. In cases that progress to complete airway obstruction that does not respond to bag-mask ventilation, endotracheal intubation or, if unsuccessful, a surgical tracheal airway may be necessary. (See

         The evaluation of a child with acute respiratory distress includes determining the severity as well as the underlying cause. Tachypnea and retractions are hallmarks of respiratory distress. Respiratory distress may manifest as inadequate respiratory effort, most often in those who have tired from attempts to compensate for respiratory compromise (eg, severe bronchiolitis), those with underlying neuromuscular disease, and those with disordered control of breathing (eg, seizure, opioid overdose). Prolonged tachypnea and decreased respiratory effort can lead to respiratory failure and/or arrest.
        </p>
        <p>
         The emergency evaluation of the child with respiratory distress must first determine the severity of respiratory distress and the need for emergency intervention. Features of the history and physical examination will ideally localize the source as well as suggest the etiology and direct initial treatment  (

          table 4
         </a>
         ). Ancillary studies can then be performed as indicated to confirm the diagnosis and guide management  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82210" href="/z/d/graphic/82210.html" rel="external">
          table 5

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Regardless of etiology, the initial management of respiratory distress in children requires immediate evaluation and supportive care of airway, breathing, and circulation. For some conditions, specific interventions (ie, bronchodilator therapy for asthma or decompression of a pneumothorax) may rapidly relieve symptoms. With prompt aggressive treatment of respiratory distress and its underlying cause, most children with respiratory distress recover uneventfully. Delay in respiratory support can lead to respiratory arrest, which is the leading cause of cardiopulmonary arrest in children.

         – The abrupt onset of gagging or choking suggests upper airway conditions, such as an aspirated foreign body, allergy, or irritant exposure. A change in voice (either muffled or hoarse) also indicates an upper airway process. A child who suddenly complains of chest pain may have a spontaneous pneumothorax or, less likely, cardiac tamponade. A child who gradually develops tachypnea and retractions may have asthma, bronchopulmonary infection, lower airway foreign body, pleural effusion, a slowly enlarging pneumothorax, or heart failure.

A complaint of abdominal pain may indicate a gastrointestinal process (eg, appendicitis or bowel obstruction), diaphragmatic irritation from a pneumonic condition (as can occur with basilar pneumonia and/or pleural effusion), or a metabolic abnormality (eg, ketoacidosis from diabetes).

          Pulsus paradoxus

         – Although not specific, the presence of pulsus paradoxus is an important indicator of severe respiratory distress and/or decreased cardiac output. In patients with lower airway disease, pulsus paradoxus (ie, &gt;10 mmHg drop in systolic blood pressure during inspiration) correlates with the degree of airway obstruction that occurs as the result of accentuated swings in pleural pressure between inspiration and expiration. It also occurs when hyperinflation of the lungs limits inspiratory filling (and therefore left ventricular stroke volume of the heart).

          Upper airway sounds
         </strong>
         – Transmitted upper airway sounds are noted commonly in small children. Noises generated in the upper airway (ie, stertor due to nasal obstruction from congestion) are easily heard homogeneously throughout the lung fields, particularly in neonates and infants because of their small size and thin-walled chest. Inspiratory stridor suggests significant narrowing of the airway above the sternal notch.

Expiratory crackles may be heard in patients with bronchiolitis, asthma, cystic fibrosis, and lower airway foreign body. They can be accentuated by having infants and children exhale forcefully as if blowing out candles. Crackles that clear with coughing are usually not significant.

         – Focal crackles are typical findings in children with bacterial pneumonia. These breath sounds are often transmitted throughout the chest of a small child, which may mask focality. Asymmetric and decreased breath sounds with dullness to percussion suggest empyema or a pleural effusion. Diffuse crackles and/or wheezing suggest viral or atypical pneumonia. However, the absence of crackles or wheezes does

Upper respiratory tract infections, which do not generally cause respiratory distress (eg, the common cold), may trigger an asthma exacerbation in children.

         </strong>
         – Children with viral myocarditis may have fever and respiratory distress due to compromised cardiac function. Coxsackie B is the most common cause of myocarditis in children. COVID-19 infection and COVID-19 RNA vaccination have also been associated with myocarditis in children. (See

         Tachypnea may be the only respiratory indication of myocarditis. Crackles suggest pulmonary edema. Tachycardia with or without respiratory findings, particularly if unresponsive to fluids, should increase the suspicion for myocarditis. A new cardiac murmur or gallop may also be present. Elevated troponin and characteristic findings on electrocardiogram and echocardiograph help confirm the diagnosis. (See

Heart sounds often are abnormal but can be normal depending upon the underlying cardiac condition. Pain as the result of pericarditis may result in splinting with respiration. Cardiac biomarkers (eg, troponin), electrocardiogram, and, in selected settings, echocardiography can be helpful in establishing a specific diagnosis. (See

          Rapid assessment
         </strong>
         – In children, respiratory distress is typically characterized by signs of increased work of breathing, such as tachypnea, use of accessory muscles, nasal flaring, and/or retractions. Head bobbing and grunting are additional signs more commonly seen in infants and young children. A respiratory rate that is inappropriately slow for the child's age and clinical condition may also be a sign of respiratory distress and impending respiratory arrest  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78097" href="/z/d/graphic/78097.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Initial stabilization
         </strong>
         – Respiratory distress in children must be promptly recognized and treated. Delay may result in respiratory failure, cardiopulmonary arrest, and death. Airway management in patients with signs of impending respiratory failure should be initiated prior to full evaluation. Initial management should focus on rapid patient assessment and support of airway, breathing, and circulation as described above. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Initial stabilization'
