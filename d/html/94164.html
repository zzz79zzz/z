Each of these categories has several potential etiologies that may be diagnosed by point-of-care ultrasound examination  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109803" href="/d/graphic/109803.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) or the hemodynamic profile of pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) values  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef99516" href="/d/graphic/99516.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/intraoperative-management-of-shock-in-adults/abstract/1,2">1,2</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1594.html" rel="external">"Definition, classification, etiology, and pathophysiology of shock in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Multiple shock categories are often present during surgery. For example, a trauma patient with hemorrhage (hypovolemic shock) may also have a tension pneumothorax (obstructive shock) or spinal cord injury (neurogenic shock). Another example is severe ischemic myocardial dysfunction (cardiogenic shock) caused by hypotension due to sepsis (distributive shock). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/98976.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of and initial approach to the adult patient with undifferentiated hypotension and shock", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Simultaneous evaluation and resuscitation may be necessary before and during emergency surgery in a shock patient (see <a class="local">'Initial resuscitation'</a> below).
