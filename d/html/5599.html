         Scleritis is a painful, destructive, and potentially blinding inflammatory disorder of the sclera that may also involve the cornea, adjacent episclera, and underlying uveal tract. Scleritis has a striking, highly symptomatic clinical presentation  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81098" href="/z/d/graphic/81098.html" rel="external">
          picture 1

         ) (see
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical features'
         </a>
         below). By contrast, episcleritis is typically self-limited or quickly responsive to topical therapies. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5610.html" rel="external">
          "Episcleritis"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Scleritis sometimes occurs in an isolated fashion, without evidence of inflammation in other organs. However, in up to 50 percent of patients, scleritis is associated with an underlying systemic illness such as rheumatoid arthritis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis [
         <a href="#rid1">

         <a class="local">
          'Systemic disease associations'
         </a>
         below). Two-thirds of patients with scleritis require high-dose glucocorticoids or the combination of high-dose glucocorticoids and another immunosuppressive agent to achieve disease control [

          2

         The sclera lies beneath the conjunctiva and episclera but above the choroid  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62615" href="/z/d/graphic/62615.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The opaque scleral tissue is composed of collagen fibrils arranged in a precise, interlacing manner that enhances rigidity and stability. Although the sclera itself is avascular, the tissue derives its metabolic requirements by diffusion from the episclera and choroid, both of which are highly vascularized.
        </p>
        <p>
         The sclera comprises 90 percent of the outer coat of the eye. Scleral tissue begins at the limbus (the outer edge of the cornea) and terminates posteriorly at the optic canal. At the posterior pole of the eye, the sclera fuses with the dura mater and arachnoid sheaths of the optic nerve. These anatomic relationships explain why optic nerve edema and visual compromise are common complications of posterior scleritis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65671" href="/z/d/graphic/65671.html" rel="external">
          picture 2

          'Clinical features'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The sclera is divided into an anterior portion that is visible to the examiner and a posterior portion that lies behind the globe. Inflammation may occur in either the anterior or the posterior portion; rarely, it affects both, particularly in the setting of systemic inflammation. Anterior scleritis and posterior scleritis have different sets of implications for diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.

         Approximately 90 percent of scleritis cases involve the anterior portion of the sclera. Posterior scleritis is defined as involvement of the sclera by inflammation posterior to the insertion of the medial and lateral rectus muscles. Diffuse, nodular, and necrotizing subtypes of both anterior and posterior scleritis are recognized. (See

          Diffuse anterior scleritis
         </strong>
         – Diffuse anterior scleritis is the most common and least severe form of scleritis, accounting for nearly 50 percent of cases  (

         <strong>
          Nodular anterior scleritis

         – Necrotizing anterior scleritis is the least common but most dangerous subtype of anterior scleral inflammation. Compared with diffuse or nodular scleritis, this disorder occurs more frequently in women, has an older mean age of onset (average age 66 years), is more often associated with a systemic inflammatory illness, and is more likely to lead to ocular complications.

         Scleromalacia perforans – Scleromalacia perforans, also known as necrotizing anterior scleritis "without inflammation," is a rare form of severe scleritis  (

         Diffuse, nodular, and necrotizing variants of posterior scleritis have also been identified, but the clinical distinction between these entities is more difficult due to anatomic challenges involved in the assessment of posterior scleritis [

        <p>
         Because of the delays inherent in diagnosing an inflammatory process focused behind the eye and the proximity of posterior scleral inflammation to sensitive ocular tissues (eg, the retina and optic nerve), posterior scleritis usually requires the types of intensive immunosuppressive therapy used in necrotizing anterior scleritis.

         </span>
         Inflammatory and autoimmune processes, particularly vasculitis, appear to play a role in the pathogenesis of scleritis in many patients. However, the precise steps in the pathophysiology of most forms of scleritis are not well-defined. About half of the patients with scleritis have an associated systemic inflammatory or autoimmune disorder, in which vasculitis or vasculopathy is known to occur (see
         <a class="local">
          'Systemic disease associations'
         </a>
         below). However, it is unknown in such patients why the eye is targeted. Similarly, inflammatory changes can occur in association with infectious causes as well, sometimes with disease due to direct effects of the infectious agent on the sclera.
        </p>
        <p>
         An important underlying role for vasculitis in patients with necrotizing scleritis is illustrated by a study in which conjunctival and scleral biopsies from 25 patients with necrotizing scleritis and five with recurrent non-necrotizing scleritis were evaluated [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The patients had histopathologic evidence of vasculitis, with fibrinoid necrosis and neutrophil invasion of blood vessel walls and immune complex deposition in vessels from both scleral specimens, which include the episcleral tissue, and conjunctival specimens.
        </p>
        <p>
         In rheumatoid vasculitis, which is often associated with necrotizing scleritis, immune complex deposition within the vessel wall leads to fibrinoid necrosis, thrombotic occlusion of blood vessels, and the generation of a chronic inflammatory response in the sclera [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. The scleritis is usually characterized by granulomatous inflammation adjacent to or involving the scleral blood vessels.

         Scleritis is associated with a systemic disease in approximately 50 percent of cases, including systemic rheumatic and inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and granulomatosis with polyangiitis; and infectious diseases, including herpes zoster  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77619" href="/z/d/graphic/77619.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The most common association is with RA. When scleritis complicates RA, it is generally considered to be a manifestation of rheumatoid vasculitis, heralding the need for an intensification of therapy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7521.html" rel="external">
          "Ocular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Among the primary vasculitides, which are prominent among the other systemic disorders associated with scleritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which may be either in a generalized or a limited form, is a much more common cause of scleritis than the other types of vasculitis associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), such as microscopic polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss) [
         <a href="#rid7">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A retrospective study of 243 patients at a tertiary referral center determined that nearly half of the patients (47 percent) had an underlying identifiable condition, most commonly a rheumatic disease (37 percent) or infection (7 percent) [

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Interestingly, among the patients with an associated medical condition, only 78 percent had a diagnosis by the time of ocular disease presentation. Among those conditions that had not been diagnosed prior to the onset of eye disease, systemic vasculitides, including ANCA-related conditions, were the most common.
        </p>
        <p>
         Local trauma may also be a contributing factor. Scleritis may first occur after ocular surgery, perhaps initiated by trauma to the sclera [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9-11
         </a>
         ]. The risk may be greater in patients with underlying rheumatic disease [

         Scleritis is usually characterized by severe, constant, boring pain that worsens at night or in the early morning hours and radiates to the face and periorbital region. The extraocular muscles insert into the sclera, thus ocular movements exacerbate the pain associated with scleral inflammation. The pain generally limits activity and often prevents sleep. Additionally, patients may report headache; watering of the eye; ocular redness, particularly in patients with non-necrotizing anterior scleritis; and photophobia, which is variably present. Symptoms may vary depending upon the severity of scleritis that is present and whether there is tissue necrosis. When there is tissue necrosis in severe disease, there is loss of peripheral innervation which leads to "paradoxic" lessening of symptoms:

         – Symptoms of necrotizing anterior scleritis with inflammation include severe ocular and periorbital pain that steadily worsens to excruciating levels over days or weeks. The pain is boring in quality, and usually worse in the early morning hours. There is also almost always some degree of tenderness over the inflamed eye which is often not present in many other cases of the "red eye."

          Scleromalacia perforans
         </strong>
         – Scleromalacia perforans, commonly bilateral, is characterized by a remarkable lack of symptoms, particularly an absence of pain, which is due to tissue necrosis and loss of nerves. The absence of pain results from the necrosis of pain fibers. Patients may notice a change in color of their sclera because of scleral thinning. They may also experience a decrease in vision caused by a change in the shape of the eyeball and an alteration of corneal curvature (an acquired astigmatism).

          'Diagnosis of scleritis'

          'Diagnostic evaluation for systemic disease'

         The diagnosis of anterior scleritis can generally be made in a patient who has eye pain and local tenderness to touch (tested by exerting pressure on the overlying eyelid) associated with violaceous redness of the eye, and based upon findings of scleral edema with dilatation of the deep episcleral vascular plexus on ophthalmologic examination (slit-lamp examination and ophthalmoscopy). Subtypes of anterior scleritis are differentiated by additional distinct physical examination findings. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Ocular examination'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Posterior scleritis, which is usually NOT accompanied by anterior scleritis, differs from anterior scleritis in that the eye appears "quiet," meaning white and uninflamed on external exam, rather than violaceous or red. The other findings of posterior scleritis, such as choroidal thickening and other changes such as exudative retinal detachment (see
         <a class="local">
          'Ocular examination'
         </a>
         above), are difficult for the non-ophthalmologist to identify, as they need full posterior segment ophthalmoscopy. In addition to slit-lamp examination and ophthalmoscopy, B-scan ultrasonography of the posterior pole is used to detect characteristic changes in posterior scleritis.

        <p>
         Anterior scleritis is usually readily apparent to both the patient and clinician and can be diagnosed and classified based upon its clinical features, elicited in the history and evident on the ophthalmologic examination (see

          'Clinical features'

          Biopsy

The usual indication for episcleral biopsy is for the exclusion of an infiltrative process such as sarcoidosis or a lymphoproliferative disorder. In a setting of acute scleritis after recent ocular surgery, an infectious cause needs to be strongly considered. Should these cases not respond to empirical antibiotic therapy, a biopsy may be helpful.

         Patients should be specifically queried directly through a careful review of systems about constitutional symptoms and other organ system involvement, such as joint pain or swelling; abdominal pain, diarrhea, blood, or mucous in the stool; and symptoms of sinus congestion or other upper or lower airway symptoms. In addition, the clinician must examine with particular care the skin, joints, ears, nose, mouth, heart, lungs, and peripheral nerves, as these organs are often affected by the types of systemic disorders associated with scleritis.

         Scleritis is a painful, destructive disorder that may cause visual loss and may also be associated with inflammation in other parts of the eye, such as the cornea, episclera, and uveal tract. (See

         The sclera is divided into an anterior and posterior portion. Anterior scleritis and posterior scleritis have different sets of implications for diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. (See

         Diffuse, nodular, and necrotizing variants of posterior scleritis have also been identified, but the clinical distinction between these entities is more difficult due to anatomic challenges involved in the assessment of posterior scleritis. (See

         Scleritis is associated with a systemic disease in approximately 50 percent of cases. Most are rheumatic diseases (particularly rheumatoid arthritis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis). Most of the remaining cases are due to infection. (See

         In many patients, scleritis is a manifestation of necrotizing vasculitis, often associated with immune complex deposition in blood vessel walls, granulomatous inflammation, thrombotic occlusion of blood vessels, and fibrinoid necrosis. (See

         Anterior scleritis (with ocular erythema and other examination features as well as intense pain) is usually obvious to both the patient and clinician. Posterior scleritis is less obvious, as redness and other changes are often not seen on examination. (See

         Necrotizing anterior scleritis is particularly likely to involve other ocular structures, such as the cornea (peripheral ulcerative keratitis [PUK]), episclera, and uveal tract. (See

         Patients suspected of scleritis based upon the medical history and, if present, findings of a red eye and pain with ocular movement, should be referred for urgent ophthalmologic evaluation. The diagnosis is made based upon the medical history and findings on slit-lamp examination and ophthalmoscopy of scleral edema with dilatation of the deep episcleral vascular plexus. Diffuse anterior, nodular, and necrotizing scleritis subtypes can be distinguished readily on physical examination, particularly when a slit lamp is used.
