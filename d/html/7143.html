The vast majority of cases are ischemic, in which increased pressure compromises vascular circulation (a type of compartment syndrome). Over time, repeated episodes cause permanent damage and erectile dysfunction (ED). </p><p>Priapism is considered a medical emergency in which timely diagnosis and appropriate management are vital to preserving normal function. This is a challenging management area because there are few experts dedicated to managing priapism in SCD and few large trials on which to base practice, and management often involves multiple specialties, including urology, emergency medicine, pediatrics, and hematology.</p><p>This topic review discusses our approach to the evaluation and treatment of priapism and ED in boys and men with SCD.</p><p>Related subjects, including the use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8543" href="/z/d/drug information/8543.html" rel="external">hydroxyurea</a> and regular blood transfusion, as well as overviews of the other clinical findings and routine management of SCD, are presented separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8543" href="/z/d/drug information/8543.html" rel="external">Hydroxyurea</a> – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7071.html" rel="external">"Hydroxyurea use in sickle cell disease"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Transfusion – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90145.html" rel="external">"Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease: Indications and transfusion techniques"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clinical features – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7119.html" rel="external">"Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Routine management (child) – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14519.html" rel="external">"Sickle cell disease in infancy and childhood: Routine health care maintenance and anticipatory guidance"</a>.) </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Routine management (adult) – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7114.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Transition from pediatric to adult care – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/112919.html" rel="external">"Sickle cell disease (SCD) in adolescents and young adults (AYA): Transition from pediatric to adult care"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND CLASSIFICATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1426467961"><span class="h2">Definitions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Priapism is defined as a persistent penile erection that is not related to sexual interest or desire. It can be categorized as low flow (ischemic) or high flow (nonischemic). Low-flow priapism accounts for the vast majority of cases of priapism in individuals with SCD.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Low-flow/ischemic priapism</strong> – Low-flow priapism (also called ischemic or veno-occlusive) is responsible for &gt;95 percent of priapism presentations in SCD [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Major episodes</strong> – While ischemic priapism can last for any time, the longer the course of the erection, the greater the potential for permanent damage to the penile tissue. Episodes lasting ≥4 hours (commonly referred to as major episodes) are especially concerning because ischemia for this duration is associated with a greater risk of permanent tissue damage. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Beyond 24 hours, there may be tissue necrosis and scarring, leading to erectile dysfunction (ED). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Stuttering priapism</strong> – Stuttering priapism (also called recurrent ischemic priapism [RIP]) is characterized by brief, recurrent episodes of transient, self-limited priapism [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Each episode typically lasts for a few minutes to up to three hours. Like other forms of ischemic priapism, the episodes are painful and unrelated to sexual interest.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>High-flow priapism</strong> – High-flow priapism (also called nonischemic or arterial) is a rare form of priapism in which the arterial blood supply to the cavernous tissue is disrupted. This typically occurs with penile trauma, penile arterial aneurysm, or iatrogenic causes (eg, needle injury). Fistula formation between the cavernous artery and the lacunar spaces results in unregulated penile engorgement. High-flow priapism is typically not painful and may resolve spontaneously with minimal complications; emergency interventions often are not needed.</p><p></p><p>ED is defined as the inability to achieve or sustain an erection firm enough for sexual intercourse. ED is a common complication of priapism in SCD and results from repeated episodes of ischemia-induced tissue damage that interfere with the normal vascular changes that lead to an erection.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3720449970"><span class="h2">Mechanisms of priapism</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Normal physiology</strong> – The basal, flaccid state of the penis is maintained by the sympathetic nervous system that produces high vascular and smooth muscle tone. Penile erection occurs typically in response to parasympathetic nervous system inputs (eg, genital stimulation or psychosexual excitement). Parasympathetic inputs increase arterial blood flow to the penis via the cavernous and helicine arteries, filling the sinusoids and leading to distension of the trabecular cavernosal tissue  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66964" href="/z/d/graphic/66964.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Cavernosal distension restricts venous outflow and permits sustained engorgement [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Reflex erections are physiologic erections not due to sexual excitement (eg, during rapid eye movement [REM] sleep) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. They can occur in any age (even neonates and young children). Sleep-related erections are also highly androgen-dependent [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]; this explains why anti-androgens may be helpful in some individuals who have frequent priapism episodes upon awakening from sleep. (See <a class="local">'Hormonal therapies'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Nitric oxide (NO) signaling is one of the principal mediators of erection; it causes smooth muscle relaxation in response to parasympathetic inputs. NO is produced in neuronal and endothelial cells by nitric oxide synthase (NOS), using arginine and oxygen as precursors [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. NO readily diffuses into smooth muscle cells in the cavernosal artery and the sinusoidal space, where it activates guanylate cyclase, leading to increased cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP-dependent protein kinases produce signals that reduce intracellular calcium, leading to smooth muscle relaxation, vasodilation, and increased blood flow into the penis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The erectile response is terminated when phosphodiesterases (PDEs; especially PDE-5, the target of ED drugs) hydrolyze and inactivate cGMP, leading to smooth muscle contraction. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Low-flow priapism mechanism</strong> – Low-flow priapism is associated with decreased or absent blood flow in the penile arteries caused by high pressure in the venous sinuses of the corpora cavernosa, which leads to tense rigidity and pain, a type of compartment syndrome. The majority of patients with SCD and priapism are homozygous for hemoglobin S. However, priapism has been described in patients with hemoglobin SC disease, sickle cell beta thalassemia, and sickle cell trait [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Many episodes of SCD-associated priapism occur upon awakening from sleep, as REM-sleep erections are common and occur by the same mechanisms. Other precipitating factors are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Precipitating factors'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>NO signalling</strong> – Detumescence does not appear to function normally in some individuals with SCD. This may be because NO signaling also regulates PDE-5 protein expression; when NO is chronically depleted (as in individuals with SCD), PDE-5 levels are lower, and the setpoint for termination of the erection is altered [<a href="#rid3">3,9</a>]. An increased risk of priapism in the setting of a low NO state is counterintuitive since penile erection requires high levels of NO. A plausible biological explanation is that priapism occurs due to PDE-5 dysregulation (uncontrolled signaling).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Evidence linking NO depletion with priapism in SCD includes:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Mouse models of reduced NO synthesis (double NOS knockout [dNOS<sup>-/-</sup>]) have priapism, pronounced erectile responses, and reduced PDE-5 signaling [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The dNOS<sup>-/-</sup> recapitulates the SCD priapism mouse models [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. In both dNOS<sup>-/-</sup> and the SCD mice, treatment with a compound derived from <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8543" href="/z/d/drug information/8543.html" rel="external">hydroxyurea</a> that acts as an NO donor was able to reverse the priapism phenotype [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Adenosine mediates vasodilation and NO synthesis, and mouse models have also suggested a role for elevated levels of adenosine in priapism, although it is not known whether a similar effect occurs in people with SCD [<a href="#rid3">3,13,14</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Individuals with SCD have decreased circulating NO levels due to chronic hemolysis, which releases free hemoglobin (a prominent NO scavenger) into the circulation [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. Hemolysis also releases the enzyme arginase into the circulation; arginase depletes NO by metabolizing the NO precursor arginine into ornithine. NO may also be decreased by excess superoxide anion, a byproduct of oxidative stress. In a case-control study involving participants in the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD), individuals with a history of priapism had more clinically severe SCD, including higher rates of stroke, acute chest syndrome, and acute painful episodes, as well as increased laboratory markers of hemolysis such as lower hemoglobin, higher reticulocyte count, higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and higher bilirubin [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Reduced NO bioavailability has also been proposed to contribute to pulmonary hypertension in SCD. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94999.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary hypertension associated with sickle cell disease", section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>PDE-5 levels are low in mouse models of SCD and in individuals with SCD and priapism. The low PDE-5 levels may lead to an altered setpoint for PDE-5 homeostasis. Regular treatment with a PDE-5 inhibitor leads to a steady increase in cGMP, and subsequently the incited cGMP-promoter activity induces tissue expressions of PDE-5 [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. This may explain the paradoxical effect of chronic administration of PDE-5 inhibitors such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9643" href="/z/d/drug information/9643.html" rel="external">sildenafil</a> in reducing priapism [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See <a class="local">'PDE-5 inhibitors (sildenafil and tadalafil)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The physiology of ischemic priapism (and vaso-occlusion generally) in SCD remains an area of active investigation. Mechanical sludging of red blood cells (RBCs) in the penile vasculature, previously thought to be responsible for priapism in SCD, is considered less likely to play a major role. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7135.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology of sickle cell disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>High-flow priapism mechanism</strong> – High-flow priapism occurs when the arterial inflow into the penis is increased, often due to trauma or injury to the cavernosal artery that creates a fistula between the artery and lacunar spaces. Tissue ischemia is not a major component of high-flow priapism because venous outflow remains intact. As a result, high-flow priapism typically is not painful and often resolves spontaneously.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H516437559"><span class="h2">Mechanisms of ED</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ED results when the normal response to parasympathetic inputs is blunted, preventing normal erections. There are many factors that contribute, as discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6840.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and etiologies of male sexual dysfunction"</a>.)</p><p>In SCD, a major mechanism of ED is prior ischemic priapism, especially prolonged ischemia (episodes lasting &gt;12 hours) and more frequent episodes of ischemia are likely to increase the risk of ED [<a href="#rid6">6,19-21</a>]. The age at which the episodes occur may also contribute; some series have reported that priapism during childhood is less likely to result in ED than priapism in adulthood [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Over time, ischemia leads to cellular injury and inflammation, culminating in irreversible damage and fibrosis in the corpora cavernosa. </p><p>Individuals with priapism may fear sexual intercourse because of the risk of precipitating a priapism event [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prevalence of priapism </strong>– The prevalence of priapism is estimated to be approximately 35 to 45 percent in males with SCD [<a href="#rid6">6,19,20,22-24</a>]. The actual prevalence may be higher, as some individuals may be reluctant to mention this symptom or to report it in surveys. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a cross-sectional study from Nigeria involving 500 males with SCD, 33 percent of adults had a history of priapism [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. The remainder had major priapism (lasting ≥4 hours). Due to shame, lack of knowledge, and paucity of effective medical treatment to prevent or actively treat priapism, a high proportion never sought medical attention (approximately 50 percent). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a survey of 104 boys and men from Jamaica who were "not reticent to discuss it," at least one episode of priapism was reported by 44 individuals (42 percent) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. In a series from a pediatric urology clinic that included 155 boys with SCD, priapism occurred in 10 (6.5 percent) [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. The priapism prevalence in children reported in this cohort may be lower than expected because only severe cases are likely to be referred to urology clinic. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prevalence of ED </strong>– Erectile dysfunction (ED) following episodes of priapism is very common in individuals with SCD, with reported prevalences of 20 to 30 percent [<a href="#rid6">6,19</a>]. In our practice, ED affects nearly 40 percent of individuals with SCD who have recurrent ischemic priapism (RIP), even if the episodes are minor [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES AND EVALUATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h2">Typical presentations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Priapism is a clinical diagnosis made when an unwanted erection is present. </p><p>Priapism in SCD may occur at any age, but typically it becomes a more significant clinical problem after puberty. The median age of onset is in adolescence (12 to 15 years), with the first episode occurring before age 20 in 75 to 90 percent of affected individuals [<a href="#rid6">6,19,23</a>]. </p><p>Rarely, individuals without prior knowledge of their SCD status may present with priapism [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. In a review of the underlying conditions associated with priapism in children and adolescents, SCD accounted for 65 percent of cases; the remainder were related to trauma, leukemia, or medications [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>Most individuals do not have a history of trauma; rarely, a history of trauma or surgery on the penis may suggest damage to the cavernosal artery and high-flow, nonischemic priapism. (See <a class="local">'Pathophysiology and classification'</a> above.)</p><p>Ischemic priapism is painful. Often the erection is present upon awakening from sleep [<a href="#rid25">25,27,28</a>]. It typically occurs in the absence of another acute vaso-occlusive illness such as acute chest syndrome. However, other sites of pain may be present, and there may be a history of an acute illness with fever or dehydration. (See <a class="local">'Precipitating factors'</a> below.)</p><p>The duration of the erection is not relevant to diagnosis, but it affects the likelihood of long-term complications and thus has an impact on the urgency and type of interventions needed. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Episodes may present as shorter, more frequent episodes (stuttering priapism) or major episodes (lasting &gt;4 hours). (See <a class="local">'Definitions'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Individuals with priapism commonly have stuttering priapism (over 70 percent) [<a href="#rid6">6,24</a>]. Stuttering episodes often occur in clusters, approximately two to three times per week for several weeks prior to the abating of symptoms. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a cohort study of adults with sickle cell anemia, the sum of priapism episodes in three months predicts the occurrence of a major priapism [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Also, in patients with a history of at least three episodes of priapism in the past 12 months, there is an 80 percent chance of having another episode within 30 days. Sometimes stuttering priapism is a precursor to a major priapism episode. In a review of 39 patients with priapism who presented for medical care, the mean duration of symptoms was 22 hours (range 6 to 70 hours), with four presenting to the hospital more than 36 hours after the onset of symptoms [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. In a series from Jamaica, 23 patients had experienced prolonged major episodes of priapism lasting more than 24 hours; of these, 14 (61 percent) were preceded by multiple episodes of stuttering priapism [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. </p><p></p><p>An ischemic priapism episode lasting at least four hours is a urologic emergency. (See <a class="local">'Ischemic priapism: Acute management'</a> below.)</p><p>The frequency of priapism episodes is also variable.

It can be low-flow (ischemic, vaso-occlusive) or high-flow (nonischemic). Some series estimate priapism affects 35 to 45 percent of men with sickle cell disease (SCD). Ischemic episodes lasting ≥4 hours (major episodes) are especially concerning due to the greater risk of permanent tissue damage from what is essentially a compartment syndrome of the penis. (See <a class="local">'Pathophysiology and classification'</a> above and <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – Ischemic priapism is a type of painful compartment syndrome. The history should determine the duration, circumstances associated with its onset, hydration status, medications, and recreational drugs. The examination focuses on infections or causes of dehydration. Examination of the penis should determine the degree of tumescence and signs of trauma. In ischemic priapism, the penis is rigid and painful with a soft glans. (See <a class="local">'Clinical features and evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Laboratory testing and role of imaging</strong> – A complete blood count (CBC) and reticulocyte count should be obtained and compared with the individual's baseline. Individuals with fever or a white blood cell (WBC) count above their baseline should have blood cultures. In selected cases (confusing results from corporal blood gas, trauma), imaging of penile blood flow using color duplex ultrasonography may be helpful. (See <a class="local">'Laboratory testing and imaging'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Treatment</strong> – For stuttering priapism or episodes lasting &lt;4 hours, patients should be advised to maintain hydration and use oral analgesics, along with other maneuvers that have been helpful in previous episodes. For priapism lasting &gt;4 hours that does not respond to conservative management, we suggest aspiration of blood from the corpus cavernosum, with or without <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> irrigation, followed by injection of an alpha-adrenergic agonist (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'Aspiration and irrigation of the corpus cavernosum'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If the aspiration and irrigation do not result in detumescence within a reasonable period of time, a surgical shunt may be required.

The best way to prevent erectile dysfunction (ED) in SCD is to treat episodes of priapism rapidly and use appropriate interventions to reduce their frequency. For individuals with frequent major episodes of priapism or other concerning features (eg, escalating stuttering priapism), we suggest <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8543" href="/z/d/drug information/8543.html" rel="external">hydroxyurea</a> (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>).
