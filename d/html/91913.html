Such procedures are performed to relieve symptoms in patients with severe asthma refractory to traditional pharmacotherapy. General anesthesia or deep sedation is employed for bronchial thermoplasty, and a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is typically selected rather than an endotracheal tube (ETT) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Thus, risk of intraoperative bronchospasm is minimized while airway patency is maintained. (See <a class="local">'Laryngeal mask airway'</a> below and <a class="local">'Endotracheal tube'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Procedures requiring rigid bronchoscopy</p><p></p><p>Since anesthetic requirements or procedural conditions may change after a bronchoscopy has begun, conversion to general anesthesia may become necessary for some sedated patients.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H208155088"><span class="h2">Topical airway anesthesia with sedation</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1407883057"><span class="h3">Topical anesthesia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We typically choose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a> for topical airway anesthesia because of its relatively rapid onset and the availability of different preparations [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Since topical anesthesia of the airway for bronchoscopy always includes the vocal cords, airway protective reflexes are depressed or absent after completion of the procedure. (See <a class="local">'Emergence and postoperative care'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients initially gargle 4% <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a> to produce topical anesthesia of the mouth and base of the tongue. This is followed by direct application of atomized 1 or 2% lidocaine by spraying structures in the oropharynx and laryngopharynx. Then the flexible bronchoscope is introduced. Additional 2% lidocaine is sprayed via the bronchoscope port onto the cords  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94913" href="/d/graphic/94913.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>), down into the trachea  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94915" href="/d/graphic/94915.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>), and finally onto the carina  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94916" href="/d/graphic/94916.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>). If necessary, the lower airways may be anesthetized by injecting local anesthetic through the distal channel of the bronchoscope  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67231" href="/d/graphic/67231.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79391" href="/d/graphic/79391.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). Total dose of lidocaine should not exceed 5 mg/kg. However, total dose calculation is challenging since much of the initial 4% lidocaine gargle is expectorated, and swallowed lidocaine is subject to the first-pass effect in the gastrointestinal tract. Typically, we use 50 mL of 4% lidocaine for gargling followed by 10 to 20 mL of 1 or 2% atomized lidocaine for delivery via the bronchoscope. Although this total volume greatly exceeds 5 mg/kg, nearly all the 4% lidocaine is expectorated, and much of the atomized lidocaine is swallowed.</p><p><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10228" href="/d/drug information/10228.html" rel="external">Prilocaine</a> is avoided for topical airway anesthesia. Although it has excellent penetration of the respiratory mucosa, it may cause methemoglobinemia, which is particularly undesirable in patients with respiratory disease [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].

Agent selection depends on the planned procedure and patient-specific factors and preferences. In general, medications with rapid onset and short duration of action are preferred to allow rapid titration of sedation and analgesia during the procedure, as well as a quick recovery. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94529.html" rel="external">"Monitored anesthesia care in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Agents used alone or in combination for sedation include [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A combination of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9650" href="/d/drug information/9650.html" rel="external">midazolam</a> (1 to 2 mg) and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8441" href="/d/drug information/8441.html" rel="external">fentanyl</a> (50 to 100 mcg) is typically administered to achieve anxiolysis, sedation, tolerance of the procedure, and partial or total amnesia. Additional titrated boluses of midazolam (0.5 to 1 mg) and/or fentanyl (25 to 50 mcg) may be administered if necessary. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94529.html" rel="external">"Monitored anesthesia care in adults", section on 'Midazolam'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94529.html" rel="external">"Monitored anesthesia care in adults", section on 'Opioids'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9854" href="/d/drug information/9854.html" rel="external">Remifentanil</a> is an ultrashort-acting opioid that has excellent pharmacokinetics for short-duration sedation due to its very rapid onset and offset [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. It is particularly useful for suppressing airway reflexes if administered by infusion. Paradoxically, bolus dosing of remifentanil may stimulate a strong urge to cough or in extreme cases, bronchospasm, and bolus dosing is also more likely to cause apnea compared with infusion.

Thus, propofol is avoided in patients with a challenging airway. Another disadvantage is that propofol may cause disinhibition and loss of patient cooperation during the procedure.

In one study of 65 patients undergoing endobronchial ultrasound-guided (EBUS) transbronchial needle aspiration with MAC sedation, use of dexmedetomidine resulted in no respiratory events such as bradypnea, apnea, or hypoxia, but a slightly longer time until discharge from the post-anesthesia care unit (3 to 38 minutes) compared with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9854" href="/d/drug information/9854.html" rel="external">remifentanil</a> (three to five minutes) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].

An alternative technique is administration of high-flow nasal oxygen (eg, at a flow rate of 30 to 70 L/minute), which may result in less frequent peripheral arterial oxygen desaturation to &lt;90 percent compared with standard management [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96308.html" rel="external">"Maintenance of general anesthesia: Overview", section on 'Total intravenous anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p>The sedative-hypnotic component of a TIVA technique for bronchoscopy is typically <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9826" href="/d/drug information/9826.html" rel="external">propofol</a>.

In young, healthy patients, an initial remifentanil infusion of 0.2 mcg/kg/minute is typical, with titration to a higher infusion dose as needed. Although bronchoscopy can be an intensely stimulating procedure, there is little discomfort following the procedure. Thus, titration of remifentanil is ideal for ablation of airway and hemodynamic responses to noxious stimuli, followed by a desirable rapid emergence at the end of the procedure.

For example, the Olympus endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope has an external diameter of 6.9 mm. When an 8.0 mm ID ETT is used, the remaining cross-sectional area after insertion of the EBUS scope is equivalent to that of a 4.0 mm ID ETT, which is too narrow to allow effective ventilation in an adult patient.

No NMBA is administered during spontaneous ventilation. Also, opioid administration is minimized during induction to avoid hypoventilation and apnea. This “don’t burn your bridges” approach affords a margin of safety if the bronchoscopist is unable to rapidly secure the airway.</p><p>After induction of general anesthesia, before attempts at securing the airway, we usually switch to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8992" href="/d/drug information/8992.html" rel="external">isoflurane</a> as the volatile anesthetic agent, rather than continuing <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9887" href="/d/drug information/9887.html" rel="external">sevoflurane</a> administration. Isoflurane is the most soluble potent volatile agent available in North America (or halothane may be used, if available). Thus, changes in anesthetic depth are less rapid when inhalation anesthetic administration is briefly interrupted (eg, when the rigid bronchoscope must be removed to perform airway interventions or during temporary periods of apnea). Anesthetic depth is more stable because a spontaneously breathing patient will not have apnea, and an apneic patient will not immediately awaken from general anesthesia produced with isoflurane or halothane. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96308.html" rel="external">"Maintenance of general anesthesia: Overview", section on 'Isoflurane'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94534.html" rel="external">"Inhalation anesthetic agents: Properties and delivery"</a>.)</p><p>Once the airway has been secured by the bronchoscopist’s interventions (eg, removal of a foreign body or treatment of tracheal stenosis), we typically discontinue the volatile anesthetic and switch to a TIVA technique; an NMBA is usually administered as part of the TIVA technique.</p><p>Disadvantages of an inhalation technique include difficulty in providing adequate anesthetic depth that prevents coughing and movement during bronchoscopic instrumentation. Typically, a 1.5 to 2.0 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) is necessary (with MAC defined as the concentration of an inhaled agent in the alveoli that is required to prevent movement in response to a surgical stimulus in 50 percent of patients). However, accurate measurements of the end-tidal anesthetic agent cannot be obtained because anesthetic gases leak around the bronchoscope. Another disadvantage of an inhalation technique is the pollution of the operating room with anesthetic gases that occurs with such leakage.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1993057043"><span class="h2">Ventilation techniques</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Controlled ventilation during rigid bronchoscopy in the anesthetized patient may be accomplished with standard PPV or a JV system [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3580467400"><span class="h3">Positive pressure ventilation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>PPV is accomplished by connecting an anesthesia circuit to the side connector of the rigid bronchoscope  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53603" href="/d/graphic/53603.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>). Ventilation is typically controlled by hand in order to accommodate the bronchoscopist’s need for periods of apnea. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/93386.html" rel="external">"Mechanical ventilation during anesthesia in adults"</a>.)</p><p>A disadvantage for this technique is the need for the bronchoscopist to completely cover the proximal end of the bronchoscope that is outside the body each time the anesthesiologist generates positive pressure with hand ventilation. This impairs the bronchoscopist's ability to work and necessitates frequent interruption of ventilation (ie, periods of apnea). Also, as noted above, there is significant leakage of gases around the bronchoscope. Although the bronchoscopist can place a throat pack in the oropharynx to ameliorate this, hypoventilation often occurs and measurements of end-tidal gases (eg, oxygen, carbon dioxide, inhalation anesthetic agents) may be inaccurate.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H85662128"><span class="h3">Jet ventilation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>JV is an alternative ventilation technique during rigid bronchoscopy suitable for patients having a patent airway with a diameter large enough to allow an adequate pathway for egress of ventilation gases. Use of a jet ventilator requires TIVA because inhaled anesthetics cannot be administered via a JV system. An NMBA is often administered to induce complete muscle relaxation. (See <a class="local">'Total intravenous anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p>Typical settings for JV during rigid bronchoscopy are:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Respiratory rate: 20 to 30 breaths per minute (bpm).

This is desirable since it provides a secure location for attaching the jet ventilator tubing, preventing too much slippage in or out. However, it is possible to accomplish JV via a catheter inserted directly into a rigid bronchoscope (eg, an airway exchange catheter).</p><p>We use the only electronic JV system that is commercially available in the United States (the Monsoon III jet ventilator manufactured by Acutronic Medical Systems AG). This ventilator has sampling catheters that measure airway pressures within the JV catheter before the administration of each breath, as well as during inspiration (via a second sampling catheter). If either pressure exceeds the maximal setting, ventilation is immediately suspended by the device. Thus, build-up of high pressures that may cause a pneumothorax is prevented. </p><p>Although manual JV is employed in some centers, this technique requires extreme caution due to a high risk for barotrauma. The anesthesiologist must ensure that there is no airway obstruction and that an adequate pathway exists for egress of gas from the chest. Since high pressures may be delivered to the patient’s lungs during manual JV, a pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum can develop rapidly, with resultant hemodynamic collapse and/or traumatic injury. Each one pound-force per square inch (psi) by jet ventilation is equivalent to 75 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, compared with standard hospital wall outlets for oxygen that are calibrated to 50 psi (equivalent to &gt;3500 cmH<sub>2</sub>O).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2743824827"><span class="h2">Emergence and postoperative care</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Airway management during emergence from general anesthesia after a rigid bronchoscopy procedure may be challenging.
