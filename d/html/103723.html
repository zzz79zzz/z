         Heart murmurs are common in infants and children. Evaluation of a murmur is the most common reason for referral to a pediatric cardiologist [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. While the prevalence of congenital heart disease is approximately 1 percent, a majority of children have innocent murmurs at some time [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. Being able to distinguish a murmur associated with heart disease from a benign etiology is important for diagnosis and management  (

          Family history

         – The risk for congenital heart disease is higher if a first-degree relative (parent or sibling) has a structural congenital heart defect  (

         <strong>
          Patient age
         </strong>
         – In the neonatal period, murmurs present in the first six hours of life are usually associated with a valve problem, either regurgitation (tricuspid valve or mitral valve) or stenosis (aortic valve or pulmonary valve). Murmurs detected after six hours of age are more likely to represent shunt lesions (eg, atrial or ventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus) or peripheral pulmonary stenosis as these murmurs become more apparent as pulmonary vascular resistance falls. However, a valve problem may also present after six hours of age, particularly if an earlier examination was not performed or the neonate was uncooperative at the time of the initial examination. The presence of an early murmur does not rule out a septal defect. For example, neonates with tetralogy of Fallot  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82493" href="/z/d/graphic/82493.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ) typically have an early murmur of pulmonary stenosis but also have a ventricular septal defect [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. (See

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Murmurs detected in children beyond the age of one year often represent innocent murmurs but can also be produced by semilunar valve stenosis, atrioventricular valve regurgitation, or atrial septal defects. Other congenital heart lesions are unlikely to present at this age unless access to medical care was limited at an earlier age. A new murmur that occurs in a patient with a history of recent or frequent streptococcal pharyngitis may represent cardiac involvement with rheumatic fever. The left-sided valves are mainly involved in this condition, with mitral regurgitation more common than aortic regurgitation in acute cases. (See

          Symptoms
         </strong>
         – When evaluating an infant or child with a cardiac murmur, it is important to assess whether there are any symptoms concerning for heart disease  (

          table 1

         ). Concerning symptoms at any age include respiratory difficulties, diaphoresis (especially with exertion), and poor growth. In infants, symptoms may include poor feeding or excessive irritability. In older children, chest pain and syncope are important symptoms. Symptoms that may raise suspicion for heart disease in children are discussed in greater detail separately. (See

         The physical examination should include careful review of the vital signs (including measurement of blood pressure in upper and lower extremities), assessment of heart rate and rhythm, assessment of pulses, and a detailed cardiovascular examination (including inspection, palpation, and auscultation of the chest)  (

         Bounding pulses occur when there is a large pulse pressure (ie, a large difference between systolic and diastolic pressure) and are classically associated with moderate to severe aortic regurgitation. In addition, bounding pulses may be seen with aortic runoff lesions, including patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)  (

          Apical impulse

         – The apical impulse is palpated using the tips of the middle and index fingers and is usually located in the fourth or fifth intercostal space in the left midclavicular line. The impulse is laterally displaced in lesions associated with a dilated left ventricle (aortic or mitral valve regurgitation, large left-to-right shunts at the ventricular or great vessel level). The impulse is more medial in patients with mesocardia or dextroposition (left-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia, scimitar syndrome, left lobar emphysema) and is present in the right chest in patients with dextrocardia.

A thrill associated with aortic or pulmonary stenosis is suggestive of severe obstruction; however, a thrill associated with a VSD does not necessarily indicate a large defect as it may be due to a large amount of left-to-right flow across the defect or a large pressure gradient between ventricles.

         – A palpable S2 at the left upper sternal border indicates that a semilunar valve is closing under high pressure. This finding usually indicates the presence of severe pulmonary artery hypertension. The pulmonary valve typically is the most anterior of the four cardiac valves, and its closure can be palpated if pulmonary pressure is at or near systemic level. In patients with unrepaired transposition of the great arteries, the aortic valve is the most anterior valve and its closure can occasionally be palpated; such patients are also cyanotic.

         S1 is produced by closure of the AV valves and corresponds to the QRS complex on the electrocardiogram (ECG). S1 is usually a single sound but, occasionally, is split if the mitral and tricuspid valves close at slightly different times. A split S1 can be a normal variation and also can occur in patients with right bundle branch block due to delayed closure of the tricuspid valve.
        </p>
        <p>
         A split S1, if present, is usually more prominent at the left lower sternal border (tricuspid valve area) than the apex (mitral valve area). A perceived "split S1" that is more prominent at the apex may instead represent an early systolic ejection click produced by a bicuspid aortic valve  (

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The intensity of S1 is increased when the valves close at greater velocity (eg, high-output states) or when there is greater excursion of valve leaflets (eg, short PR interval, mild mitral stenosis) since the elevated atrial pressure maintains a more open valve position. The intensity of S1 is decreased in low output states, mitral regurgitation due to failure of valve coaptation, and decreased valve excursion (long PR interval, severe mitral stenosis, elevated ventricular end-diastolic pressure) [

          Splitting
         </strong>
         – The aortic and pulmonary valve components of S2 normally vary with the respiratory cycle, being split in inspiration and single in expiration  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104781" href="/z/d/graphic/104781.html" rel="external">
          movie 2
         </a>
         ). Physiologic splitting of S2 occurs due to decreased intrathoracic pressure during inspiration resulting in increased venous return to the right side of the heart, which in turn prolongs right ventricular systole and delays closure of the pulmonary valve (P2) [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Effects of inspiration on the left side of the heart are the opposite; pulmonary venous return decreases, left ventricular systole is shortened, and aortic valve closure (A2) occurs earlier. The normal split of S2 in inspiration is approximately 0.05 seconds. During expiration, intrathoracic pressure returns to baseline and the semilunar valves closure is perceived as a single sound. In children &gt;3 years of age, the examiner can detect the physiologic split of S2 by focusing attention on expiration. In infants and younger children whose respiratory rate and heart rate are faster, usually the best an examiner can do is to note variability in S2 with some beats being single and others split without specifically correlating the findings with the respiratory cycle.

         Wide splitting – In conditions that delay closure of the pulmonary valve, S2 is widely split but still varies during the respiratory cycle. These conditions include pulmonary valve stenosis, idiopathic dilation of the main pulmonary artery, and delayed electrical activation of the right ventricle as occurs with right bundle branch block  (

         Fixed splitting – S2 is widely split and fixed throughout the respiratory cycle in conditions associated with right ventricular volume overload, the most common of which is atrial septal defect (ASD)  (

         Paradoxical splitting – This feature is uncommon in the first decade of life and is associated with delayed closure of the aortic valve that occurs with left bundle branch block. In such patients, in expiration, the aortic valve closes after the pulmonary valve; in inspiration, the effects on systemic and pulmonary venous return outlined with normal patients produce a single S2. Occasionally, patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) can also have this feature. (See

         <strong>
          Intensity
         </strong>
         – The intensity of S2 depends on the pressure that closes the valve. After the neonatal transition period, the systolic pulmonary pressure is approximately one-fifth that of the systemic circulation. As a result, the pressure that closes the pulmonary valve is low and the pulmonary component of S2 is normally soft.

         Reduced intensity – In patients with semilunar valve stenosis (aortic or pulmonary), the excursion of the affected valve is reduced and its closure sound is softened.

         Increased intensity – In patients with pulmonary artery hypertension, the pulmonary valve closes both under high pressure and earlier since the elevated diastolic pressure in the pulmonary artery exceeds ventricular diastolic pressure sooner. This produces a loud pulmonic component to S2  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104785" href="/z/d/graphic/104785.html" rel="external">
          movie 5
         </a>
         ). The pulmonary valve is typically the most anterior of the four valves and is located in the immediate retrosternal region at the left upper sternal border. If the pulmonary component of S2 occurs close enough to the aortic component, S2 will be perceived as a single loud sound.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Patients with systemic arterial hypertension have an increased intensity of the aortic component of S2; since the aortic valve is positioned more posteriorly, this feature is not as apparent as the prominent pulmonary component in patients with pulmonary hypertension. Some forms of congenital heart disease are associated with an anteriorly positioned aorta (transposition or malposition of the great arteries) or a single semilunar valve (aortic atresia, pulmonary atresia); in such patients, S2 will be single and usually prominent.

This sound produces a cadence of "Ken-tuc-ky," with "Ken" representing S1, "tuc" representing S2, and "ky" representing S3. S3 can be generated by flow entering either ventricle and is heard best at the site of the corresponding AV valve (apex for the left ventricle and left lower sternal border for the right ventricle).

         S4 is always a pathologic finding. S4 occurs in late diastole during the atrial contraction phase and is coincident with the P wave on the ECG. It is best heard with the bell of the stethoscope. S4 is produced by turbulence as blood enters a stiff ventricle and occurs with myocardial dysfunction or ventricular hypertrophy (eg, systemic hypertension  (

          Ejection click
         </strong>
         – Ejection clicks are sharp, brief, high-frequency sounds that have a different quality from S1 and S2. They are usually produced by abnormal valves. By noting the timing and location on the precordium, the source of the click can be determined  (

         ). The mid or late systolic apical click associated with mitral valve prolapse may be associated with a murmur of mitral regurgitation that is more easily heard when the patient is standing rather than sitting or supine because of increased prolapse that occurs with reduced left ventricular volume in a more upright posture  (

The early systolic click associated with valvar pulmonary stenosis is best heard at the left upper sternal border and is variable, becoming softer in inspiration due to decreased excursion of the stenotic valve leaflets  (

          Pericardial friction rub
         </strong>
         – A pericardial friction rub occurs with pericarditis and is a grating sound similar to rubbing two pieces of sandpaper together. It is created when inflamed pericardial and visceral pericardial surfaces rub together and is therefore absent with a large pericardial effusion. It is louder when the patient sits up and leans forward, usually has inspiratory accentuation, can be present throughout all phases of the cardiac cycle, and is loudest along the left sternal border  (

If the coarctation is longstanding and severe, collateral arteries develop and produce a continuous murmur in the lateral region of the chest. Large AVMs produce continuous murmurs in the affected region; relatively common sites include the cranium in patients with vein of Galen malformation, and the right upper quadrant in patients with a hepatic lesion.

         In order to assess the likelihood of cardiac disease in a child with a heart murmur, the components of the physical examination must be considered together. The location and timing of the murmur may suggest certain diagnostic possibilities, and additional findings (eg, second heart sound [S2] splitting, clicks, radiation, gallop rhythm) provide further clues as to the etiology of the murmur and the severity of the lesion. A stepwise approach is helpful. Examples of commonly encountered scenarios include:

          Introduction
         </strong>
         – Heart murmurs are common in infants and children, but only a minority of patients with murmurs have heart disease. The association of murmurs with heart disease is higher in infants and decreases with age during childhood and adolescence. Being able to distinguish a murmur associated with heart disease from a benign etiology is important for diagnosis and management. (See

          History
         </strong>
         – In reviewing the history of an infant or child with a heart murmur, it is helpful to consider the prenatal history (including maternal conditions and whether fetal echocardiography was performed during the pregnancy)  (

         ), the family history (particularly, history of congenital heart disease), whether the child has a genetic syndrome or other congenital anomaly  (

          Physical examination
         </strong>
         – The physical examination should include careful review of the vital signs and a detailed cardiovascular examination, including assessment of heart rate and rhythm; assessment of pulses; and inspection, palpation, and auscultation of the chest. (See

          Synthesizing the findings
         </strong>
         – In order to assess the likelihood of cardiac disease in a child with a heart murmur, the components of the physical examination must be considered together. The location and timing of the murmur may suggest certain diagnostic possibilities, and additional findings (eg, S2 splitting, clicks, radiation, gallop rhythm) provide further clues as to the etiology of the murmur and the severity of the lesion. A stepwise approach is helpful, as shown in the figures outlining the approach for a systolic ejection murmur (SEM) at the left upper sternal border  (
