Among children and skeletally immature adolescents with emergent foot conditions, injuries to the bone are more common than to the ligaments. In ambulatory settings, common musculoskeletal causes of foot pain in children and adolescents include calcaneal apophysitis (Sever disease) and pes planus (flatfoot). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6521.html" rel="external">"Forefoot and midfoot pain in the active child or skeletally immature adolescent: Overview of causes"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6522.html" rel="external">"Heel pain in the active child or skeletally immature adolescent: Overview of causes"</a>.)</p><p>Although foot injuries may occur during many types of sports or recreation, activities frequently associated with foot pain and injury include long-distance running, volleyball, dancing (especially ballet), and rock climbing [<a href="#rid2">2-5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">ANATOMY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H972207"><span class="h2">Bones</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The foot has 28 bones, including 14 phalanges, 7 tarsal bones (talus, calcaneus, cuboid, navicular, and 3 cuneiforms), 5 metatarsals, and 2 sesamoids [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Accessory ossicles are normal variants that are commonly present (5 to 30 percent) in the foot and ankle, usually asymptomatic, and usually well-corticated bones formed by unfused secondary ossification centers [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>The foot can be divided into three functional parts that are defined by the articulations proximally and distally as follows  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52540" href="/z/d/graphic/52540.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hindfoot</strong> – The hindfoot consists of the talus and the calcaneus. Proximally, the ankle mortise connects the tibialis/fibula complex to the superior talus. And the distal portion of the talus and calcaneus connects to the midfoot at the midtarsal (Chopart) joint. The os trigonum is the most common accessory ossicle in the foot (25 to 30 percent) that is located at the posterior lateral process of the talus.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Midfoot</strong> – The midfoot contains the navicular, the cuboid, and the three cuneiform bones. The bones of the midfoot connect to the proximal metatarsals at the Lisfranc joint. The os naviculare is the most common accessory ossicle on the medial aspect of the midfoot (4 to 20 percent) that is located just medial and proximal to the navicular tuberosity. The os peroneum occurs on the lateral midfoot at the level of the cuboid and is usually embedded in the fibularis (peroneus) longus tendon.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Forefoot</strong> – The forefoot includes everything distal to the Lisfranc joint, including the metatarsals, sesamoids, and phalanges.

The dome of the talus fits snugly into the tibia and fibula  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef93194" href="/z/d/graphic/93194.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). The primary plane of movement at the ankle joint is plantarflexion/dorsiflexion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Subtalar joint</strong> – The subtalar joint is composed of the anterior, middle, and posterior articulations between the talus and the calcaneus. They are separated laterally by the sinus tarsi and medially by the tarsal canal. The subtalar joint is responsible for hindfoot inversion/eversion and abduction/adduction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Midtarsal (Chopart) joint</strong> – The talonavicular and calcaneocuboid articulations are responsible for "unlocking" the midfoot during subtalar pronation, allowing the foot to absorb more shock, and for "locking" the midfoot during subtalar supination, allowing the foot to become a rigid lever for propulsion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Midfoot (Lisfranc) joint</strong> – The midfoot or Lisfranc joint provides rigid stability to optimize efficiency through the medial column of the foot.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>First metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint</strong> – The first MTP is a complex joint that includes the two sesamoids, supporting ligaments, plantar plate, and muscles (flexor halluces longus, ab- and adductor hallucis); it is essential to the propulsion phase of gait.

The deltoid ligament is a relatively strong group of ligaments all originating from the medial malleolus that are organized into a deep and a superficial component.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The deep component (anterior and posterior tibiotalar ligaments) stabilizes the talus against posterior and lateral translation and eversion forces. The superficial components (tibia to calcaneus, spring ligament, and navicular) provide stability to the calcaneal navicular complex and prevent external rotation of the talus.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The spring ligament (three components) originates from the sustentaculum tali of the calcaneus and insert on the navicular providing support medially and inferiorly to the neck/head of the talus.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tibiofibular ligament complex</strong> – The tibiofibular complex consists of the anterior and posterior tibiofibular and the interosseous membrane and ligament  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66189" href="/z/d/graphic/66189.html" rel="external">figure 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72462" href="/z/d/graphic/72462.html" rel="external">figure 3A</a>). This complex is responsible for maintaining the relationship between the distal tibia and fibula and preventing them from splaying apart with a cephalad force from the talus.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lisfranc ligament complex </strong>–<strong> </strong>The Lisfranc ligament complex is very important to midfoot stability and maintaining the transverse arch of the foot. The three components of the complex (dorsal, interosseous, and plantar) connects the lateral portion of the medial cuneiform to the medial portion of the proximal second metatarsal  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103035" href="/z/d/graphic/103035.html" rel="external">figure 5</a>).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H972225"><span class="h2">Plantar fascia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The plantar fascia is the primary aponeurosis that originates on the plantar aspect of the calcaneus and fans out to attach to the base of each of the five metatarsal heads  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61931" href="/z/d/graphic/61931.html" rel="external">figure 6</a>). It acts to reinforce the medial arch during the propulsion phase of gait. Its impact on the medial longitudinal arch is important to the biomechanics of the foot during the toe-off phase.

The extrinsic muscles permit the larger force-generating muscles to be located away from the foot and to avoid interference with the intrinsic structure of the foot  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54716" href="/z/d/graphic/54716.html" rel="external">figure 7</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71142" href="/z/d/graphic/71142.html" rel="external">figure 8</a>).</p><p>The extrinsic muscles are organized into four fascial compartments that are anatomically important to compartment syndromes  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68629" href="/z/d/graphic/68629.html" rel="external">figure 9</a>). Each compartment has a nerve that may cause classic neurologic symptoms in the foot if the compartment pressure is elevated. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/358.html" rel="external">"Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities", section on 'Anatomic compartments and related clinical signs'</a>.)</p><p>The anterior or extensor compartment of the leg includes the following muscles and the deep fibular (peroneal) nerve [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The tibialis anterior originates on the proximal anterior tibia and courses distally in its synovial sheath beneath the extensor retinaculum to insert on both the medial cuneiform and the medial base of the first metatarsal.

The peroneus longus inserts on the base of the first metatarsal bone and medial cuneiform bone and acts to evert the foot and weakly plantarflex it  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93699" href="/z/d/graphic/93699.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). The peroneus brevis inserts on the base of the fifth metatarsal  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93702" href="/z/d/graphic/93702.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) and has the same action as does the peroneus longus.</p><p>The superficial posterior compartment of the leg contains the sural nerve and the triceps surae (the gastrocnemius and soleus complex), which insert via the Achilles tendon into the posterior surface of the calcaneus  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91480" href="/z/d/graphic/91480.html" rel="external">picture 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91479" href="/z/d/graphic/91479.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>). They are the force generators that plantarflex the foot and weakly evert the heel.</p><p>The deep posterior compartment of the leg contains the tibial nerve and the tibialis posterior (TP), flexor digitorum longus (FDL), and flexor hallucis longus (FHL) muscles. The tendinous portion of these muscles are located in the tarsal tunnel (with the posterior tibial artery, vein, and nerve) as they all pass inferior to the medial malleolus.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The TP inserts on the tuberosity of the navicular bone, along with additional insertion points on the three cuneiforms, and the base of the second, third, and fourth metatarsal bones  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93703" href="/z/d/graphic/93703.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>).

The dorsalis pedis artery is a continuation of the anterior tibial artery that crosses the anterior joint line of the ankle just deep to the extensor hallucis longus [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. As the artery proceeds down the long axis of the foot to the proximal first intermetatarsal space, it divides into a deep plantar artery and an arcuate artery that sends off branches to each of the toes.</p><p>The arteries in the sole of the foot are derived from the posterior tibial artery and form the medial and lateral plantar arteries. The lateral plantar branch sends off branches through the plantar arterial arch, which anastomoses with the deep plantar artery for the dorsalis pedis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H972243"><span class="h2">Nerves</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The common fibular (peroneal) and tibial nerves are the two major divisions of the sciatic nerve that branch just above the knee  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83190" href="/z/d/graphic/83190.html" rel="external">picture 8</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The common fibular (peroneal) nerve is the nerve that is injured most often in the lower limb  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76717" href="/z/d/graphic/76717.html" rel="external">figure 11</a>). Severance of this nerve causes a foot drop because of the paralysis of the dorsiflexion and eversion muscles of the foot.</p><p>The common fibular (peroneal) nerve splits into a superficial and deep branches just distal to the fibular head [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The superficial branch provides sensation to the lateral aspect of the dorsum of the foot and innervates the fibularis (peroneal) brevis and longus (hindfoot evertors). The deep branch provides sensation to the interdigital space between the first and second toe and is responsible for dorsiflexing the ankle and toes. The tibial nerve proceeds posterior to the medial malleolus and becomes the medial and lateral plantar nerves. The tibial and fibular (peroneal) nerves give off branches that form the sural nerve, which supplies sensation to the lateral aspect of the ankle and foot.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1908344721"><span class="h2">Veins</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The major veins of the lower leg and foot consist of the great saphenous vein, medal and lateral marginal veins of the foot, and the dorsal venous arch  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73200" href="/z/d/graphic/73200.html" rel="external">figure 12</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h1">BIOMECHANICS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In addition to the structural divisions discussed above, the foot can be divided into two functional columns: medial and lateral [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The medial column, consisting of the calcaneus, talus, navicular, medial cuneiforms, and medial three toes, forms the medial longitudinal arch and is the main axis for weightbearing and propulsion. The lateral column, consisting of the calcaneus, cuboid, and lateral two toes, forms the lateral longitudinal arch and is the main axis for proprioception.</p><p>A review of the gait cycle is helpful in understanding the complex movements of the foot that occur during walking and running. The subtalar movement controls the locking and unlocking of the midtarsal joints and determines the actions of the forefoot. These coupled motions of the foot allow it to perform its various functions [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Pronation, which provides maximum shock absorption, occurs when the tibia internally rotates, the talus adducts and dorsiflexes, and the calcaneus everts. Supination, which converts the foot into a rigid lever, occurs when the tibia externally rotates, the talus abducts and plantarflexes, and the calcaneus inverts.</p><p>The gait cycle has four phases  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53103" href="/z/d/graphic/53103.html" rel="external">figure 13</a>) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Heel-strike to foot-flat (contact)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Foot-flat to heel-off (midstance)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Heel-off to toe-off (propulsion)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Toe-off to heel-strike (swing)</p><p></p><p>Detailed description of these phases is as follows [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Contact</strong> – In the contact phase, the lateral calcaneus strikes the ground. At the point of impact, the tibia internally rotates, causing the calcaneus to evert and talus to drop and adduct to unlock the midtarsal joints and provide maximum shock absorption. The foot is lowered eccentrically to the ground by the extensor digitorum longus and tibialis anterior. In runners who contact the ground with their midfoot or forefoot, they will get into midstance quicker, pronate earlier, and load the Achilles more with less impact of the lower extremity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mid-stance</strong> – In the midstance phase, the cycle progresses from the flat-foot to the heel-off. As the rearfoot fully pronates, the metatarsals hit the ground to bring the foot flat on the ground. The body's center of gravity passes from behind to over the foot. During this phase, the subtalar joint resupinates (calcaneus everts and talus abducts) and locks the midtarsal joints, transforming the foot from a shock absorber to a rigid lever. The posterior tibialis is an important restraint to overpronation and is an active foot supinator. As the body passes over the mid-foot, it places the ankle in maximal dorsiflexion, putting a maximal preload on the gastrocnemius-soleus complex.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Propulsion</strong> – In the propulsion phase, the heel-lift progresses to toe-off. As the heel rises, the body continues forward over the metatarsals and begins to pull the heel off the ground. The extension of the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints, especially the first MTP joint, result in the windlass effect of the plantar fascia that elevates the arch and further assists in the supination of the foot. The foot is now a rigid lever and is used to propel the body forward by maximal contraction of the gastrocnemius-soleus and hamstrings. At toe-off, the line of progression usually passes between the first and second metatarsal that are in maximal extension. This phase concludes with the body weight moving over the great toe at toe-off.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Swing</strong> – The swing phase is the last phase of the gait cycle. The foot dorsiflexes to keep the toes from hitting the ground and supinates to position the foot for the lateral calcaneus to make contact at heel strike, and the cycle repeats itself  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53103" href="/z/d/graphic/53103.html" rel="external">figure 13</a>).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A careful history and physical examination can establish a working diagnosis in most children or adolescents with foot or ankle pain or injury.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The problems relating to the foot and ankle can be divided into acute and chronic.</p><p>The pertinent history related to specific injuries is discussed in detail separately.
