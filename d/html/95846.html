         Pediatric shoulder injuries are very common. Among active children and adolescents, the incidence of shoulder injuries increases as the participation in overhead activities such as baseball and volleyball rises. Among high school athletes in the United States, the overall rate of shoulder injuries is approximately 2.2 injuries per 10,000 athletic exposures (one athlete participating in one practice or competition) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Strains and sprains are most common, followed by shoulder separations or dislocations. Despite the risk for traumatic shoulder injury during any competitive activity, the greatest risk for shoulder injury requiring intervention occurs during contact sports such as football, wrestling, and rugby [

         </span>
         A complex network of anatomic structures endows the human shoulder with tremendous mobility, greater than any other joint in the body. The shoulder girdle is composed of three bones (the clavicle, scapula, and proximal humerus) and four articular surfaces (sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular [AC], glenohumeral, and scapulothoracic)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72709 graphicRef54102 graphicRef69995" href="/z/d/graphic/72709.html" rel="external">
          figure 1A-C
         </a>
         ). The glenohumeral joint, commonly referred to as the shoulder joint, is the principal articulation. The shoulder is an inherently unstable joint that relies on several delicate interactions to minimize the risk for injury. The shape and interaction of the bones and soft tissues of the shoulder girdle are essential to understanding the factors leading to shoulder stability and to identify injury.

          Glenohumeral structures
         </strong>
         <strong>
          –
         </strong>
         The glenohumeral joint is loosely constrained within a thin capsule bounded by surrounding muscles and ligaments  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72709 graphicRef54102 graphicRef69995" href="/z/d/graphic/72709.html" rel="external">

          table 1
         </a>
         ). The shoulder's great mobility is due in large part to the shallow depth of the glenoid and the limited contact between the glenoid and the humeral head. Only 25 percent of the humeral head surface makes contact with the glenoid. The labrum, a fibrocartilaginous ring attached to the outer rim of the glenoid, provides some additional depth and stability [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. It also serves as a bumper to decrease the potential for humeral head subluxation. The shallowness and small surface area of the glenohumeral joint make it susceptible to instability and injury and require that stability be provided primarily by extrinsic supports.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Surrounding muscles and ligaments provide these supports:

         The glenohumeral ligaments are collagenous reinforcement of the capsule and quite variable in their thickness, anatomic position, and their contribution to shoulder stability  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54102" href="/z/d/graphic/54102.html" rel="external">
          figure 1B
         </a>
         ). The glenohumeral ligaments serve as the primary static stabilizer [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-7
         </a>
         ].

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         The inferior glenohumeral ligament complex (IGHL) is made up of the anterior and posterior bands and the posterior axillary pouch that form a hammock like structure. In abduction and external rotation, the anterior band is the primary restraint to anterior translation of the humeral head [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ].

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         In the absence of the anterior IGHL, the middle glenohumeral ligament may provide some restraint to anterior humeral translation [

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         In the flexion and internal rotation, the posterior band of the IGHL and the posterior capsule are the primary restraints for posterior movement (translation) of the humeral head relative to the glenoid [

          6

         The rotator cuff serves as the primary dynamic stabilizer. The rotator cuff is composed of four muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, and teres minor) that form a cuff around the head of the humerus, to which these muscles attach  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72027" href="/z/d/graphic/72027.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). The rotator cuff compresses the humoral head in the glenoid fossa, thereby stabilizing the glenohumeral joint, and serves to counterbalance the elevating forces of the deltoid, as well as the forces of other muscles acting on the humerus. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/238.html" rel="external">

          Other structures
         </strong>
         – The clavicle serves as a strut attaching the upper extremity to the axial skeleton through the AC and sternoclavicular joints and the scapulothoracic articulation  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72709 graphicRef54102 graphicRef69995" href="/z/d/graphic/72709.html" rel="external">
          figure 1A-C
         </a>
         ). The function of the clavicle includes supporting the weight of the arm, providing additional dynamic mobility to the arm, and transferring force from the arm to the rest of the skeleton.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The sternoclavicular joint has the least amount of bony stability of the major joints of the body, but paradoxically bears the responsibility of being the only true articulation between the upper extremity and the axial skeleton. The convex articular surface of the clavicle is much larger than the curved notch of the sternum resulting in an incongruous mismatch. Despite this instability, dislocation at this joint is rare. Both bones are covered with thick fibrocartilage (not the usual hyaline cartilage) and are separated by an intervening fibrocartilage disk which provide added cushion to the joint.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The muscles primarily responsible for scapular stability and motion are the trapezius, serratus anterior, rhomboids, and levator scapulae  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50894" href="/z/d/graphic/50894.html" rel="external">
          figure 3

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The AC joint is supported by ligaments that span its anterior, superior, posterior, and inferior aspects  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62016" href="/z/d/graphic/62016.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). These ligaments also envelop the distal 1 to 2 cm of the clavicle. In addition to the AC ligaments, the distal clavicle is held in alignment with the acromion by the strong coracoclavicular (CC) ligaments. These ligaments consist of the conoid ligament medially and the trapezoid ligament laterally.

          Bony development
         </strong>
         – As a general rule, the bones that form the shoulder girdle (ie, scapula, humerus, and clavicle) are not fully ossified in children and young adolescents  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef83709" href="/z/d/graphic/83709.html" rel="external">

         <a href="#rid8">
          8-15
         </a>
         ]. Thus, the skeletally immature athlete has open epiphyses that are two to five times weaker than the surrounding soft tissues and are prone to fracture.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In some patients, skeletal immaturity or variation in ossification can lead to misdiagnosis because these injuries are not the same as seen in adults. A few examples include:

         A routine history will aid in the diagnosis of shoulder pain. Understanding the location of pain and mechanism of injury will further guide the physical examination to confirm the diagnosis. Pain with shoulder movement, limited range of motion, and decreased strength compared with the unaffected side suggest intrinsic shoulder pathology. Referred pain to the shoulder is possible with more serious injuries such as abdominal, cardiac, and cervical spine pathology.

          Sternoclavicular injury

         – The most common mechanism is an indirect force on the anterolateral or posterolateral shoulder. Less commonly, injuries may also result from direct trauma (eg, misplaced kick to the medial clavicle and sternum during soccer or mixed martial arts competition or a helmet blow during American football). Patients will describe anterior shoulder or chest pain. Posterior sternoclavicular dislocations may present with patients complaining of dyspnea, dysphagia, or hoarseness. (See

         <strong>
          Clavicular injury
         </strong>
         – The mechanism of injury most commonly consists of a fall onto the point of the shoulder but may include a fall onto outstretched arm or direct trauma. Clavicle fractures often occur in the middle third of the shaft. Focal tenderness and swelling are common following injury. Often a snapping or cracking sensation will be described at time of injury. Patients will also complain of worsening pain with shoulder movement. (See

         – High-energy direct trauma and falls onto an outstretched hand can cause proximal humerus fractures. Most common is a history of falling backwards on an outstretched arm. Patients will describe pain and swelling of the shoulder. Pain is often diffuse but may localize over the greater tuberosity. They will present with their arm adducted and held tightly against their chest to minimize movement. They may also describe decreased sensation along the axillary nerve distribution (skin over the lateral shoulder ["shoulder badge" distribution]). (See

          Glenohumeral dislocation, subluxation, and instability
         </strong>
         – Although more common in skeletally mature adolescents and rare in children younger than 12 years of age, anterior and posterior glenohumeral dislocations may still occur in children. Clinicians considering a glenohumeral injury in a child younger than 12 years of age should also assess for the more likely possibilities of a clavicular fracture or proximal humeral fracture. Anterior dislocations typically follow a force to the abducted, externally rotated and extended arm, force to the posterior shoulder, or a fall on an outstretched hand (eg, blocking a basketball shot or arm tackling in American football). Posterior shoulder dislocations result following force to the anterior shoulder or axial loading of an adducted and internally rotated arm (eg, lineman blocking in American football). In either case patients will present with severe shoulder pain and limited movement. Shoulder subluxation and instability often present with similar findings to shoulder dislocations. (See

         In all traumatized adolescents and children presenting with shoulder pain, begin with a neck examination to ensure there is no serious life-threatening injury. Patients with a concern for neck injury should undergo cervical spinal motion restriction (immobilization) before further examination. There should be no focal tenderness or neurologic deficit before proceeding to the shoulder exam.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pain can limit the physical examination and therefore, should be adequately controlled. (See

          Proximal humerus fracture
         </strong>
         – Pain, swelling, and tenderness of the proximal humerus will be noted on physical exam. Crepitus may also be present. Patients will often self-splint the injured extremity and have limited active range of motion on examination. Ecchymosis may be visible and can spread to the distal extremity, chest wall, or flank. Range of motion at the elbow should be normal. No neurovascular deficits should be identified unless the axillary nerve is affected, in which case one may detect decreased sensation over the deltoid. Both traumatic and pathologic proximal humeral fractures are identified by plain radiographs of the proximal humerus. (See

         Findings of proximal humeral osteolysis (Little League shoulder) – Best seen on AP views of the shoulder with the arm in external rotation. Widening may be subtle and may be seen in asymptomatic patients. Thus, clinical correlation is necessary  (

         Pain with shoulder movement, limited range of motion, and decreased strength compared with the unaffected side suggest intrinsic shoulder pathology. Normal shoulder examination despite significant pain suggests referred pain caused by more serious injuries such as abdominal, cardiac, or cervical spine pathology.
        </p>
        <p>
         The patient is initially evaluated for neurovascular injury, paresthesia, or weakness. If any of these are positive, the cervical spine should be immobilized until a thorough evaluation can be performed. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6516.html" rel="external">
          "Evaluation of the child or adolescent athlete with neck pain or injury"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         A cervical spine injury should be suspected with major mechanisms of injury (eg, motor vehicle collision or fall from height), given pain is often referred to the shoulder. Myocardial injury and abdominal hemorrhage may also cause referred pain to the shoulder and should be ruled out if there is an abnormal neurovascular assessment. If no blunt trauma to these regions is identified, then further evaluation for the etiology of isolated shoulder pain is warranted.
        </p>
        <p>
         The location of shoulder pain should be identified and plain film radiographs obtained in patients with significant pain or restriction of motion  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114742" href="/z/d/graphic/114742.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Abnormal radiographs related to trauma include fractures of the clavicle, humerus, or scapula. Dislocations of the glenohumeral, acromioclavicular (AC), or sternoclavicular joint will also result from a traumatic mechanism of injury and present with abnormal plain films.
        </p>
        <p>
         If radiographs are abnormal without associated trauma, the shoulder pain is due to a pathologic fracture, clavicular osteolysis, clavicular pseudoarthrosis, or malignancy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13885.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with normal plain radiographs, the clinician proceeds to provocative testing. A suggested approach is as follows:

         <span class="glyph">

         For patients with a negative apprehension test, palpate the biceps tendon in the bicipital groove. If tenderness is present, then biceps tendonitis is confirmed. Speed test  (

         Patients with normal radiographs and normal provocative testing most likely have a contusion or, if the cross body adduction test is positive, an AC sprain or Salter-Harris type I fracture. However, the clinician should also reassess to ensure no findings of abdominal, neck, or myocardial trauma are present and causing referred pain.

          Clinical anatomy
         </strong>
         – Knowledge of clinical anatomy of the shoulder is essential to identifying shoulder injuries and recognizing referred pain arising from other regions. The shoulder girdle is composed of three bones (the clavicle, scapula, and proximal humerus) and four articular surfaces (sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular, glenohumeral, and scapulothoracic)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72709 graphicRef54102 graphicRef69995" href="/z/d/graphic/72709.html" rel="external">
          figure 1A-C
         </a>
         ). The glenohumeral joint, commonly referred to as the shoulder joint, is the principal articulation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical anatomy'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The bones that form the shoulder girdle (ie, scapula, humerus, and clavicle) are typically not fully ossified in children and young adolescents  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef83709" href="/z/d/graphic/83709.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). Thus, the skeletally immature athlete has open epiphyses that are two to five times weaker than the surrounding soft tissues and are prone to fracture. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical anatomy'

          Evaluation
         </strong>
         – In all traumatized adolescents and children presenting with shoulder pain, begin with a neck examination and assessment of airway, breathing, circulation, and neurologic status. (See

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Once multiple trauma is excluded, the location of pain and mechanism of injury helps to narrow the differential diagnosis of acute traumatic shoulder injury and focus the evaluation  (
