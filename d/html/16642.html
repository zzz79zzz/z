As a result, it is imperative that the choice of therapy be diagnostically driven as well as developmentally appropriate.</p><p>The vast majority of sleep disturbances in children and adolescents are appropriately managed with behavioral therapy alone, and behavioral interventions should be considered first-line therapy, as has been recommended for adults [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. However, in a limited number of clinical situations, pharmacologic intervention may be appropriate for management of the child or adolescent with significant difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep, as long as a number of important caveats are taken into consideration.</p><p>A general approach to making decisions about pharmacotherapy for sleep in children is outlined below, followed by a brief summary of the main considerations for individual medications. Related information is included in other UpToDate topics:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6357.html" rel="external">"Assessment of sleep disorders in children"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6353.html" rel="external">"Behavioral sleep problems in children"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97875.html" rel="external">"Sleep in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97867.html" rel="external">"Overview of the treatment of insomnia in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2609073293"><span class="h1">GENERAL APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Decisions about the use of pharmacotherapy for insomnia in children are informed by several considerations:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Efficacy</strong> – Little empirical evidence exists on effectiveness of these drugs in children. Only a few randomized controlled trials have been performed in children; most have demonstrated no or little efficacy and were conducted in highly selected patients, such as children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism. Most of the information available regarding use of these medications in children is from case reports or small case series, extrapolated from adult data, or reflects clinical experience.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Side effects</strong> – Potential short- and long-term side effects should be considered, including effects on sleep architecture and daytime drowsiness, as well as recurrence or even exacerbation (ie, rebound) of pretreatment insomnia symptoms following discontinuation of medication.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Safety</strong> – Unfortunately, the safety profile of sleep medications remains one of the most poorly researched areas in pediatric psychopharmacology. A specific concern is the risk of accidental overdose.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ethical considerations</strong> – When the risk/benefit profile of a medication is unclear, ethical concerns are particularly important. These include the possibility that medication will replace or detract from a safer or more effective behavioral intervention. This concern is sometimes characterized as "medicating a parenting problem" and giving the "wrong message" (ie, "take a pill if you can't sleep") to families and caregivers about management of sleep issues.</p><p></p><p>Despite these considerations, there is clearly a perceived need for safe and effective ways to improve sleep in children, as prescribing or recommending sedatives and hypnotics for sleep complaints is quite common among child health professionals, including pediatricians, family practitioners, and child psychiatrists in the United States, Canada, and Europe [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>].</p><p>In particular, use of the exogenous synthetic hormone melatonin has risen dramatically in the United States during the past decade, likely because it is a nonprescription drug and is often perceived as "safe" and "natural" (see <a class="local">'Melatonin'</a> below). However, even the use of relatively "benign" medications such as melatonin may be counterproductive if this practice supplants the use of more effective and long-lasting behavioral treatments. Moreover, the long-term efficacy and side effects of melatonin administered in childhood remain poorly understood due to the limited number and variable quality of pediatric randomized controlled trials [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>Thus, decisions to initiate pharmacotherapy, including melatonin, should be undertaken thoughtfully, as outlined below. Consideration of pharmacotherapy for sleep should include each of the following steps:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1268035525"><span class="h2">Pretreatment evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The first step is rigorous diagnostic assessment of the child's sleep problem. The diagnostic evaluation is discussed in detail elsewhere (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6357.html" rel="external">"Assessment of sleep disorders in children"</a>). Important elements include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Assessment of behavioral contributors</strong> – This is important because behavioral contributors are common and are amenable to behavioral interventions. They may be the primary problem or may exacerbate and perpetuate other sleep disorders. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6353.html" rel="external">"Behavioral sleep problems in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Screening for primary sleep disorders</strong> – Primary sleep disorders include obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and restless legs syndrome (RLS). Identifying these disorders is critical because they would each warrant specific treatment; screening should include at minimum a focused history and examination. In addition, pharmacologic treatment of insomnia could potentially exacerbate coexisting sleep problems. For example, children with OSA are at risk for adverse effects from sedative medications that cause respiratory depression or from other medications that may cause significant weight gain. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16995.html" rel="external">"Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6363.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of suspected obstructive sleep apnea in children"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation of the impact of the sleep disturbance</strong> on the child's health and daily functioning – This includes careful assessment for possible neurobehavioral signs of daytime sleepiness (eg, mood changes, attention problems, impulsivity, poor school performance). Children experiencing significant problems with daytime function may be more likely to benefit from targeted intervention such as behavioral therapy or pharmacotherapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Psychosocial evaluation of the family</strong> – This includes the impact of the sleep disturbance on other family members and consideration of other variables that might impact medication choice and adherence. Such variables may include educational level, parenting skills and style, household composition, parental stress level and caregiver exhaustion, access to medications and other safety considerations, and previous experience with and acceptability of pharmacologic treatment. For example, situations arise, albeit relatively rarely, in which families are so exhausted and overwhelmed by a child's sleep problems that concerns about both safety and parental mental health are warranted.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H252556494"><span class="h2">Psychoeducation of the family</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Important elements include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>A simple explanation of the basics of sleep regulation</strong> – Points should include the role of the sleep drive and predictable 24-hour circadian patterns of relative alertness and sleepiness, including the so-called "forbidden zone" or "second wind" phenomenon involving a surge in circadian alertness in the hour or so before the natural fall asleep time.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Multiple internal factors (such as hunger and boredom) and external factors (such as noise and light levels) can facilitate or inhibit sleep. Understanding these factors can often help caregivers and patients to appreciate the complexity of the sleep-wake system and recognize the importance of behavioral strategies as a complement to medication.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Education about appropriate and healthy sleep practices</strong> – Topics should include environmental measures, such as avoiding stimulation from electronics, ensuring low light levels, and providing a comfortable room temperature; sleep-wake scheduling; sleep practices such as establishment of a bedtime routine; and awareness of relevant physiology (for example, about caffeine use).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2651327259"><span class="h2">Treat behavioral contributors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The next step is to design and implement behavioral intervention to treat or optimize any behavioral contributors to the sleep problem. This means that medication should not be the first or sole treatment strategy. The plan should be tailored to the individual characteristics of the patient and family.</p><p>In most cases, behavioral interventions, including parenting strategies and attention to sleep hygiene, should be trialed before considering pharmacotherapy. In selected cases in which the sleep problem is causing significant child or family dysfunction, it may be appropriate to initiate pharmacotherapy at the same time as behavioral therapy. </p><p>Behavioral efforts should continue during and after pharmacotherapy, as they are important for long-term success. Data from adult treatment trials demonstrate that behavioral interventions produce durable, long-term improvement, whereas the efficacy of medications typically wanes following discontinuation of treatment. It is likely that a similar pattern applies in the pediatric population.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3709966725"><span class="h2">Individualize the decision about pharmacotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The decision about whether to initiate pharmacotherapy should be individualized, based on the above evaluation. Other key considerations include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Child's age</strong> – Pharmacotherapy is rarely appropriate for young children (&lt;5 years), except for unusual circumstances such as significant caregiver physical or mental health issues or risk of child abuse. This is because behavioral causes and interventions are particularly common in this age group and also because of the lack of safety and efficacy data in this age group.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acute versus chronic sleep problem</strong> – Children with underlying medical, psychiatric, or neurodevelopmental conditions, in comparison with otherwise healthy, typically developing children, are more likely to need longer-term pharmacotherapy to address sleep issues. For children with these comorbid conditions, it is particularly important to address behavioral issues and to select medications that are less likely to have long-term side effects.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3774419859"><span class="h2">Set treatment goals</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If pharmacotherapy is initiated, it is important to set clear and realistic treatment goals, in collaboration with the family and patient. The goals should be clearly defined, realistic, and measurable. As examples, goals might include sleep onset consistently less than 30 minutes, improvement in mood and attentiveness, or decrease in subjective distress for the caregiver or child about the insomnia.</p><p>The most realistic immediate goal of treatment may be to improve rather than eliminate sleep problems. Defining goals helps to set realistic expectations and avoid frustration. In addition, the goals can serve as milestones at which termination of medication should be considered.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H95607144"><span class="h2">Choice of medication and dosing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once the clinician and family have decided to initiate a trial of pharmacotherapy, the following should be considered:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Selection of the medication</strong> – This choice should be based on the clinician's judgment of the best match between the clinical circumstances (eg, type of sleep problem, patient characteristics, expected duration of therapy), the individual properties of currently available drugs (eg, onset of action, safety, and tolerability), and any comorbid disorders (eg, ADHD, anxiety, or depression). Specific considerations relating to the drugs used for management of ADHD are addressed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97875.html" rel="external">"Sleep in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder", section on 'Subsequent management'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The half-life and duration of action of the medication is particularly important and should be appropriate for the presenting complaint. For children with sleep onset problems, a shorter-acting medication is generally desirable, whereas for sleep maintenance problems, longer-acting medications may be considered, while at the same time minimizing morning residual sleepiness or persistent grogginess. The properties of the sedative and hypnotic drugs are outlined in the following sections and accompanying tables. (See <a class="local">'Nonprescription medications'</a> below and <a class="local">'Prescription insomnia drugs'</a> below and <a class="local">'Drugs used off-label for insomnia'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Safety considerations:</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Consider potential drug interactions when selecting and dosing the sleep medication. Concurrent medications may have pharmacodynamic interactions, as for sedative/hypnotics and opiates, or may have pharmacokinetic interactions, as for <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13236" href="/z/d/drug information/13236.html" rel="external">diphenhydramine</a> and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13315" href="/z/d/drug information/13315.html" rel="external">fluoxetine</a>, a CYP2D6 and 2C19 inhibitor. Potential interactions can be investigated with the <a class="external" href="/drug-interactions">drug interactions program</a> included with UpToDate.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Specifically inquire about concurrent use of nonprescription sleep medications such as Tylenol PM, melatonin, or herbal preparations, which are often initiated by parents or caregivers or by adolescent patients without consulting the clinician. While these medications are generally viewed by parents and caregivers as "safe," the potential drug–drug interactions between most herbal preparations and sedatives and hypnotics, as well as other medications, are largely unknown and thus pose a potential safety threat. Maintaining an open and nonjudgmental approach is key to optimal communication and allows for the development of more effective and appropriate treatment strategies in cooperation with the family.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Assess for risk factors for drug misuse or special adverse effects. Adolescents should be screened for alcohol and drug use (including prescription opioids), as well as pregnancy, prior to initiation of therapy as many recreational substances may have synergistic clinical effects when combined with sedatives and hypnotics.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>All sedative medications and supplements should be stored safely in locked containers out of the reach of children. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2873.html" rel="external">"Prevention of poisoning in children"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Dosing</strong> – The medication should be initiated at the lowest level likely to be effective and titrated up as necessary. This strategy is important because of the limited data on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties for hypnotic drugs in the pediatric population. For some medications (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13094" href="/z/d/drug information/13094.html" rel="external">zolpidem</a> [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]), evidence suggests that younger children may require higher dosing (per kg) compared with adults due to differences in metabolism. For some medications, this difference in metabolism results in a paradoxical reaction, in which a dose that is not adequate to induce sleep causes initial grogginess and, subsequently, agitation and disinhibition.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Timing</strong> – Drug administration should be tailored to the drug's onset of action and the target time of sleep onset. Because most hypnotic medications have their onset of action within 30 minutes of administration and peak within one to two hours, they should be administered shortly before bedtime for sleep-onset insomnia, eg, within 30 minutes of lights out. Giving the medication too early, eg, more than two hours before desired sleep onset, is less likely to be effective. The "forbidden zone" or "second wind" phenomenon mentioned above may also impact timing of sedating medication.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H633833102"><span class="h2">Anticipatory guidance</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Anticipatory guidance of the family includes:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Make a plan for potential modifications in dosing and timing of administration, depending on the child's response.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clarify whether medication is to be used on a nightly or "as needed" basis. If the latter, clear parameters should be established regarding if and when medication should be administered (eg, if the child is not asleep within 60 minutes of lights out).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Specifically discuss the issue of dose escalation to avoid inadvertent overdose. Some caregivers may assume that if "one pill doesn't work, then two (or three) might." This is particularly critical with drugs that have a narrow therapeutic index, such as <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13171" href="/z/d/drug information/13171.html" rel="external">clonidine</a>. In general, dose increases are best accomplished only after direct communication and consultation with the health care provider.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H999005248"><span class="h2">Duration of pharmacotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The duration of pharmacotherapy depends on the type of sleep problem and the child's response to medical and behavioral treatment.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In general, medications should also be used for the shortest possible duration. However, the goal of limiting drug exposure should be balanced by ensuring adequate duration of therapy to allow behavioral interventions to be successfully implemented.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoid abrupt discontinuation of sleep medication, especially for drugs with short and intermediate half-lives. Failure to wean sleep medications gradually may result in "rebound insomnia" and may also increase the likelihood of other sleep disorders. For example, abrupt discontinuation of sleep medications that are potent rapid eye movement (REM) sleep suppressants (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) may result in a compensatory increase (rebound) in REM sleep and a subsequent increase in REM sleep-related phenomena, such as nightmares.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H582183564"><span class="h1">DRUGS FOR INSOMNIA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In practice, a variety of nonprescription (over-the-counter) and prescription medications are used to treat pediatric insomnia by pediatric health care practitioners or are initiated by a child's parents or caregivers, often without medical guidance. However, little empirical evidence exists regarding the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of these medications in the pediatric population. Furthermore, no hypnotics or other medications are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of insomnia in children under the age of 16 years. Therefore, pharmacotherapy for insomnia in children is always an off-label use and should be approached with careful evaluation of the potential benefits, risks, and treatment options for the individual patient. An overview of the options is presented in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef121994" href="/z/d/graphic/121994.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1141461264"><span class="h2">Nonprescription medications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Nonprescription medications that are commonly used for insomnia in children are antihistamines and melatonin. Both have potential pitfalls and different uses. They are listed in alphabetical order below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H447980782"><span class="h3">Antihistamines</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>These medications can be considered for short-term situational or occasional use in younger children, especially those with comorbid atopic disease. Both prescription (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13368" href="/z/d/drug information/13368.html" rel="external">hydroxyzine</a>) and nonprescription (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13236" href="/z/d/drug information/13236.html" rel="external">diphenhydramine</a>) antihistamines are the most commonly prescribed and recommended sedatives in pediatric practice. Parents and providers often choose antihistamines because of familiarity, and widespread clinical experience indicates that these medications are largely well tolerated in children. However, tolerance to antihistamines tends to develop, necessitating increasing doses and precluding their chronic use.

Second- and third-generation antihistamines, such as <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13300" href="/z/d/drug information/13300.html" rel="external">fexofenadine</a> and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12563" href="/z/d/drug information/12563.html" rel="external">loratadine</a>, are significantly less sedating.

These drugs have modest efficacy in reducing sleep onset latency (SOL), as demonstrated in a few clinical trials, including in adults with psychiatric disorders. In children, there is mixed evidence for the efficacy of antihistamines for insomnia: A double-blind placebo-controlled pediatric study of diphenhydramine hydrochloride (1 mg/kg) showed significant subjective improvement in sleep latency and night wakings [<a href="#rid7">7</a>], although a subsequent study in 6- to 15-month-old infants found that diphenhydramine was no better than a placebo in reducing night wakings [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) practice guideline suggests <strong>against</strong> the use of diphenhydramine for insomnia in adults, primarily because of small effect size and low-quality data [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>].

Melatonin is also a reasonable choice for children with sleep-onset insomnia who may need long-term pharmacotherapy, including those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Melatonin has demonstrable efficacy in typically developing children with insomnia. However, it should not<em> </em>be used in healthy children without sleep problems to "promote restful sleep" or in adolescents with biologically based later sleep onset times in an attempt to "force" sleep onset to accommodate early school start times, for example. The pros and cons of melatonin are summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef112085" href="/z/d/graphic/112085.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical effects</strong> – Melatonin is generally considered effective for management of chronic or acute circadian rhythm disturbances (eg, delayed sleep-wake phase disorder [DSWPD], jet lag) in both typically developing, healthy children and adolescents and in children with neurologic or neurodevelopmental disorders such as blindness and ASD. However, the AASM clinical practice guideline recommending the use of strategically timed melatonin in DSWPD in otherwise healthy children and adolescents [<a href="#rid12">12</a>] was based on relatively weak evidence, and additional research in this population is clearly needed [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97845.html" rel="external">"Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Melatonin also may be helpful in management of sleep-onset insomnia in children, based primarily on data from patients with ADHD and autism. The rationale is based on the premise that at least some of these children have a circadian-mediated phase delay (ie, delayed sleep onset and offset compared with developmental norms). A meta-analysis of pediatric randomized controlled trials concluded that melatonin increased total sleep duration by approximately 30 minutes and was generally well tolerated but acknowledged that the 13 studies included were of limited scope and had high risk of bias [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Due to paucity of data and low quality of evidence, the clinical practice guidelines for adults recommend against the use of melatonin for sleep-onset or sleep-maintenance insomnia. However, the applicability of these data to pediatric populations is uncertain, and clinical experience suggests that melatonin may be efficacious for some children and adolescents, particularly in those with comorbid ADHD or autism [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pharmacology</strong> – Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland in response to decreased light, mediated through the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The mechanism of action of commercially available, immediate-release melatonin is to supplement the endogenous pineal hormone. The plasma level of exogenous melatonin peaks within approximately one hour of administration. Thus, it should be taken close to bedtime when given for sleep-onset insomnia. When treating circadian phase delay, it is most effective when given several hours prior to bedtime. This is because exogenous melatonin given earlier than the time of its usual endogenous secretion helps to shift the circadian rhythm forward (earlier).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Dosing and administration</strong> – Recommended dosing of melatonin depends on the type of sleep problem:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Circadian phase delay</strong> – Timing of administration should ideally be based on dim light melatonin onset (DLMO), which involves sequential evening measurement of salivary melatonin levels under low light conditions. However, this determination is impractical in most clinical settings. Thus, in the absence of these data, "chronobiotic" doses of melatonin (eg, 0.2 to 0.5 mg) are typically given three to five hours prior to actual sleep onset time (or one to two hours before the desired bedtime). These relatively small doses and advance administration are more effective for circadian phase delay than larger doses or those given closer to sleep onset [<a href="#rid14">14</a>] and appear to be safe [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Sleep-onset insomnia</strong> – Typical doses are 1 to 2 mg in preschool children, 2 to 3 mg in school-aged children, and 5 mg in adolescents, given 30 minutes before bedtime. Dosing should always begin at the lower range and be titrated up on a weekly basis as needed. Melatonin has mild hypnotic properties in these larger doses. Studies in children with autism have reported using doses of up to 10 mg (maximum dose recommended in guidelines for this population [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Some evidence supports the short-term [<a href="#rid16">16</a>] and longer-term [<a href="#rid17">17</a>] efficacy and safety of sustained-release (controlled-release, prolonged-release) preparations in insomnia that is characterized by difficulty with sleep maintenance. In such patients, sustained-release preparations may achieve longer total sleep time, decreased SOL, and fewer night awakenings.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Melatonin is not regulated as a drug by the FDA. Therefore, the commercially available formulations can vary in strength and accuracy in regard to concentration. A Canadian study analyzing 31 commercially available melatonin supplements with liquid chromatography found that actual melatonin content varied from -83 to +478 percent of the labelled content, and lot-to-lot variability was as much as 465 percent [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. An additional 26 percent of the samples contained serotonin (a precursor of melatonin) as a contaminant. Similar variability (74 to 347 percent of the labeled quantity) was found in 25 melatonin gummy products sold in the United States [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. In the United States, melatonin products with a third-party verification seal (eg, US Pharmacopeia [USP] Verified Mark) may provide a more reliable preparation [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. These programs are voluntary, however, and a limited number of melatonin products have received such seals.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Adverse effects</strong> – Studies of melatonin use for durations of up to four years have failed to demonstrate significant adverse effects in a variety of pediatric populations. However, potential side effects include suppression of the hypothalamic-gonadal axis (triggering precocious puberty on discontinuation), although at least one study found no effects on pubertal development [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Increased reactivity of the immune system in children with immune disorders or on immunosuppressants (ie, corticosteroids) has also been postulated. At least one small study in adults suggested no suppression of endogenous melatonin with exogenous administration [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. However, without additional randomized clinical trials and systematic longitudinal follow-up, neither claims of safety concerns nor those of negligible risk of melatonin use in children can presently be fully substantiated.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Inhibitors of CYP1A2 (eg, tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs], <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13025" href="/z/d/drug information/13025.html" rel="external">fluvoxamine</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13156" href="/z/d/drug information/13156.html" rel="external">cimetidine</a>, or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13157" href="/z/d/drug information/13157.html" rel="external">ciprofloxacin</a>) may increase melatonin concentration; oral contraceptives may also decrease metabolism.

A systematic review in adults identified relatively few, mostly small studies with short-term follow-up and design limitations and suggested the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) compared with placebo are uncertain, that there may be a small improvement in sleep quality with short-term use of low-dose <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13253" href="/z/d/drug information/13253.html" rel="external">doxepin</a> and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12855" href="/z/d/drug information/12855.html" rel="external">trazodone</a>, and that tolerability and safety of antidepressants for insomnia is uncertain due to limited reporting of adverse events [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Thus, we suggest that antidepressants should be used for insomnia only in the presence of comorbid mood issues. Treating the underlying mood disorder will often result in improved sleep, and successful sleep interventions often result in improvements in mood. The antidepressant dose for insomnia is typically less than the dose used to treat mood disorders. The pros and cons of antidepressants for sleep are summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef112090" href="/z/d/graphic/112090.html" rel="external">table 8</a>). Properties of specific classes of antidepressants are discussed in the following sections.</p><p>Antidepressants are believed to mediate sleep promotion by influencing activity of non-GABA neurotransmitters such as serotonin, histamine, and acetylcholine, which are involved in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. Most antidepressants, especially those with anticholinergic effects, suppress REM sleep and increase latency to REM sleep; thus, abrupt withdrawal may lead to increased nightmares as a result of REM sleep rebound.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3238647798"><span class="h4">Tricyclic antidepressants</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most TCAs are sedating; the most sedating drugs are <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12598" href="/z/d/drug information/12598.html" rel="external">amitriptyline</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13253" href="/z/d/drug information/13253.html" rel="external">doxepin</a>, and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="122821" href="/z/d/drug information/122821.html" rel="external">trimipramine</a>. TCAs decrease SOL and arousals and have been used to treat insomnia in adults who have underlying depression. Most of these medications have not been studied for insomnia in patients without underlying depression.</p><p>The most commonly reported side effects of TCAs are anxiety and agitation, as well as anticholinergic effects such as blurred vision, dry mouth, urinary retention, and orthostatic hypotension. There is a risk of cardiotoxicity, especially in prepubertal children, and TCAs should be used with extreme caution in clinical situations in which a risk exists for accidental or intentional overdose. Most TCAs are potent REM sleep suppressants; thus, rapid withdrawal may lead to REM sleep rebound and nightmares. TCAs also tend to suppress SWS, and withdrawal may lead to SWS rebound and an increase in partial-arousal parasomnias such as sleepwalking and sleep terrors. TCAs have been used clinically to treat severe partial-arousal parasomnias because of these direct effects on SWS. TCAs may also exacerbate restless legs syndrome (RLS) symptoms.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3002522688"><span class="h4">Atypical antidepressants</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mirtazapine</strong><strong> (Remeron)</strong> is an atypical antidepressant with noradrenergic and specific serotonergic actions, with strong sedative properties at a low dose (7.5 mg). It has been shown to decrease SOL, increase sleep duration, and reduce wake after sleep onset in adults, including those with major depression, with relatively little effect on REM sleep. However, it may result in daytime somnolence. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/85816.html" rel="external">"Atypical antidepressants: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects", section on 'Mirtazapine'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Trazodone</strong> is a serotonin modulator commonly used for insomnia in adults and children with comorbid depression. It is one of the most sedating antidepressants because it both inhibits binding of serotonin and blocks histamine receptors. While there is widespread use of this drug for insomnia in adults with some empirical support (largely subjective reports of improved sleep quality), there is very little empirical evidence to support the use of <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12855" href="/z/d/drug information/12855.html" rel="external">trazodone</a> for the pediatric population, particularly in children without a comorbid mood disorder [<a href="#rid9">9,31,32</a>]. Although trazodone is commonly selected for sleep complaints in patients with comorbid depression, little empirical support exists for this preference compared with other sedating antidepressants. The AASM practice guideline suggests <strong>against</strong> the use of trazodone for sleep-onset or sleep-maintenance insomnia in adults without comorbid depression (only data from patients with primary insomnia were reviewed), based on paucity of data and the small effect sizes observed in the single randomized trial [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>].

In addition, one study in adolescents with treatment-resistant depression found that those who had been treated with trazodone were substantially less likely to respond to an alternative antidepressant trial and more likely to express self-harm statements than those on no sleep medication [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].

Furthermore, the sedating effects may interfere with daytime functioning and learning, and tolerance frequently develops, necessitating dose escalation.
