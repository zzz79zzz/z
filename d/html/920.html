Unstable patients (ie, pulseless patients in cardiac arrest or patients who are hemodynamically unstable) should be treated immediately, before an extensive diagnostic evaluation. (See <a class="local">'Assessment of hemodynamic stability'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/101641.html" rel="external">"Wide QRS complex tachycardias: Approach to management", section on 'Unstable patients'</a>.) </p><p>Stable patients (ie, patients with no or minimal symptoms and who are hemodynamically stable) will most often have already had an ECG showing the presence of a WCT. In a stable patient, the ECG should be thoroughly and systematically reviewed in an effort to determine the etiology of the WCT. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation of the electrocardiogram'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H601165872"><span class="h2">Assessment of hemodynamic stability</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Immediate assessment of the patient's symptoms, vital signs, and the level of consciousness are of primary importance. In the discussions that follow, patients are categorized as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unstable – An unstable patient with WCT has evidence of hemodynamic compromise, such as hypotension, altered mental status, chest pain, or HF, but generally remains awake with a discernible pulse. In this setting, emergency synchronized cardioversion (after intravenous sedation, whenever possible) is the treatment of choice regardless of the mechanism of the arrhythmia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/101641.html" rel="external">"Wide QRS complex tachycardias: Approach to management", section on 'Unstable patients'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Patients who become unresponsive or pulseless are considered to have a cardiac arrest and are treated according to standard resuscitation algorithms. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/278.html" rel="external">"Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/272.html" rel="external">"Adult basic life support (BLS) for health care providers"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stable – A stable patient with WCT shows no evidence of hemodynamic compromise despite a sustained rapid heart rate. Such patients should have continuous monitoring (if hospitalized) and frequent reevaluations (in either the inpatient or outpatient setting) due to the potential for rapid deterioration as long as the WCT persists.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The presence of hemodynamic stability should <strong>not</strong> be regarded as diagnostic of SVT [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Misdiagnosis of VT as SVT based upon hemodynamic stability is a common error that can lead to inappropriate and potentially dangerous therapy [<a href="#rid1">1,3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/101641.html" rel="external">"Wide QRS complex tachycardias: Approach to management", section on 'Pharmacologic interventions'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H279617036"><span class="h2">Immediate cardioversion in unstable patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hemodynamic compromise may occur with any WCT, regardless of the etiology, but is more likely in patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT). Patients who are felt to be hemodynamically unstable require prompt treatment with electrical cardioversion/defibrillation to prevent further clinical deterioration or sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). The approach to treatment in these patients is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/101641.html" rel="external">"Wide QRS complex tachycardias: Approach to management", section on 'Unstable patients'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1898476301"><span class="h2">Initial evaluation in stable patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In a stable patient, a focused clinical evaluation should include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History (see <a class="local">'History'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Physical examination (see <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/116601.html" rel="external">"Wide QRS complex tachycardias: Causes, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations", section on 'Physical examination findings'</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Laboratory testing (see <a class="local">'Ancillary testing'</a> below)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diagnostic maneuvers in selected patients</p><p></p><p>The primary goals of the initial evaluation of a stable patient with WCT are to determine the etiology of the WCT (through evaluation of the ECG) and to elucidate any underlying conditions related to the event (eg, heart failure, myocardial ischemia, drug reaction, or electrolyte abnormalities). (See <a class="local">'Evaluation of the electrocardiogram'</a> below.)</p><p>Among patients with WCT, VT is much more common than supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrant conduction. In addition, inadvertently treating VT as though it were SVT could precipitate hemodynamic collapse and/or cardiac arrest, while "mistreating" SVT as though it were VT will rarely cause a clinically significant adverse effect. Thus, if there is any uncertainty of the diagnosis, it is generally preferable to be conservative and presume VT in the case of WCT. The approach to treatment of WCT is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/101641.html" rel="external">"Wide QRS complex tachycardias: Approach to management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H601166120"><span class="h3">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When evaluating the stable patient with a WCT, the following historical features may help determine the likely etiology and/or guide therapy:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of heart disease – The presence of structural heart disease, especially coronary heart disease and/or a previous myocardial infarction (MI), strongly suggests VT as an etiology [<a href="#rid1">1,4</a>]. It is also important to establish whether a cardiac arrhythmia has occurred in the past and, if so, whether the patient is aware of the etiology. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/116601.html" rel="external">"Wide QRS complex tachycardias: Causes, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Presence of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) – The presence of an ICD implies a known increased risk of VTs and suggests strongly (but does not prove) that the WCT is VT. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/921.html" rel="external">"Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators: Overview of indications, components, and functions"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Presence of a pacemaker – The patient should be asked about the presence of pacemaker, which raises the possibility of a device-associated WCT. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/116601.html" rel="external">"Wide QRS complex tachycardias: Causes, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations", section on 'Supraventricular tachycardia'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Atrial arrhythmias – In a patient known to have persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), a <strong>regular</strong> WCT is likely VT, as aberrant conduction during AF would create an <strong>irregular</strong> rhythm. An exception is when AF "organizes" into atrial flutter; this can occur spontaneously but occurs much more commonly in the setting of antiarrhythmic drugs (especially class IC agents, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8595" href="/d/drug information/8595.html" rel="external">amiodarone</a>, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9037" href="/d/drug information/9037.html" rel="external">dronedarone</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Age – For patients over the age of 35 years presenting to an emergency department, a WCT is likely to be VT (positive predictive value 85 percent in one series) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. SVT is more likely in younger patients (positive predictive value 70 percent). However, VT must be considered in younger patients, particularly those with a family history of ventricular arrhythmias or premature sudden cardiac death.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Symptoms – Symptoms are <strong>not</strong> useful in determining the diagnosis, but they may be important as an indicator of the severity of hemodynamic compromise. Symptoms are primarily due to the elevated heart rate, associated heart disease, and the presence of left ventricular dysfunction [<a href="#rid1">1,4</a>]. Some patients with a WCT have no or relatively minor symptoms (palpitations, lightheadedness, diaphoresis), while others have severe manifestations including chest pain or angina, syncope, shock, seizures, and cardiac arrest.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H601166379"><span class="h3">Medications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many medications have proarrhythmic effects, either directly by prolonging the QT interval or indirectly via alterations in electrolyte levels, and obtaining a medication history is among the first priorities in the evaluation of a patient with a WCT. The most common drug-induced WCT is a form of polymorphic VT called torsades de pointes (TdP). This arrhythmia is associated with QT interval prolongation when the patient is in sinus rhythm. Many medications (eg, antiarrhythmic drugs, anti-infective drugs, psychotropic drugs, etc) are known to prolong the QT interval  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57431" href="/d/graphic/57431.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and are associated with a risk of polymorphic VT. An internet resource with updated lists of specific drugs that cause TdP is available at the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crediblemeds.org%2F&amp;token=F2fTJXWTbAdqtiUVhUGfEeHvm%2Bapw8j0DIpr7ZimhTcQDLZbSKKNNIJ4B%2FwprPZ%2F&amp;TOPIC_ID=920" target="_blank">Credible Meds</a> website. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1043.html" rel="external">"Acquired long QT syndrome: Definitions, pathophysiology, and causes"</a>.)</p><p>Class IC antiarrhythmic drugs can sometimes organize AF into a relatively slow atrial flutter, which may conduct 1:1 with a very wide QRS complex, mimicking VT. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H601166552"><span class="h3">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As with the history, the initial physical examination should search for evidence of underlying cardiovascular disease, which can impact the likelihood that the WCT is VT.</p><p>Findings suggestive of cardiovascular disease include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Signs of acute or chronic HF (eg, hypoxia, lung crackles, etc). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3454.html" rel="external">"Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: General considerations"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3510.html" rel="external">"Heart failure: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A healed sternal incision as evidence of previous cardiothoracic surgery.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The sequelae of peripheral artery disease or stroke (eg, surgical scars consistent with vascular surgery, residual neurologic deficits, etc).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A pacemaker or ICD. These devices are usually palpable and are in the left or, less commonly, right pectoral area below the clavicle; rarely, ICDs are found in the anterior abdominal wall.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3979850753"><span class="h3">ECG initial impressions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once a WCT has been identified on the ECG, prompt diagnosis and management is important. Unstable patients should be presumed to have VT and treated as such. While the Brugada criteria are the most widely known and applied criteria for distinguishing VT from SVT, time and/or technical limitations may not allow for immediate review of the ECG in such detail, particularly in a symptomatic or borderline unstable patient. (See <a class="local">'Brugada criteria'</a> below.)</p><p>The absence of the historical or ECG features of VT does not confirm a diagnosis of SVT. The diagnosis of SVT should be considered primarily in young patients, whose hearts are structurally normal, in whom none of the historical (eg, family history of sudden cardiac death), physical, or ECG criteria supporting VT are present, or in patients with a history of SVT with a similar presentation. When the diagnosis of a WCT remains uncertain, we recommend that the patient be treated as if the rhythm is VT until definitively proven otherwise.</p><p>Our approach emphasizes immediate ECG review for key high-yield features in parallel with a brief history that can guide the management of most patients with a WCT.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Is the rhythm regular or irregular? – VT and most SVTs are generally regular, though slight variation of the RR interval can be seen in VT. An irregular WCT usually represents AF with aberrant conduction, although polymorphic VT should also be considered. (See <a class="local">'Basic features'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>What is the QRS axis  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85682" href="/d/graphic/85682.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>)? – Extreme right axis deviation (ie, a right superior axis [axis from -90 to ±180 degrees]) strongly favors VT, as does any axis shift of greater than 40 degrees when compared with baseline or concordance of the QRS complexes. (See <a class="local">'Basic features'</a> below and <a class="local">'Concordance'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Is there AV dissociation? – If AV dissociation can be quickly identified, an atrial rate slower than the ventricular rate, along with any fusion or capture beats, strongly suggests VT. (See <a class="local">'AV dissociation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Is there a history of heart disease or arrhythmias? – A quick history focusing on structural heart disease, particularly coronary heart disease and/or prior MI as well as any known arrhythmias or cardiac implantable electronic devices (eg, pacemaker or ICD), can aid in identifying the most likely etiology of WCT. The WCT is far more likely to be VT in patients over 35 years of age with known coronary heart disease or prior MI and in those with an ICD. (See <a class="local">'History'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H601166589"><span class="h3">Ancillary testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A number of additional tests may provide further insight to the mechanism of the tachycardia and the presence of associated conditions.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Laboratory testing – Initial laboratory testing in all patients with a WCT should include electrolytes and cardiac troponin, with additional testing for elevated serum drug levels in patients taking certain medications.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The plasma potassium and magnesium concentrations should be measured as part of the initial evaluation since hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia both predispose to the development of VT. Hyperkalemia can cause a wide QRS complex rhythm with the loss of a detectable P wave, although this usually is a supraventricular rhythm with a slow rate (so-called "sinoventricular rhythm"). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2377.html" rel="external">"Causes and evaluation of hyperkalemia in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2120.html" rel="external">"ECG tutorial: Miscellaneous diagnoses", section on 'Hyperkalemia'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Cardiac troponin testing should be performed in patients with WCT when the patient is having ongoing chest pain or hemodynamic instability. Cardiac troponin can be elevated in the setting of myocardial ischemia (as the result of myocardial oxygen supply and demand mismatch) or MI (as a possible cause of the arrhythmia). Elevated cardiac troponin is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes and may guide hospital admission decisions, cardiac testing, and/or anti-ischemic therapy.

For optimal ECG analysis, both a 12-lead ECG and a rhythm strip should be obtained. However, if there are any questions regarding the patient's stability, detailed ECG evaluation should be deferred in favor of urgent therapy.

If available, comparison with a baseline ECG tracing in sinus rhythm (or atrial fibrillation [AF]) can be very helpful. Helpful clues on a baseline ECG may include fascicular and/or bundle branch block, signs of prior infarction, or ventricular pre-excitation. Patients with aberrant conduction at baseline will virtually always have aberrant conduction during SVT. A QRS complex during WCT identical to that during SR usually implies SVT, though an unusual form of VT called bundle branch reentrant VT may be possible. If the patient is known to have persistent AF at baseline, a regular WCT usually implies VT.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rate – The rate of the WCT is of limited use in distinguishing VT from SVT.

Slight variation in the RR intervals is sometimes seen and suggests VT as opposed to most SVTs, which are characterized by uniformity of the RR intervals. When the onset of the arrhythmia is available for analysis, a period of some irregularity and acceleration ("warm-up phenomenon") suggests VT. More marked irregularity of RR intervals occurs in polymorphic VT and in AF with aberrant conduction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Morphology – For distinguishing between VT and SVT, there are no universal morphologic criteria that would allow for the distinction. However, when describing WCTs, the QRS morphology in lead V1 is the key. If the complex is primarily negative in lead V1, the WCT is said to be left bundle branch block (LBBB)-like. If the QRS is primarily positive in lead V1, the WCT is said to be right bundle branch block (RBBB)-like. (See <a class="local">'QRS morphology'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Axis – The QRS axis in the frontal plane can be useful in distinguishing SVT from VT. The presence of one or more of the following is highly suggestive of VT: right superior axis, shift in axis &gt;40 degrees from a prior baseline, and a specific QRS axis in association with other QRS morphologies.

There are two exceptions to this rule. The first is an antidromic AV reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) seen with ventricular pre-excitation. In this situation, there is direct activation of the ventricular myocardium, bypassing the normal His-Purkinje system, and the QRS complex may have an indeterminate axis.

An unstable patient will have evidence of hemodynamic compromise, such as hypotension, altered mental status, chest pain, or heart failure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A patient who is unresponsive or pulseless should be treated according to standard advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) algorithms  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef129983" href="/d/graphic/129983.html" rel="external">algorithm 5</a>). (See <a class="local">'Assessment of hemodynamic stability'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/278.html" rel="external">"Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For a patient who is unstable, with evidence of hemodynamic compromise but who remains conscious, emergency synchronized cardioversion (after intravenous sedation, whenever possible) is the treatment of choice regardless of the mechanism of the arrhythmia. (See <a class="local">'Assessment of hemodynamic stability'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/101641.html" rel="external">"Wide QRS complex tachycardias: Approach to management", section on 'Unstable patients'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a stable patient, or following cardioversion to stabilize an unstable patient, our initial approach includes the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>A succinct history and physical examination, focusing on the presence of structural heart disease, especially coronary heart disease and/or a previous myocardial infarction, as well as the history of any arrhythmias and the presence of a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. (See <a class="local">'History'</a> above and <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Review of the patient’s medications for drugs that may be proarrhythmic (by prolonging the QT interval or promoting electrolyte disturbances). (See <a class="local">'Medications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Initial review of the ECG, with a focus on whether the rhythm is regular or irregular, the width of the QRS complex, the presence or absence of AV dissociation, and any preexisting arrhythmias. (See <a class="local">'ECG initial impressions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Ancillary testing including serum electrolyte levels, cardiac troponin, and a chest radiograph in all patients. (See <a class="local">'Ancillary testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In most patients with WCT, a probable diagnosis (ventricular tachycardia [VT] or supraventricular tachycardia [SVT]) may be made by closely reviewing the ECG, although definitive diagnosis is not always possible and may be time consuming. The standard initial approach to ECG interpretation includes an assessment of rate, regularity, axis, QRS duration, and QRS morphology. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation of the electrocardiogram'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Most patients with WCT will have some, but not all, of the ECG features favoring VT. There is no single criterion or combination of criteria that provides complete diagnostic accuracy in evaluating a WCT, even when employing an algorithmic approach to the diagnosis of a WCT. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>We prefer using the Brugada algorithm to evaluate for VT versus SVT in patients with WCT when the diagnosis is uncertain and when patient hemodynamic stability allows.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>ECG features consistent with VT include concordance  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef129926" href="/d/graphic/129926.html" rel="external">waveform 2</a>), AV dissociation, fusion/capture beats, and specific QRS morphologies.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The absence of the historical or ECG features of VT does not confirm a diagnosis of SVT. The diagnosis of SVT should be considered primarily in young patients, whose hearts are structurally normal, in whom none of the historical (eg, family history of sudden cardiac death), physical, or ECG criteria supporting VT are present, or in patients with a history of SVT with a similar presentation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>When the diagnosis of a WCT is uncertain despite a careful initial evaluation, the patient should be treated as if the rhythm is VT.
