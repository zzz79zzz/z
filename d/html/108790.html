         Ebstein anomaly is a congenital malformation that is characterized primarily by abnormalities of the tricuspid valve and right ventricle  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103702" href="/z/d/graphic/103702.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The clinical presentation of Ebstein anomaly varies widely, ranging from fetal recognition or the symptomatic neonate to the asymptomatic adult, depending upon the degree of anatomic abnormality and concomitant lesions (eg, atrial septal defect). The management and prognosis of Ebstein anomaly are discussed here.

         The approach to the management of patients with Ebstein anomaly is determined by the patient's age and clinical presentation including the presence of symptoms of heart failure secondary to tricuspid regurgitation and right heart failure, cyanosis, and right ventricular dilation or dysfunction. The components of management are monitoring, medical management (including temporizing relief of symptoms prior to surgery), management of arrhythmias, and surgical or catheter intervention. Many patients with Ebstein anomaly have no symptoms and require only monitoring while others are symptomatic and require supportive medical therapy and surgical intervention.

         All patients with Ebstein anomaly should undergo periodic monitoring, preferably by a congenital cardiovascular specialist. (See
         <a class="local">

         Indications for intervention or surgical repair of children and adults with Ebstein anomaly include worsening heart failure (HF), progressive cyanosis or uncontrolled arrhythmias. Surgical repair may also be considered if there is decline in functional capacity with evidence of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and/or hypoxia. Occasionally, asymptomatic adult patients with severe tricuspid valve regurgitation and repairable tricuspid valves are considered for early repair to prevent progressive right heart enlargement.

         For the newborn with Ebstein anomaly presenting with cyanosis or heart failure, advanced medical management is preferred to delay surgery as long as possible. (See

         Most symptomatic children with Ebstein anomaly are referred for surgical intervention, although some children with heart failure may require medical stabilization prior to corrective surgery. (See

         Some adults with Ebstein anomaly with an indication for surgical intervention require medical therapy to stabilize heart failure prior to surgery. (See

         Liver function should be monitored in adults with Ebstein anomaly and long-standing severe tricuspid regurgitation. Some patients with long-standing right atrial hypertension develop cardiac cirrhosis and are at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma [

         In children and adults, the clinical presentation of arrhythmias, identification of an accessory pathway, and findings on the electrophysiologic study are used to guide radiofrequency catheter ablation or less commonly surgical ablation of atrioventricular accessory pathway(s). (See

         Medical management in a newborn with cyanosis or heart failure is limited to supportive therapy until the pulmonary vascular resistance drops and normalizes with time. In the symptomatic newborn,

          inhaled nitric oxide

         may be helpful in reducing pulmonary vascular resistance and improving antegrade pulmonary blood flow [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Critically ill newborns may require inotropic support for stabilization until surgical intervention is performed or there is clinical improvement.
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9652" href="/z/d/drug information/9652.html" rel="external">
          Milrinone
         </a>
         is most beneficial in this setting as it has an inotropic, as well as pulmonary vasodilator effect that allows reduction of pulmonary vascular resistance, augmenting the pulmonary blood flow.
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/z/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">
          Epinephrine
         </a>
         and other catecholamines should be avoided, as these may predispose to tachyarrhythmia in the setting of stretched right atrium and/or accessory pathway(s).
        </p>
        <p>
         In case of extreme cyanosis, as noted in patients with functional or anatomic pulmonary valve atresia, prostaglandin E1 (also known as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8459" href="/z/d/drug information/8459.html" rel="external">
          alprostadil
         </a>
         ) infusion is indicated to keep the ductus arteriosus open and increase pulmonary blood flow until the pulmonary vascular resistance drops. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5785.html" rel="external">
          "Diagnosis and initial management of cyanotic heart disease in the newborn", section on 'Prostaglandin E1'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, if pulmonary valve regurgitation is also present, initiation of prostaglandin E1 may result in high output failure due to the creation of a circular shunt, ie, blood flows from left ventricle to aorta to pulmonary artery (through ductus arteriosus) and then, retrograde through pulmonary valve, right ventricle and tricuspid valve, across the atrial septum, and back into the left ventricle and aorta. Despite it being a high output state, the presence of circular shunt results in low systemic output. If a circular shunt develops, prostaglandin E1 infusion should be terminated and surgical or device closure of the patent ductus arteriosus may be required. The presence of concomitant pulmonary regurgitation in newborns with Ebstein anomaly carries a poor prognosis.

         Treatment of atrial arrhythmias depends on the rhythm and substrate. An electrophysiologic study is frequently performed to identify accessory pathways. Children less than four years old who have supraventricular tachycardia or an accessory conduction pathway can be managed on oral beta blocker therapy until they are old enough to undergo catheter ablation [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Catheter ablation or less commonly surgical ablation of atrioventricular accessory pathway(s) is suggested in symptomatic patients [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9-11
         </a>
         ]. Medical management with anti-arrhythmic drugs can be used temporarily. Since an interatrial shunt is frequently present, paradoxical embolism is a potential risk of catheter ablation. Atrial tachyarrhythmias (fibrillation and flutter) can also be treated with a right-sided or biatrial Maze procedure at the time of surgical repair. A biatrial Maze procedure may be preferable to catheter-based ablation for persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation/flutter [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12

         A registry study published in 1998 evaluated 65 patients with Ebstein anomaly and showed that a single accessory pathway was present in 52 percent, multiple accessory pathways in 29 percent, and arrhythmias unrelated to an accessory pathway in 18 percent [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. The acute success rate of radiofrequency ablation for patients with single pathway was 77 percent (26/34 patients) and for multiple pathways the success rate was 90 percent (17/19 patients). Ablation of a right free wall or right septal pathway was initially successful in 79 and 89 percent, respectively; however, the recurrence rate was 32 and 29 percent. Among those with arrhythmias unassociated with an accessory pathway, ablation was initially successful in 75 percent, and 27 percent had recurrence.
        </p>
        <p>
         A later multicenter study that reported on catheter ablations in 32 patients with Ebstein anomaly [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ] confirmed that patients with Ebstein anomaly often have multiple arrhythmogenic substrates; the most frequent ablation targets were accessory pathways, followed by macroreentrant atrial circuits. Further, arrhythmia recurrence is frequent after ablation due to conduction recovery. A single-center study showed high diagnostic and therapeutic yield of preoperative electrophysiology study in patients with Ebstein anomaly, aged 0.2 to 56 years [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Based on this study, many centers are performing routine preoperative electrophysiology studies to identify arrhythmias and accessory conduction pathways; ablation of accessory pathways prior to surgical repair is generally suggested as catheter-based ablation becomes challenging after the area around the accessory pathway has been plicated or the tricuspid valve has been replaced.
        </p>
        <p>
         Success rates may have further improved with technical advances for electroanatomic mapping and ablation techniques.

        <p>
         Indications for arrhythmia surgery (surgical ablation of accessory pathways or a Maze procedure) concomitant with tricuspid valve repair or replacement and atrial septal defect (ASD) closure are atrial and/or ventricular arrhythmias not amenable to percutaneous treatment and ventricular preexcitation not successfully treated in the electrophysiology lab.

         Pregnancy poses a risk of heart failure, cyanosis, and arrhythmia in the patient with Ebstein anomaly. Right ventricular volume overload is augmented by the increase in intravascular volume and cardiac output during pregnancy [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15-17
         </a>
         ]. Cyanosis due to an intracardiac right-to-left shunt may first become manifest during pregnancy because of the rise in right ventricular filling pressure. The right-to-left intracardiac shunt increases the risk of paradoxical embolization, and hypoxemia increases the fetal risk [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16-19
         </a>

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Arrhythmia risk is also increased during pregnancy in Ebstein anomaly due to predisposition, such as accessory conduction pathway as well as the pregnancy-related physiologic and hormonal changes [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. The presence of an accessory pathway establishes a precondition for rapid ventricular rates in response to atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with potentially catastrophic consequences. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/976.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Despite these concerns, acyanotic women with Ebstein anomaly usually tolerate pregnancy well [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16-18,21,22
         </a>
         ]. A literature review of studies published between 1985 and 2007 found the following rates of complications during completed (&gt;20 weeks gestation) pregnancies among women with Ebstein anomaly (combined repaired and unrepaired): arrhythmias in 5 of 127 pregnancies (3.9 percent); heart failure in 4 of 127 pregnancies (3.1 percent); and no cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality) in the majority (128) of pregnancies [

        </p>
        <p>
         There are significant fetal risks associated with Ebstein anomaly. These include an increased incidence of prematurity, fetal wastage, and congenital heart disease. The severity of maternal cyanosis and reduced cardiac output may impact the outcome of pregnancy. The above-cited review reported the rates of fetal complications among completed (&gt;20 weeks gestation) pregnancies: premature delivery occurred in 28 of 127 pregnancies (22 percent), fetal mortality rate in none of 128 pregnancies, and perinatal mortality in 3 of 128 pregnancies (2.3 percent) [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22

         The reported risk during pregnancy [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ] is appreciably reduced after surgical repair of Ebstein anomaly or catheter ablation of accessory pathways. Closure of the interatrial communication eliminates the risk of paradoxical embolization and the fetal risk of maternal cyanosis. However, the risk of congenital heart disease in the fetus remains.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the presence of maternal Ebstein anomaly, the rate of recurrence of congenital heart disease (of any type) in offspring was 4 percent (5 of 126) [

         </span>
         Our approach to the patient with Ebstein anomaly with regard to pregnancy is to perform a comprehensive preconception risk assessment to assess potential risk associated with pregnancy, frequency of follow-up during pregnancy, and anticipated location where the patient will be delivered using the modified World Health Organization (WHO) risk score assessment [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Preconception risk stratification includes clinical assessment, evaluation of heart rhythm, and oxygen saturation at rest and with exercise. A comprehensive echocardiogram is also performed before pregnancy. We then counsel the patient and partner about the pregnancy risks and adjust medical therapy as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once the patient becomes pregnant, we see the patient to confirm that pregnancy is being tolerated, plan additional visits as needed, and review the delivery plan. A fetal echocardiogram is recommended around 18 to 22 weeks gestation. More frequent obstetric ultrasounds for fetal well-being may be indicated. The frequency of comprehensive echocardiography during pregnancy is individualized. Some patients require frequent follow-up, and others require minimal cardiovascular care during pregnancy. The patient with an ASD or patent foramen ovale (PFO) requires special care and monitoring; some of these patients experience oxygen desaturation during pregnancy, which can adversely affect fetal growth and well-being. The presence of an ASD or PFO also increases the risk of paradoxical embolism. Rarely, an ASD or PFO may need to be closed during pregnancy due to worsening functional status and cyanosis [

         Patients with Ebstein anomaly commonly require surgical repair. In a study of 530 patients with Ebstein anomaly (median age 0.8 years at diagnosis) in Danish and Swedish registries, 228 patients (43 percent) underwent surgical repair during median 11-year follow-up [

         In addition, for children and adults with severe tricuspid valve regurgitation and a tricuspid valve that is amenable to repair with low operative risk of mortality (eg, &lt;1 percent), we favor surgical repair. This recommendation is based upon our institutional experience and is done in an effort to prevent adverse right heart remodeling, which occurs with long-standing severe tricuspid valve regurgitation [

         Evolving surgical interventions and heterogeneity in outcomes among surgical centers must be considered when considering the available evidence on management of Ebstein anomaly for individual decision-making and surgical referral. Limited observational evidence is available to guide the management of patients with Ebstein anomaly. Surgical repair techniques have evolved markedly over the past two decades and thus comparison between different series is challenging. Outcomes after surgical repair procedures are dependent on the experience of the surgical center and vary between different centers. Most reported series are derived from large centers with extensive experience and may not be applicable to smaller centers with less experience. For example, in a European multicenter study, operative mortality was 13.3 percent, which was higher than in most larger single-center studies [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30-32

        </p>
        <p>
         Observational data suggest that survival is increasing as advances in diagnostic, surgical techniques, and postoperative care have led to improvements in outcomes. This was illustrated in a report of 158 patients who received a primary tricuspid bioprosthesis [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. Ten-year survival was 93 percent with freedom from bioprosthesis replacement at 10 and 15 years of 98 and 81 percent, respectively; 92 percent were New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I or II and 94 percent were not receiving anticoagulation [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Similar results were noted in a review of 60 patients who underwent surgical repair of the tricuspid valve [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. Hospital mortality was 3 percent, actuarial survival was 97 and 83 percent at one and 18 years, respectively, and 94 percent of survivors were NYHA class I or II [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Studies of surgical intervention have found that the presence of more than moderate right ventricular dysfunction was the only independent predictor of early mortality after surgical intervention [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. In the setting of severe tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricular myocardial contractility and postoperative right ventricular systolic function may be markedly overestimated by measurements of preoperative right ventricular ejection fraction. For this reason, we suggest surgical intervention before the development of significant right heart enlargement, hoping to prevent progressive right ventricular dysfunction. At experienced centers, the standard surgical repair can be performed with low mortality and excellent durability [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36
         </a>
         ]. In the published report from our institution, 84 patients underwent surgical repair of Ebstein anomaly at a mean age of 10 ± 6 years. There was one early death and three patients required early reoperation. In a different report describing 81 patients with Ebstein anomaly over 50 years of age, 89 surgical procedures were performed [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. Tricuspid valve replacement was done in 65 (73 percent) and repair was performed in only 22 (25 percent) patients. There were three early deaths. Most patients (89 percent) had improved functional class on long-term follow-up. The 20-year survival for this cohort was 65 versus 74 percent for age and sex-matched controls. Lack of postoperative improvement in functional capacity and older age at the time of surgery were the best predictors of late death. As outlined above, surgical results may differ between centers, and this has to be taken into account in individual decision-making.

         Surgical repair includes tricuspid valvuloplasty or replacement, selective plication of the atrialized right ventricle, closure of intracardiac shunts, right reduction atrioplasty, and arrhythmia procedures in select patients. Whenever possible, repair of the tricuspid valve is undertaken since it is associated with lower mortality and fewer long-term complications than tricuspid valve replacement [

         Contemporary repair techniques focus on a cone-type of reconstruction. This includes mobilization of all available leaflets and joining them to result in 360 degrees of leaflet tissue that is re-anchored at the level of the true annulus [
         <a href="#rid39">

         Several other repair techniques, involving annuloplasty and/or ventricular plication, have also been described [

         If tricuspid repair is not possible and the patient has reached adult size, tricuspid valve replacement becomes necessary [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. A biologic prosthesis is preferred because of the high incidence of thrombosis with a mechanical prosthesis placed in the right heart, particularly when the right ventricular function is poor [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. A porcine valve prosthesis is preferred rather than a pericardial valve prosthesis since it functions better in a low flow setting and is less likely to thrombose. The prosthesis is usually placed in an intraatrial position in order to avoid injury to the right coronary artery or the exposed conduction tissue.

         The single-ventricle pathway consists of fenestrated patch closure of the tricuspid valve, atrial septectomy, and a systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt. Subsequent operations then include a bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis at four to six months of age and completion Fontan at two to four years of age [

          29

         ]. Biventricular repair includes repair of the tricuspid valve and complete or partial closure of the ASD. However, for patients with advanced symptoms of right heart failure with significant right ventricular enlargement or dysfunction, a 1.5-ventricle repair is preferred. Importantly, a low pulmonary vascular resistance is key for normal functioning of a bidirectional cavo-pulmonary anastomosis. In adults with right ventricular systolic dysfunction, preoperative hemodynamic assessment including assessment of pulmonary vascular resistance is mandatory in case a bidirectional cavo-pulmonary anastomosis becomes necessary. Postoperative superior vena cava syndrome is a risk when a bidirectional cavo-pulmonary anastomosis is performed in the setting of elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. Rarely, adults with marked biventricular dysfunction are referred directly to heart transplant rather than primary repair.

         In selected patients, isolated percutaneous device closure of interatrial communications may be considered to abolish right-to-left shunting in order to improve saturation (at rest or during exercise) and decrease the risk for paradoxical embolism. As interatrial defects may act as a "pop-off valve" for the failing right ventricle, careful hemodynamic assessment prior to device closure is mandatory. This often requires temporary catheter occlusion of the defect with careful monitoring of right ventricular filling pressures at rest and occasionally even with exercise [

         Cardiac surgery in patients with Ebstein anomaly should be performed at a center with established experience by surgeons with training and expertise in congenital heart disease, preferably at centers with specific high-volume expertise in Ebstein surgery. Indications for surgical repair of Ebstein anomaly are based chiefly on the age of the patient, presence of symptoms, and the severity of clinical findings. Right ventricular systolic function and experience of the surgical center have to be taken into account in individual decision-making. Our approach is generally as follows (see

         Surgical tricuspid valve re-repair or replacement are options for patients with repaired Ebstein anomaly with recurrent severe tricuspid regurgitation with symptoms, progressive right ventricular dilation and/or systolic dysfunction, arrhythmias, or bioprosthetic valve dysfunction. For patients with bioprosthetic valve dysfunction who meet criteria for reintervention, valve-in-valve tricuspid valve replacement may be considered. Local experience of the surgical center needs to be taken into account in individual decision-making. (See

         The prognosis of Ebstein anomaly varies with the severity of the lesion. Severe malformations associated with cyanosis in neonates and heart failure in infants result in a guarded prognosis. Adolescents and adults commonly present with atrial arrhythmias, often associated with one or more accessory pathways. Mild disease may be detected in children or adults; these patients may remain asymptomatic for decades. (See
