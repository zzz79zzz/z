         Patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS, which includes the presentations of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI] and unstable angina) due to suspected coronary artery occlusion (ie, Type I myocardial infarction [MI]) typically undergo either invasive coronary angiography without prior noninvasive imaging (ie, invasive strategy) or stress or anatomic imaging followed by invasive coronary angiography as indicated (ie, selective angiography, conservative management).
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic reviews the indications of each strategy.

          Characterization of chest discomfort
         </strong>
         – The presenting symptoms and any ongoing symptoms should be characterized by their location, quality, timing, exacerbating factors, and ameliorating factors. In particular, the presence of any ongoing symptoms (eg, recurrence, stuttering nature), change in symptoms (eg, improvement with nitrates), or heart failure symptoms helps to determine the approach to revascularization. The details on the comprehensive evaluation of chest discomfort are described separately. (See

          Laboratory tests
         </strong>
         – The essential laboratory tests include troponin, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen levels. In all patients with suspected MI, we obtain a basic metabolic panel, leukocyte count, hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, and coagulation studies to assess the safety of angiography, anticoagulation, and antiplatelet therapies.

         In patients with an appropriate history and elevated troponin or ST-segment depression (ie, NSTEMI), we suggest invasive coronary angiography ("invasive strategy") rather than other management strategies (eg, stress or noninvasive imaging followed by appropriate angiography ["selective angiography" or "conservative strategy"]). However, it is reasonable to pursue imaging first in patients in whom stress (eg, nuclear perfusion, exercise echocardiography) or anatomic imaging (coronary computed tomographic angiography [CCTA]) can be performed and who either have risk factors for procedural complications (eg, bleeding, difficult arterial access, kidney dysfunction) or present to a center without access to invasive coronary angiography.
        </p>
        <p>
         Invasive angiography with appropriate PCI is typically performed within 48 hours of presentation. However, it is reasonable to perform angiography within 24 hours in high-risk patients, including those with multiple risk factors for MI (eg, diabetes, known coronary artery disease [CAD]) or who have a

          Invasive strategy or selective angiography
         </strong>
         – Our approach to choosing between an invasive strategy and selective angiography is based on our experience as well as the results of large trials and meta-analyses. In general, trials show that an invasive strategy decreases the risk of MI but does not reduce the risk of death compared with selective angiography. However, the direct application of these results to practice is limited based on the variable definitions of ischemia (eg, symptoms only versus objective evidence), use of older troponin assays, limited use of modern antiplatelet therapies, predominant use of femoral rather than radial access, and high risk of bias. The results of these trials were summarized by a meta-analysis published in 2017:

         In a meta-analysis, patients assigned to an invasive strategy had a lower risk of acute MI (3.1 versus 4.8 percent with a conservative strategy, risk ratio [RR] 0.79, 95% CI 0.63-1.0) and refractory angina (20 versus 33 percent; RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.52-0.79) but similar rates of mortality (3.7 versus 4.2 percent; RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.76-1.08) [
         <a href="#rid3">

          Timing of angiography for an invasive strategy
         </strong>
         – Trials that evaluated the timing of angiography among patients undergoing an invasive strategy generally showed similar effects between angiography within 12 to 24 hours and angiography performed prior to discharge. However, there was a broad array of time-to-angiography in these trials. In subgroup analyses of patients at high risk for adverse cardiac events, there were conflicting results on the value of coronary angiography within 24 hours:

         <a href="#rid4">

         ]. Very early and standard angiography occurred at a median of 5 and 62 hours, respectively, after randomization. At a median follow-up of 4.3 years, assignment to very early strategy was associated with a lower risk of nonfatal acute MI (8.4 versus 11.2 percent; hazard ratio [HR] 0.73, 95% CI 0.56-0.96) but not with a lower incidence of death (12.2 versus 12.6 percent) or the primary composite endpoint (27.5 versus 29.5 percent).

         ]. The trials were performed between 2000 and 2016, and the median follow-up was 180 days. Due to differences in the trials' definition of early and delayed angiography, "early" angiography included patients in whom angiography was performed within 24 hours of presentation, while "delayed" angiography included patients in whom angiography was performed between 12 to 108 hours after presentation. The rates of mortality (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.64-1.03) and nonfatal MI (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.57-1.46) were similar between the two groups.

         In subgroup analyses, patients with elevated biomarkers, diabetes, a GRACE risk score more than 140 points, or who were 75 years of age or greater had lower point estimates of mortality with an early invasive strategy, but these effects did not reach statistical significance.

          Role of risk scores
         </strong>
         – The contributors to this topic have different approaches to routine use of risk scores. The GRACE and TIMI risk scores are accurate scores with extensive validation data, but some experts perceive the routine use of these scores to be cumbersome. In trials that evaluated the effects of the routine use of risk scores, the impact of scores on processes of care was variable, and rates of death and MI were similar to usual care:

         In a trial that included 3050 patients with NSTEACS, management with routine use of the GRACE risk score or with usual care had similar rates of adherence to guideline-recommended processes of care (77 versus 75 percent), cardiovascular death (3.3 versus 3.5 percent), nonfatal MI (6.6 versus 5.7 percent), and new-onset HF (4.2 versus 4.8 percent) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7

         ]. Participating hospitals managed clusters of patients with usual care and then with risk model-based care (ie, stepped wedge design), which may have biased the trial result toward no effect.

         Another trial, which was stopped early due to futility, demonstrated that patients with acute coronary syndrome managed with the GRACE risk score were more likely to undergo an early invasive strategy (92 versus 84 percent; odds ratio [OR] 2.3, 95% CI 1.3-4.0), but rates of mortality and MI were similar in patients managed with or without a risk score at 12 months (9.2 versus 13.4 percent in those managed without a risk score; OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.38-1.14) [

         In patients who have a presentation suspicious for myocardial ischemia or infarction but who have normal troponin and ECG findings (ie, unstable angina), we typically observe the patient in a monitored setting and obtain additional ECGs and troponin testing  (

          No evidence of ischemia or infarction is detected

         – In patients who have no signs of NSTEMI after appropriate monitoring, we use a heart pathway  (

          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ) to determine the next steps in the diagnostic evaluation. In general, patients with indeterminate findings (eg, T-wave inversions) or significant risk factors for ischemia may undergo stress or anatomic imaging prior to discharge, while patients without clear evidence of ischemia who are at very low risk of death or MI may be managed without imaging but with rapid outpatient evaluation. The detailed approach to management of these patients is discussed separately. (See

        <p>

         This approach agrees with European guidelines, while United States guidelines endorse invasive coronary angiography prior to discharge for low-risk patients [

        <p>
         Since routine angiography is not clearly associated with a mortality benefit in this group of patients, and there is no evidence of ongoing ischemia or infarction, these patients can undergo stress (eg, nuclear perfusion) or anatomic imaging (eg, CCTA) to further assess for the presence of obstructive CAD. Details on the evidence for this approach are discussed separately. (See
