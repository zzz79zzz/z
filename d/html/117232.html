         Gas in the pleural space is termed pneumothorax. Pneumothorax can be a life-threatening condition that needs prompt attention. The management strategies of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP; presents in the absence of an external factor/underlying cause) and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP; presents as a complication of underlying lung disease)  (

         The management of PSP is discussed in this topic review. The etiology and diagnosis of pneumothorax and the management of SSP are discussed separately. (See

         Following the radiographic identification of PSP, clinicians should quickly estimate the stability of the patient and the symptom burden so that appropriate therapy can be initiated. The principle focus of PSP management is to relieve symptoms and stop the air leak rather than rapidly expanding the lung to achieve radiographic resolution (ie, "treating the chest radiograph"), which does not necessarily stop the air leak. The assessment of size, while reasonable, is now less important in determining a treatment strategy. Size assessment is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/117242.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical presentation and diagnosis of pneumothorax", section on 'Pneumothorax size'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The approach to managing PSP varies widely among institutions and across continents. Our approach expands upon that outlined in several published clinical consensus statements and guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP; 2001), the British Thoracic Society (BTS; 2023), the European Respiratory Society (2015), and the Japanese Association for Chest Surgery (2014) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-4
         </a>
         ]. Our approach is one that prioritizes patient safety and symptom control, preferably with minimal intervention, to avoid associated pain and risks.

         All patients with PSP should receive resuscitation with a focus on airway stabilization (if needed), supplemental oxygen to treat hypoxemia (if present), and the provision of adequate analgesia (if indicated). PSP is rarely life-threatening, and the associated breathlessness is typically mild, often only affecting severe exertion; some patients may also experience pain. The clinical features of pneumothorax are described separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/117242.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Subsequent management is directed at deciding whether air needs to be removed from the pleural space and, if so, by what means. Treatment selection is determined by patient stability and symptom burden, the details of which are discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Assessment of symptom burden and stability'

         Symptom burden – In patients with PSP, dyspnea is often mild and may only be experienced during ambulation. Pain may also be present, and the burden substantially relieved with analgesia. We typically ask if the symptoms occur at rest or during exertion, how they impact activities of daily living, and whether they are perceived as mild or significant. However, assessing symptom burden is challenging since it is perceived differently by each patient and symptoms exist on a spectrum (rather than on a binary scale). (See

          Role of oxygen
         </strong>
         – Limited data support the role of oxygen unless it is required for hypoxemia, which is rare in PSP, and if present, should prompt the clinician to look for an underlying lung disorder. Although frequently administered, we believe that it is unlikely that supplementary oxygen provides clinically relevant benefits if the underlying air leak is still active. High flow oxygen via nasal cannulae (HFNC) should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be used since a small amount of positive pressure is delivered to the upper airway and could theoretically worsen the pneumothorax. For similar reasons, noninvasive positive pressure should also be avoided. (See

         We are not proponents of administering oxygen solely as a potential therapy to improve the resorption of air from the pleural space. Although commonly administered, only data from animal models report an increased rate of resorption of air from the pleural space when humidified 100 percent oxygen is administered compared with room air [

         Options for clinically stable patients with a PSP who have significant dyspnea after adequate analgesia include aspiration or catheter or chest tube thoracostomy with or without an ambulatory device. For most patients, aspiration via a catheter is traditionally performed (provided that expertise is available), although approaches that incorporate ambulatory devices are gaining acceptance. The rationale for this approach is based upon meta-analyses of small randomized trials that report similar recurrence rates at one year and shorter hospital stays with aspiration compared with catheter or chest tube thoracostomy [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ] and a large randomized trial that reported that aspiration was better tolerated with fewer adverse events compared with catheter/tube drainage [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. These trials are discussed in detail below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Aspiration'

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In practice, choosing between aspiration and catheter or chest tube thoracostomy with or without an ambulatory device is often dependent upon availability of local expertise, severity of the presentation, and patient preference. For example, aspiration is less painful than catheter or chest tube insertion. However, the initial failure rate is higher with aspiration (on average one-third of patients), thereby necessitating a second procedure. Some clinicians choose catheter or chest tube thoracostomy when expertise in aspiration is not available or for patients with bilateral or very large pneumothoraces (eg, complete collapse, mediastinal shift), concurrent hemothorax or pleural effusion necessitating drainage, or complex loculated pneumothorax (unusual in PSP).

        <p>
         Although a conservative approach such as observation has been shown to be equivalent to aspiration or catheter/tube drainage in patients with large PSP [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ], patients with significant dyspnea generally do not meet the stability criteria necessary for observation. Data to support observation in stable patients with mild symptoms are discussed above. (See

         Aspiration can be performed using a venous catheter or, more commonly, a catheter from a commercial thoracentesis kit. Using a Seldinger technique, the catheter is typically introduced into the second intercostal space at the midclavicular line. This may need to vary if the lung is tethered on chest radiograph (ie, loculated pneumothorax). Once the catheter is in place, air is manually aspirated usually until resistance is met or when about 2.5 L of air has been removed.

         Once resistance is felt during aspiration and no more air can be aspirated, different approaches may be applied at the discretion of the clinician [

         If the lung is fully expanded and symptoms have improved, the catheter can be removed and the patient discharged with appropriate clinical and radiographic follow up within 24 to 48 hours [

         Alternatively, the catheter can be left in place and attached to a portable one-way valve  (

         <a href="#rid1">
          1,15,16

         If aspiration fails (eg, no resistance after aspiration of a significant volume of air), it is likely that there is a persistent air leak (PAL). Depending on the circumstances, the aspiration catheter can be left in situ and connected to an underwater seal drainage system or a catheter or chest tube can be placed to provide ongoing drainage, usually as an inpatient.

         Several studies support aspiration in patients with a PSP rather than catheter or chest tube thoracostomy (small- or large-bore); most are observational or small randomized trials that report efficacy rates ranging from 30 to 80 percent, shorter hospital stays, and fewer complications with aspiration [

         One 2017 meta-analysis of six studies (435 patients) reported that simple aspiration was associated with a shorter hospital stay (mean difference -1.66 days, 95% CI -2.28 to -1.04) and a lower adverse event rate compared with tube thoracostomy without an ambulatory device. Aspiration was associated with lower rates of immediate success (risk ratio [RR] 0.78, 95% CI 0.69-0.89), although the success rates at one year were the same in both interventions (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.96-1.18) [

         O (to avoid variations from manual aspiration) for 30 minutes and could be repeated. Despite an initial lower rate of full radiographic expansion in the aspiration group (71 versus 82 percent), there was a similar one-year recurrence rate in both groups (20 percent [aspiration] versus 27 percent [chest tube]). Consistent with other studies, patients in the aspiration group reported less pain (mean difference: -1.4 on a 10-point scale).

         A randomized clinical trial tested a device ('Pleural Vent') for ambulatory drainage of PSP. The device consists of a small-bore catheter attached to a one-way valve and is usually placed in the anterior upper chest [

          17

         ]. In that study, 236 patients were randomly assigned to the ambulatory device for PSP drainage or standard care (aspiration with a 14 to 16 gauge cannula followed by the insertion of a chest tube, if aspiration was ineffective). Included patients were young (16 to 55 years of age; mean 30 years), had symptoms, were clinically stable, and had no evidence of underlying lung disease.

         In the ambulatory arm, patients were observed for one to two hours and if a chest radiograph showed no progression, the patients were discharged, provided they had no oxygen requirements and were clinically stable, mobile, and able to care for themselves.

Although the ambulatory strategy was associated with a lower rate of recurrence at seven days (7 versus 19 percent), the recurrence rate at 12 months was similar (24 versus 28 percent) as was the surgical referral rate (28 versus 22 percent).

         We often choose small-bore catheters, which are increasingly used, because they are easy to place, less painful, and are sufficiently effective in most patients compared with tube thoracostomy. While both can be placed blindly, ultrasound or other imaging modalities (eg, fluoroscopy, computed tomography [CT]) should be used to guide placement when the pneumothorax is small or loculated. However, if the patient has impending respiratory failure or hemodynamic instability due to pneumothorax, tube thoracostomy without image guidance should be performed immediately as a life-saving maneuver.

It is unusual in this population that an indication for a large-bore chest tube (eg, 22 to 28 French) is present unless the patient is unstable with tension pneumothorax, concomitant drainage of viscous pleural fluid (eg, empyema) or blood is needed, or small-bore catheter drainage is insufficient.

         For patients with a PSP in whom a catheter or chest tube has been placed, follow-up over the subsequent one to five days usually involves daily bedside assessment for symptoms (such as presence of an air leak or surgical emphysema) and for complications of the catheter or chest tube (eg, blockage, pain, bleeding). Daily imaging with chest radiography is not always necessary, although frequent imaging is typically performed to assess the degree of lung expansion. Imaging should also be obtained when symptoms worsen to evaluate for worsening pneumothorax on the ipsilateral side or development of a new pneumothorax on the contralateral side as well as for tube thoracostomy position.
        </p>
        <p>
         Digital devices to quantify the size of the air leak have been described but are not typically routine [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. Limited data suggest that measuring the leak size with digital manometry to identify those with large leaks predicts treatment failure and a longer hospital stay, although further data are needed to confirm this finding [

         </a>
         ].
        </p>

         – Once the air leak has sealed and the lung is fully expanded, we clamp the catheter/chest tube for 4 to 12 hours. Clamping the catheter/tube prevents inapparent drainage of small amounts of air through the underwater seal system and thus allows recognition of small leaks that would otherwise be missed. Some experts prefer not to clamp the tube because this might lead to the development of a tension pneumothorax.

         Clamping should only be performed in units with sufficient nursing experience and precautions should be followed, for example, to keep the clamp outside the bedclothes and visible, instructing the bedside nurse about releasing it if the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable or significantly symptomatic, and obtaining and examining the chest radiograph after a set period (eg, 4 to 12 hours).

         A small proportion of patients with a PSP develop a PAL. An air leak is considered prolonged if it continues for five days or longer, although varying definitions exist in the literature ranging from three to seven days. Our general approach is the following:

          Check leak source
         </strong>
         – We check that the leak is not coming from the drainage chamber, from the tubing, or from around the catheter/chest tube at the skin entry site. This is classically done by clamping the tube at different locations to isolate the site of the leak or by flushing

          saline
         </a>
         up the tube to look for the source of the leak. If the leak is coming from the system, a new drainage procedure may need to be performed. If the leak is alveolar in origin, then a plan needs to be in place to close the defect.

         <strong>
          Plan for defect closure
         </strong>
         – If it is determined that the defect is due to PAL, patients generally require defect closure. This approach is based upon the premise that the longer an air leak persists, it is less likely that the leak will close spontaneously and more likely that a definitive intervention (eg, surgical repair of the leak) will be required [
         <a href="#rid4">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         However, the exact approach to defect closure varies among experts and depends upon factors including the degree of lung expansion, local expertise, and patient values and preferences. We use a multidisciplinary approach that includes an interventional pulmonologist and a thoracic surgeon to facilitate this decision. Notably, the listed procedures in the approach outlined in the bullets below are primarily done to seal the air leak rather than prevent recurrence:

         For patients with PSP and a PAL, surgery is the preferred option, usually video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) repair of the defect followed by pleurodesis. This is irrespective of the size of the residual pneumothorax. This preference is based upon the limited likelihood that the leak will resolve spontaneously and that VATS repair is the most effective means to achieve this endpoint. Data that support the efficacy of VATS are discussed below (See

         When surgery is not feasible/available, alternatives include ambulatory drainage devices, continued catheter or chest tube drainage, chemical pleurodesis, autologous blood patch, and endobronchial valves. Choosing among these is dependent upon local expertise and patient preference.

         For patients with previous PSP who recur with an ipsilateral or contralateral pneumothorax, the acute management should be similar to that of the first episode. However, a definitive procedure to prevent recurrence (eg, surgical pleurodesis) should be considered during the same admission or very soon after discharge.
        </p>
        <p>
         The rationale for this approach is based upon the high risk of recurrence and, additionally, in the case of contralateral pneumothorax, the risk of bilateral pneumothorax. (See

         The rationale for a definitive procedure in these patients is based upon the assumption (not supported by evidence) that, among patients with PSP, the risk of recurrence and risk of harm from recurrence is greatest in these subgroups (see

          "Pneumothorax: Definitive management and prevention of recurrence", section on 'Incidence of recurrence'
         </a>
         ). Data to support these indications, however, are sparse. In one small study of 214 patients with PSP (&gt;2 cm from the pleural line to the chest wall), at one year, chemical pleurodesis with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9653" href="/z/d/drug information/9653.html" rel="external">
          minocycline
         </a>
         was more effective at preventing recurrence than no pleurodesis (29 versus 50 percent) [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. Future studies should focus on defining which patients with PSP are at the highest risk of recurrence so that a targeted preventive intervention may be performed selectively.

         Other reasons to opt for a definitive procedure include the following:

         Patients with a first PSP who have another indication for thoracoscopy. For example, some patients who require a diagnostic lung biopsy (eg, if catamenial pneumothorax is suspected) or patients with hemopneumothorax who need a thoracoscopy to remove frank blood from the pleural space (ie, to avoid future trapped lung). In these circumstances, some surgeons choose to perform a definitive procedure (eg, abrasion and/or blebectomy) at the time of surgery because the additional risk is considered relatively low.

         Following resolution of a pneumothorax, whether spontaneously, with a thoracostomy or with an ambulatory device, or after a definitive procedure, patients should be clinically and radiologically evaluated in about two to four weeks as outpatients. In the intervening period, they are instructed to return to the hospital if they develop symptoms of chest pain or dyspnea since recurrence is greatest during the first month after presentation.

          Smoking
         </strong>
         – We advise patients to stop smoking cigarettes as well as other tobacco products, marijuana, and illicit drugs. Although poorly studied, the strong association between smoking and pneumothorax suggests that smoking cessation may help prevent recurrence [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. In addition, smoking has been shown in one retrospective study to predict a higher recurrence rate in those who undergo pleurodesis [

          Inquiry into familial history/genetics

         – For some patients, a spontaneous pneumothorax can be the first indication of a genetic disorder [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome, Marfan syndrome, tuberous sclerosis-related lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can all present with pneumothorax. Thus, consideration of family history, suggestive physical findings, and/or chest CT findings may lead to a referral to a geneticist and potential benefits of surveillance for other extrapulmonary complications for the patient and their family members.

          Air travel

         – An acute pneumothorax is an absolute contraindication for air travel. After therapy, the optimal time for avoiding air travel is unknown but patients are typically advised not to travel by air for at least one to three weeks. However, it likely depends upon the type of treatment the patient received (eg, simple aspiration, tube thoracostomy, chemical or mechanical pleurodesis) and the estimated risk of recurrence. Air travel and pneumothorax is discussed in greater detail separately. (See

          Management of a clinically stable patient with PSP and significant dyspnea
         </strong>
         – For most patients with PSP who are clinically stable and have moderate or significant dyspnea after adequate analgesia, we suggest a simple aspiration drainage procedure (typically with a catheter) rather than a catheter or chest tube thoracostomy (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). The aspiration procedure is described above. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Significant symptoms (dyspnea)'
         </a>
         above and

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The rationale for this approach is based upon data from randomized trials that report similar recurrence rates, shorter hospital stays, better tolerance, and fewer adverse effects with aspiration compared with thoracostomy. However, in practice, choosing between aspiration and catheter or chest tube thoracostomy or an ambulatory drainage device is often dependent upon local expertise, severity of the presentation, and patient preference.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Patients in whom aspiration fails or is not feasible (eg, expertise is lacking) require definitive drainage with catheter or chest tube thoracostomy. The advantage of catheter or chest tube thoracostomy is that they are widely available, have lower immediate failure rates when compared with aspiration, and can be used for continued drainage using a water seal device (requiring hospital admission) or an ambulatory device (allowing select patients to be discharged).

         ) and patients with severe dyspnea, tension pneumothorax, bilateral pneumothorax, concurrent hemothorax, a pleural effusion necessitating drainage, or complex loculated pneumothorax (unusual in PSP) require an intervention. For most patients, we suggest a definitive drainage procedure (eg, catheter or chest tube thoracostomy) rather than a simple aspiration procedure (

          Grade 2C

          Persistent air leak (PAL)
         </strong>
         – In patients with PSP who have a persistent air leak (PAL; eg, beyond five to seven days), we suggest video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) repair of the defect rather than continued drainage (

         </a>
         ). This approach is based upon the limited likelihood that the leak will resolve spontaneously and that VATS repair is the most effective means to achieve this defect closure. When surgery is not feasible/available, alternative options include ambulatory drainage devices, continued catheter or chest tube drainage, chemical pleurodesis, autologous blood patch, and endobronchial valve placement. Choosing among these is dependent upon expertise and patient preference. (See
