In women, CKD leads to hypogonadism, which manifests clinically as menstrual irregularities, anovulation, reduced libido, and infertility [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Many of these disturbances typically persist after these patients have initiated chronic dialysis. Pregnancy occurs rarely among women with advanced kidney failure, and, even when conception is successful, it is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. In addition, women with CKD have an earlier onset of menopause compared with the general population. Abnormalities also occur in a significant proportion of men with moderate to severe CKD, who may complain of decreased libido, erectile dysfunction (ED), gynecomastia, and impaired fertility. Although some of these problems may improve with maintenance dialysis, they rarely normalize and frequently contribute to a decreased quality of life. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6840.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and etiologies of male sexual dysfunction"</a>.)</p><p>Kidney transplantation helps to restore sexual and reproductive function in both females and males, although certain features of reproductive function may remain impaired. This topic will review issues relevant to the sexual and reproductive health of patients who have undergone kidney transplantation. A discussion of pregnancy in kidney donors and in nontransplant patients with underlying kidney disease is presented separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/103489.html" rel="external">"Kidney transplantation in adults: Risk of living kidney donation", section on 'Maternal and fetal outcomes'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7205.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy and contraception in patients with nondialysis chronic kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>In this topic, when discussing study results, we will use the terms "woman/en" or "patient(s)" as they are used in the studies presented. We encourage the reader to consider the specific counseling and treatment needs of transgender and gender expansive individuals.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1359078286"><span class="h1">SEXUAL FUNCTION AFTER TRANSPLANTATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1549492695"><span class="h2">In females</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Disturbances in menstruation, fertility, and sexual function are common in females with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) due to abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis that result in varying degrees of hypogonadism. Patients with ESKD frequently report oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, anovulation, decreased libido, problems with vaginal lubrication, and the inability to achieve orgasm [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Such women commonly have elevated circulating levels of prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) and reduced levels of estradiol and progesterone. In addition, the preovulatory LH surge is typically absent in these patients.</p><p>After kidney transplantation, many of these hormonal disturbances improve rapidly (as early as a few weeks posttransplant), and, in many patients, the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis can normalize as early as six months posttransplant [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. As restoration of fertility can occur rapidly, contraception should be planned before transplantation. Initiation of estrogen-containing contraceptives should be delayed until six weeks after transplantation to avoid the increased risk of thrombotic event during the perioperative period. (See <a class="local">'Contraception'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition, libido and sexual function frequently improve after transplantation. In one study of 33 female kidney transplant recipients, loss of libido went from 70 percent pretransplant to 10 percent posttransplant [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The degree of improvement of sexual health may also be impacted by the health of the allograft, the presence of other comorbidities (such as diabetes and hypertension), certain medications, and psychological factors.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4094642750"><span class="h2">In males</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A significant proportion of men with advanced CKD experience disturbances in sexual function, including erectile dysfunction (ED), decreased libido, and a decline in the frequency of intercourse. These abnormalities may improve but rarely normalize with the institution of maintenance dialysis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6840.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and etiologies of male sexual dysfunction"</a>.)</p><p>However, sexual and reproductive health generally improve in most men after kidney transplantation. An improvement in reproductive function occurs in association with normalization of the serum testosterone concentration and, in many patients, an increase in sperm count [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. In addition, serum levels of FSH, LH, and prolactin, which are usually increased in uremic men, begin to improve as early as a few weeks after a successful kidney transplant and approach normal levels within a few months posttransplant [<a href="#rid3">3,7,8</a>]. The degree of improvement in sexual and reproductive health is also impacted by other factors, including the health of the allograft, other comorbidities (such as diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and smoking history), certain medications, recipient age, as well as psychological factors.</p><p>As with female transplant recipients, male recipients should be counseled about the potential for improvements in sexual and reproductive health posttransplant. For men who wish to conceive, routine semen analysis is not advised, unless additional risk factors for infertility are present (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7473.html" rel="external">"Causes of male infertility"</a>). Sexually active men should be reminded of the importance of preventing sexually transmitted infections (STIs) with condoms when not in a long-term, monogamous relationship. However, some men, especially those with multiple comorbidities, may continue to experience some degree of impairment, particularly with reduced libido and ED.</p><p>Immunosuppressive agents used in kidney transplantation may affect male fertility. Although numerous reports have indicated that male transplant recipients can successfully father healthy offspring [<a href="#rid9">9</a>], some studies suggest that mammalian (mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10329" href="/d/drug information/10329.html" rel="external">sirolimus</a> may cause impaired spermatogenesis and reduce male fertility [<a href="#rid10">10-13</a>]. This is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7329.html" rel="external">"Pharmacology of mammalian (mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors", section on 'Teratogenicity/effects on pregnancy and fertility'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3014408090"><span class="h1">CONTRACEPTION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H645479237"><span class="h2">Female contraception</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We advise that women of childbearing age receive counseling regarding contraception before undergoing transplantation and again at posttransplant clinic visits. Since sexual function in women improves within a few weeks posttransplant, we recommend that clinicians and patients discuss a contraceptive plan prior to transplant and that women initiate contraception before they resume sexual activity. Such discussion is particularly important because the immunosuppressant <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9670" href="/d/drug information/9670.html" rel="external">mycophenolate</a> appears to decrease serum estrogen concentrations, which could theoretically reduce efficacy of estrogen-progestin contraceptives (pill, ring, or patch) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. We also review data indicating that female transplant recipients should avoid pregnancy during the first posttransplant year. (See <a class="local">'Timing of conception'</a> below.)</p><p>The optimal form of contraception for transplant recipients is not known and is individualized based upon the side-effect profile [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. Thus, we educate women who desire to avoid pregnancy about all contraceptive methods that are reasonable choices given their medical issues and encourage the use of the most effective types  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef119765" href="/d/graphic/119765.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The approach to contraceptive selection is presented in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5459.html" rel="external">"Contraception: Counseling and selection"</a>.)</p><p>For women who desire reversible contraception, we first discuss long-acting reversible contraception because these methods have the highest efficacy rates  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef119765" href="/d/graphic/119765.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Long-acting reversible contraception methods include the intrauterine devices (IUDs) and the progestin-releasing implant. For women who elect contraceptive pills, patch, or ring, we discuss that antibiotic use, with the exception of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9864" href="/d/drug information/9864.html" rel="external">rifampin</a>, does not decrease efficacy [<a href="#rid17">17-20</a>]. We prefer to delay the start of estrogen-containing contraceptives (pills, ring, or patch) until six weeks posttransplant because of the increased risk of thromboembolic events with estrogen use. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Freproductivehealth%2Fcontraception%2Fpdf%2Fsummary-chart-us-medical-eligibility-criteria_508tagged.pdf&amp;token=p7A56cdQa48oh8HfN4dMPEKlrim7QFIQY%2FuVV%2FJckGU937u1ckJkmkgaK8H2PBoY%2FJ5BEapx7DHdp5gqM%2BK1cZFvupA973jfwqlDuJ3YBVeBCZhIb4QeOsKswDD%2B1dvSISE9r%2BIvb9WDleMu0Qs%2FMQ%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=113826" target="_blank">Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use 2016</a> help guide the counseling of women with solid organ transplants based on the type of transplant, other comorbid issues, and concomitant medication use [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Uncomplicated transplant</strong> – Women with uncomplicated kidney transplants can use any method compatible with their other medical issues as the benefits are believed to outweigh any theoretical or proven risks. Specifically, although supporting data are limited, women with kidney transplants can use either the copper or levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs (eg, new start or continuation of existing device), the progestin-only methods (implant, injection, or pills), or estrogen-containing methods (pill, patch, or ring). Women with risk factors for thromboembolic disease should generally avoid estrogen-containing contraceptives regardless of transplant status. In our practice, we also prefer to avoid the progestin injection because long-term use is associated with reduced bone density independent of that associated with kidney transplantation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7399.html" rel="external">"Combined estrogen-progestin contraception: Side effects and health concerns", section on 'Cardiovascular effects'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/100623.html" rel="external">"Kidney transplantation in adults: Bone disease after kidney transplantation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Complicated transplant</strong> – Women with complicated solid organ transplants (eg, those with acute or chronic graft failure, rejection, or cardiac allograft vasculopathy) can continue existing IUDs but are not advised to initiate new ones, although supporting data are sparse. These women can use any of the progestin-only methods. Use of estrogen-containing contraceptives is not advised for women with complicated transplants, although this guidance is mainly based on one study that reported serious adverse events in 8 percent (2/26) of women using estrogen-progestin contraceptive pills and a case report of a woman who developed cholestasis while taking high-dose estrogen-progestin contraceptive pills.</p><p></p><p>Women who desire permanent contraception are offered female tubal ligation or placement of a long-acting reversible contraceptive as the efficacy is the same between these methods  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef119765" href="/d/graphic/119765.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Use of long-acting reversible contraceptives eliminates the need for surgery and the resultant risk of surgical complications.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3194095981"><span class="h2">Male contraception</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We advise that men receive counseling regarding fathering and contraception before transplantation and again at the posttransplant clinic visits. Since sexual function in men tends to improve within a few weeks posttransplant, and fathering a pregnancy becomes a distinct possibility, we recommend that men use contraception after transplant as soon as they become sexually active.</p><p>For men who desire permanent contraception, we offer vasectomy. For men who desire reversible contraception, male condoms are the main option. However, for some men with erectile dysfunction (ED), condoms can worsen the sexual experience, which leaves these patients without a reliable contraceptive method [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. While some men practice withdrawal, the pregnancy rate is over 20 percent per 100 women per years with this method, and, therefore, this approach is not advised  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef119765" href="/d/graphic/119765.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1507485291"><span class="h2">Emergency contraception</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Women with kidney transplants can use emergency contraception (EC) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].

However, despite the return of fertility after kidney transplantation, the rates of both pregnancy and successful pregnancy remain far lower than in the general population. Pregnancy in the transplant recipient is considered high risk given the multiple risk factors for both the mother and the developing fetus, and kidney transplant recipients who are considering pregnancy should be managed by a high-risk obstetrician in conjunction with a transplant nephrologist.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2226947096"><span class="h2">Obstetric outcomes</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2589731973"><span class="h3">Maternal outcomes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Available data on pregnancy outcomes in posttransplant pregnancy are primarily derived from case reports, single-center studies, and four voluntary registries including the Transplant Pregnancy Registry International (TPR; previously known as the United States National Transplantation Pregnancy Registry [NTPR]), the Transplant Pregnancy Registry of the United Kingdom, the European Renal Association – European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) registry, and the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA).

There was also a temporal trend toward reduced pregnancy rates over time, ranging from 59 per 1000 women in 1990 to 19 per 1000 women in 2003.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The reason for such a marked reduction in the fertility rate in women of childbearing potential is unclear. While the difference could be explained, to some extent, by the degree of chronic kidney disease (CKD) observed in the transplant population, other potential explanations include the deliberate avoidance of pregnancy secondary to more education and overall knowledge about the high-risk nature of posttransplant pregnancies, the uncertainties regarding immunosuppression during pregnancy and its impact on the fetus, fear of allograft loss, changing views on women's health, and better education regarding the use of different contraceptive methods.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Live birth rate</strong> – Among kidney transplant recipients who do conceive, the live birth rate appears to be comparable with that of the general population. As an example, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 50 studies (4706 pregnancies in 3570 kidney transplant recipients) reported a live birth rate among transplant recipients of 73.5 percent, compared with 66.7 percent in the general population [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Other retrospective studies have found similar live birth rates ranging from 71 to 79 percent [<a href="#rid28">28,32-34</a>]. One study, however, has reported a lower live birth rate in transplant recipients. In the large, longitudinal cohort study mentioned above, 55 percent of pregnancies resulted in a live birth compared with nearly 70 percent in the general population [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Although the proportion of successful pregnancies remained relatively constant between 1990 and 2003, the reasons for fetal loss changed over time. The unadjusted rate of therapeutic abortions declined from 19 to 6 percent, while fetal loss due to other causes increased from 25 to 37 percent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cesarean delivery</strong> – Although a trial of vaginal labor is advised, kidney transplant recipients have a higher risk of cesarean delivery compared with the general population, with a reported frequency of 43 to 72 percent [<a href="#rid29">29,32,33,35</a>]. In a study of the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS), the risk of cesarean section in kidney transplant recipients was nearly fivefold higher than in the general population [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. The most common indications for cesarean delivery before the onset of labor included concern for fetal well-being (23 percent), previous cesarean section (19 percent), and deteriorating kidney function (16 percent), whereas the most common indication for in-labor cesarean section was fetal distress (67 percent). Three percent of cesarean deliveries were performed only because the patient had a kidney transplant, in the absence of a clinical indication.

In the UKOSS study cited above, among 105 pregnancies in 101 recipients, there were no maternal deaths [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Studies in nontransplant patients with CKD suggest that the risk of maternal death is limited to women with immunologic disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus or vasculitis [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].

In the analysis of the UKOSS cohort mentioned above, transplant recipients had a 12-fold higher risk of delivering a low birth weight baby compared with the general population [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].

In one study of 105 pregnancies in 101 recipients, the median serum creatinine decreased from 1.33 mg/dL (118 micromol/L) before pregnancy to 1.18 mg/dL (104 micromol/L) in the first and second trimesters, then rose to 1.39 (123 micromol/L) in the third trimester [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. However, 49 percent of patients did not experience a reduction in serum creatinine during the second trimester, and a reduction in graft function (defined as an increase in serum creatinine of ≥20 percent from the lowest level in pregnancy) occurred in 38 percent. Among those with a reported cause for the increased creatinine, 63 percent were attributed to preeclampsia and 11 percent to acute rejection. In another study, the increase in 24-hour creatinine clearance measured at 10 weeks of gestation was comparable between transplant recipients and healthy nontransplant women (34 versus 38 percent) [<a href="#rid54">54</a>].</p><p>Urine protein excretion also increases during pregnancy due to hyperfiltration, and this increase has been shown to be greater in pregnant kidney transplant recipients compared with healthy pregnant women.

The obstetrician should review operative notes from the transplant procedure to confirm location of the allograft and ureter. As the need for cesarean delivery for obstetric reasons is unpredictable, clinicians can perform an ultrasound in the third trimester to confirm the anatomic location of the graft in the setting of the gravid uterus. This information should be placed in the prenatal record to guide the surgeon if a cesarean delivery is required. Prophylactic antibiotics are warranted to avoid complications in these immunocompromised patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Planned cesarean delivery</strong> – If a cesarean delivery is planned, obtaining preoperative input from a transplant surgeon is recommended to discuss potential surgical challenges and anatomic alternations relating to the transplant. In addition, surgical support from the transplant team should be available in case of complication. A keen awareness, both before and during surgery, of the anatomy and position of the transplanted kidney, the donor ureter, and the recipient's bladder in relationship to the gravid uterus is critical to avoid unintentional injury to these organs. Injury to the allograft is uncommon with cesarean delivery but has been reported following a Pfannenstiel (ie, horizontal) incision [<a href="#rid72">72</a>].

Among those who had a trial of labor, most (71 percent) had a vaginal delivery. Compared with scheduled cesarean delivery, a trial of labor was not associated with an increase in severe maternal morbidity and was associated with decreased odds of neonatal composite morbidity (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.52 and 0.36 for those resulting in cesarean and vaginal delivery, respectively).

Similar to pregnant nontransplant patients with chronic hypertension, hypertensive transplant recipients are at a higher risk for a variety of obstetrical complications including preeclampsia and eclampsia. In addition, the presence of prepregnancy hypertension in transplant patients has been associated with IUGR, low birth weight, miscarriage, and preterm delivery [<a href="#rid29">29,32</a>]. Thus, blood pressure should be closely monitored in kidney transplant recipients throughout pregnancy, both during clinic visits as well as by patients daily at home.</p><p>There are no definitive recommendations to guide the optimal blood pressure goal in pregnant kidney transplant recipients. The 2005 AST report on the Consensus Conference on Reproductive Issues and Transplantation states that blood pressure should be maintained close to normal [<a href="#rid31">31</a>], although it was noted that this target differs from higher blood pressure goals of existing guidelines for pregnant women with chronic hypertension without end-organ damage. In pregnant kidney transplant recipients with preexisting hypertension, our treatment target is a systolic pressure of 120 to 140 mmHg and diastolic pressure of 80 to 90 mmHg. In those who do not have preexisting hypertension, we initiate antihypertensive therapy when the blood pressure is consistently &gt;140/90 mmHg.

Clinicians should be aware that the natural decrease in blood pressure during pregnancy seen in the nontransplant population can be blunted in pregnant transplant patients. As mentioned above, urine protein excretion increases (up to threefold by the third trimester) during pregnancy due to hyperfiltration, making it difficult to distinguish this physiologic change from the proteinuria of preeclampsia, rejection, or other allograft injury, particularly in patients with preexisting proteinuria prior to pregnancy. (See <a class="local">'Effect of pregnancy on graft function and outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition, the typical rise in serum uric acid seen in nonpregnant transplant patients on CNIs may also make it more difficult to accurately establish the diagnosis of preeclampsia.

While most patients are asymptomatic, presenting only with an elevation in serum creatinine and/or proteinuria, those with more serious rejection may present with fever, oliguria, and graft pain or tenderness. Occasionally, the diagnosis may be missed in patients with subtle increases in serum creatinine and/or proteinuria, which can be masked by the normal pregnancy-related changes in GFR and proteinuria. Rejection must also be distinguished from preeclampsia (see <a class="local">'Preeclampsia'</a> above), which can also present with an increase in serum creatinine and proteinuria, and acute pyelonephritis, which can present with fever and graft tenderness. In patients who are suspected of having acute rejection, an ultrasound-guided kidney allograft biopsy should be performed to establish the diagnosis and guide treatment. This procedure is generally safe and well tolerated in pregnancy, although data regarding kidney allograft biopsies in pregnancy are limited [<a href="#rid78">78-80</a>].</p><p>Treatment options are limited because of the potential fetotoxicity of many of the agents normally used to treat acute rejection.

Although both plasma volume and red blood cell (RBC) mass increase during pregnancy as a result of increasing erythropoietin levels, the expansion in plasma volume is disproportionately greater than the increase in RBC mass, and, therefore, a dilutional anemia can occur. Transplant-specific factors such as iron deficiency, kidney function impairment, and immunosuppressive medications can also contribute to anemia in pregnant recipients. The diagnosis and management of anemia in pregnant transplant patients are similar to that in nonpregnant transplant patients. These issues are discussed separately.

Kidney transplantation helps to restore sexual and reproductive function in both females and males, although certain features of reproductive function may remain impaired. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above and <a class="local">'Sexual function after transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Contraception</strong> – Sexual function typically improves in both females and males within a few weeks posttransplant. Women of childbearing age and men should receive counseling regarding contraception before undergoing transplantation and again at posttransplant clinic visits. We advise female transplant recipients to start contraception before they become sexually active since it is highly recommended that women avoid pregnancy during the first posttransplant year. Similarly, we advise that male recipients use contraception as soon as they become sexually active if they do not wish to father a pregnancy. (See <a class="local">'Contraception'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pregnancy</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Preconception care</strong> – In all kidney transplant candidates who desire to become pregnant, preconception counseling should be initiated during the pretransplant evaluation. Patients should be informed that pregnancy after transplantation is considered high risk and will require a multidisciplinary effort that involves both a high-risk obstetrician and nephrologist working closely together. (See <a class="local">'Preconception care'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Timing of conception</strong> – The optimal time for conception after kidney transplantation is uncertain. We agree with the 2005 American Society of Transplantation (AST) guidelines discussing the medical criteria for proceeding with pregnancy. We advise women to wait a minimum of one year after transplantation to conceive. In addition, patients who have a history of recent (but not currently active) cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease are advised to wait <strong>at least six months and preferably one year</strong> from the resolution of disease before trying to conceive. (See <a class="local">'Timing of conception'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Baseline evaluation</strong> – In all kidney transplant recipients who are considering becoming pregnant, we advise a multidisciplinary evaluation that includes a transplant nephrologist, a transplant surgeon, and a maternal-fetal medicine specialist (high-risk obstetrician). (See <a class="local">'Baseline evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Management of immunosuppression</strong> – Modification of the maintenance immunosuppression regimen is frequently necessary prior to conception. The immunosuppressive medications used in transplantation pass through the maternal-fetal barrier to varying degrees, and all carry some risk in pregnancy. The recommended maintenance immunosuppression regimen in pregnant transplant recipients is the combination of a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI; either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9971" href="/d/drug information/9971.html" rel="external">tacrolimus</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9217" href="/d/drug information/9217.html" rel="external">cyclosporine</a>), <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9026" href="/d/drug information/9026.html" rel="external">azathioprine</a>, and low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a>. This regimen is considered safe in pregnancy. The use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9670" href="/d/drug information/9670.html" rel="external">mycophenolate</a> mofetil/sodium and mammalian (mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10329" href="/d/drug information/10329.html" rel="external">sirolimus</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9078" href="/d/drug information/9078.html" rel="external">everolimus</a>) is <strong>contraindicated</strong> in pregnancy. All patients undergoing adjustment of immunosuppression should have close monitoring of allograft function for a few months to ensure stability of the allograft. In addition, patients should be informed of the increased risk of rejection following changes in immunosuppression. (See <a class="local">'Management of immunosuppression'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Monitoring during pregnancy</strong> – We advise that patients be seen <strong>every two to four weeks</strong> throughout pregnancy and followed closely by both the transplant nephrologist and high-risk obstetrician. Monitoring should include ongoing surveillance for hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, kidney allograft dysfunction, and infection. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring during pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Mode of delivery</strong> – Vaginal delivery is the preferred mode of delivery if there are no obstetric contraindications. Although most transplant patients (over 50 percent) will undergo a cesarean delivery, there is no clear evidence to support its routine use, and it should be reserved for obstetric indications only. If a cesarean delivery is planned, obtaining preoperative input from a transplant surgeon is recommended to discuss potential surgical challenges and anatomic alternations relating to the transplant. (See <a class="local">'Mode of delivery'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Maternal complications</strong> – Significant potential complications in pregnant kidney transplant recipients include hypertension, preeclampsia, graft dysfunction, rejection, gestational diabetes, infection (particularly bacterial urinary tract infections and CMV infection), and anemia. (See <a class="local">'Maternal complications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Postpartum care</strong> – After giving birth, most of the pregnancy-related physiologic changes will normalize, although at indeterminate time intervals, and, therefore, CNI levels must be closely monitored and adjusted for several weeks postpartum. Other aspects of postpartum care do not differ among women with or without kidney transplants.
