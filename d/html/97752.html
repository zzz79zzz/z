         Although thrombocytopenia is relatively rare in the general newborn population, it occurs frequently in patients admitted to neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Severe neonatal thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;50,000/microL) can be associated with bleeding and, potentially, significant morbidity. As a result, it is important to identify at-risk neonates and, if needed, initiate therapy to prevent associated complications.
        </p>

         The clinical manifestations, diagnostic evaluation, and management of neonatal thrombocytopenia are reviewed here. The causes of neonatal thrombocytopenia are discussed separately. (See

          Screening for at-risk neonates
         </strong>
         ‒ At-risk infants for thrombocytopenia are detected by a screening CBC. Risk factors include a maternal history of thrombocytopenia due to autoimmune disease (eg, immune thrombocytopenia or systemic lupus erythematous [SLE]), previous affected sibling (eg, neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia [NAIT]), or specific disorders associated with thrombocytopenia that may be identified by characteristic physical findings. These include genetic and chromosomal disorders (eg, trisomies 21, 18, and 13) and congenital infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and rubella  (

         Because bleeding from thrombocytopenia is a potentially life-threatening condition, initial management, including platelet transfusion of symptomatic patients with severe bleeding, takes precedence over any diagnostic evaluation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Management'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The evaluation is focused on determining and, if possible, directing specific therapy to the underlying cause of neonatal thrombocytopenia. However, establishing a diagnosis can be challenging because of the overlap of the clinical presentation among different conditions, and because frequently there may be multiple potential causes. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4979.html" rel="external">
          "Neonatal thrombocytopenia: Etiology"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The first step of the evaluation is verification of a low platelet count by repeat complete blood count (CBC). The diagnostic approach is centered on the onset of thrombocytopenia, the severity of thrombocytopenia, the infant's clinical condition, and the maternal and neonatal history, including labor and delivery. Based on this initial evaluation, the etiology of the thrombocytopenia is usually identified  (

          Age of onset
         </strong>
         – Neonatal thrombocytopenia that presents within the first 72 hours of life (early onset) is more likely to be caused by conditions due to complications of pregnancy (placental insufficiency) or delivery (perinatal asphyxia), or from maternal antibody-mediated platelet destruction (eg, neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia [NAIT]). In contrast, neonatal thrombocytopenia that presents after 72 hours of life (late onset) is usually due to postnatally-acquired conditions such as bacterial sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), particularly in preterm infants.

         <strong>
          Severity of thrombocytopenia
         </strong>
         – In patients with an incidental finding of mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count between 100,000 and 150,000/microL) in whom the platelet count stabilizes and improves without intervention, further evaluation is typically not warranted. Similarly, infants with moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet count between 50,000 and 100,000/microL) born following a history of or clinical evidence of placental insufficiency usually only need monitoring of the platelet count to ensure it is transient. However, in patients with moderate thrombocytopenia without an etiology or severe thrombocytopenia, further evaluation is warranted.

         <strong>
          Clinical status
         </strong>
         – Neonates with immune-mediated thrombocytopenia typically are well-appearing except for the clinical manifestations related to thrombocytopenia (eg, petechiae and mucosal bleeding). In contrast, infants who are ill-appearing are more likely to have thrombocytopenia associated with systemic disease such as sepsis, NEC, and severe asphyxia. However, NAIT should also be considered in ill-appearing infants, particularly if the severity of the thrombocytopenia is disproportionate to the degree of clinical illness. (See

         The infant should be examined for evidence and extent of bleeding. Bleeding into the skin is one of the most common findings in patients and may include petechiae, non-palpable purpura, and ecchymoses. In addition, neonatal bleeding may be manifested by more serious bleeding, including cephalohematoma, oozing from the umbilical cord or puncture sites, hematemesis, melena, and blood-tinged secretions. The presence of these findings is an indication that platelet transfusion should be considered. (See
         <a class="local">

         Involvement of other cell lines ‒ The CBC, which demonstrates a low platelet count, should also be evaluated for anemia and/or neutropenia. If present, this suggests the underlying pathogenesis is decreased production due to bone marrow suppression, or (more rarely) disorders characterized by two or more cytopenias (ie, HLH, or congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which presents with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia).

         In the majority of cases, thrombocytopenia resolves within a week with no intervention, and without subsequent major sequelae. However, because bleeding from thrombocytopenia is a potentially life-threatening condition, initial management, including platelet transfusion of symptomatic patients with active bleeding, takes precedence over any diagnostic evaluation.

         </span>
         Ongoing monitoring of the platelet count should be performed to see if the platelet count improves. The frequency of such testing will depend on the gestational age (GA) of the patient, the postnatal age, the presumed etiology of the thrombocytopenia, the severity of the thrombocytopenia, whether platelet administration is provided, and the response to any platelet transfusions.
        </p>
        <p>
         In our practice, we usually monitor neonates frequently on the first day of diagnosis, especially in patients who are clinically unstable, to determine the ongoing trend. As a result, a complete blood count (CBC) may be obtained as often as every six hours. As the patient's clinical status stabilizes and/or there is a clearer understanding of the course of the platelet count with evidence of improvement, the timing between tests is adjusted.

          6,7

         For extremely preterm infants (GA &lt;28 weeks or birth weight &lt;1000 g) without evidence of active bleeding, we use a platelet count of &lt;50,000/microL as a threshold for platelet transfusion during the first week of life. Determining an optimal threshold has been an area of ongoing debate as the indication for platelet transfusions has been more liberal for these infants with the highest risk of serious bleeding. Other centers use a more conservative threshold of &lt;30,000 or 25,000/microL for transfusions in this setting [

         A multicenter trial of preterm infants with GA &lt;34 weeks (mean GA 26.6 weeks) compared a high-threshold group (platelet count threshold of 50,000/microL) with a low-threshold group (platelet count threshold of 25,000/microL) using a primary composite outcome of death or major bleeding (defined as intracranial hemorrhage, pulmonary hemorrhage, frank rectal bleeding, and life-threatening bleeding [eg, shock or requiring emergency fluid or red blood cell transfusion]) within 28 days after randomization. Results of the study showed a higher incidence of death or major bleeding in the high-threshold compared with the low-threshold group (26 versus 19 percent, respectively; odds ratio 1.57, 95% CI 1.06-2.32) [
         <a href="#rid7">

         ]. The incidences of new major bleeding episodes were similar for the high- versus low-threshold groups (14 versus 11 percent). There was no difference between the groups in the rates of serious adverse events (eg, multiorgan failure, renal failure, necrotizing enterocolitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and stage 2 or greater retinopathy of prematurity). The risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia was slightly higher in the survivors of the high-threshold group (63 versus 54 percent). A subsequent analysis reported the benefit associated with a low-threshold platelet count &lt;25,000 regardless of the baseline risk of bleeding and mortality [

         <a href="#rid12">
          12

          Irradiation

         – Platelet irradiation is used to prevent graft-versus-host disease, in which contaminating white blood cells attack host tissue. Irradiation damages the nuclei of donor lymphocytes in the transfusion, so that they cannot proliferate and mount an immune response against the recipient. Platelets are anucleate, so their functions are unaffected by irradiation (see

          14
         </a>
         ]. In infants with NAIT, an antigen-compatible donor is preferable. If NAIT is anticipated, the mother's platelets can be collected prior to delivery and used for transfusion. Maternal platelets need to be concentrated, however, in order to reduce the amount of antibody-containing serum given to the neonate. Otherwise, donor platelets that are typed and matched for the patient can be used. (See

         Volume reduction should not be done unless there is a need for strict volume restriction, recurrent severe allergic reaction, or reduction on antibody-containing serum as in the case of NAIT. Volume reduction may be necessary when fluid restriction is critical, such as in patients with heart failure, oliguria or anuria due to renal injury, or generalized edema (eg, pleural effusion and ascites). Volume reduction may cause platelet activation due to centrifugation, resulting in a lower recovery of platelets. However, one retrospective study reported that volume-reduced platelet transfusions appear to have similar efficacy to nonreduced preparations [

         There are no established published guidelines for the administration of platelets in neonates. In our practice, based on clinical experience, we routinely transfuse platelets through a peripheral intravenous catheter. The infusion is given as rapidly as the infant will tolerate the volume of infusion, which is usually over one hour and no longer than two hours to minimize any risk due to a large fluid bolus [

          Presentation
         </strong>
         – The clinical presentation of neonatal thrombocytopenia includes patients detected incidentally by a low platelet count from a complete blood count (CBC) obtained for other reasons, at-risk patients identified by a screening CBC, and symptomatic infants with evidence of bleeding (eg, petechiae, large ecchymoses, cephalohematoma, or oozing from the umbilical cord or puncture sites).

          Initial management for active bleeding –
         </strong>
         Because bleeding from thrombocytopenia is a potentially life-threatening condition, initial management, including platelet transfusion of symptomatic patients with active bleeding, takes precedence over any diagnostic evaluation. (See

          Diagnostic evaluation
         </strong>
         – The diagnostic evaluation is focused on determining and, if possible, directing specific therapy to the underlying cause of neonatal thrombocytopenia. However, establishing a diagnosis can be challenging because of the overlap of the clinical presentation among different conditions, and because frequently there may be multiple potential causes. The diagnostic approach to neonatal thrombocytopenia is centered on the timing of presentation (early within the first 72 hours of life or later), the severity of thrombocytopenia, the infant's clinical condition, and the maternal and neonatal history, including labor and delivery. Based on this initial evaluation of history, physical findings, and CBC, the etiology of the thrombocytopenia usually can be identified  (

         The need for further laboratory testing is determined by the clinical setting and includes coagulation studies, blood culture, review of the mother's platelet count, and in some cases, platelet antigen typing of the mother, father, and newborn. (See

         In the majority of cases, neonatal thrombocytopenia resolves without intervention. Specific therapy, if available, should be given to patients in whom an etiology has been identified (eg, sepsis). (See

         Monitoring of the platelet count is performed to determine the ongoing trend and whether a prespecified threshold is met for platelet transfusion. In our practice, we monitor neonates frequently on the first day of diagnosis to note any further decline in the platelet count, especially in patients who are clinically unstable. As a result, a CBC may be obtained as often as every six hours and as the patient's clinical status stabilizes and/or there is a clearer understanding of the course of the platelet count with evidence of improvement, the timing between tests is increased.

          Platelet transfusion: Indications
         </strong>
         – Most platelet transfusions in neonates are given prophylactically to patients without evidence of bleeding. However, there is no specified threshold as bleeding risk varies based on the clinical setting, and there are variations in clinical practice based on limited available evidence and expert clinical experience.

          Platelet preparation and administration
         </strong>
         – Platelets are obtained from either a fresh unit of whole blood or by apheresis. Platelets undergo irradiation, leukoreduction, and are from a cytomegalovirus-seronegative donor. (See

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In general, administration of 10 to 15 mL/kg of platelet suspension will increase the platelet count from 50,000 to 100,000/microL. In our practice, we use a dose of 10 mL/kg, which is typically administered through a peripheral intravenous catheter over 30 minutes. (See
