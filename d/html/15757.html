Over the past few decades, professional allergy societies in the United States have made attempts to reduce variations in practice across the United States and identify best practices. Practice parameters for SCIT have been published, and the practices described in this topic review are consistent with American guidelines [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review conventional schedules for the administration of SCIT, focusing on those used to administer inhalant allergens. Adjustments in schedules in response to adverse effects, injection techniques, safety requirements for facilities where immunotherapy is given, documentation, and patient monitoring will also be discussed. Accelerated schedules for SCIT (including rush, cluster, and ultra-rush) and schedules for Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy are reviewed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4096.html" rel="external">"Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy: Technical issues, protocols, adverse effects, and monitoring", section on 'Choice of protocol'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22754392"><span class="h1">CONVENTIONAL SCHEDULES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>SCIT schedules differ in the number of injections per visit, number of visits per week, and the rapidity with which the patient reaches the maintenance dose. Conventional immunotherapy schedules involve one to three injections per week during a build-up phase that lasts a number of weeks, followed by a maintenance phase, during which injections are given every two to four weeks over a period of years.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2054966936"><span class="h2">Choosing a build-up schedule</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are faster and slower versions of conventional schedules. The clinician may choose a schedule with a slower (more gradual) build-up for the patient at increased risk for a systemic allergic reaction to the immunotherapy itself. The primary advantage of slower schedules is a presumed reduced risk of systemic allergic reactions. An example of a conservative build-up schedule is provided  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60803" href="/d/graphic/60803.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Within the spectrum of conventional schedules, more conservative schedules are appropriate for patients with any of the following characteristics:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Multiple large reactions during allergen skin testing [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Systemic symptoms during skin testing</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Persistent asthma</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A history of systemic allergic reactions to previous immunotherapy</p><p></p><p>Patients without these characteristics usually tolerate a more moderate schedule, such as that shown in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef72555" href="/d/graphic/72555.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), which involves 14 fewer injections to reach maintenance than the slower schedule discussed above [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Advantages of faster schedules include patient and clinician convenience and a shorter time to maintenance and clinical improvement.</p><p>Clinicians may be reluctant to initiate pollen immunotherapy during times of the year when pollen counts are high. However, a systematic review found that rates of systemic reactions were not higher in patients beginning pollen immunotherapy during pollen seasons, compared with those starting therapy at other times [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1868046"><span class="h2">Maintenance phase</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>During the maintenance phase, the interval between injections is usually increased from once weekly up to a maximum of once monthly for inhalant allergens [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Some clinicians give maintenance injections every two weeks, while others prefer every three to four weeks. Certain patients receiving maintenance injections at three- or four-week intervals may report that allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis symptoms become bothersome before their next maintenance injection is due. In this situation, the interval can be shortened to see if better symptom control is achieved.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1868053"><span class="h2">Total duration of therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The recommended duration of SCIT is three to five years of maintenance therapy. The data supporting this recommendation and studies addressing the persistence of benefit after discontinuing therapy are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/361.html" rel="external">"Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma: Indications and efficacy", section on 'Persistence of benefit after discontinuation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/361.html" rel="external">"Subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma: Indications and efficacy", section on 'Duration of therapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1868375"><span class="h1">ADMINISTRATION OF INJECTIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Issues surrounding the administration of SCIT injections include ensuring that the patient is given the correct injection, screening the patient for changes in health that might alter the safety of immunotherapy, and optimal injection techniques.</p><p>SCIT can induce a systemic reaction including anaphylaxis, and the risk factors and incidence of anaphylaxis during immunotherapy are reviewed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/394.html" rel="external">"Anaphylaxis induced by subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy", section on 'Frequency'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/394.html" rel="external">"Anaphylaxis induced by subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy", section on 'Factors associated with fatal and near-fatal anaphylaxis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1868806"><span class="h2">Safety precautions at every visit</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Personnel responsible for administering immunotherapy injections should be trained to perform the following measures routinely at the beginning of each patient visit to increase safety.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A relatively common cause of systemic reactions to immunotherapy is the administration of an extract to the wrong patient. For this reason, it is critical to ensure that the allergen immunotherapy extract and dilution are the correct one for the patient before administering the injection. It is advised that patients be asked to provide two identifying pieces of information (eg, name and birth date) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The patient should be questioned to determine if any local or systemic reactions developed following the previous injection(s).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If the patient has been instructed to take an antihistamine prior to the visit, staff should confirm that this was done. Premedication with a nonsedating H1 antihistamine is suggested for selected patients, including those experiencing recurrent large local reactions or systemic reactions to prior injections. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/394.html" rel="external">"Anaphylaxis induced by subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy", section on 'Premedication'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The patient should be questioned to determine if there have been any changes in health status or in medications since the last injection. The onset of pregnancy or the introduction of beta-adrenergic blocker medication should be a cause for reevaluating the continuation of immunotherapy [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Consider routinely performing a peak expiratory flow test in patients with asthma. Patients experiencing an asthma exacerbation should not be given an injection that day [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In those who do receive injections, a repeat measurement of peak expiratory flow may be considered prior to discharge from the clinic, even in the absence of symptoms, because some patients are unaware of or ignore changes in lung function.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients should wait at the site where they received their immunotherapy injection for 30 minutes. The data supporting this are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/394.html" rel="external">"Anaphylaxis induced by subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy", section on 'Optimize safety'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients should be instructed not to exercise vigorously for at least several hours after receiving an immunotherapy injection. Some clinicians advise patients to avoid vigorous exercise for one or two hours before injections as well. This advice is intended to minimize rapid uptake of the allergen into the systemic circulation, although its utility in preventing systemic reactions has not been formally studied.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1868813"><span class="h2">Injection technique</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Immunotherapy injections should be given using a calibrated small volume syringe (usually a 1 mL syringe) with a 26- to 27-gauge nonremovable needle (usually three-eighths to one-half inch [0.9 to 1.3 cm] in length) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has mandated that needles with safety-engineered sharp injury protection be used.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The site should be wiped with an alcohol swab before giving the injection.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Injections should be given subcutaneously in the lateral or posterior middle portion of the arm [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The subcutaneous tissue has limited blood supply compared with other tissues and allows for slow absorption. Intramuscular injection is avoided because it would lead to more rapid absorption and increased risk of a systemic reaction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The plunger of the syringe may be pulled back slightly to check for blood return before injecting as an extra safety step. However, a retrospective and prospective study failed to detect blood during 35,000 immunotherapy and immunization injections [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, patients request that injections be administered somewhere other than the upper arm, usually because of large or persistent local reactions. In this situation, the thigh could be used, provided the patient has adequate subcutaneous tissue and the underlying muscle can be successfully avoided. The thigh is probably preferable to the buttocks, as it would not be possible in the latter circumstance to apply a tourniquet to slow systemic absorption in the event of a severe systemic reaction.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22754801"><span class="h1">TRAINING AND PREPARATION FOR MANAGING SYSTEMIC REACTIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22754406"><span class="h2">Personnel and site</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Allergen immunotherapy should be administered in a setting where prompt recognition and treatment of a systemic reaction are optimized [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The preferred location of administration of allergen immunotherapy is in the office of the allergy expert who prepared the patient's immunotherapy extract. There should be a clinician or clinician extender (advanced registered nurse practitioner or clinician's assistant) appropriately trained in emergency treatment immediately available in the medical facility. These precautions are especially important for patients at high risk for systemic reactions (highly sensitive, severe symptoms, comorbid conditions, or history of recurrent systemic reactions) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1868663"><span class="h2">Equipment and medications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following equipment and medications should be immediately available [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stethoscope and sphygmomanometer</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Aqueous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a> 1:1000 weight/volume (ie, the primary treatment for anaphylaxis)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Tourniquet, syringes, large bore (14 gauge) needles, and intravenous catheters</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Equipment to administer oxygen by mask</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intravenous fluid set-up</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Antihistamine for injection (second-line treatment)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Glucocorticoids for intramuscular or intravenous administration (second-line treatment)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Equipment to maintain an airway appropriate for the supervising clinician's expertise and skill</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8493" href="/d/drug information/8493.html" rel="external">Glucagon</a> kit for patients on beta-blockers</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22754824"><span class="h1">ADVERSE REACTIONS TO IMMUNOTHERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Adverse reactions to SCIT consist of local reactions at the site of injection and systemic allergic reactions.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1868494"><span class="h2">Local reactions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Injection site reactions consist of redness, pruritus, and swelling. A local reaction can range from a few millimeters in diameter to swelling and erythema that encompasses most of the patient's upper arm. They may progressively increase in size over several hours and persist for over 24 hours. Local reactions to SCIT are common, with 30 to 80 percent of immunotherapy patients experiencing these at least some of the time. Consensus is lacking about what degree of local reaction is expected with SCIT. Some studies have characterized a local reaction as large if it exceeds 2.5 cm in diameter, while others have defined large as bigger than the patient's palm [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>].</p><p>Several factors may contribute to local reactions. A single-site retrospective study found that higher rates of local reactions smaller than the patient's palm (although not larger local reactions) correlated with higher allergen concentration, greater number of allergens per extract, and larger injection volume [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Higher <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8959" href="/d/drug information/8959.html" rel="external">glycerin</a> concentrations were not associated with local reactions, although glycerin is known to cause injection site pain, particularly as concentrations approach 50 percent and with higher injection volumes [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1868508"><span class="h3">Prevention and treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Local reactions can be reduced by premedication with a minimally sedating oral antihistamine (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9236" href="/d/drug information/9236.html" rel="external">cetirizine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9572" href="/d/drug information/9572.html" rel="external">loratadine</a>, others) taken one to three hours before the injection, and this is common practice [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>Two small studies have examined rinsing the syringe used to administer SCIT with a solution of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a> (ie, drawing up a solution of epinephrine and then expelling it from the syringe/needle before drawing up the allergen solution for injection) [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a randomized trial of 74 adult and pediatric patients with local reaction to immunotherapy despite antihistamine premedication, rinsing the immunotherapy syringe with a solution of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a> significantly reduced the size of local reactions per patient report, while rinsing them in solutions of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9369" href="/d/drug information/9369.html" rel="external">diphenhydramine</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> (placebo) did not [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a second small randomized trial, 17 pediatric and adult patients who had a history of large local reactions after ≥20 percent of injections despite premedication received maintenance injections one month apart, once through epinephrine-coated syringes and once with untreated syringes [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Rinsing with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a> (1 mg/mL) reduced both the incidence and size of local reactions at multiple time points up to six hours (early and delayed local reactions). Three patients reported a transient burning sensation at the site of the epinephrine-coated needle, which resolved rapidly.</p><p></p><p>This practice of rinsing the syringe with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a> appears to reduce the size and occurrence of local reactions, with minimal adverse effects. It may be considered in patients in whom large local reactions are a consistent problem. Note that the effect of this practice on the incidence of systemic reactions, if any, was not reported.</p><p>Data are lacking on the utility of other interventions, such as the application of cold packs or topical corticosteroid preparations or dividing the dose between two arms. These measures can be tried for patients with recurrent and bothersome large local reactions. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9539" href="/d/drug information/9539.html" rel="external">Montelukast</a> was found in a small randomized pilot study of just 15 patients to be helpful in reducing the severity of local reactions [<a href="#rid12">12</a>], but another small study suggested that montelukast might reduce the effectiveness of SCIT [<a href="#rid13">13</a>], so more investigation is required regarding the impact of antileukotriene medications on SCIT.</p><p>One study found that a local reaction in response to an injection did not predict a repeat local reaction at the next visit, suggesting that dose reduction was not indicated for the prevention of recurrent local reactions [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2962660"><span class="h2">Relationship between local and systemic reactions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Two large studies found that local reactions are not immediate harbingers of systemic reactions and that adjusting immunotherapy doses based on local reactions did not impact the incidence of systemic reactions [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. In one study, no adjustment was made for local reactions less than the size of the patient's palm, and, in the other, no adjustment was made for local reactions of any size, compared with previous periods when adjustments in dose were made for local reactions. There was no increase in systemic reactions in either study. However, other studies found that systemic reactions, not with the next injection but during the course of immunotherapy, were more common in patients who experienced frequent moderate-sized local reactions (&gt;2.5 cm) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>] and were three times as frequent in patients who experienced a local reaction greater than the size of their palm [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. One interpretation of this finding is that the tendency to develop large local reactions with SCIT is a marker for a patient who is at higher risk (for undefined reasons) for systemic reactions at some point during therapy.</p><p>In summary, if a patient has developed a large local reaction (often defined as swelling and erythema bigger than the patient's palm), there is no evidence that decreasing the amount of extract used for the next injection helps prevent either a recurrent local reaction or a systemic reaction. However, many clinicians choose to be cautious and either repeat the same dose that caused the reaction or reduce the dose slightly. For patients experiencing frequent medium-to-large local reactions (≥2.5 cm) or a single large local reaction greater than palm sized, there is an increased risk for a systemic reaction sometime during the course of therapy, and, for patients in the build-up phase, clinicians may wish to change to a more gradually increasing schedule.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1868501"><span class="h2">Systemic reactions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Systemic allergic reactions to SCIT involve organ systems distant from the injection site. Most serious systemic reactions occur within 30 minutes after the injection. Therefore, a 30-minute waiting period following injection is recommended. These reactions may range in severity from mild rhinitis to fatal cardiopulmonary arrest. A system for classifying the severity of these reactions has been developed, and its use is endorsed by the practice parameters  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef85944" href="/d/graphic/85944.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1,17</a>].</p><p>The incidence of, risk factors for, and measures to prevent systemic reactions to SCIT are reviewed in detail separately.

Because these typically occur after the patient leaves the treatment facility, patients should be warned about these reactions and be instructed about what action to take should symptoms occur. Some clinicians provide all or selected patients with autoinjectable <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9409" href="/d/drug information/9409.html" rel="external">epinephrine</a> to use for these late-occurring systemic reactions.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Delayed systemic reactions occurring more than 30 minutes after the injection constitute 27 to 50 percent of all systemic reactions.

As an example, if a patient is receiving 0.5 mL of a maintenance solution (1:1 volume/volume [v/v]) and the dose is reduced by one-half, this means that 0.25 mL of the 1:1 v/v solution would be given.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1868733"><span class="h2">Following systemic allergic reactions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is common practice following a systemic reaction to reduce the next injection to the previously tolerated dose and, in cases of very severe reactions, to an even lower dose. However, there are wide variations in the degree to which clinicians reduce doses, and the issue has not been formally studied to identify the best approach. In the case of very severe reactions, the prescribing clinician should review the course of immunotherapy to determine whether the risk/benefit assessment justifies continuation of immunotherapy [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. There are no established criteria regarding discontinuation of immunotherapy due to systemic reactions, and the decision must be made cooperatively with input from both clinician and patient.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1511567980"><span class="h2">Following large local reactions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>This is discussed above.

The reason for this is concern that the fresh vials may be more potent due to gradual loss of potency in the old vials or variations in potency of different lots of extract.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6473761"><span class="h2">New allergen added to therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If a new allergen extract is introduced, it can be given as a separate injection, built up to the maintenance dose, and then added to the allergen immunotherapy extract.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1868769"><span class="h2">Change in supplier of allergen extracts</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It may occasionally be necessary to change suppliers of extracts.

We would suggest reducing the dose slightly when changing brands. As an example, if a patient was receiving standardized dust mite mix or cat, the initial dose from the new supplier could be reduced to approximately one-fifth of the previous dose, with build-up from there (eg, from 0.5 mL of 1:1 to 0.1 mL of 1:1).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nonstandardized pollens have a greater range of variability, so one might reduce the dose by at least one dilution (eg, from 0.5 mL of 1:1 to 0.5 mL or even 0.25 mL of 1:10).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cockroach and fungi extracts can be widely variable (even 100-fold or more), so one might reduce the initial dose by two dilutions or even further (eg, from 0.5 mL if 1:1 to 0.5 mL or even 0.25 mL of 1:100).</p><p></p><p>Clinical judgment may dictate a more cautious approach in some situations, depending upon a patient's history of systemic reactions to immunotherapy, the season in which the change is being implemented, or other factors.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2963920"><span class="h2">High pollen and mold seasons</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some allergists reduce doses during periods of high pollen counts in patients receiving immunotherapy for pollen allergy. However, several studies suggest that routine dose reductions of pollen extracts during pollen season are not necessary:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Two large studies including over 600,000 injections did not find a correlation between pollen counts and systemic reaction rates (SRRs), although there was a correlation in one study with mean monthly mold counts from August to October [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a study from the allergy clinic at Lackland Air Force base in San Antonio, Texas, SRRs to immunotherapy were compared between patients allergic to and presumably receiving mountain cedar pollen in their immunotherapy and those not allergic to mountain cedar pollen [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].

After 42 months, the SRR was compared with that during a similar period of time before seasonal dose adjustments were instituted. The SRR prior to seasonal dose adjustment was 0.43 percent and during the period of seasonal adjustments, 0.36 percent, a difference that was not statistically significant. There was no difference in the severity of systemic reactions between the two time periods [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p></p><p>These studies suggest that routine immunotherapy dose reduction during pollen seasons of the component extracts does not reduce the overall rate of systemic reactions. Until the relationship between environmental exposure and risk of systemic reactions to SCIT is better defined, one option is to decrease the immunotherapy dose only in patients who are experiencing significant symptoms due to concomitant high pollen or mold spore levels.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1868598"><span class="h1">DOCUMENTATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1868605"><span class="h2">Consent form</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinicians should obtain informed consent before initiating allergen immunotherapy. Patients should be informed about the following issues:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>The nature of the treatment and alternatives to treatment</strong> – The alternatives to SCIT include medications, sublingual forms of immunotherapy (available for a limited number of allergens), and continued and strict avoidance of those allergens that can be avoided.
