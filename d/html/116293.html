         </span>
         Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is characterized by a diminutive left ventricle and small left-sided structures incapable of supporting the systemic circulation (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82280" href="/z/d/graphic/82280.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). If left untreated, HLHS is universally fatal. Surgical and medical interventions have improved outcomes, but mortality and morbidity remain high.
        </p>
        <p>
         The management and outcome of HLHS will be reviewed here. The anatomy, physiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of HLHS and management of patients following the Fontan procedure are discussed separately. (See

         Once the diagnosis of HLHS has been confirmed, treatment options should be clearly explained to parents/caregivers to allow them to make informed decisions in line with their values and preferences. HLHS remains one of the most challenging congenital heart defects to manage because of its high mortality and morbidity. However, innovations and improvements in medical and surgical care have improved outcomes considerably, and, increasingly, families are choosing intervention over comfort care measures [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Most pediatric cardiologists and surgeons in North America consider staged palliative surgery the preferred management approach for HLHS rather than primary cardiac transplantation or "comfort measures only" (CMO) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Within the pediatric cardiology community, there remains a debate as to whether CMO should be offered as an option to parents/caregivers [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Some experts feel that CMO should not be offered as an option in light of the improving outcome of the staged surgical repair, while others argue parents/caregivers should be given the option of CMO because of the high burdens associated with surgical palliation, including multiple cardiac operations, unknown long-term morbidity, and considerable mortality [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,5
         </a>
         ]. Primary cardiac transplant for HLHS is generally not offered as an option given long waiting times for donor organs.
        </p>
        <p>
         At the author's institution, the management choice is dependent on parent/caregiver preference after ensuring that parents/caregivers understand the different management options.

         <strong>
          Prenatal counseling
         </strong>
         – During prenatal counseling, discussion with the parents includes the natural history of HLHS and prenatal management decisions including termination of the pregnancy, pursuit of additional prenatal testing, choice of delivery setting, and, where clinically applicable, possibility of fetal intervention. The approach to prenatal counseling may differ in settings where options for pregnancy termination are limited.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Postnatal management choices are also discussed at prenatal visits, including staged palliative surgery, cardiac transplantation, and CMO. Longitudinal follow-up after prenatal diagnosis of HLHS suggests that approximately 40 percent of pregnancies end in termination or fetal demise [

          Postnatal counseling
         </strong>
         – Postnatal counseling includes discussion of staged surgical palliation, including a careful presentation of outcomes. Most parents/caregivers choose staged surgical palliation. Some families choose CMO, particularly if there are other comorbidities such as extreme prematurity, life-limiting genetic conditions, or other major malformations [

         With the ability to identify prenatal anatomic and physiologic characteristics predictive of the development of HLHS, fetal intervention has become a potential therapeutic management option at select centers with expertise in fetal transcatheter intervention [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6

         ]. In highly selected cases of critical aortic valve stenosis and preserved left ventricular volume in the second trimester, prenatal intervention to perform aortic valvuloplasty can prevent the progression to neonatal HLHS [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-9
         </a>
         ]. This ultrasound-guided transcatheter procedure poses significant risks to the fetus and some risk to the mother as well. These risks have been felt to be justifiable given the uniform lethality of the untreated disease and the significant mortality associated with postnatal management [

         Given the difficulty in managing the balance of pulmonary and systemic circulations in the early postoperative Norwood stage I patient, alternative palliations have been explored. Of these, using an RV-PA conduit to supply pulmonary blood flow (Sano modification) has become an acceptable alternative [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In the Sano modification, an RV-PA conduit (typically a 5 to 6 mm expanded polytetrafluoroethylene tube) serves as the source of pulmonary blood flow instead of the mBTS [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. One disadvantage to the traditional Sano procedure is the need for a right ventriculotomy, with potential for negative effects on long-term function of the systemic RV. Modifications of the original Sano approach have included a limited RV incision without ventriculotomy and using a reinforced RV-PA conduit [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. In some centers, a composite Sano conduit is created by attaching a systemic vein homograft to the distal end of the Sano to prevent conduit regurgitation and reduce volume overload [

         The "hybrid" approach uses a combination of surgical and transcatheter approaches to accomplish the goals of a stage I palliative repair without neonatal cardiopulmonary bypass and circulatory arrest, thus avoiding the circulatory stressors imposed by the postbypass inflammatory state, myocardial reperfusion effects, and recovery from extensive dissection through a median sternotomy [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17

         The optimal use of the hybrid procedure has not been defined, and there is considerable variability among centers in patient selection, procedural details, and subsequent management. The hybrid procedure is performed in the minority of cases, and patients selected for this procedure frequently have underlying risk factors. A report from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database included data on 1728 patients with HLHS managed at 100 centers in North America from 2010 through 2012 [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18

         ]. The hybrid procedure was the initial palliation in only 13 percent of patients, of whom 52 percent had at least one preoperative risk factor (including prematurity; low birth weight; chromosomal abnormalities; and organ dysfunctions such as shock, necrotizing enterocolitis, and renal dysfunction) compared with 37 percent of patients who underwent the traditional stage I procedure.

         The choice between the different stage I surgical approaches is based on the experience and preference of the surgeon, the institutional familiarity with the procedure, and certain patient factors (eg, anatomy and comorbidities such as prematurity or other noncardiac diseases). The available evidence suggests that clinical outcomes may depend more on patient and center factors (ie, comorbidities, surgical volume) than on the surgical technique itself.

          RV-PA conduit versus mBTS
         </strong>
         – The stage I procedure with mBTS (classic Norwood procedure) and the stage I procedure with RV-PA conduit (Sano modification) both result in a functionally univentricular circulation maintained by the RV. In both procedures, the goal is to achieve a distribution of blood flow to the pulmonary and systemic circulation that provides adequate oxygen delivery to the systemic organs and tissues without excessive pressure or volume load on the RV, as well as avoiding excessive systemic cyanosis. The main disadvantage of the mBTS is that blood flow through the shunt into the pulmonary circulation results in diastolic diversion of flow from the systemic circulation including, most importantly, the coronary circulation. The main disadvantage of the RV-PA approach is the need for a right ventriculotomy, with potential for negative effects on long-term function of the systemic RV.

         After completion of stage II palliation, patients who initially underwent stage I with an RV-PA conduit had larger RV volumes and reduced strain patterns on echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance compared with those who underwent mBTS, suggesting that long-term ventricular function may be better preserved in those receiving mBTS initially [

In a retrospective study from a single center of infants with single-ventricle physiology who underwent initial stage I repair using a hybrid approach (n = 32) or mBTS (ie, classic Norwood; n = 43) and who subsequently completed stage II palliation, transplant-free survival at three years was similar in both groups (86 percent in the hybrid group versus 80 percent in the mBTS group) [

         to prevent shunt thrombosis in all infants who have undergone stage I palliation, regardless of the type of procedure performed. The usual dose is 1 to 5 mg/kg per dose given orally once daily. However, the optimal dose is uncertain. Retrospective studies suggest that standard weight-based aspirin dosing may not achieve sufficient platelet inhibition in postsurgical pediatric patients [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30-32

         ]. In addition, there is a growing experience that aspirin resistance can occur in infants. Among infants with infants with shunt-dependent congenital heart disease, the prevalence of aspirin resistance may be as high as 10 percent [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33

         following stage I palliation is supported by observational data suggesting that aspirin greatly reduces the risk of shunt thrombosis. In a study from the National Pediatric Cardiology Quality Improvement Collaborative (NPC-QIC) registry that included 932 patients who underwent a stage I procedure at one of 52 sites in North America from 2008 to 2013, nearly all patients (94 percent) were discharged home on aspirin and only three patients (0.2 percent) presented with interstage shunt thrombosis [

The trial had several limitations, including a high drop-out rate (only 185 of the 230 randomized infants completed the study), high rate of drug discontinuation, inability to achieve target doses in many patients, and limited follow-up. In addition, most of the patients enrolled in the trial had normal ventricular function at baseline; thus, the results may not be applicable to patients with ventricular dysfunction. Because of these limitations and because there is abundant indirect evidence from clinical trials in adult patients with heart failure demonstrating that ACE inhibitors improve survival in that setting, many providers continue to use ACE inhibitors in patients with single-ventricle physiology who have ventricular dysfunction.

         Patients who are discharged home after stage I palliation typically are managed by an intensive home monitoring program that includes daily measurements of weight and oxygen saturation. Home care providers are given parameters that should prompt notification of the medical team for further evaluation and changes in management. This practice is based upon data from a single-center study that showed reduced mortality following initiation of a home surveillance program [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>

          Stage II: Cavopulmonary shunt

          —
         </span>
         The second stage of surgical palliation for HLHS is the superior cavopulmonary shunt, also known as the bidirectional Glenn operation. This stage is typically performed at age four to six months of age, when the patient begins to outgrow the original shunt and becomes progressively more cyanotic. At stage II, the original shunt is removed and the superior vena cava is anastomosed end-to-side to the (typically right) PA (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58235" href="/z/d/graphic/58235.html" rel="external">
          figure 2B
         </a>
         ). Thus, systemic venous return from the superior vena cava enters the PAs directly.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients who had a stage I hybrid procedure require a more extensive stage II operation, also known as a "comprehensive stage II procedure." In these patients, the ductal stent is removed and the surgical aortopulmonary reconstruction is completed. The distal main PA is repaired, and the PA bands are removed, usually with branch PA repairs as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         The optimal timing for undertaking stage II palliation is uncertain. Based on a post hoc analysis of the SVR trial dataset, an interval of three to six months following stage I appears to be associated with lowest risk of mortality [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. Of 399 patients who survived to stage II, 349 (87 percent) survived to a three-year follow-up, and overall transplant-free survival was 68 percent. Transplant-free survival was highest among patients who underwent stage II at an interval of three to six months following stage I. Optimal timing of the stage II palliation did not differ by shunt type. Another analysis from the NPC-QIC dataset of 789 patients from 31 centers showed that centers who generally performed stage II operations later than 5.1 months of age had higher interstage mortality [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49
         </a>
         ]. This suggests a benefit for earlier stage II procedures. However, infants who required a stage II operation before three months of age had increased mortality, likely secondary to other high risk clinical factors [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Estimated surgical mortality following a traditional bidirectional Glenn procedure is low (between 1 and 2 percent) since the repair resolves the issue of balancing pulmonary and systemic flow through a shunt [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51,52
         </a>
         ]. Data from the NPC-QIC showed postoperative complications occurred in one-third of patients and included unplanned cardiac catheterization (9 percent), reoperation (6 percent), cardiac arrest (3 percent), new neurologic deficit including seizures (2 percent), and feeding/gastrointestinal difficulties resulting in interventions such as fundoplication and/or feeding tube placement (15 percent) [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ]. In a multivariate analysis, risk factors for postoperative complications included failure to thrive, female gender, and presence of aortic atresia and mitral stenosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         The post-Glenn circulation is characterized by a passive source of pulmonary blood flow, a volume-unloaded ventricle, and persistent cyanosis due to the obligate flow of inferior vena caval return to the RV, which supplies the systemic arterial output. Infants are typically hospitalized for one week postoperatively and have oxygen levels in the low 80s at discharge. Following stage II, there is a low mortality rate and most children are able to tolerate this level of systemic oxygenation. As children become more active with crawling, walking, and, subsequently, running, the degree of cyanosis becomes more severe, especially during periods of exercise and exertion. At this point, stage III (Fontan) palliation should be considered. In addition, a small subset of patients will have ventricular dysfunction, which is associated with increased mortality [
         <a href="#rid53">

          —
         </span>
         The third stage, the Fontan procedure, is typically performed between the age of two to five years. The Fontan procedure creates a venous pathway (total cavopulmonary connection) that directs the inferior vena caval flow into the PAs, resulting in the entire systemic venous return flowing passively into the PAs (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95320" href="/z/d/graphic/95320.html" rel="external">
          figure 2C
         </a>
         ). This creates a system with a single ventricle pumping blood into separate, in-series systemic and pulmonary circulations, thereby relieving cyanosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         There have been many modifications to the Fontan procedure. The modern versions of the Fontan are the lateral tunnel Fontan and the extracardiac Fontan (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95320" href="/z/d/graphic/95320.html" rel="external">
          figure 2C
         </a>
         ). The choice between these largely depends on center and surgeon preference. Although this remains controversial, there are no definitive data showing superiority of either modern approach.
        </p>
        <p>
         A surgically created fenestration between the conduit and the atrium can be made at the time of the Fontan operation. There is considerable practice variation in the use of the fenestration. Some centers perform the fenestration as a routine; others have moved toward using the fenestration only in "high-risk" patients (eg, those with elevated pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR]). The optimal approach is uncertain. The fenestration allows for a small right-to-left shunt and serves as a "pop-off" when PVR increases. This "pop-off" is particularly advantageous in the immediate postoperative period in patients with ventricular dysfunction and/or high PVR. Because there is a small amount of right-to-left shunting, patients with a fenestrated Fontan typically have oxygen saturations in the low 80s initially, rising to the high 80s to low 90s with time. The degree of cyanosis depends on the amount of shunting. The fenestration may close spontaneously many months after surgery or it can also be closed using a transcatheter device in the cardiac catheterization laboratory if necessary. One of the long-term risks of keeping a fenestration patent is that a thrombus in the Fontan baffle may go across the fenestration, which can result in stroke.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Fontan procedure has a low mortality rate (3 percent), similar to the stage II procedure [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ]. Although this total cavopulmonary connection is sometimes presented as the final stage of palliation for HLHS, follow-up after the Fontan procedure has demonstrated that a significant proportion of patients may require additional intervention due to cyanosis, elevated central venous pressures, persistent anatomic obstructions, arrhythmia, valve dysfunction, or ventricular dysfunction. Failure of the Fontan circulation may present as rare complications, such as protein-losing enteropathy, which occurs in 6 percent of cases [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ]. Similarly, plastic bronchitis is rare but may require takedown of the Fontan or heart transplant to relieve symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with HLHS may have long-term complications following Fontan completion since it remains unknown how well the morphologic RV, which is responsible for sustaining both systemic and pulmonary flow, will perform into adulthood [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55-57
         </a>
         ]. It is expected that the function of these ventricles will decline over time, based on observations of RV function in the systemic circulations of other cardiac disorders, such as following atrial switch operations for D-transposition of the great arteries. In a retrospective series of patients with HLHS who completed Fontan procedure, patients who underwent an mBTS or RV-PA conduit as stage I palliation had clinically significant ventricular dysfunction (17 and 31 percent, respectively) and atrioventricular valve regurgitation (40 and 16 percent, respectively) at a mean follow-up of 58 months following the Fontan procedure [

         Heart transplantation is an important option for patients with HLHS. The main benefit of heart transplant in this population is that it exchanges single-ventricle physiology for a biventricular circulation. However, heart transplantation carries with it the burdens and risks associated with immunosuppression and potential for organ rejection. Because of considerable supply versus demand mismatch for organs that often results in long recipient wait times, primary heart transplantation is generally not offered. Rather, heart transplantation is reserved for patients in whom the Fontan circulation is failing or has failed. Criteria for listing patients with HLHS for heart transplant are not standardized. Common indications for cardiac transplant in this population include:

         In a subsequent report from the SVR trial, children with single-ventricle lesions continued to have NDI at three years of age based upon lower scores on the Ages &amp; Stages Questionnaire compared with normative values [
         <a href="#rid86">

        <p>
         In a multicenter cross-sectional study, 47 school-age survivors of either Norwood palliation or infant heart transplant had neuropsychiatric testing at a mean age of 12.4±2.5 years. Mean full scale intelligence quotient (IQ) was 86±14, well below population normative values. Surgical strategy (Norwood versus transplantation) was not associated with any developmental test score in multivariable analysis [
         <a href="#rid81">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         These results demonstrate that patients with HLHS are at risk for NDI, but this appears to be independent of the type of surgical intervention. Patients who undergo fetal intervention appear to have a similar risk of NDI [
         <a href="#rid87">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, children with HLHS are at high risk for developmental delay and should be referred for developmental evaluation and early intervention or early childhood special education, as well as periodic reevaluation [
         <a href="#rid88">
          88

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the etiology of neurodevelopmental disability in patients with HLHS is not fully understood, it is thought to be multifactorial and includes malnutrition as a risk factor. One study of 170 patients (60 percent of whom had HLHS) demonstrated that low height trajectory was associated with worse neurodevelopmental outcome at 14 months of age [
         <a href="#rid89">
          89
         </a>
         ]. Clinical efforts toward ensuring delivery of adequate nutrition to these vulnerable infants are ongoing, and poor low-height trajectory in infancy may serve as an indication to monitor neurodevelopment more closely.

          Prenatal and initial postnatal counseling
         </strong>
         – Fetuses and neonates diagnosed with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) should be managed at centers with expertise in both medical and surgical treatment for HLHS. In these centers, prenatal counseling for parents/caregivers includes a review of the natural history of HLHS and discussion of prenatal management decisions (eg, terminating versus continuing the pregnancy, pursuing additional prenatal testing, choice of delivery setting, and, where clinically applicable, the possibility of fetal intervention). Postnatal counseling includes discussion of staged surgical palliation, including a careful presentation of outcomes. Most informed parents/caregivers choose staged surgical palliation; however, some choose "comfort measures only," particularly if there are other comorbidities such as extreme prematurity, life-limiting genetic conditions, or other major malformations.

         Stage I – Stage I palliation is performed during the neonatal period once the newborn is medically stable. It provides unobstructed blood from the right ventricle (RV) to the systemic circulation and unobstructed flow between the pulmonary venous return and the RV and also establishes a reliable source of pulmonary blood flow. Stage I procedures can be performed with a modified Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt (also referred to as the classic Norwood procedure), with an RV-to-pulmonary artery (PA) conduit (also referred to as the Sano modification), or with a combination of surgical and transcatheter techniques (referred to as the hybrid procedure) (

         Interstage management – Following stage I palliation, infants typically are discharged from the hospital three to four weeks postoperatively, with oxygen saturation levels in the range of 75 to 80 percent. These infants remain at risk of interstage mortality prior to further surgical intervention. For all infants who have undergone stage I palliation, regardless of the type of procedure performed, we recommend

          Outcome
         </strong>
         – With modern medical and surgical interventions, HLHS has transformed from being a condition that was almost always fatal to having six-year survival rates approaching 60 to 70 percent. For children who survive to the age of 12 months, long-term survival is approximately 90 percent. However, there is considerable morbidity, including an increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairment, thrombotic complications, exercise intolerance, and other complications. (See
