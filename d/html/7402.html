It is often classified as either primary (absence of menarche by age 15 years or thereafter) or secondary (absence of menses for more than three months in girls or women who previously had regular menstrual cycles or six months in girls or women who had irregular menses [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]). Missing a single menstrual period may not be important to assess, but amenorrhea lasting three months or more and oligomenorrhea (fewer than nine menstrual cycles per year or cycle length greater than 35 days) require investigation. The etiologic and diagnostic considerations for oligomenorrhea are the same as for secondary amenorrhea.</p><p>The evaluation of secondary amenorrhea and a brief summary of treatment options are reviewed here. The epidemiology and causes of secondary amenorrhea and overviews of primary amenorrhea and abnormal uterine bleeding in adolescents are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/104135.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and causes of secondary amenorrhea"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7403.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of primary amenorrhea"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/116.html" rel="external">"Abnormal uterine bleeding in adolescents: Evaluation and approach to diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h1">INITIAL EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once pregnancy has been ruled out, a logical approach to women with either primary or secondary amenorrhea is to consider disorders based upon the levels of control of the menstrual cycle: hypothalamus, pituitary, ovary, and uterus. Determining the site of the defect is important because it determines the appropriate therapeutic regimen. While the most common causes of secondary amenorrhea are likely to be functional hypothalamic amenorrhea or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), disorders with an anatomic or pathologic cause must be ruled out  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616" href="/d/graphic/109616.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17"><span class="h2">Rule out pregnancy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A pregnancy test is recommended as a first step in evaluating any woman with secondary amenorrhea. Measurement of serum beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is the most sensitive test. Commercially available home kits for measurement of hCG in urine are improving, but the clinician who suspects pregnancy should order a serum hCG measurement, even if the woman had a negative home test. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/440.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of early pregnancy", section on 'Types of pregnancy tests'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The woman should be asked about any past medical history, risk factors, or symptoms that might suggest any of the major causes of secondary amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616" href="/d/graphic/109616.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59801" href="/d/graphic/59801.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The history should include the following questions:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Has there been stress, change in weight, diet, or exercise habits, or is there an eating disorder or illness (that might result in functional hypothalamic amenorrhea) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]? (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/104135.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and causes of secondary amenorrhea", section on 'Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Is the woman taking any drugs that might cause or be associated with amenorrhea? The drug may be taken for a systemic illness that itself can cause hypothalamic amenorrhea. Newly initiated or discontinued oral contraceptives can be associated with several months of amenorrhea, as can androgenic drugs like <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9321" href="/d/drug information/9321.html" rel="external">danazol</a> or a high-dose progestin. Other drugs cause amenorrhea by increasing serum prolactin (PRL) concentrations, including <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9642" href="/d/drug information/9642.html" rel="external">metoclopramide</a> and antipsychotic drugs. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6626.html" rel="external">"Causes of hyperprolactinemia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Is there hirsutism, acne, and a history of irregular menses (suggestive of hyperandrogenism)? (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7436.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Are there symptoms of hypothalamic-pituitary disease, including headaches, visual field defects, fatigue, or polyuria and polydipsia? (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6632.html" rel="external">"Causes, presentation, and evaluation of sellar masses"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Are there any symptoms of estrogen deficiency, including hot flashes, vaginal dryness, poor sleep, or decreased libido? These symptoms may be prominent with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). In contrast, women with hypothalamic amenorrhea do <strong>not</strong> usually have these symptoms, despite the presence of similarly low serum estradiol (E2) concentrations. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7414.html" rel="external">"Autoimmune primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7435.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis and causes of spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Has the patient had galactorrhea, which suggests hyperprolactinemia?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Is there a history of obstetrical catastrophe, severe bleeding, dilatation and curettage, or endometritis or other infection that might have caused scarring of the endometrial lining (Asherman syndrome)? (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3285.html" rel="external">"Intrauterine adhesions: Clinical manifestation and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1489618499"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In addition to the medical history, the physical examination may provide clues about the possible cause of amenorrhea  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616" href="/d/graphic/109616.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59801" href="/d/graphic/59801.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The examination in women with secondary amenorrhea should include measurements of height and weight. A body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> is observed in 50 percent or more of women with PCOS, depending on the population studied. Women with a BMI less than 18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> may have functional hypothalamic amenorrhea due to an eating disorder, strenuous exercise, or a systemic illness associated with weight loss. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7393.html" rel="external">"Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations"</a>.)</p><p>The patient should also be examined for hirsutism, acne, striae, acanthosis nigricans, vitiligo, and easy bruisability. Breasts should be examined for evidence of galactorrhea, and a vulvovaginal examination should look for signs of estrogen deficiency. Parotid gland swelling and/or erosion of dental enamel would suggest an eating disorder (bulimia nervosa). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7436.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14728.html" rel="external">"Bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder in adults: Medical complications and their management", section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20"><span class="h2">Laboratory testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial laboratory evaluation (after ruling out pregnancy) for women with secondary amenorrhea should include follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), serum PRL, E2, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) to test for POI, hyperprolactinemia, and thyroid disease, respectively. In women with prolonged amenorrhea, this is measured on a random day. However, if menses occurs, testing is ideally performed on day 3 (although any day between 1 and 5 would be reasonable)  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616" href="/d/graphic/109616.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>The clinical utility of this approach (measuring FSH, PRL, and TSH) was examined in a study of 127 women with adult-onset amenorrhea [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. High serum FSH concentrations, high PRL, and abnormal TSH were seen in 10, 7.5, and 2.5 percent of patients, respectively, suggesting that this is a reasonable approach to initial testing in women with secondary amenorrhea.</p><p>We measure serum E2 as one of the initial tests with serum FSH to evaluate the pituitary-ovarian axis. Low or normal E2 that is associated with an elevated FSH indicates POI, while low or normal E2 associated with FSH that is normal or low suggests the possibility of secondary (pituitary or hypothalamic) hypogonadism, either structural or functional.<strong> </strong>Interpretation of the serum E2 should also take into account that levels change across the menstrual cycle and it may be variable in women with either early POI or functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (during recovery). In addition, a single sample may not reflect exposure to E2 over weeks. For this reason, E2 status sometimes is assessed by measurement of endometrial thickness on pelvic ultrasound. Although we no longer routinely perform the progestin withdrawal test, in the absence of E2 testing and/or pelvic ultrasound availability, it is a reasonable option. (See <a class="local">'Assessment of estrogen status'</a> below.)</p><p>If there is clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism (hirsutism, acne, scalp hair loss [alopecia]), serum total testosterone should be measured in addition to the initial laboratory tests listed for women without hyperandrogenism. In addition, many measure 17-hydroxyprogesterone at the initial visit to rule out nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616" href="/d/graphic/109616.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'High serum androgens'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7441.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of premenopausal women with hirsutism", section on 'Biochemical testing'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2107532589"><span class="h1">ADDITIONAL EVALUATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H120039692"><span class="h2">Prolactin high</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prolactin (PRL) secretion can be transiently increased by stress, eating, sexual intercourse, and exercise. Therefore, if prolactin is mildly elevated (&lt;50 ng/mL [&lt;50 mcg/L]) we recommend that it be repeated fasting, in the morning, and without exercise before pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is ordered. All of these women should be screened for thyroid disease because hypothyroidism can sometimes cause hyperprolactinemia. (See <a class="local">'Abnormal TSH'</a> below.)</p><p>If a mildly elevated serum PRL is confirmed to be high on a second sample, or if the initial sample is &gt;50 ng/mL (&gt;50 mcg/L), a pituitary MRI should be performed unless a very clear explanation is found for the elevation (eg, untreated hypothyroidism or antipsychotic drug use). The goal of imaging is to evaluate the possibility of a hypothalamic or pituitary lesion. In the case of a lactotroph adenoma, the image will allow determination of whether it is a microadenoma or a macroadenoma (≤1 or &gt;1 cm, respectively). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6638.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and evaluation of hyperprolactinemia", section on 'Laboratory/imaging tests'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2901548053"><span class="h2">Abnormal TSH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Both hypo- and hyperthyroidism can be associated with oligo- or amenorrhea. A third-generation thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) assay is usually all that is needed to diagnose hypo- or hyperthyroidism. The only exception would be in central hypothyroidism, where free thyroxine (T4) and TSH will both be low. In severe eating disorders, a suppressed TSH and free T4 may also be seen.</p><p>In some cases of profound hypothyroidism, there may be a slight increase in serum PRL (due to a presumed increase in hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone [TRH], which stimulates both TSH and PRL secretion) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Treatment of the hypothyroidism restores serum PRL to normal. Therefore, a pituitary MRI should not be performed unless hyperprolactinemia persists after the patient is euthyroid. (See <a class="local">'Prolactin high'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1099364788"><span class="h2">High serum FSH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A high serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration indicates primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), formerly referred to as premature ovarian failure. It should be kept in mind, however, that intermittent follicular development does occur in women with POI, resulting in transient normalization of serum FSH concentrations. During times of ovarian inactivity and amenorrhea, FSH is high and serum estradiol (E2) is low, similar to what is seen in normal menopause. The presence of hot flashes and/or vaginal dryness is suggestive of POI as these symptoms are uncommon in women with menstrual disturbances due to other causes  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616" href="/d/graphic/109616.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7443.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure)"</a>.)</p><p>For patients without an obvious precipitating factor for POI (gonadotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy), additional testing to rule out the most common etiologies of POI should be performed, including a karyotype to look for Turner syndrome (including mosaicism). In women with 46,XX spontaneous POI, we also suggest testing for antiadrenal antibodies and the fragile X premutation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7391.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Turner syndrome", section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7435.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis and causes of spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7443.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2572687408"><span class="h2">Low or normal serum FSH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Women with normal serum PRL and TSH, a low or normal serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration, and no history of uterine instrumentation are likely to have a hypothalamic-pituitary disorder or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). A serum FSH concentration that is low or "normal" is inappropriately low in the presence of a low serum E2 concentration and indicates secondary (hypogonadotropic) hypogonadism. This constellation is one of the most common outcomes of laboratory testing in women with amenorrhea  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616" href="/d/graphic/109616.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Although we do not recommend measuring serum luteinizing hormone (LH) level as one of our initial laboratory tests, it can be helpful in the occasional patient who has features of both functional hypothalamic amenorrhea and PCOS (eg, amenorrhea with mild hirsutism and/or acne, but normal/low body mass index [BMI] and a history of exercise) [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. Serum FSH concentrations are low or normal in both functional hypothalamic amenorrhea and PCOS. Serum FSH is typically higher than LH in women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea; in women with PCOS, serum FSH is typically lower than LH. In addition, women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea are hypoestrogenic, while women with PCOS are typically well estrogenized. (See <a class="local">'Assessment of estrogen status'</a> below.)</p><p>Hypothalamic amenorrhea can also be seen with systemic illness such as celiac disease and type 1 diabetes mellitus. We therefore suggest measurement of fasting blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin (A1C) to rule out diabetes mellitus if the patient has polyuria, polydipsia, and serologic screening for celiac disease with immunoglobulin A antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (tTG-IgA). Other specific tests may be done, depending upon the clinical history. As an example, iron studies to test for hemochromatosis should be performed if there is an appropriate family history or if the patient has manifestations of iron overload (bronzed skin, diabetes mellitus, or unexplained heart or liver disease). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7393.html" rel="external">"Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/100553.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of celiac disease in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7157.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with suspected iron overload"</a>.)</p><p>MRI of the sella region is indicated in all women without a clear explanation for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, such as weight loss, exercise, or stress, and in all women who have normal laboratory findings and symptoms such as visual field defects, headaches, or other signs of hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction. In contrast, no further testing is required if the onset of amenorrhea occurred recently or is easily explained and there are no symptoms suggestive of other disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616" href="/d/graphic/109616.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7436.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7385.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Androgen-secreting tumors are typically associated with the rapid onset of virilizing symptoms and, in some adrenal cases, with glucocorticoid excess. Most clinicians initiate evaluation for a tumor if the serum concentration of testosterone is greater than 150 to 200 ng/dL (5.2 to 6.9 nmol/L). This topic is discussed in detail separately.

One approach that many clinicians use is to start with a progestin challenge (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9600" href="/d/drug information/9600.html" rel="external">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> 10 mg for 10 days). If withdrawal bleeding occurs, an outflow tract disorder has been ruled out.</p><p>If bleeding does not occur, estrogen and progestin may be administered. The endometrium may be primed with estradiol 1 mg/day or transdermal estradiol 0.05 mg/day patch twice weekly for 35 days. A progestin is then added from days 26 to 35 (typically medroxyprogesterone 10 mg/day). Failure to bleed upon cessation of this therapy strongly suggests endometrial scarring. In this situation, a hysterosalpingogram or direct visualization of the endometrial cavity with a hysteroscope can confirm the diagnosis of intrauterine adhesions  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109616" href="/d/graphic/109616.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).
