These include the effects of HBV on maternal and fetal health, the effects of pregnancy on the course of HBV infection, treatment of HBV during pregnancy, and prevention of mother-to-child transmission. </p><p>Prevention of mother-to-child transmission is an important component of global efforts to reduce the burden of chronic HBV since vertical transmission is responsible for approximately one-half of chronic infections worldwide. The risk of developing chronic HBV infection is inversely proportional to the age at time of exposure. The risk is as high as 90 percent in those exposed at birth without vaccination, while the risk is much lower (about 20 to 30 percent) in those exposed during childhood. Maternal screening programs and universal vaccination of infants have significantly reduced transmission rates. </p><p>This topic will review special considerations for the management of patients with acute and chronic HBV infection during pregnancy and the postpartum period, as well as prevention of mother-to-child transmission. </p><p>We recognize that not all pregnant, postpartum, and lactating individuals identify as women or mothers. Using gender-inclusive language, however, is not possible in all languages and all countries and for all our readers. The topics discussed here are based on risks driven by biological sex and not gender identify. Therefore, throughout this topic, we use the term "woman" to signify a person of the female sex (regardless of gender identity) and the term "mother" to signify the female biological parent of a child (regardless of gender identity).</p><p>Additional topic reviews that address prevention and management of HBV infection in children, and liver disease in pregnancy, are found elsewhere: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/101483.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis B virus immunization in infants, children, and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4958.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis viruses and the newborn: Clinical manifestations and treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5943.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hepatitis B virus infection in children and adolescents"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/116139.html" rel="external">"Management of hepatitis B virus infection in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3619.html" rel="external">"Acute fatty liver of pregnancy"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6778.html" rel="external">"HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets)"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3560.html" rel="external">"Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3563.html" rel="external">"Approach to evaluating pregnant patients with elevated liver biochemical and function tests"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3561.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy in women with pre-existing chronic liver disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1333645997"><span class="h1">ACUTE HEPATITIS B VIRUS INFECTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute viral hepatitis is the most common cause of jaundice in pregnancy [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Other causes include liver diseases associated with pregnancy, such as acute fatty liver of pregnancy, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome, and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3563.html" rel="external">"Approach to evaluating pregnant patients with elevated liver biochemical and function tests"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3619.html" rel="external">"Acute fatty liver of pregnancy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6778.html" rel="external">"HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3560.html" rel="external">"Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy"</a>.)</p><p>Acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection during pregnancy is usually mild and not associated with increased mortality or teratogenicity [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Thus, infection during gestation should not prompt consideration of termination of the pregnancy. However, there have been reports of an increased incidence of low birth weight and prematurity in infants born to mothers with acute HBV infection [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. </p><p>Acute HBV infection occurring early in the pregnancy has been associated with a 10 percent perinatal transmission rate [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Transmission rates significantly increase if acute infection occurs at or near the time of delivery, with rates as high as 60 percent reported [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Thus, serial monitoring should be performed throughout pregnancy, and if the mother remains hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive or has detectable serum HBV DNA, the infant should receive <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8520" href="/d/drug information/8520.html" rel="external">hepatitis B immune globulin</a> in addition to the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine at birth. Antiviral therapy to reduce maternal viral load should also be considered if the mother has high serum HBV DNA levels near the time of delivery. (See <a class="local">'Prevention of mother-to-child transmission'</a> below.) </p><p>Treatment of acute infection is mainly supportive. Liver biochemical tests and prothrombin time should be monitored. Antiviral therapy is usually unnecessary, except in women who have acute liver failure or protracted severe hepatitis [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3642.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management", section on 'Acute infection'</a>.)</p><p>For those with acute HBV infection who require antiviral therapy, the choice of which agent to use should be based upon the predicted duration of treatment and the accessibility and cost for the patient. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9895" href="/d/drug information/9895.html" rel="external">Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate</a> (TDF) (300 mg daily) or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9544" href="/d/drug information/9544.html" rel="external">lamivudine</a> (100 mg daily) are both suitable options in this setting because both have been safely used during pregnancy, and the risk of developing resistance is low since the duration of treatment is expected to be short [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. However, we prefer TDF as there is less risk of resistance. A more detailed discussion of the safety of antiviral agents for the treatment of HBV during pregnancy is found below. (See <a class="local">'Safety of antiviral agents in pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H182092753"><span class="h1">CHRONIC HEPATITIS B VIRUS INFECTION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2652237504"><span class="h2">Impact of pregnancy on the natural history of chronic HBV</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pregnancy is generally well tolerated in women with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection who do not have advanced liver disease. However, pregnancy is considered to be an immune-tolerant state and is associated with high levels of adrenal corticosteroids that may modulate immune response. Thus, the following clinical manifestations may be seen in pregnant women with chronic HBV:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hepatic flares</strong> – The immunological changes during pregnancy and the postpartum period have been associated with hepatitis flares (including hepatic decompensation); however, flares with serious clinical sequelae appear to be uncommon [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. A flare of HBV infection is typically defined as a greater than two- to threefold rise in the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) that is at least three to five times above the reference range. During the postpartum period, flares may be related to immune reconstitution, a situation immunologically analogous to flares that have been described following the withdrawal of immunosuppressive medications in nonpregnant patients with chronic HBV [<a href="#rid8">8-10</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In a prospective study that followed 126 women during pregnancy and the postpartum period, two patients developed a flare during pregnancy whereas 27 (25 percent) developed a flare in the postpartum period [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. A subsequent retrospective study of 310 pregnant women in the United States with 388 pregnancies found the incidence of hepatitis flares to be low and similar during pregnancy and within six months postdelivery (14 and 16 percent, respectively), although this study was limited by a high percentage of women with missing hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and HBV DNA during pregnancy and a high percentage with missing ALT postpartum [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Predictors of HBV flares during pregnancy have not been established. However, flares appear to be more common in women who are HBeAg positive [<a href="#rid7">7,11</a>]. In addition, flares have been associated with HBeAg seroconversion in approximately 12 to 17 percent of patients [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], a rate similar to what has been described in patients who are not pregnant. Limited evidence suggests that seroconversion is unrelated to maternal age, parity, or the presence of precore or basal core promotor mutations [<a href="#rid8">8,12</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3627.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis B virus: Clinical manifestations and natural history", section on 'Immune-active, HBeAg-negative'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Progression of liver disease</strong> – The immunologic, metabolic, and hemodynamic changes that occur during pregnancy have the potential to worsen or unmask underlying liver disease. Although progression to cirrhosis is not expected within such a short time for most patients, decompensation can occur in the setting of a severe flare.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, it can be difficult to assess the progression of liver disease during pregnancy because of normal physiologic changes that can mimic clinical features of chronic liver disease. In particular, serum albumin and hematocrit often decrease, while alkaline phosphatase and alpha fetoprotein increase. Similarly, physical examination may reveal findings suggestive of stigmata of chronic liver disease such as palmar erythema, lower extremity edema, and spider angiomata.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>HBV DNA</strong> – The immunologic changes associated with pregnancy also have the potential to increase HBV viremia; however, most studies have found that HBV DNA levels remain stable during pregnancy [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H779530320"><span class="h2">Effect of chronic HBV on pregnancy outcomes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For mothers with chronic HBV, the impact of HBV infection on newborns is not well defined and data are conflicting [<a href="#rid15">15-23</a>]. As an example, one large study compared 824 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive women with 6281 HBsAg-negative controls [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. No differences were seen in gestational age at delivery, birth weight, incidence of prematurity, neonatal jaundice, congenital anomalies, or perinatal mortality. However, other studies have found possible associations between chronic HBV and gestational diabetes mellitus [<a href="#rid15">15,16,20</a>], increased risk of prematurity [<a href="#rid21">21</a>], lower birth weight [<a href="#rid22">22</a>], and antepartum hemorrhage [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. </p><p>Women with cirrhosis are at significant risk for perinatal complications and poor maternal and fetal outcomes [<a href="#rid23">23</a>], including intrauterine growth restriction, intrauterine infection, premature delivery, and intrauterine fetal demise. The increased risk was demonstrated in a population-based study in Canada, which compared maternal and fetal outcomes in 399 patients with cirrhosis to a matched control group who delivered between 1993 and 2005 [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Maternal complications including gestational hypertension, placental abruption, and peripartum hemorrhage were increased in the group with cirrhosis. In addition, 15 percent of mothers with cirrhosis developed hepatic decompensation. Overall mortality was significantly higher than controls (1.8 versus 0 percent). Infants born to mothers with cirrhosis also had higher rates of prematurity and growth restriction and significantly higher rates of fetal mortality (5.2 versus 2.1 percent). Other reports have described an increased risk of variceal bleeding, particularly during the third trimester and during labor because of increased intra-abdominal pressure and plasma volume expansion. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3561.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy in women with pre-existing chronic liver disease", section on 'Cirrhosis and portal hypertension'</a>.)</p><p>A discussion of mother-to-child transmission is found below. (See <a class="local">'Mother-to-child transmission'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H50248265"><span class="h2">Management considerations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Various factors need to be assessed when determining the management of pregnant women with chronic HBV during pregnancy, including the indications for treatment, the anticipated duration of therapy, the potential adverse effects to the fetus, the risk of developing drug resistance, and the accessibility and cost of the antiviral agents. The health of the mother and fetus must be considered independently when deciding on treatment. Pregnant women with chronic HBV should be managed in conjunction with a hepatologist. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3801167499"><span class="h3">Patients who are pregnant</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some patients with chronic HBV require antiviral therapy to prevent progression of liver disease (eg, those with immune-active hepatitis), while others can be observed.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients who become pregnant while receiving antiviral therapy </strong>– Women should inform their clinician immediately if they become pregnant while receiving antiviral therapy, and the risks and benefits of continuing treatment should be discussed. Continuing treatment may pose a risk to the fetus while discontinuing treatment may pose a risk of hepatitis flare for the mother. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Discontinuing treatment can be considered in women without cirrhosis if the patient has achieved a therapeutic endpoint (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3642.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management", section on 'Duration and treatment endpoints'</a>). Otherwise, women receiving <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8816" href="/d/drug information/8816.html" rel="external">entecavir</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8690" href="/d/drug information/8690.html" rel="external">adefovir</a>, interferon, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="110861" href="/d/drug information/110861.html" rel="external">tenofovir alafenamide</a> (a formulation of tenofovir that was approved in 2016) can continue treatment by switching to an alternative agent, such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9895" href="/d/drug information/9895.html" rel="external">tenofovir disoproxil fumarate</a> (TDF), which has more safety data available and appears to be safe for use in pregnancy. These women should be monitored closely during the transition period to ensure viral suppression. A more detailed discussion of the safety of antiviral agents during pregnancy is found below. (See <a class="local">'Safety of antiviral agents in pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indications for antiviral therapy </strong>– The decision to initiate therapy while pregnant depends upon the presence or absence of cirrhosis, HBeAg, and hepatitis B e antibody (anti-HBe), as well as the HBV DNA and aminotransferase levels [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3642.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management", section on 'Indications for antiviral therapy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3642.html" rel="external">"Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The indications for antiviral therapy in pregnant women are generally the same as those for patients who are not pregnant. Antiviral therapy is recommended for patients with a persistently elevated ALT &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal and an elevated HBV DNA (HBV DNA &gt;20,000 international units/mL in HBeAg-positive patients or HBV DNA ≥2000 international units/mL in HBeAg-negative patients)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58520" href="/d/graphic/58520.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, for those without cirrhosis, some scenarios may differ. As examples:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>During pregnancy, a person may choose to defer therapy until after delivery if there is only evidence of mild disease activity, such as aminotransferase levels just above the treatment threshold. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>By contrast, a person with a viral load &gt;2 x 10<sup>5 </sup>international units/mL during pregnancy should initiate therapy in the third trimester, even if the aminotransferase levels are normal. In this setting, the goal of therapy is to prevent transmission to the child. The use of antiviral therapy to prevent maternal fetal transmission is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Maternal antiviral therapy to prevent transmission'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">TDF is preferred if antiviral therapy is contemplated during pregnancy because of its potency; safety profile, including use during first trimester; and low risk of resistance. There is accumulating data that <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="110861" href="/d/drug information/110861.html" rel="external">tenofovir alafenamide</a> may also be safe in pregnancy [<a href="#rid26">26-28</a>].

In addition, the HBV DNA should be measured at 26 to 28 weeks to determine if antiviral therapy should be offered to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission. (See <a class="local">'Maternal antiviral therapy to prevent transmission'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients with cirrhosis</strong> – The management of cirrhosis in a pregnant woman does not differ from that of nonpregnant patients. Variceal screening with endoscopy is still recommended and is safe during pregnancy. Active variceal bleeding should be managed the same way with banding.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of 129 studies found a protective effect of antiviral therapy, regardless of the agent used, with the odds ratio of HBV infection being 0.16 (95% CI 0.10-0.26) for TDF, 0.17 (95% CI 0.13-0.22) for <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9544" href="/d/drug information/9544.html" rel="external">lamivudine</a>, and 0.20 (95% CI 0.08-0.13) for <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9488" href="/d/drug information/9488.html" rel="external">telbivudine</a> [<a href="#rid56">56</a>]. In almost all the studies, infants received HBIG in addition to birth dose HBV vaccine. In an analysis of six studies that reported the risk of maternal HBV flare after discontinuation of TDF, the risk was similar between those who did and did not received TDF at a matched time-point (8 versus 6 percent, respectively). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In a meta-analysis of 26 studies, which included 3622 pregnant women, antiviral therapy (in addition to passive and active immunization of the newborn) significantly reduced neonatal HBV transmission as evidenced by a reduced risk of infant HbsAg seropositivity (risk ratio 0.3; 95% CI 0.2-0.4) and a reduced risk of HBV DNA seropositivity (risk ratio 0.3; 95% CI 0.2-0.5) [<a href="#rid83">83</a>]. In addition, among mothers who received antiviral therapy and their newborns, there was no increased risk of adverse outcomes (eg, congenital malformations, prematurity, postpartum hemorrhage). However, there are concerns about the quality of the data in this analysis given the small numbers of events and the limited data on the safety of the antiviral agents in newborns. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">One of the key trials evaluating antiviral therapy was a randomized trial of 200 pregnant women from China who were HbeAg positive and had HBV DNA &gt;2 x<sup> 1</sup>0<sup>5 </sup>international units/mL (median<sup> </sup>10<sup>8</sup> international units/mL) at baseline received either TDF (300 mg) or placebo, starting at 30 to 32 weeks gestation and continuing 4 weeks postpartum [<a href="#rid84">84</a>]. All infants received standard immunoprophylaxis using HBIG and the hepatitis B vaccine. At postpartum week 28, the mother-to-child transmission rate was significantly lower for infants born to tenofovir-treated women compared with untreated women (5 versus 18 percent). Among the 92 mothers who received tenofovir and completed the trial, there was no transmission of HBV. In addition, no significant differences in the rate of birth defects between babies born to treated and untreated mothers (2.1 versus 1.1 percent) were noted. After treatment was discontinued, more of the mothers who received tenofovir had elevations in their alanine aminotransferase levels, but none of the mothers had severe flares or hepatic decompensation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The efficacy of tenofovir in reducing mother-to-child transmission was also demonstrated in a prospective study of 118 pregnant women who had an HBV DNA <sup>≥107.5</sup> international units/mL and were positive for HbsAg and HbeAg [<a href="#rid82">82</a>]. Women received tenofovir (300 mg daily), which was initiated at week 30 to 32 of gestation, or no antiviral therapy, and treatment was continued for one month postpartum. All infants received passive and active immunization. Newborns born to mothers who received tenofovir had significantly lower rates of HbsAg positivity at six months (1.5 versus 10.7 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Conflicting results were found in a randomized trial in Thailand that evaluated the use of maternal TDF in 331 pregnant women with chronic HBV and a median HBV viral load of 10<sup>8</sup> international units/mL. In this trial, mothers initiated TDF or placebo at week 28 and continued therapy for two months postpartum [<a href="#rid91">91</a>]. All newborns received HBIG plus hepatitis B vaccine at birth, and then four additional doses of hepatitis B vaccine at one, two, four, and six months. Among those women who completed the study (147 in each arm), there was no difference in rates of transmission (0 versus 2 percent, not significant). Approximately 10 percent of patients in each group were lost to follow-up; however, similar results were obtained if last available infection status was imputed or analysis was performed with missing data imputed as infected. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although TDF did not demonstrate a clear benefit in this trial, these findings do not alter our approach to maternal antiviral therapy since the generalizability is limited. As an example, the adherence to the protocol for infant immunoprophylaxis in this trial may not be replicable in other settings. HBIG and birth-dose vaccine are not available in many countries despite recommendations from the WHO [<a href="#rid92">92</a>]. Even in countries with birth-dose HBV vaccination programs, such as the United States, the recommended timing of HBV vaccine is within 12 hours of birth [<a href="#rid78">78</a>], and only 71.1 percent of infants receive birth-dose HBV vaccine by three days of life [<a href="#rid93">93</a>]. In addition, infants in this study received four doses of HBV vaccine before assessment for HBV infection at six months, whereas most guidelines recommend only two to three doses before six months  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76345" href="/d/graphic/76345.html" rel="external">table 4A</a>). The results of this study do not refute the current recommendation to administer antiviral therapy to highly viremic mothers, but suggest that further investigation of postexposure immunization regimens may be warranted.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H28184739"><span class="h3">Newborn immunization</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Newborns of mothers who test positive for HbsAg should receive passive-active immunization, with the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine series and one dose of HBIG administered within 12 hours of delivery at different sites  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76345 graphicRef55139" href="/d/graphic/76345.html" rel="external">table 4A-B</a>). Infants should then complete the hepatitis B vaccine series. A more detailed discussion of HBV immunization in infants born to HbsAg-positive mothers is found elsewhere.

The prevalence of HBsAg among the children who received birth dose vaccine in less than 24 hours was 5.6 percent versus 16.7 percent in those who received the birth dose vaccine 48 to 96 hours after birth. One limitation of this study was the varying time when the children were tested for HBsAg; some children were tested after the age of three years, therefore, horizontal transmission could not be ruled out.</p><p>To eliminate viral hepatitis B by 2030, the World Health Assembly adopted the Global Health Sector Strategy (GHSS) on viral hepatitis in 2016 [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. Programmatic targets for vaccination are ≥90 percent coverage of timely hepatitis B birth dose and three doses of HBV vaccine (HepB3). By December 2020, 98 percent of WHO member states had introduced universal infant hepatitis B vaccination, and 57 percent of countries provided HepB-birth-dose vaccine to all newborns [<a href="#rid95">95</a>]. However, only 54 percent had timely administration of the birth dose, and only 52 percent of countries had ≥90 percent HepB3 coverage. There was even a small decline in hepatitis B vaccine coverage in 2020, particularly HepB3, attributed to disruption in service caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. </p><p>There was a marked difference in hepatitis B vaccination coverage in different regions of the world, with the lowest in the African region and the highest in the Western Pacific region (16 percent versus 81 percent for HepB-BD, and 73 percent versus 94 percent for HepB3). These findings highlight the need to identify and overcome barriers to hepatitis B vaccination in the African region, where prevalence of hepatitis B remains high. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H231281766"><span class="h1">SAFETY OF ANTIVIRAL AGENTS IN PREGNANCY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1964382501"><span class="h2">Overview</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Therapeutic options for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) in nonpregnant women include oral nucleos(t)ide analogues and pegylated interferon.

(See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Acute HBV in pregnancy</strong> – Acute HBV infection during pregnancy is usually not severe and is not associated with increased mortality or teratogenicity. Treatment is mainly supportive. However, acute HBV has been associated with mother-to-child transmission. If the mother remains hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive or has a detectable HBV DNA, the infant should receive <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8520" href="/d/drug information/8520.html" rel="external">hepatitis B immune globulin</a> (HBIG) in addition to routine hepatitis B vaccination.

However, administering HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine to infants at delivery can reduce transmission by at least 95 percent. The most important risk factors for transmission, despite prophylaxis, appear to be a positive hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in the mother and a high maternal HBV viral load (&gt;200,000 international units/mL).
