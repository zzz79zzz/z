Early detection and treatment may reduce disease-related morbidity and complications.</p><p>The following facts about childhood cancer set the stage for a discussion of issues surrounding clinical assessment of the child with suspected cancer:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Although childhood cancers are rare, they are the leading cause of disease-related death in individuals between 1 and 19 years of age in the United States [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Mortality is higher among boys compared with girls and among adolescents compared with younger children [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>At least 85 percent of pediatric cancers are associated with the presenting signs and symptoms discussed in this topic review; the remaining 10 to 15 percent of tumors are associated with unusual signs and symptoms and are more difficult to diagnose in the early stages [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Delays in diagnosis have been shown to be related to the child's age (older children are at a higher risk for delay), the specific type of cancer, presenting symptoms, tumor site, first medical specialty consulted, and access to health care [<a href="#rid5">5-8</a>]. The time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis of pediatric cancer is variable based on the type of malignancy. The reported average time to diagnosis ranges from 2 to 5 weeks for neuroblastoma, 3 to 5 weeks for acute leukemias, 7 to 10 weeks for lymphomas, 8 to 15 weeks for bone tumors, and 8 to &gt;20 weeks for brain tumors [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Common sites of childhood malignancies include blood and bone marrow, brain and nervous system, lymph nodes, kidneys, bone, and soft tissues [<a href="#rid2">2,9</a>]. The frequency of a particular cancer depends upon the age of the child  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef99680" href="/d/graphic/99680.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). For example, neuroblastoma and Wilms tumor occur most commonly in children between birth and four years of age; leukemia occurs most often in children &lt;10 years old; and Ewing sarcoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and thyroid cancer are more common in children &gt;10 years of age [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Five-year survival rates vary by diagnosis but are approximately 80 to 85 percent when all cancer types are considered together [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>].

Survivors of certain types of childhood cancer (eg, retinoblastoma) are at risk for developing secondary malignancies [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>]. The family history should include information about parents, siblings, and first cousins. Age, serious illnesses, congenital anomalies, and cause of death for deceased family members should also be elicited [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">COMMON SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Childhood cancer may present with signs and symptoms that are shared by other childhood illnesses  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef131813" href="/d/graphic/131813.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). Although a single finding in isolation does not always require evaluation for cancer, a combination of multiple findings (eg, weight loss, bone pain, and lymphadenopathy; easy bruising, abnormal blood counts, and hepatosplenomegaly) is worrisome and generally warrants evaluation for malignancy. In addition, certain findings are worrisome even as isolated findings (eg, abdominal or mediastinal masses, headaches associated with vomiting in the morning, blasts on the peripheral blood smear) and require prompt evaluation and consultation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3805017"><span class="h2">Constitutional symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Nonspecific constitutional symptoms including fever, weight loss, and fatigue are common findings in children with cancer.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Fever</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Fever is a common complaint in children and is rarely attributable to malignancy.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>When to suspect malignancy</strong> – Suspicion for noninfectious causes should be raised when the febrile illness does not follow the usual course or fails to respond to seemingly appropriate therapy. However, even when fever is prolonged, infection remains the most common cause [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. In published reports of children with prolonged fever, a small minority (approximately 5 percent) were found to have a malignancy, most commonly leukemia and lymphoma [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5996.html" rel="external">"Fever of unknown origin in children: Etiology"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5993.html" rel="external">"Fever of unknown origin in children: Evaluation", section on 'Causes'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In the absence of infection, persistent or recurring fever may reflect an occult neoplasm, such as lymphoma; rarely, it may be secondary to tumor-related necrosis, such as with neuroblastoma or Wilms tumor. Persistent fever also may be the only complaint in children with leukemia, Ewing sarcoma, and Langerhans cell histiocytosis [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. More than one-half of children with leukemia have fever at the time of presentation [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6244.html" rel="external">"Overview of the clinical presentation and diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7744.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, staging, and prognostic factors of Ewing sarcoma"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8385.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A thorough physical examination may reveal additional worrisome findings such as lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. (See <a class="local">'Lymphadenopathy'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5928.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with an enlarged spleen"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – The initial diagnostic evaluation for a child with a fever that does not respond to seemingly appropriate therapy should include (but is not limited to) a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, examination of the peripheral blood smear, blood culture, and chest radiography. Additional studies may be indicated for fever of unknown origin, as discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5993.html" rel="external">"Fever of unknown origin in children: Evaluation", section on 'Overview of evaluation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The white blood cell (WBC) differential and examination of the peripheral blood smear may help distinguish the underlying cause of fever. The presence of circulating blasts  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57831" href="/d/graphic/57831.html" rel="external">picture 1A</a>) or profound neutropenia or thrombocytopenia can suggest the diagnosis of leukemia, in which case, referral to a pediatric oncologist and bone marrow examination is generally warranted, particularly if two cell lines are affected (see <a class="local">'Blood count abnormalities'</a> below). On the other hand, the presence of atypical lymphocytes may suggest a nonmalignant etiology (eg, mononucleosis or other viral illnesses).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Chest radiography may reveal an intrathoracic mass. (See <a class="local">'Mediastinal masses'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3777340822"><span class="h3">Weight loss</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most children who present with isolated weight loss have nonmalignant etiologies (eg, dehydration, infection, malnutrition). However, patients with continued, unintentional weight loss in the setting of anemia, pallor, bruising, body pains, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, unexplained fevers, or fatigue may have an underlying malignancy. The evaluation of children with weight loss is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16377.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of weight loss in infants over six months of age, children, and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3594027310"><span class="h3">Fatigue and pallor</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Decreased energy, fatigue, and pallor can occur in a wide range of diseases. Pallor is most often due to anemia but may also occur in nonhematologic conditions such as chronic infection, rheumatologic disorders, heart failure, arrhythmia, or metabolic disorders. Fatigue and pallor are most commonly due to nonmalignant causes; however, concern for malignancy may be raised if there are other concerning accompanying findings (petechiae, bruising, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, bone pain). Initial laboratory testing in children with pallor generally includes a CBC with differential and reticulocyte count. This can help to identify if there are other concerning hematologic findings (eg, other cell lines affected, peripheral blasts  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57831" href="/d/graphic/57831.html" rel="external">picture 1A</a>)), which should prompt consideration of referral and bone marrow examination. (See <a class="local">'Blood count abnormalities'</a> below.)</p><p>The evaluation of pallor and anemia in children are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6447.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of pallor in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5927.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with anemia"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Headache</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Headache is another common symptom in general pediatric practice. Intracranial tumors are a rare cause of headache in children, but they must be considered when headaches are persistent or worsening in intensity, particularly if they are associated with vomiting, visual changes, asymmetric weakness, or coordination difficulties. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2842.html" rel="external">"Headache in children: Approach to evaluation and general management strategies", section on 'Worrisome findings'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6250.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of central nervous system tumors in children", section on 'Common presenting signs and symptoms'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>History and physical examination</strong> – The history of headache for a child, particularly a child who is &lt;10 years old, is best obtained with input from the parents. Important aspects of the history and physical examination are summarized in the tables  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71717 graphicRef59967" href="/d/graphic/71717.html" rel="external">table 5A-B</a>).

Indications for neuroimaging and the choice of imaging modality in children with suspected brain tumors are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6250.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of central nervous system tumors in children", section on 'Neuroimaging'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Lymphadenopathy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Lymphadenopathy is another common finding in children. The size of normal lymph nodes in children varies widely as children are exposed to new viruses and bacteria. Most children have palpable small cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymph nodes at some time during childhood. The size of a lymph node that is considered abnormal varies depending upon the lymph node region and age of the child. The risk of malignancy is increased in lymph nodes that are &gt;2 cm (0.8 inches) in diameter, although malignancy may occur in smaller nodes. This is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2867.html" rel="external">"Peripheral lymphadenopathy in children: Evaluation and diagnostic approach", section on 'Lymph nodes'</a>.)</p><p>Most enlarged nodes are related to benign causes such as infection [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. However, lymphadenopathy may be a presenting sign of leukemia, lymphoma and neuroblastoma. In contrast, lymphadenopathy is uncommon (although seen occasionally) with soft tissue, bone, and germ cell tumors. The site of the adenopathy and the child's age may help narrow the range of possible diagnoses. The most common cancers associated with lymphadenopathy of the head and neck are neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukemia in children &lt;6 years old, whereas lymphomas (both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin) predominate in children between 7 and 13 years of age; Hodgkin lymphoma is the most common histology in children older than 13 years.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – Clinical features that are worrisome for malignancy in children with lymphadenopathy are summarized in the table and discussed in detail separately  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106127" href="/d/graphic/106127.html" rel="external">table 6</a>).

Prior to biopsy, it is essential to involve a pathologist, ideally with pediatric oncology expertise, to ensure appropriate initial specimen processing. Biopsy specimens should be placed in normal <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12796" href="/d/drug information/12796.html" rel="external">saline</a> and then transported immediately on ice to the surgical pathology laboratory. Gross examination of the tissue by the pathologist before processing helps to ensure that the specimen is adequate. Intraoperative frozen sections may be necessary to ensure diagnostic material, particularly if an immediate diagnosis will alter the planned operation. Definitive, specific diagnoses are rarely made from frozen sections, and it is critical to wait for final pathology results to ensure an accurate treatment plan. When appropriate, other procedures (eg, central venous catheter placement, bone marrow aspirate/biopsy) may be performed at the time of biopsy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H24"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Importance of early diagnosis</strong> – Optimal management of childhood cancer requires a high level of suspicion by the primary care practitioner and early referral to a pediatric oncologist.
