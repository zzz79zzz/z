It is characterized by tissue responsiveness to thyroid hormone that does not reflect the circulating thyroid hormone levels.</p><p>Three types of RTH have been identified, based on the underlying defect in TR [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>RTH-beta – Due to <em>THRB</em> gene defects</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>RTH-alpha – Due to <em>THRA</em> gene defects</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>RTH of unknown etiology (nonTR-RTH) – Likely due to an abnormality in a cofactor or interfering substance</p><p></p><p>These disorders will be discussed below. Other inherited disorders of thyroid hormone secretion, transport, and metabolism are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5845.html" rel="external">"Resistance to thyrotropin and thyrotropin-releasing hormone"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/132665.html" rel="external">"Genetic defects in thyroid hormone transport and metabolism"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">NORMAL THYROID HORMONE PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Maintenance of thyroid hormone supply is ensured by a feedback control mechanism involving the hypothalamus, pituitary, and thyroid gland, as shown in panel A of the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70604" href="/d/graphic/70604.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). A decreased thyroid hormone supply stimulates secretion of thyrotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary thyrotrophs, which, in turn, stimulates thyroid follicular cells to synthesize and secrete thyroid hormone. Conversely, thyroid hormone excess shuts down the system through the same pathway until a steady state is restored.</p><p>Local requirements for thyroid hormone are adjusted through additional mechanisms. One such system is the control of thyroid hormone entry into the cell through active transmembrane transporters [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Activation of the prohormone thyroxine (T4) by removal of one of the outer ring iodine atoms (5'-deiodination) to form triiodothyronine (T3), or the inactivation of T4 and T3 by inner ring (5-deiodination) to form reverse T3 (rT3) and T2, respectively, provide an added level of control, as shown in panel B of the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70604" href="/d/graphic/70604.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>Finally, the presence and abundance of thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), through which thyroid hormone action is mediated, determine the type and degree of hormonal response. Action takes place in the nucleus as well as in the cytosol of the target cell [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. TR action in the nucleus is known as a genomic effect and has been more extensively studied, as shown in panel C of the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70604" href="/d/graphic/70604.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. There are two TRs (TR-alpha and TR-beta), which are encoded by separate genes located on chromosomes 17 and 3, respectively. In addition, different isoforms are synthesized through alternative transcription and splicing. The receptors have structural and sequence similarities with DNA-binding and T3-binding domains  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77294" href="/d/graphic/77294.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). Other regions of the molecules are involved in dimerization with another TR (homodimerization) or another type of nuclear receptor (heterodimerization), as well as in binding corepressor and coactivator protein cofactors [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>].</p><p>In the nucleus, TRs act as transcription factors that regulate expression of specific genes, which are recognized through a DNA sequence known as the thyroid hormone response element (TRE). Dimers of unliganded (without T3) receptors bind to TREs and recruit corepressor proteins, resulting in inhibition of the expression of genes that are positively regulated by T3. When T3 binds to the receptors, the TR molecule undergoes a steric change that results in release of the corepressor protein, dissociation of the dimers, and formation of heterodimers of TR and retinoid X receptors that then bind coactivator proteins  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70604" href="/d/graphic/70604.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). These changes promote expression of the target genes and ultimately increase the synthesis of specific proteins. Through this mechanism, genes such as that for type 1 iodothyronine deiodinase are upregulated and the gene for thyrotropin beta subunit is downregulated. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7864.html" rel="external">"Thyroid hormone action"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">MECHANISMS OF IMPAIRED SENSITIVITY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3730396601"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the late 1950s, blood tests that measure the amount of circulating thyroid hormone replaced the tedious and inaccurate determination of the basal metabolic rate as a means to define the thyroid status. High and low circulating thyroid hormone levels became the accepted standard for the diagnosis of hyper- and hypothyroidism, respectively.</p><p>This notion was first challenged in 1967 with the identification of inherited circulating thyroid hormone excess in the absence of hyperthyroidism, attributed to target organ refractoriness to thyroid hormone [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. It took another 22 years before it was demonstrated that the syndrome was caused by defects in the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) beta [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. This now relatively well-recognized condition is the main focus of this topic review.</p><p>In the early 2000s, additional disorders were identified that are caused by impaired transport or metabolism of thyroid hormone, resulting in reduced sensitivity to thyroid hormone in the target tissues. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/132665.html" rel="external">"Genetic defects in thyroid hormone transport and metabolism"</a>.)</p><p>These conditions are often grouped together as impaired sensitivity to thyroid hormone  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110783" href="/d/graphic/110783.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), although their causal mechanisms are quite distinct.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2751078473"><span class="h2">Classification and nomenclature</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A classification and nomenclature for the forms of impaired sensitivity to thyroid hormone are outlined below  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110783" href="/d/graphic/110783.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. These defects should be considered in a patient with thyroid function tests that show a discordance of serum thyroid hormone and thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]) concentrations, and each defect has its own constellation of test abnormalities and different clinical presentation.</p><p>The types of known and postulated defects are listed below according to the physiologic sequence of thyroid hormone cell transport, metabolism, and action rather than by clinical frequency.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thyroid hormone cell membrane transport defect (THCMTD)</strong> – Abnormal intracellular levels of thyroid hormone can be caused by defects in one of the cell transport proteins that allow thyroid hormone to enter cells  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70604" href="/d/graphic/70604.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).

This disorder is discussed in a separate topic review. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/132665.html" rel="external">"Genetic defects in thyroid hormone transport and metabolism", section on 'Thyroid hormone cell membrane transport defect'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thyroid hormone metabolism defect (THMD)</strong> – T4, the main hormone secreted by the thyroid gland, is a prohormone that must be activated by conversion to T3, as shown in panel B of the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70604" href="/d/graphic/70604.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).

It has been detected in 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 19,000 live births [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>] and occurs with equal frequency in males and females. With the exception of a single family, all cases to date have shown an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.</p><p>More than 4000 individuals belonging to 805 families have been shown to have RTH-beta, harboring 236 different mutations [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Among 326 families investigated in the authors' institution, thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR-beta) gene mutations were identified in 85 percent and 28 percent occurred de novo  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77294" href="/d/graphic/77294.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Categorization</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H39030316"><span class="h3">RTH-beta</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In approximately 85 percent of cases, RTH is due to mutations in the TR-beta gene (<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fomim.org%2Fentry%2F190160&amp;token=87jLzclRwWxNoI%2BQq5Gg7z7hZaJG2j3Bj8HgVoGeF2kPRFDSaUD7NjGiJcgJXaQ3&amp;TOPIC_ID=5827" target="_blank">THRB</a>). Most of the mutations are located in the triiodothyronine (T3)-binding domain of the <em>THRB</em> gene  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77294" href="/d/graphic/77294.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). They interfere with the function of the normal <em>THRB</em> gene (dominant-negative effect). One family has been described in which the affected subjects had complete deletion of the <em>THRB</em> gene [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. This was inherited in a recessive manner because the single normal allele in heterozygotes was sufficient for normal function. Somatic mutations in the <em>THRB</em> gene have been identified in two thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-producing pituitary adenomas [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p>The severity of hormonal resistance varies among different subjects carrying the same gene mutation, such as affected siblings. The variation in phenotype is not fully understood but probably results from genetic variability of cofactors involved in thyroid hormone action [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. The main clinical phenotypes were previously categorized as generalized RTH, isolated pituitary RTH, and isolated peripheral tissue RTH, but this classification is no longer used.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H39030331"><span class="h3">NonTR-RTH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In 15 percent of families with clinical and biochemical features that mimic RTH-beta, <em>THRB</em> gene mutations are not detected; this is known as "nonTR-RTH." It is clinically and biochemically indistinguishable from RTH-beta with<em> THRB</em> gene mutations  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75538" href="/d/graphic/75538.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). Mosaicism should be excluded by sequencing the receptor in DNA obtained from different tissues or by in-depth sequencing. However, mosaicism has been ruled out in several of these families. Mutations in some of the cofactors that interact with the receptor cannot be excluded and may be responsible for the resistance in some of these families [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3243588688"><span class="h2">Mechanisms and biochemical features</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with RTH-beta, all tissues that express TR-beta have reduced sensitivity to action of T3. The severity of hormonal resistance varies among different tissues in an affected individual, probably due to differences in the relative expression of TR-beta and thyroid hormone receptor alpha (TR-alpha) in different tissues [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. As an example, the tachycardia that occurs in patients with RTH-beta is probably caused by the high serum thyroxine (T4) and T3 concentrations in the heart, an organ expressing predominantly the alpha isoform of the TR [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>]. Cardiac arrhythmias can be found in up to 20 percent of patients with RTH-beta; impaired cardiac systolic and diastolic functions can be also present, but heart failure has not been reported [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Reduced survival and increased cardiovascular morbidity has been reported in a cohort of patients with RTH-beta, possibly driven by lifelong cardiac exposure to thyroid hormone excess [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis</strong> – In RTH-beta, resistance of the pituitary thyrotrophs to thyroid hormone raises TSH secretion, which increases the synthesis and secretion of T4 and T3 from the thyroid gland. The elevated levels of these thyroid hormones fail to downregulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis as they would in an individual without RTH-beta, as shown in panel A of the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70604" href="/d/graphic/70604.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). As a result, these patients have high levels of T4 and T3 and normal or high levels of TSH. Because of this apparent dissociation between serum thyroid hormone and TSH concentrations, the syndrome has been called "inappropriate secretion of TSH." However, TSH secretion is not really inappropriate, because the response of the thyrotrophs to thyroid hormone is reduced; to the contrary, it is compensatory and appropriate for the level of thyroid hormone action mediated through the defective TR-beta.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The TSH secreted by these patients is rich in sialic acid and has increased bioactivity as compared with normal TSH [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].

CAP values correlated with age and body mass index in unaffected first-degree relatives, but this was not the case for individuals with RTH-beta, suggesting that the defect in TR-beta signaling was predominant over the effects of age and obesity.

The prevalence of early pregnancy loss was increased fivefold in affected mothers but not in couples with an affected father and unaffected mother. Two-thirds of their infants carried the <em>THRB</em> gene mutation, which suggests that nearly all miscarried fetuses had no mutation and thus a normal response to thyroid hormone. Furthermore, unaffected infants born to affected mothers had lower birth weights and suppressed serum TSH concentrations when compared with affected infants. These adverse pregnancy outcomes are similar to those for infants with excess thyroid hormone, caused by gain-of-function TSH receptor mutations, who are born prematurely and have low birth weights [<a href="#rid50">50</a>].
