Among those who undergo surgical procedures annually in the United States, 2 to 4 percent will develop an SSI, representing a significant burden on the health care system as a whole [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In addition to the more quantifiable detrimental effects, the development of SSI has a significant impact on patient-reported outcomes and is a source of patient anxiety in the postoperative period, particularly after hospital discharge when patients are responsible for their own wound care and SSI triage [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>].</p><p>The general approach to the evaluation and management of SSI is reviewed. Risk factors for SSI and measures to prevent SSI are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/112216.html" rel="external">"Risk factors for impaired wound healing and wound complications"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4044.html" rel="external">"Overview of control measures for prevention of surgical site infection in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4043.html" rel="external">"Antimicrobial prophylaxis for prevention of surgical site infection in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H934632736"><span class="h1">DEFINITION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition of SSI is the most widely used. The CDC defines an SSI as an infection related to a surgical procedure that occurs near the surgical site within 30 days following surgery (or up to 90 days following surgery where an implant is involved) [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. Incisional SSIs are further divided into those involving only skin and subcutaneous tissues (superficial incisional SSI) and those involving deeper softer tissues of the incision (deep incisional SSI)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80661" href="/d/graphic/80661.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116392" href="/d/graphic/116392.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Organ/space infections include abscess, anastomotic leak for intra-abdominal operations, and implant-associated infections. </p><p>Other tools have been used to describe SSIs using objective criteria. These include the ASEPSIS (Additional treatment, the presence of Serous discharge, Erythema, Purulent exudate, and Separation of the deep tissues, the Isolation of bacteria, and the duration of inpatient Stay) scoring system [<a href="#rid7">7</a>], which was created to assess sternal wounds, and a patient-centered wound questionnaire primarily intended for retrospective identification of SSI [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. One review of SSI following colorectal surgery reported better inter-rater agreement between surgeons for ASEPSIS compared with the CDC definitions [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Patients or health care providers can use such tools in the hospital or at home following discharge to assess signs, symptoms, and wound care interventions. A key limitation to both these objective scoring systems is that they are cumbersome and may not be practical outside a research setting. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3928518856"><span class="h1">INCIDENCE AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common reason for unplanned readmission after surgery is SSI [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The incidence of SSI varies widely, ranging from 5 to 30 percent depending upon the operative site and wound classification. It is estimated that SSI develops in 2 to 5 percent of patients undergoing inpatient surgical procedures each year in the United States [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. SSIs are associated with increased morbidity and mortality [<a href="#rid13">13-15</a>]. The incidence of SSI has decreased over time due to widespread prevention efforts [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. However, as the population in the United States ages, the number and complexity of patients undergoing surgery will continue to increase, leading to the development of more SSIs [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4043.html" rel="external">"Antimicrobial prophylaxis for prevention of surgical site infection in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4044.html" rel="external">"Overview of control measures for prevention of surgical site infection in adults"</a>.). </p><p>Surgical site infection in middle- to low-income countries may be higher compared with high-income countries, possibly related to cumulative risk factors and resource limitations. In the FALCON study, the incidence of surgical site infection was 22 percent for clean-contaminated cases and 30 percent for contaminated/dirty cases in low- to middle-income countries [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Risk factors for SSI in the studied population included no antimicrobial prophylaxis, a high proportion of emergency cases, and current smoking.</p><p>SSI rates in ambulatory surgical settings are relatively low. One study reported overall rates at 14 and 30 days of 3.1 and 4.8 per 1000 procedures; however, the surveillance bias in this study was large [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. </p><p>Surgical volume may affect the risk of SSI. In a prospective study of surgical procedures performed at 18 community hospitals, hospitals were separated based on average surgical volume per year: small (&lt;1500 procedures), medium (≥1500 and &lt;4000 procedures), and large (≥4000 procedures) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Prospective surveillance identified 1434 SSIs after 132,111 surgical procedures (prevalence rate = 1.09/100 procedures). After adjusting for differences between hospital category and important confounders, the risk of SSI at small hospitals was still 1.5 times higher than medium hospitals (adjusted prevalence rate ratio [PRR] 1.49, 95% CI 1.39-1.60), whereas the risk at large hospitals was substantially decreased compared with medium hospitals (adjusted PRR 1.29, 95% CI 1.22-1.36).</p><p>The risk of SSI for individual procedures varies widely. The highest rates occur after abdominal surgery, particularly colon surgery, for which the SSI rate is about 10 percent [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Other representative rates for various types of surgery are coronary bypass surgery (3.3 to 3.7 percent), vascular surgery (0.16 to 29 percent) [<a href="#rid22">22</a>], cesarean delivery (3.4 to 30 percent) [<a href="#rid23">23</a>], joint arthroplasty with a prosthesis (0.7 to 1.7 percent), and spinal fusion (1.3 to 3.1 percent). Eye surgery is associated with an extremely low rate of SSI (0.14 percent). </p><p>SSIs following surgeries that use implanted materials such as joint replacement, hernia repairs with mesh, and some cardiac surgeries are much less common but are associated with profound consequences. Although the use of implanted materials has revolutionized surgical practice, this technological advancement has come at a cost. Of the more than 2 million health care–associated infections diagnosed annually, as many as 50 percent are associated with an implant [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. The evaluation and treatment of the implant-associated infection presents its own set of unique challenges. (See <a class="local">'Deep infection associated with implanted materials'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H627671775"><span class="h2">Risk assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Whether an SSI occurs depends upon a complex interaction between numerous factors, including the nature and number of organisms contaminating the surgical site, antimicrobial prophylaxis, the health of the patient, and the technique of the surgeon  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef62246" href="/d/graphic/62246.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Measures to prevent SSI are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4044.html" rel="external">"Overview of control measures for prevention of surgical site infection in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Many of the patient factors identified as risk factors for impaired wound healing (eg, cigarette smoking, older age, vascular disease, obesity, malnutrition, diabetes, immunosuppressive therapy) are also risk factors for SSI [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>]. The presence of recent or remote infection at the surgical site, recent surgery, and hospitalization are also important. These risk factors are reviewed in more detail separately [<a href="#rid27">27-30</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/112216.html" rel="external">"Risk factors for impaired wound healing and wound complications"</a>.)</p><p>Other factors that may increase the risk for SSI include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Transfusion – Allogeneic blood transfusion modulates the immune system; however, studies evaluating the association between transfusion and SSI may be confounded by other factors such as duration of surgery, preoperative anemia, and medical comorbidities [<a href="#rid31">31,32</a>]. In addition, many studies investigating this relationship were performed in an era of less restrictive indications for transfusion. Thus, transfusion of blood products should not be withheld from surgical patients when indicated solely as a means to prevent SSI [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Local wound factors – Local wound factors such as edema, proximity to other open or contaminated wound sites, and presence of remote infections may also influence the development of SSI [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4044.html" rel="external">"Overview of control measures for prevention of surgical site infection in adults", section on 'Timing of surgery'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2625488537"><span class="h2">Surgical wound classification</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The degree of contamination of a surgical wound at the time of the operation is an important risk factor for infection and can be classified using the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) wound class as clean, clean-contaminated, contaminated, or dirty/infected  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51272" href="/d/graphic/51272.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid34">34</a>], which is based upon an adaptation of the American College of Surgeons surgical wound classification [<a href="#rid34">34-36</a>]. Surgical site infection (SSI) occurs in approximately 4 percent of clean wounds and 35 percent of grossly contaminated wounds. </p><p>Procedure-specific risk factors identified in a logistic regression model using data from the NHSN generally outperform the traditional NHSN risk index based on wound classification [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. The NHSN has made its risk adjustment models and methods available for participating hospitals via its web tool calculations of the Standardized Infection Ratio. Several of the procedure-specific risk adjustment models offer only raw or minimally adjusted risk calculations due to the lack of statistically significant predictor variables in the existing NHSN database. Other risk adjustment models have been published by the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) [<a href="#rid38">38</a>] and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3537450500"><span class="h2">Measures to reduce risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surgeons can reduce rates of SSI using preventive measures that include avoiding elective surgery in patients with active infection, timely administration of prophylactic antibiotics, proper skin preparation, and maintenance of sterile conditions [<a href="#rid2">2,40</a>]. These are discussed elsewhere; surgical techniques that may be helpful to reduce the risk for SSI are briefly reviewed below. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4044.html" rel="external">"Overview of control measures for prevention of surgical site infection in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Good surgical technique can also help reduce the risk of SSI. Such practices include gentle traction, effective hemostasis, removal of devitalized tissues, obliteration of dead space, irrigation of tissues with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> to avoid excessive drying, wound closure without tension, and minimizing duration of closed-suction drainage [<a href="#rid26">26,41</a>]. The judicious use of electrosurgery can help reduce thermal damage to tissue. Excessive use can cause areas of tissue necrosis that can serve as a nidus for infection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2890.html" rel="external">"Overview of electrosurgery", section on 'Basic principles'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4.html" rel="external">"Principles of abdominal wall closure"</a>.) </p><p>Various topical and local antibiotic delivery methods have been used to reduce the incidence of SSI, including antibiotic irrigation, topical antimicrobial agents, antibiotic sutures, and antimicrobial dressings. There is some low-quality evidence for some of these therapies for specific surgical populations and procedures [<a href="#rid42">42-50</a>]. Despite a wide array of delivery systems to deliver antibiotics near implants, few have found their way into routine clinical practice. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4044.html" rel="external">"Overview of control measures for prevention of surgical site infection in adults", section on 'Topical and local antibiotic delivery'</a>.)</p><p>A wide variety of surgical drains have also been used to prevent SSI, including closed suction drains within an anatomic space (eg, peritoneal cavity, joint space). In addition, open or closed system surgical drains have been used in the subcutaneous space to prevent SSI. While an exhaustive review of the literature specific to the various surgical subtypes is beyond the scope of this review, in general, there are insufficient data to support the routine use of drains for the prevention of SSI [<a href="#rid51">51,52</a>]. Furthermore, with the advent of Enhanced Recovery after Surgery protocols, the routine use of surgical drains has been discouraged given the negative impact of surgical drains/tubes on early mobilization after surgery [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. </p><p>Prophylactic negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT; ie, overlying a closed incision) has been described with the aim of preventing SSI [<a href="#rid54">54,55</a>]. While data are promising for certain high-risk surgeries and contaminated wounds, the evidence does not uniformly support its use. Outcomes likely vary due to the degree of contamination and features related to the incision site [<a href="#rid56">56,57</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4.html" rel="external">"Principles of abdominal wall closure", section on 'Negative pressure dressings'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2881.html" rel="external">"Negative pressure wound therapy", section on 'Prophylactic use'</a>.)</p><p>Leaving the wound open at the primary operation for delayed primary closure is another strategy used to reduce the risk for SSI [<a href="#rid58">58</a>]. Although observational studies have supported this practice, a meta-analysis of randomized trials did not demonstrate a benefit to delayed primary closure [<a href="#rid59">59</a>]; even class III and IV contaminated wounds may be safe for primary closure [<a href="#rid60">60</a>]. Anticipatory management of wounds at high risk for postoperative seroma and SSI is possible with loosely stapled skin closure and daily probing between the staples with a cotton-tipped applicator until the wound is impenetrable [<a href="#rid61">61</a>]. Alternatively, a negative pressure wound dressing applied directly to the approximated wound can evacuate accumulated wound drainage and minimize seroma formation and is also thought to increase blood flow to the wound edges to promote healing. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2881.html" rel="external">"Negative pressure wound therapy", section on 'Mechanism of action'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4.html" rel="external">"Principles of abdominal wall closure", section on 'Negative pressure dressings'</a>.)</p><p>There is no evidence to suggest that use of any particular wound dressing over a closed surgical wound has any effect on the rate of SSI [<a href="#rid62">62</a>]; however, wound protectors, which are designed to protect the wound edges from trauma and contamination, may be warranted for prevention of SSI in the setting of clean-contaminated, contaminated, and dirty abdominal procedures [<a href="#rid63">63,64</a>]. Wound protectors are available for laparotomy and laparoscopic incisions and orthopedic incisions [<a href="#rid65">65-69</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4044.html" rel="external">"Overview of control measures for prevention of surgical site infection in adults", section on 'Intraoperative wound protectors'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3186697522"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When SSI is suspected, the wound should be examined directly to facilitate visual and tactile inspection  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116392" href="/d/graphic/116392.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Depending upon severity of symptoms, the risk of other potential complications due to the nature of the index operation, and timing of development of symptoms, the patient may be evaluated while still hospitalized or requested to return to the clinic or emergency room if they have been discharged.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3089644777"><span class="h2">Superficial surgical site infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Evaluation of the skin surrounding the wound includes documentation of the presence and extent of erythema and induration (edema). Symptoms of superficial SSI may include localized swelling, warmth, drainage with or without odor, wound breakdown and separation (ie, dehiscence), peri-incisional erythema, and pain at the incision site. Palpation of the wound area may demonstrate induration or tenderness. Some patients will have systemic evidence of their infection (eg, fever, leukocytosis). </p><p>Purulent wound drainage or separation of the wound edges are usually indicative of an infection, and a diagnosis of superficial SSI can usually be made without forced opening of the wound or supplemental imaging. However, superficial incisional dehiscence can occur in the absence of infection. As an example, if staples are removed too soon from a surgical incision in a patient with obesity or immunocompromised state, wound healing may not have progressed sufficiently to keep the edges of the wound together. The presence of purulence and/or surrounding erythema will typically distinguish an infected from uninfected dehiscence. In the absence of purulence or erythema, culturing the deep tissue may be helpful; however, care must be taken to avoid contaminating the culture with skin flora. If the wound is already open, or if underlying fluid or tissue necrosis is suspected, full evaluation of the wound includes examining the greatest depth of involvement and may require opening the skin overlying the area in question, which may need to be performed in an operating room setting.</p><p>The aggressiveness with which to further evaluate whether SSI extends to deeper tissues depends on the type of surgery and whether implanted material was used. (See <a class="local">'Deep incisional surgical site infection'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H246925093"><span class="h2">Deep incisional surgical site infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Involvement of the fascia and/or muscle with infection is the hallmark of a deep incisional SSI. As with superficial SSI, symptoms of a deep SSI may include localized swelling, warmth, drainage with or without odor, wound breakdown and separation (ie, dehiscence), peri-incisional erythema, and pain at the incision site. Palpation of the wound area may demonstrate tenderness or a fluctuant mass. Deep SSIs are more often accompanied by fever and local tenderness. Systemic signs of infection may include fever, leukocytosis, or elevation of other markers of acute inflammation, such as C-reactive protein or procalcitonin.</p><p>A high degree of suspicion is warranted, as it can be difficult to diagnose a deep SSI clinically, particularly in a patient with obesity. Imaging (eg, ultrasound, computed tomography) is helpful to estimate the depth and extent of infection to guide appropriate source control. Confirmation of fascial or muscular involvement requires opening of the wound, which facilitates optimal debridement. (See <a class="local">'Wound exploration and debridement'</a> below and <a class="local">'Imaging'</a> below.)</p><p>Exploration and inspection of the wound with suspected deep SSI is often performed in the operating room to facilitate inspection and the debridement. When examining an infected wound for deep SSI, it is important to open it wide enough to evaluate the underlying tissue. This is of particular importance for certain types of incisions (eg, spine, sternotomy), or when implanted material was used during the surgery (eg, hernia mesh, breast implant, vascular graft, orthopedic implant). (See <a class="local">'Deep infection associated with implanted materials'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H319006246"><span class="h2">Organ/space surgical site infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with organ/space infection typically present with malaise, fever, and pain/tenderness in the body region where their operation was performed, often without overlying skin changes. Organ/space SSI can also occur as a complication of progressive deep incisional SSI.

Necrotizing infections often manifest rapidly after surgery (as early as 24 hours for group A <em>Streptococcus </em>and clostridia) and often present with sepsis. Peri-incisional pain is often severe and out of proportion to the expected degree of postoperative pain. Depending upon the causative organism and the depth of involvement, it may be characterized by skin discoloration, blistering and devitalization; a copious, dishwater-like drainage; dusky and friable subcutaneous tissue; and/or pale, devitalized fascia. Patients may display extremes of leukopenia or leukocytosis and other laboratory abnormalities, such as hyponatremia or evidence of end-organ failure. The extent of infection may not be apparent on visual inspection, as well-perfused overlying skin often belies the underlying necrosis; infection may spread through any tissue, including myositis and fasciitis. Obtaining imaging studies should not delay operative wound exploration and definitive debridement due to the risk of rapid dissemination of infection.

However, in the setting of deep or organ space SSIs, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging provide a more detailed evaluation of the underlying soft tissue and organ space. In the setting of prior gastrointestinal resection with the possibility of an underlying anastomotic leak or intra-abdominal infection, oral contrast aids in diagnosis. The presence of extraluminal contrast and/or air on imaging is concerning for an underlying perforation requiring surgical intervention.

It is best to obtain swab cultures directly from the specific site of infection in the open wound. Sampling the surrounding skin often reveals polymicrobial growth, making it difficult to distinguish colonization from true infection. During surgical debridement, a sample of synthetic material (eg, surgical mesh, implant) or necrotic material may also be sent for culture. Treatment of SSI can be initiated based on Gram stain results, which provide the earliest information to guide empiric therapy. However, specific therapy is based on subsequent culture results. Culture of purulent drainage obtained from an indwelling or radiographically placed drain can be also used to tailor antibiotic therapy. </p><p>Negative cultures in an obviously infected wound can be a sign of an underlying atypical infection (eg, acid-fast bacillus [AFB]) or fungal infection. In the setting of immunosuppressive therapies (eg, chemotherapy, post-transplant antirejection therapies), consideration should be given to obtaining AFB and fungal cultures.</p><p>If systemic signs of infection are present, concomitant blood cultures should be obtained.

Eliciting a thorough history of prior skin reactions as well as review of operative notes for documented areas of prior skin redness near the surgical site may be helpful in determining the etiology of erythema.</p><p>A "stitch abscess" is a typically small sinus tract that develops at the site of a subcuticular or deep tissue knot. In the absence of purulence, these should not be considered infections and typically do not warrant treatment beyond local wound care. Braided polyester and silk sutures are more likely to cause a reaction compared with other suture materials. Removing the suture and future avoidance of the material causing the reaction is recommended, if possible. </p><p>Hematoma or seroma may be difficult to distinguish from infection. With a significant hematoma that develops suddenly or acute drainage of blood through an incision, there may be a concomitant drop in the hemoglobin, which is not likely to be seen with SSI. In the case of a seroma, palpation of the wound typically yields a soft fluid wave with absence of significant pain; erythema may or may not be present. Ultrasound or computed tomography may facilitate identification of hematoma/seroma and can be helpful in distinguishing blood from serous fluid or purulent fluid. </p><p>Long-term resorption of hematoma/seroma is possible with conservative management. Because percutaneous aspiration is commonly associated with recurrent seroma, asymptomatic postoperative seromas should be observed initially. Clinicians should resist the temptation to aspirate a hematoma/seroma because an uninfected hematoma/seroma can easily become contaminated through percutaneous manipulation. If a seroma persists, it should only be aspirated under sterile conditions. Recurrent seromas following aspiration should be treated with surgical drainage and excision of the seroma lining, if possible [<a href="#rid70">70</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1478409120"><span class="h1">GENERAL MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2569137306"><span class="h2">Wound exploration and debridement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment of suspected/confirmed superficial/deep incisional SSI involves opening the wound; drainage of infected fluid, which should be cultured; and debridement of necrotic and devitalized tissue, which are imperative for adequate treatment. In the setting of an undrained fluid collection in communication with an abdominal fascial closure, or in cases when the risk of SSI is high, opening the wound is favored over percutaneous drainage. Antibiotics are required in the setting of surrounding skin erythema, evidence of deeper soft tissue infection, or in the presence of systemic signs and symptoms of infection. (See <a class="local">'Antimicrobial therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Deep tissue should also be sent for culture and sensitivities to guide specific antimicrobial therapy. In the presence of underlying bone, metal hardware, mesh, or other implanted material, there may be concern about opening the surgical wound. This issue is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Deep infection associated with implanted materials'</a> below.)</p><p>Most superficial wound exploration can be performed in the clinic, emergency room, or bedside, with attention to reducing patient discomfort and using meticulously clean technique to prevent superinfection of the wound. In addition to removing surgical skin staples, sutures, or glue, it may be necessary to forcibly separate the wound edges to sufficiently evacuate any accumulated fluid or pus and to fully evaluate the integrity of the underlying fascial closure, if present. Sufficient wound opening also facilitates serial dressing changes. After opening of the wound, a saline-filled syringe can be used to irrigate the wound to remove loose devitalized tissue, exudate, and clots. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">Saline</a> is isotonic and does not interfere with healing; however, tap water has also been used for wound care in the home or ambulatory setting with good results [<a href="#rid71">71</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15912.html" rel="external">"Basic principles of wound management", section on 'Irrigation'</a>.) </p><p>Mechanical debridement is performed with forceps and scalpel or scissors. Ideally, all foreign bodies are excised as well because they can delay healing and promote infection. However, for SSI of laparotomy wounds, any benefit of removal of exposed fascial sutures is typically outweighed by the risk of evisceration. Enzymatic agents are an option when manual debridement is not possible [<a href="#rid72">72</a>]. Serial debridement is continued until no necrotic tissue remains and granulation tissue is present. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15912.html" rel="external">"Basic principles of wound management", section on 'Wound debridement'</a>.)</p><p>Deep SSI (involving tissue below the subcutaneous fat) in abdominal wounds is a major risk factor for fascial dehiscence and may require emergency exploration of the wound in the operating room to safely debride deeper tissue given the risk of evisceration, and to facilitate abdominal exploration if sub-fascial infection is present. In the case when fascial debridement is necessary, it may be necessary to augment fascial closure with biologic or absorbable synthetic mesh to contain the viscera. If the deepest level of infection extends into the abdominal cavity (organ/space SSI), particularly if dense intra-loop adhesions are present, abdominal exploration combined with percutaneous drainage of abscesses inaccessible during laparotomy may be necessary to obtain source control prior to definitive fascial closure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1.html" rel="external">"Complications of abdominal surgical incisions", section on 'Fascial dehiscence'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15145.html" rel="external">"Management of the open abdomen in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Organ/space SSI is somewhat different from superficial or deep SSI, and morbidity and mortality from this class of SSI tend to be higher. Computed tomography or ultrasound are used to guide placement of closed suction percutaneous drains into abscess collections, when possible. For abdominal organ/space SSI, it can be challenging in some cases to differentiate an abscess from anastomotic leak. The National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) definitions include anastomotic leak as an organ/space SSI, but not all post-enterectomy or colectomy abscesses are due to anastomotic leak. However, if the abscess is associated with a recently performed bowel anastomosis, anastomotic leak should be strongly suspected. On imaging studies, extraluminal air or contrast within the abscess cavity are indicative of an anastomotic leak or underlying perforation. The distinction is critical, as achieving source control may require additional percutaneous drains, reducing afferent gastrointestinal flow through complete bowel rest and/or proximal stoma diversion, and/or intra-abdominal re-exploration and washout.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1923213528"><span class="h2">Antimicrobial therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The need for antimicrobial therapy is determined by the extent of the infection, presence of systemic manifestations, and patient comorbidities (eg, chronic glucocorticoids, diabetes).

Empiric gram-negative therapy is often not necessary (eg, Gram stain shows only gram-positive organisms in clusters). But, if the wound was known to be grossly contaminated in the case of traumatic injury or gastrointestinal tract perforation, adequate coverage includes antibiotics directed against gram-negative coliforms and anaerobic organisms, as well as typical gram-positive skin organisms.</p><p>Definitive antimicrobial treatment is guided by the clinical response of the patient and, when available, results of wound culture and sensitivities. </p><p>In the absence of retained foreign material, antibiotics should be stopped with resolution of cellulitis and/or normalization of physiologic parameters such as leukocytosis.

When the gauze is removed (preferably before it dries out), necrotic tissue is removed with it, which provides a form of debridement. However, once debridement is no longer necessary, the packing material should be changed from gauze to one that is less traumatic to the developing granulation tissue and new epithelial cells. Dressing changes may initially be required up to three times daily and are continued until the wound surface is mostly covered by granulation tissue. Dressings can then be changed once a day or every other day to avoid disturbing the healing process.

NPWT also helps protect the patient's skin from frequent dressing changes. NPWT is associated with the need for fewer dressing changes since it is only changed once every three to five days and as such may facilitate earlier progression from hospital care to outpatient management for larger wounds.

SSIs are described as incisional SSIs (superficial, deep) and organ/space SSIs  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80661" href="/d/graphic/80661.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116392" href="/d/graphic/116392.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).

Leaving the wound open at the primary operation for delayed primary closure is a strategy that is often used but is unproven to reduce the risk for SSI. Alternatively, negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) dressings applied directly to a closed surgical wound (ie, prophylactic NPWT) and use of wound protectors have reduced the incidence of SSI for some types of surgical incisions.
