         This chapter will cover assessment and management of simple and complex auricle (ear) lacerations. Once serious head or middle ear injury is excluded, careful closure of ear lacerations after copious but gentle irrigation and minimal debridement should ensure coverage of any exposed cartilage to preserve cosmetic appearance.

        <p>
         Minor wound management, methods of suture placement, repair of adjacent anatomic sites, and evaluation of middle ear trauma are discussed in detail separately:

         The external ear is composed of the auricle, or pinna, and the external auditory canal. Because of the protuberant nature of the ear, most traumatic lacerations involve the auricle; a laceration may, however, extend into the external auditory canal. The cartilaginous subunits of the auricle include: the helix, antihelix, concha, tragus, and antitragus  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57847" href="/z/d/graphic/57847.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). These structures are composed of elastic cartilage that is continuous with the cartilaginous external auditory canal and is avascular. The cartilage receives its nutrients from the adherent perichondrium. The skin of the auricle is very thin and is densely attached to this underlying perichondrium. The earlobe is composed of fibrous adipose tissue and lacks cartilage. The function of the auricle is to amplify and direct sound to the external auditory canal, and ultimately to the tympanic membrane [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Cartilage exposure after auricular laceration can cause infection, erosive chondritis, and necrosis [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Loss of auricular cartilage (notching) or replacement of healthy cartilage with fibrocartilage ("cauliflower ear") is disfiguring and not easily reversed. Thus, ensuring tissue coverage of exposed cartilage is of paramount importance during auricular laceration repair.
        </p>
        <p>
         In cases of auricular avulsion, knowledge of the blood supply is essential. The anterior blood supply comes from the superficial temporal artery (STA), while the posterior auricle is fed by the posterior auricular artery (PAA)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68609" href="/z/d/graphic/68609.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). There is a supplemental vascular supply from branches of the occipital artery [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The STA and PAA communicate via the helical arcade that runs along the helix; this arcade is the basis for single pedicle reimplantation of a total avulsion of the auricle [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The auricle is innervated by the auriculotemporal nerve superiorly and medially, the greater auricular nerve and lesser occipital nerve laterally and inferiorly, and the vagus nerve (concha and external auditory meatus).

         In most instances, ear lacerations result from isolated trauma. However, as for all trauma patients, the initial clinical assessment should focus on rapid identification of potentially fatal conditions. For victims of major trauma, evaluation for airway compromise (while maintaining cervical spine immobilization), impaired breathing, hemorrhagic shock, and altered level of consciousness should be performed immediately upon the patient’s arrival at the emergency department. Systematic evaluation helps ensure detection of potentially life-threatening injuries.

         Infiltration of local anesthetics facilitates a comprehensive evaluation of the wound with minimal discomfort to the patient. In young children and other uncooperative patients, sedation may be necessary to perform optimal wound assessment and repair. (See

         Primary closure (ie, wound repair at the time of presentation) is the preferred treatment for auricular lacerations, especially if the ear cartilage is exposed or the wound extends through the ear. Failure to cover exposed cartilage increases the risk of infection, erosive chondritis, and/or necrosis which may lead to cartilage loss or significant cosmetic disfigurement ("cauliflower ear"). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Complications'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Delayed primary closure (ie, cleansing and debridement at the time of initial presentation with definitive wound closure performed electively four to five days later) may be appropriate for wounds of the earlobe that present after 24 hours and have increased risk for infection. In general, the decision should be based upon the time from injury, patient factors that increase the risk of infection (eg, vascular insufficiency, diabetes mellitus), and wound factors (bite wound, other contamination, or foreign body potential). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6328.html" rel="external">

         Wounds with obvious signs of inflammation (redness, warmth, swelling, pus drainage) should not be closed primarily. Auricular laceration closure should also

         delay further evaluation and definitive care of more urgent traumatic injuries, including underlying middle ear or intracranial injuries.
        </p>
        <p>
         When closure is delayed, saline-soaked gauze packing (wet-dry dressing) can be provided to enhance secondary healing. Although not required based upon evidence, when prescribing antibiotics, coverage (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8676" href="/z/d/drug information/8676.html" rel="external">

         General consent forms for treatment are commonly part of the registration process for all patients arriving into the emergency department (ED) and a separate written consent for wound repair in the emergency department is not usually obtained [

         ]. However, the patient and/or caregiver must be aware of the general risks of laceration repair which include infection, pain and scarring. With respect to scarring, the potential for poor cosmetic outcome after auricular laceration repair and need for further surgery should be explained to patient.

         Auricular lacerations can be described as simple, complex, or avulsion injuries [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. The type of injury largely determines the surgical approach. The clinician should also be alert for signs of an auricular hematoma, which must be drained to prevent pressure necrosis of the ear cartilage. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Auricular hematoma'

        </p>

         Simple lacerations that spare cartilage most commonly involve the earlobe but may also involve other parts of the auricle. These wounds can be closed with simple interrupted sutures using 6.0 nonabsorbable sutures  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63622" href="/z/d/graphic/63622.html" rel="external">
          table 6
         </a>
         ) or, in young children and patients without assured follow-up, 6.0 absorbable suture, such as fast-absorbing gut. When nonabsorbable suture is used, some experts prefer monofilament polybutester (Novafil) because of its greater elasticity and decreased potential for suture marks. (See

         Split earlobes are most commonly caused by pulling through of earrings or allergy to earring metal alloys. Acute wounds require subcutaneous placement of 4.0 or 5.0 absorbable suture (eg, poliglecaprone 25 [Monocryl] or polyglycolic acid [Dexon]  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51741" href="/z/d/graphic/51741.html" rel="external">
          table 7
         </a>
         )) and skin closure of the front and the back of the earlobe with 6.0 nonabsorbable sutures (eg, polybutester [Novafil]) or, in young children and patients without assured follow-up, 6.0 absorbable sutures (fast-absorbing gut). Careful approximation is important.
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinicians with less experience managing these injuries may wish to refer them to an appropriate surgical specialist, when available, because primary closure of these earlobe lacerations can be complicated by notching and recurrence of the cleft. Thus, multiple cosmetic techniques based upon the classic Z-plasty have been developed [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. Some surgeons will close the laceration around an angiocatheter or other stenting device to preserve a piercing for future earring use; a less complicated approach closes the entire laceration and allows for re-piercing as early as six weeks following repair [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         When the split earlobe is chronic and epithelialized, the wound management is complicated by the need to excise skin margins of the cleft and to provide repair that avoids loss of earlobe tissue strength and prevents recurrence [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Various techniques, including straight repair, Z-plasty, flap method, or concha cartilage graft have been proposed and are best performed by an appropriate surgical specialist [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,12

         ].

         Auricular lacerations that expose or extend through the cartilage require careful closure. The perichondrium must be reapproximated and the cartilage covered with skin in order to prevent notching or a step-deformity [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,13
         </a>
         ]. Because the overlying skin is so thin and is so densely adherent to the underlying perichondrium, stitches that incorporate both layers are appropriate; burying perichondrial sutures under such thin auricular skin is technically challenging and can produce unwanted subcutaneous nodularity. Furthermore, any absorbable suture utilized, particularly for buried sutures, should be undyed in order to avoid tattooing. Generally speaking, suture should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be passed through the cartilage itself. The perichondrial sutures should be the deepest layer of closure.
        </p>
        <p>
         As with simple ear lacerations, nonabsorbable monofilament 6.0 suture (eg, polybutester [Novafil])  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63622" href="/z/d/graphic/63622.html" rel="external">

         ) should be used and is appropriate if the patient can follow-up for removal in 7 to 10 days. In young children and those patients with uncertain follow-up, 6.0 fast-absorbing gut may be used.

         Most ear wounds do
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         warrant empiric antibiotic treatment. Prophylactic antibiotics may decrease the risk of wound infection in patients with animal or human bites, excessive wound contamination, vascular insufficiency (eg, peripheral artery disease), degloved/exposed cartilage, or immunodeficiency. The evidence for the use of prophylactic antibiotics after the closure of skin wounds other than bite wounds is discussed separately. (See

        <p>
         For a laceration that involves cartilage, we do not routinely use prophylactic antibiotics [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. There is insufficient evidence on the use of antibiotics to prevent chondritis. Some experts use antibiotics (eg,

         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Other experts use prophylactic antibiotics only in the setting of grossly contaminated, degloved, or exposed cartilage or when cartilage itself needs to be repaired [
         <a href="#rid17">

         Although most commonly occurring after blunt trauma during sports (eg, amateur wrestling, rugby, boxing), auricular hematomas may occur after wound closure. This complication warrants prompt drainage and application of a pressure dressing to prevent reaccumulation of blood. Fibrocartilage overgrowth, or "cauliflower ear" can occur if drainage is incomplete or if the hematoma recurs.

          Anatomy
         </strong>
         – The external ear is composed of the auricle, or pinna, and the external auditory canal. Because of the protuberant nature of the ear, most traumatic lacerations involve the auricle. The cartilaginous subunits of the auricle include: the helix, antihelix, concha, tragus, and antitragus  (

         <strong>
          Evaluation
         </strong>
         – Patients with auricular (ear) lacerations require careful evaluation to determine the location and depth of the injury, degree of cartilage involvement, extension of the laceration into the auditory canal, and the presence of tissue avulsion. In addition, patients with major trauma should be assessed for signs of associated middle ear injury and basilar skull fracture. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Specialty consultation
         </strong>
         – Patients with auricular avulsions, external ear lacerations that extend into the external auditory canal, chronically split earlobes or clefts, or have associated middle ear trauma or basilar skull fractures warrant consultation with an appropriate surgical subspecialist. Through and through lacerations of the auricle may also be an indication for subspecialty consultation, depending upon the capability of the clinician. (See

          Indications for closure
         </strong>
         – Primary closure (ie, wound repair at the time of presentation) is the preferred treatment for auricular lacerations, especially if the ear cartilage is exposed or the wound extends through the ear. Failure to cover exposed cartilage increases the risk of infection, erosive chondritis, and/or necrosis with resulting cartilage loss or significant cosmetic disfigurement ("cauliflower ear"). (See
         <a class="local">

          Contraindications for closure
         </strong>
         – Wounds with obvious signs of inflammation (redness, warmth, swelling, pus drainage) should not be closed primarily. Auricular laceration closure should also
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>

          saline
         </a>
         . During irrigation, the clinician should avoid excessive irrigation pressure that might strip the perichondrium from the cartilage. Debridement of skin should be avoided or kept to a minimum to ensure that any exposed cartilage can be covered. Cartilage should

         – The suggested equipment and techniques for closure of auricular lacerations according to wound type are provided above. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Equipment'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">
          'Techniques'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Additional management
         </strong>
         – All patients should receive tetanus prophylaxis, as needed. Most ear wounds do
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         warrant empiric antibiotic treatment. However, prophylactic antibiotics may decrease the risk of wound infection or chondritis in patients with animal or human bites, excessive wound contamination, vascular insufficiency (eg, peripheral artery disease), degloved/exposed cartilage, cartilage that requires repair, or immunodeficiency. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Other considerations'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>

         </span>
         <strong>
          Aftercare
         </strong>
         – Repaired auricular lacerations warrant close follow-up in 24 hours to assess for signs of infection or auricular hematoma. Nonabsorbable sutures should be removed 7 to 10 days after repair. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Aftercare'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Complications
         </strong>
         – Auricular hematomas, perichondritis, and chondritis are potential complications of auricular lacerations that warrant prompt recognition and treatment during follow-up. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Auricular hematoma'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">
          'Perichondritis or chondritis'
