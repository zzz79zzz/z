         Nonnarcotic analgesic agents have been associated with progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) since the early 1950s [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Analgesic nephropathy is a well-described cause of CKD characterized by renal papillary necrosis and chronic interstitial nephritis. It results from prolonged and excessive consumption of analgesic mixtures containing potentially addictive substances in addition to analgesics [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Analgesic nephropathy has well-defined histologic and radiographic features and used to be an important cause of CKD [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5
         </a>
         ]. However, the incidence markedly declined after the withdrawal of phenacetin from the market and with legislation that made combined analgesics available only by prescription.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to phenacetin-containing and non-phenacetin-containing mixtures, individual analgesic agents may also cause kidney damage.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic reviews the epidemiology of, risk factors for, and pathogenesis of analgesic nephropathy associated with phenacetin-containing and non-phenacetin-containing mixtures, as well as CKD associated with single analgesic agents. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of analgesic nephropathy and acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAIDs) are presented separately. (See

         Analgesic nephropathy is associated with prolonged and excessive consumption of analgesic mixtures [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-7
         </a>
         ]. The analgesic mixtures generally contained centrally acting and potentially addictive agents, such as

         , which led to excessive and habitual use of the analgesic drugs  (

          figure 1

         Analgesic nephropathy is characterized by chronic interstitial nephritis and renal papillary necrosis and calcification [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,8
         </a>
         ]. It is caused by prolonged ingestion of analgesics, such as

          aspirin
         </a>
         or antipyrine in combination with either phenacetin, paracetamol, or salicylamide.

         <a href="#rid3">
          3-7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The kidney damage induced by analgesics is most prominent in the medulla. The earliest changes consist of prominent thickening of the vasa recta capillaries (capillary sclerosis) and patchy areas of tubular necrosis; similar vascular lesions can be found in the renal pelvis and ureter, suggesting that the primary effect is damage to the vascular endothelial cells [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Later changes include areas of papillary necrosis and calcification and secondary cortical injury with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and interstitial infiltration and fibrosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         The mechanisms responsible for the kidney injury are incompletely understood. Phenacetin is metabolized to
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">
          acetaminophen
         </a>
         and to reactive intermediates that can injure cells, in part by lipid peroxidation [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. These metabolites tend to accumulate in the medulla along the medullary osmotic gradient (created by the countercurrent system). As a result, the highest concentrations are seen at the papillary tip, the site of the initial vascular lesions [
         <a href="#rid11">

          Acetaminophen
         </a>
         undergoes oxidative metabolism by prostaglandin H synthase to reactive quinoneimine that is conjugated to glutathione. If acetaminophen is present alone, there is sufficient glutathione generated in the papillae to detoxify the reactive intermediate. However, if acetaminophen is ingested with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">
          aspirin
         </a>
         , the aspirin is converted to salicylate, which becomes highly concentrated and depletes glutathione in both the cortex and papillae of the kidney. With the cellular glutathione depleted, the reactive metabolite of acetaminophen then produces lipid peroxides and arylation of tissue proteins, ultimately resulting in necrosis and calcification of the papillae  (

         and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) suppress prostaglandin production by inhibiting cyclooxygenase enzymes. Renal blood flow, particularly within the renal medulla, is highly dependent upon systemic and local production of vasodilatory prostaglandins. Thus, this region, in the setting of combined aspirin and NSAID use, is more prone to ischemic damage.

         Phenacetin-containing combination agents were almost certainly the most important cause of analgesic nephropathy. Analgesic nephropathy was common before phenacetin was removed from over-the-counter analgesics and before legislation was enacted making combined analgesics only available by prescription. Reports suggested that analgesic nephropathy was responsible for 1 to 3 percent of cases of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in the United States as a whole, up to 10 percent in areas of North Carolina, 13 to 20 percent in Australia and part of Europe, and up to 50 percent of dialysis patients in two provinces in Belgium [

         By the time phenacetin was withdrawn from the market, phenacetin-containing combination analgesics had been implicated as a likely cause of analgesic nephropathy:

         A prospective, 10-year study found that the incidence of a rise in the plasma creatinine concentration was 12 percent in those with heavy use of analgesic mixtures versus only 1.4 percent in nonusers [
         <a href="#rid12">

         A case-control study compared 554 adults with newly diagnosed CKD (plasma creatinine concentration &gt;1.5 mg/dL or 132 micromol/L) with 516 controls [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13

         <a href="#rid14">

         A 20-year prospective of 7275 females showed an increase in the risk of death from kidney disease among phenacetin users compared with nonusers [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15

         The nephrotoxicity of phenacetin is dose dependent [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,16
         </a>
         ]. Decreased concentrating ability or a mild reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is observed after cumulative phenacetin intake of as little as 1 kg. In comparison, clinically evident kidney disease requires a minimum intake of 2 to 3 kg each of phenacetin and
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">
          aspirin
         </a>
         . This requires six to eight years of a patient ingesting six to eight tablets (or approximately 1 gram) of phenacetin-containing compounds per day. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7175.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of analgesic nephropathy"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The decrease in availability of phenacetin-containing analgesic mixtures and other combined analgesics led to a reduction in the number of new cases of analgesic nephropathy [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4,6,17

         In Europe, analgesic nephropathy as a cause of ESKD virtually disappeared in Sweden and Denmark between 1980 and 1990, while the incidence in Switzerland fell from 28 to 12 percent [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,17
         </a>
         ]. The latter figure undoubtedly includes many patients who already had kidney disease before phenacetin was removed from over-the-counter analgesic preparations.

         In an autopsy study of 616 adults in Basle, Switzerland, the rate of analgesic nephropathy fell progressively from 3 percent in 1980 to 0.2 percent in 2000 [

         </a>
         ]. In addition, analgesic nephropathy still remains an important, preventable cause of kidney disease in resource-limited countries where combination pills containing phenacetin are still being manufactured and sold.

In the northern part of the country, where analgesic nephropathy was most prevalent, the incidence was 12 percent in 1993 and decreased toward 4.5 percent in 2008 (Belgian Society of Nephrology [NBVN] registry data). In 1999, phenacetin-containing analgesic mixtures were banned, and manufacturers substituted single analgesics for analgesic mixtures. In 2001, analgesic mixtures became available only by prescription.

         In 2000, in order to address the uncertainty regarding the contributive role of non-phenacetin-containing mixtures, a committee of scientists, selected by regulatory authorities of Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, and the pharmaceutical industry reviewed the available evidence [

         Individual analgesic agents (ie, noncombination agents) may cause CKD, although this issue remains controversial and the associated histologic and clinical features are not as well defined as for analgesic nephropathy associated with phenacetin-containing and non-phenacetin-containing agents.

         The role of phenacetin in analgesic nephropathy was suggested by studies that showed that the decrease in availability of phenacetin-containing analgesic mixtures and other combined analgesics over the past 10 to 15 years led to a reduction in the number of new cases of analgesic nephropathy [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4,6,17
         </a>
         ]. In Europe, analgesic nephropathy as a cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) virtually disappeared in Sweden and Denmark between 1980 and 1990, while the incidence in Switzerland fell from 28 to 12 percent [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,17
         </a>
         ]. The latter figure undoubtedly includes many patients who already had kidney disease before phenacetin was removed from over-the-counter analgesic preparations. In Australia, the decrease in incidence of analgesic nephropathy started in 1985, which was five years after over-the-counter sales of analgesic mixtures were banned [

        <p>
         The nephrotoxicity of phenacetin alone has not been assessed in humans, since the drug has never been available as a single (ie, noncombination) agent. Animal studies have demonstrated that phenacetin alone is the least nephrotoxic of many analgesic agents, suggesting that phenacetin is only nephrotoxic when administered in combination with other agents [

         Exposure to large quantities of NSAIDs can probably induce CKD in some cases, although the percentage of patients affected is small relative to the number of prescriptions written [

         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Another large case-control study suggested that daily NSAID use for over one year may be associated with an increased risk of an otherwise unexplained and newly diagnosed plasma creatinine concentration &gt;1.5 mg/dL (132 micromol/L) [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. However, the significance of these findings was undermined by two observations: There was no obvious dose dependence, and the decline in kidney function was essentially confined to males &gt;64 years of age; there was no decline in kidney function in the three other groups in this study [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         None of these studies determined what type of kidney disease might be present. A third report evaluated 259 patients over a 10-year period, among whom 69 patients satisfied the clinical criteria for analgesic nephropathy (including the presence of papillary necrosis) [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ]. Twenty-nine had consumed only NSAIDs (primarily for rheumatologic disease), and varying degrees of kidney function impairment were noted in many of these patients.

         NSAIDs are common causes of drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7234.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis", section on 'Drugs'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients who develop NSAID-induced AIN are at risk for CKD from chronic interstitial nephritis. This was suggested by review of 1068 biopsy-proven cases of AIN from 1968 to 1997 [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. Causes, symptoms, and the clinical and histologic findings were compared between patients with permanent and reversible kidney function impairment after AIN.
        </p>
        <p>
         While NSAIDs accounted for only 20 percent of the cases of AIN, nearly two out of three patients from the NSAID subgroup were found to have permanent kidney function impairment at follow-up, representing the greatest frequency of any of the drug-induced interstitial nephritis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subacute symptoms, prolonged exposure, and analgesic or NSAID use were associated with chronicity. Biopsy findings including tubular atrophy, interstitial granuloma, and pronounced interstitial cell infiltration were predictive of chronicity.

         NSAID use may cause progression among patients who have preexisting kidney disease. A retrospective study of 10,184 older adult patients administered NSAIDs examined progression of kidney disease for a mean of 2.75 years [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ]. A rapid decrease in estimated GFR (eGFR; defined as a decrease &gt;15 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         ) was observed in 13.3 percent of patients. After adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, high cumulative NSAID use (&gt;90
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         percentile for all subjects) was associated with a 26 percent risk of a rapid decline in eGFR relative to those who did not use NSAIDs (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.04–1.53). In addition, each 100-unit increase in defined daily NSAID dose was associated with a decrease in eGFR of 0.08 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         . A clear linear relationship was noted between cumulative dose and eGFR reduction. The mechanism of NSAID-associated CKD is not known; however, it is possible that recurrent bouts of acute kidney injury (AKI) lead to CKD, or chronic NSAID ingestion may promote unrecognized AIN with associated fibrosis or chronic papillary necrosis [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7230.html" rel="external">
          "NSAIDs: Acute kidney injury"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important for clinicians to be aware of the association between NSAID use and the progression of CKD. Routine reporting of the eGFR may increase clinician awareness of CKD and decrease NSAID use. This was examined in a retrospective study of NSAID-prescribing patterns among 1522 patients with CKD stage 3, 4, and 5 before and after implementation of eGFR reporting to clinicians [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A 10.2 percent reduction in NSAID prescriptions followed eGFR reporting, suggesting that clinicians were aware of the nephrotoxic potential of NSAIDs in CKD patients. From the standpoint of kidney function, eGFR increased from 45.9 to 46.9, 23.9 to 27.1, and 12.4 to 26.4 mL/min/1.73 m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         in the CKD stage 3, 4, and 5 patients, respectively, after reporting of the eGFR. This study strongly suggests that eGFR should be considered when prescribing medications to CKD patients.

         Analgesic nephropathy is characterized by chronic interstitial nephritis and renal papillary necrosis and calcification. It is caused by prolonged and excessive consumption of analgesic combination medications. Individual analgesic agents may also cause chronic kidney disease (CKD), although the associated histologic and clinical features are less well defined than for analgesic nephropathy associated with phenacetin-containing and non-phenacetin-containing mixtures. (See

         Analgesic nephropathy used to be an important cause of CKD, particularly in Australia, parts of Europe (Belgium, Switzerland), and the United States. The decrease in availability of analgesic-combined medications with or without phenacetin has led to a marked reduction in the number of new cases. However, it still remains an important, preventable cause of kidney disease in resource-limited countries where combination pills are still being manufactured and sold. (See

         It is possible that long-term use of individual analgesic agents may also lead to a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). (See

         Although it is clear that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause acute kidney injury (AKI), the role of NSAIDs in the development of CKD is uncertain. The exposure to large quantities of NSAIDs can probably induce CKD, although the percentage of patients affected is small relative to the number of prescriptions written and even smaller relative to the number of NSAIDs that are bought over the counter. The effect of long-term use of selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors on kidney function is unknown. (See
