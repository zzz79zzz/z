         Pain is highly prevalent in the cancer population. Virtually all patients with malignant disease experience recurrent episodes of acute pain, which may accompany surgery, invasive procedures, or complications, such as a pathological fracture. In addition, chronic pain that is severe enough to warrant opioid therapy is experienced by 30 to 50 percent of patients undergoing active antineoplastic therapy and by 75 to 90 percent of those with advanced disease [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The causes of chronic pain are diverse in this population, and both prevalence and severity vary with the type of neoplasm, stage and extent of disease, prior treatment, comorbidities, and other factors. Tissue injury produced by the neoplasm is the primary etiology in about three-fourths of patients with chronic cancer pain, and the remainder have pain related to the late effects of antineoplastic therapy or to painful comorbidities. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2795.html" rel="external">
          "Assessment of cancer pain"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Opioid therapy is the first-line approach for moderate or severe chronic cancer pain. While opioids are effective analgesics, they are potentially abusable drugs. The public health consequences of opioid abuse drive the imperative that all clinicians assume responsibility for risk management when these drugs are prescribed for legitimate medical purposes. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2814.html" rel="external">
          "Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia"

         This topic review will cover the general principles of cancer pain management and provide an overview of risk assessment and management in patients treated with opioids. An overview of assessment of cancer pain, a review of specific cancer pain syndromes, the clinical use of opioid analgesics, non-opioid analgesics (including adjuvant analgesics) and nonpharmacologic methods of cancer pain management are covered elsewhere.

          THE PROBLEM OF UNDERTREATMENT

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Adequate pain relief can be achieved in more than 70 percent of patients when well-accepted opioid treatment guidelines for cancer pain are followed [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-8
         </a>
         ]. Given that most recommended therapies for cancer pain are within the scope of both specialty and primary care medical practice, the treatment of cancer pain should be viewed as a best practice for all medical disciplines involved in the care of this population.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unfortunately, the availability of effective therapy and updated guidelines from reliable leading societies has not eliminated the problem of undertreatment of cancer pain [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9-15
         </a>
         ]. A year 2014 systematic review concluded that while there was a decrease in undertreatment between 2008 and 2013 of approximately 25 percent (from 43 to 31 percent), approximately one-third of patients with cancer-related pain still do not receive pain medication proportional to their pain intensity [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. A systematic review of 66 studies published through 2020 confirmed a decline in undertreatment over time, but noted that the literature continues to demonstrate that about 40 percent of cancer patients receive analgesic treatment that is inconsistent with recommendations that are based on pain severity [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. At the individual level, the odds of undertreatment appear to be substantially higher for underrepresented populations [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The causes of undertreatment are multifactorial and reflect the combined effects of clinician-, patient-, and system-related barriers [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,17-21
         </a>
         ]:

         </span>
         Clinicians often have inadequate knowledge and skills, or attitudes that minimize the importance of pain management. They may be reluctant to prescribe drugs due to concern about side effects or a fear of hastening death through aggressive pain control.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Patients may underreport pain because of stoicism, a desire to be liked, or concerns about distracting the clinician from antineoplastic treatment. In addition, when opioid therapy is provided, therapeutic nonadherence is believed to be common, perhaps due to fear of addiction or the development of side effects.
        </p>

         System-wide impediments to optimal analgesic therapy may include financial concerns (eg, lack of health care insurance coverage, inability to purchase drugs), a limited number of specialists in pain management or palliative care, and an incentive structure in the health care system that does not encourage clinicians to manage pain as a priority.
        </p>
        <p>

         </span>
         In the United States, there are racial and ethnic disparities in the assessment and management of pain using opioids, which may reflect the problems of implicit bias or systemic racism impacting the availability of opioid therapy in diverse communities [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22-25
         </a>

         </span>
         Also specific to the United States several population-level studies suggest that regulations and guidelines that appeared after 2010 and were intended to reduce opioid prescribing in populations with non-cancer pain may have unintentionally led to a decline in appropriate opioid use for moderate to severe cancer pain [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26-30
         </a>
         ].

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Uncontrolled pain results in unnecessary suffering, decreased ability to cope with illness, interference with activities of daily living, and extended or repeat hospital admissions [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,31
         </a>
         ]. Uncontrolled pain may also delay or disrupt anticancer treatment, compromising its effectiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
         Given the profound impact of uncontrolled pain on all aspects of life, and the prevalence and complexity of undertreatment, clinicians must be attuned to the possibility that poorly controlled pain is being under-reported, and that it may be the result of poor access to care, under prescribing, and/or nonadherence. The risk should be assumed to be particularly high in vulnerable populations, including underrepresented groups, the poor or uninsured, patients with a history of chemical dependency or other serious psychiatric disease, and those living in low- and middle-income countries [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. Awareness of undertreatment and the willingness to confront its causes is a first step toward improving outcomes.

          PAIN MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF PALLIATIVE CARE
         </span>
         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Among individuals with active cancer, pain is best considered as a domain within the broader context of palliative care. Palliative care is an interdisciplinary therapeutic approach that focuses on the comprehensive management of the physical, psychological, social, and spiritual needs of patients with serious or life-threatening disease and their caregivers [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The overriding goal of palliative care is to reduce the suffering and illness burden of the patient and caregivers throughout the course of a progressive illness. Palliative care focuses on diminishing the burden of illness from the time of diagnosis to death. Effective palliative care considers the needs of both the patient and their caregivers, viewing the caregivers as the unit of care. It addresses the nature of grief before the death and into the bereavement period that follows.
        </p>
        <p>
         Generalist-level palliative care (primary palliative care) can and should be provided by all clinicians who are involved in the ongoing care of the patient with a serious life-threatening illness and their caregivers. Consultation with clinicians who are specifically trained in palliative care (specialist palliative care) may be appropriate whenever the complexity of problems warrants a referral and is typically sought when the end of life is perceived to be near. Specialty palliative care services are most available in high-income countries, including the United States. The availability of specialty palliative care in low income countries is quite limited. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14240.html" rel="external">
          "Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care"
         </a>
         and
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/86758.html" rel="external">
          "Palliative care and hospice outside of the United States"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Palliative medicine specialists work in interdisciplinary teams or develop networks that facilitate the involvement of other professionals when needed. Most hospitals in the United States now have some type of institution-based palliative care consultation program [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. Home-based specialist palliative care, available to patients living in their own homes or in skilled nursing facilities, is now mostly provided by hospice agencies in the United States. Hospice care is a benefit of Medicare and Medicaid, and is also supported by most commercial insurers. Patients are eligible for the government benefit if a clinician employed by the hospice agency certifies that it is more likely than not that the patient's prognosis is six months or less if the illness runs its expected course. Community-based palliative care that is distinct from hospice is gradually emerging but still has very limited availability. At present, hospice programs provide most cancer patients with specialist palliative care at the end of life [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83642.html" rel="external">
          "Palliative care delivery in the home"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         From the perspective of palliative care, pain assessment and management are major aspects of the care plan that focuses on many domains related to quality of life. Pain management should be integrated with other strategies that are being used to address other key goals, such as the relief of other symptoms (eg, dyspnea, fatigue), coordination of care across sites, appropriate advance care planning, and management of caregiver distress.
        </p>
        <p>
         Like pain management itself, the broader clinical concerns that constitute palliative care should be considered a best practice for all clinicians engaged in the treatment of patients with cancer. At a generalist level, this typically takes the form of multidimensional assessment and intervention in a variety of domains related to preserving function, improving adaptation, and maintaining quality of life. When the clinical issues are complex, particularly when pain is difficult to control or accompanied by other concerns, referral to a palliative care specialist is appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pain specialists may or may not have expertise in palliative care or a professional focus on cancer pain. Because pain specialists vary in background, training, interest and accessibility, the clinician seeking help for a patient with challenging pain should ensure that a pain specialist has experience and capability in cancer pain before making a referral.
        </p>
        <p>
         Regardless of the treatment team, assessment of the patient with cancer pain requires a clear understanding of the goals of care in relation to the broader treatment plan. As an illness advances, the goals of the patient and their caregivers may evolve, gradually shifting to an emphasis on comfort above all else. As this occurs, decisions about therapy and the information provided to the patient and caregivers may change. Modifying the care plan as goals of care shift requires ongoing communication, education, and support of the patient and their caregivers. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95552.html" rel="external">

         An effective strategy for cancer pain management is predicated on several broad principles:

         A detailed assessment of the pain should be performed initially; careful reassessment is indicated whenever a change occurs. The initial assessment of the patient with cancer pain always includes a history and examination, and often requires imaging or laboratory tests. The approach may be conceptualized as collecting data sufficient to characterize key elements of the pain (see

         The second principle recognizes that pain may be addressed by disease-modifying antineoplastic therapy and other interventions directed against the etiology of the pain. Treatments that address the underlying etiology of pain, such as radiation therapy, surgery, or in some cases, chemotherapy, can be integrated into a broader plan of care for symptom control. Treatment of cancer-related pain usually requires close consultation with an oncology specialist, who can provide the necessary information about the availability of antineoplastic therapy.

         Whether or not primary disease-modifying therapy is possible, a large proportion of patients with pain due to active cancer require symptomatic treatment. Beginning in the early 1980s, a worldwide consensus has evolved that considers opioid-based pharmacotherapy as the mainstay approach for the symptomatic treatment of cancer patients with active disease and pain that is moderate to severe [

         or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID). This analgesic may be combined with an adjuvant drug that provides additional analgesia (ie, a so-called "adjuvant analgesic," such as an analgesic antidepressant drug for neuropathic pain), treats a side effect, or manages a coexisting symptom. A low-dose opioid may be required for pain that is persistent or increasing [

         The quality of the evidence to support benefit from opioids in cancer pain is surprisingly low. An analysis of Cochrane reviews (152 studies, including 13,524 patients) found that the amount and quality of the evidence were very low; most studies were at high risk of bias from several sources, including small study size and short follow-up [

Based on the limited data available, the authors concluded that 19 out of every 20 people with moderate to severe cancer-related pain who are given opioids and can tolerate them should have that pain reduced to mild or no pain within 14 days. Most people will experience adverse events, and between 1 and 2 of every 10 patients treated with opioids will find these adverse effects to be intolerable, leading to a change in treatment.

         Opioids are potentially abusable drugs and safe prescribing requires consideration of the risks associated with drug abuse, addiction, and diversion to the illicit marketplace. Their potential for abuse and addiction results from the "brain reward" they induce in biologically predisposed individuals, which is mediated through dopamine pathways in the brain. The potential for harm to the individual and the important public health consequences of opioid abuse drive the imperative that all clinicians assume responsibility for risk management when potentially abusable drugs like opioids are prescribed for legitimate medical purposes. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7804.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         The ability to assess and manage the risk of abuse, addiction, and diversion is one of the foundations to safe and effective opioid prescribing. The importance of risk management during the treatment of cancer pain, complementing the broad consensus that opioid-based drug therapy is the mainstay approach for the treatment of moderate or severe chronic cancer pain, is underscored the prevalence of opioid use disorder in populations with cancer-related pain, estimated to be approximately 8 percent [
         <a href="#rid44">

         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Risk assessment requires an understanding of the laws and regulations with which prescribers must comply. All medications with the potential for abuse and addiction are regulated [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ]. In the United States, these drugs are designated "controlled substances" under a federal law known as the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which places controlled prescription drugs in one of five "schedules" based on abuse liability  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66064" href="/z/d/graphic/66064.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). Under the CSA, most opioids used for cancer pain management are schedule II, which indicates a high liability for abuse and diversion. Both federal and state laws are in force to regulate all scheduled drugs, particularly those in schedule II. Clinicians are required to know and comply with these laws.

         The intent of the new laws and regulations described above is to reduce opioid abuse, and is widely supported by clinicians, regulators, and those in law enforcement. Clinicians have raised concerns, however, that the effort to reduce risk could create barriers to prescribing, the result of which will be more unrelieved pain, challenging the ability of oncologists and palliative care clinicians to provide compassionate care that includes adequate pain relief. As noted, there is evidence that regulations to curb opioid abuse might reduce legitimate access by patients with cancer who need opioids for chronic pain, including those near end of life, and increasing the burden of cancer-related pain [

         In the United States, influential guidelines for opioid prescribing were published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2016. Although these guidelines specifically excluded treatment of patients with cancer or other terminal illness [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ], some prescribers presumably extrapolated the guidance to this population and some insurance payers inappropriately use it to deny opioid coverage for the cancer populations. Many states also have enacted formal legislation limiting the duration and/or dose of opioid prescriptions, and although the majority explicitly exempt patients with cancer-related pain, exemptions are broadly applied with few states providing specific guidance for prescribing for cancer-related pain [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55
         </a>

This guideline states that its recommendations do not apply to the population with cancer pain, or pain due to sickle cell disease, or to populations receiving palliative or end-of-life care. The CDC has not issued a separate set of guidelines for opioid prescribing in cancer patients.

These studies suggest that oncology practices and programs that manage cancer patients with advanced illness (eg, hospice or palliative care) are ill prepared for identifying and managing opioid misuse, abuse, and addiction. A survey of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited palliative medicine fellowship programs observed that most programs do not have policies or training opportunities focused on screening patients for abuse or dealing with diversion [

         A year 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 studies published during the two decades prior to 2020, identified a prevalence of opioid use disorder in populations with cancer-related pain of 8 percent (95% CI 1-20 percent) [

        <p>
         Aberrant opioid use in the population with cancer pain can produce adverse consequences for the individual, including increased symptom distress or a reluctance to accept recommended oncologic care. The relationship with clinicians and other professional caregivers can be compromised, and the clinician in particular may experience uncertainty and distress while trying to balance the importance of pain control with the potential for harm to the patient or the community.
        </p>
        <p>
         Many experts endorse the view that the decision to prescribe an opioid for pain management always should be preceded by careful risk assessment. Although the risk of aberrant drug-related behaviors is minimal or nil in many clinical circumstances (eg, acute pain management in a hospital setting or treatment of pain at the very end of life), there are many times that the risk cannot be trivialized and a careful strategy is necessary to preempt or minimize problems.
        </p>
        <p>
         Risk assessment requires a clear understanding of the clinical presentations of the phenomena related to the abuse liability of opioid drugs. These phenomena include abuse, addiction, and diversion [

         The term "drug abuse" refers to the use of a drug in a manner that deviates from medical, legal, and social standards. Prescription drugs are abused when taken in any manner that was not prescribed. In the United States, indicators of prescription opioid abuse increased at an alarming rate between the early 2000s and the mid-2010s (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15236.html" rel="external">
          "Prescription drug misuse: Epidemiology, prevention, identification, and management", section on 'Prescription drug misuse'
         </a>
         ). As noted, a key indicator, prescription opioid overdose, peaked in 2012 and declined thereafter, to be replaced by a rise in the rate of illicit opioid overdose.
        </p>
        <p>
         Addiction is a disease with a strong genetic component that is defined by aberrant drug-taking behavior, characterized by craving, loss of control, compulsive use, and continued use despite harm. The biologic propensity toward addictive disease affects a small minority of the population, probably no more than 10 percent. A personal or family history of alcohol or drug abuse may reveal such a propensity, and individuals with such a history should be considered high risk for problematic drug-related behavior during treatment with an opioid or other potentially abusable drug.
        </p>
        <p>
         A personal history and family history with no indication of alcohol or drug abuse does not mean that the genetic predisposition to addiction is absent. Although the risk is relatively lower, it is possible that exposure to therapeutic opioids can trigger an addictive disorder de novo. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7809.html" rel="external">
          "Risky drinking and alcohol use disorder: Epidemiology, clinical features, adverse consequences, screening, and assessment"

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Addiction must be distinguished from the physiologic phenomena of physical dependence and tolerance. Physical dependence is defined solely by the occurrence of withdrawal symptoms after abrupt dose reduction or the administration of an antagonist. Tolerance is defined solely by the drug-induced loss of an effect over time. Although these phenomena presumably occur commonly as addiction evolves, neither are necessary for addiction to occur, and equally important, neither means that abuse or addiction is occurring.

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Diversion is a legal concept, referring to the distribution of a drug into the illicit marketplace. Physicians are required to stop prescribing when there is a strong likelihood that diversion of prescribed drugs is occurring. In the United States, this legal constraint is codified in the Federal Controlled Substances Act, which states that prescribing of a controlled prescription drug (ie, one with the potential for abuse) is legal only if it is for a legitimate medical purpose, and performed within the course of usual professional practice [
         <a href="#rid68">
          68
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15236.html" rel="external">
          "Prescription drug misuse: Epidemiology, prevention, identification, and management", section on 'Controlled substances'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In contrast to the requirement that prescribing cease if diversion is occurring, the law states that prescribing may continue legally in the context of suspected abuse or addiction if appropriate medical actions are being taken to stop the behavior, regain control over the prescribing, and manage the medical and psychiatric condition of the patient. Great care must be taken, however, because clinicians are subject to review under medical practice regulations, as well as drug laws, and must prescribe within conventionally accepted standards. When aberrant behaviors occur and cannot be promptly and effectively managed, consultation with a specialist in addiction medicine should be considered to appropriately diagnose and manage the nature of a drug-related problem. High-risk patients may warrant co-management, with consultation before a commitment is made by the prescribing to continue opioid therapy on a long-term basis. In some cases, referral to a pain medicine or palliative medicine specialist also can clarify best practices and next steps. Careful documentation is mandatory.

         With an understanding of these phenomena, clinicians can stratify the estimated risk of problematic drug-related behavior in individual patients, and judge whether treatment with a controlled prescription drug can proceed, should proceed without assistance from a specialist, or proceeds in tandem with risk management approaches that emphasize adherence monitoring and control. General principles of risk assessment and risk management for patients receiving opioids for treatment of cancer pain are outlined in the table  (

        </p>
        <p>
         Although numerous questionnaires have been developed for the prediction of risk (eg, the CAGE questionnaire, the Opioid Risk Tool [ORT], and the Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain [SOAPP]), none has been adequately validated in cancer patients or is in widespread use [
         <a href="#rid65">
          65,69-78
         </a>
         ]. A systematic review of 18 studies [
         <a href="#rid65">
          65
         </a>
         ] evaluated found that the use of the CAGE, ORT, or SOAPP, and the use of urine drug screening, could identify opioid abuse, with rates that varied by the methods employed in the studies. (See

         The presence of any of these factors indicates an elevated risk for problematic drug-related behavior. A number of questionnaires are available to assist in screening for unhealthy use of alcohol or other drugs. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Other factors, such as younger age, smoking history, social isolation or involvement with a drug abuse subculture, a history of multiple automobile accidents, financial distress, and inability to maintain employment, also may be important to consider when stratifying risk of aberrant drug-related behaviors. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15236.html" rel="external">
          "Prescription drug misuse: Epidemiology, prevention, identification, and management"

        </p>
        <p>
         Notably, the absence of risk factors does not ensure that an individual will be adherent over time or exclude a risk of abuse or addiction. Risk factors overall have low sensitivity for identifying individuals who will develop opioid problems.
        </p>
        <p>
         All cancer patients who are prescribed controlled prescription drugs must be carefully monitored during therapy for nonadherence—behaviors that might suggest aberrant nonmedical use  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef121243" href="/z/d/graphic/121243.html" rel="external">
          table 5
         </a>
         ). Those who are at relatively higher risk should be monitored more rigorously. While there are tools to assist with screening and diagnosis during therapy (eg, the Current Opioid Misuse Measure [COMM]) [
         <a href="#rid69">
          69,82-86
         </a>
         ], none are adequately validated, none have been studied in cancer patients, none can replace a careful substance use and psychiatric history, and none can be recommended for routine use.
        </p>
        <p>
         When screening questions suggest that a cancer patient may be at risk for problematic drug-related behavior, the prescribing clinician should communicate this concern and attempt to engage the patient in a plan for adherence monitoring. Clinicians may feel unprepared for this conversation [
         <a href="#rid87">
          87
         </a>
         ] and worry that the therapeutic alliance could be ruptured by the patient's perception that the clinician lacks trust, is threatening the withholding of needed treatment, or even is suggesting that the patient could be discharged from care. The following are points to remember when first communicating about the results of the screening:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Recognize that the communication may generate anger, anxiety, or shame on the part of the patient, and that the interaction may become emotional and possibly conflictual. Adopt a nonjudgmental stance (this is all about balancing risks and benefits of treatment), prepare to allow emotions to be expressed and to de-escalate tension by pointing to the rationale for the clinician's actions and the viability of next steps, and realize that the messages that must be conveyed may need to be repeated until the patient demonstrates understanding.

         Have a plan for next steps at the time of the discussion (eg, to request regular urine drug screens or a treatment agreement), so that the patient's concerns about the availability of treatment can be addressed immediately.

Explain that monitoring means obtaining information that confirms that the patient is taking the medication exactly as prescribed and is neither taking other medication without telling the doctor nor abusing drugs or alcohol. Also state that monitoring is not about a lack of trust but, rather, is a practice that clinicians must do in order to act in the patient's best interest, both in terms of providing access to treatment and ensuring that treatment is provided in a safe and effective way.

        <p>
         When the risk of aberrant drug-related behavior is assessed as low (as it is in most patients with cancer pain), prescribing of an opioid can proceed with simple and straightforward strategies for adherence monitoring and controlling drug use. The medical record should document that prescribing is occurring in the context of a therapeutic relationship and for a specific medical problem that has been evaluated in a routine manner (history, examination, appropriate formulation of diagnosis). Reassessment should be performed or planned at periodic intervals to ensure that the medication remains necessary and adequate. There should be documentation of each prescription that is written for a controlled substance.

         The role of random urine drug testing (UDT) for patients at low risk for aberrant drug-related behavior is controversial. Random UDT is an effective risk monitoring tool during chronic opioid therapy, and it has been endorsed in numerous opioid prescribing guidelines for chronic noncancer pain. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/118689.html" rel="external">
          "Urine drug testing for patients with chronic pain"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, there is very limited evidence to guide the integration of random UDT into routine cancer pain management, even though rates of aberrant opioid behavior have been reported to be almost 20 percent in some populations. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Risk of aberrant opioid behavior in cancer patients'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         At least one study from the supportive care center of a major cancer center concluded that random urine drug testing identifies abnormalities earlier than the use of targeted urine drug testing (ie, testing on the basis of an estimation of the risk of nonmedical opioid use) [
         <a href="#rid88">
          88
         </a>
         ]. In this study, excluding marijuana, 15 percent of the random group had positive UDT, compared with 37 percent of the targeted group. It took a shorter time from the initial supportive care consultation to detect one or more abnormalities in the random group (median 130 versus 274 days).
        </p>
        <p>
         These studies suggest that risk assessment in some populations of cancer patients, specifically those expected to have a relatively high prevalence of aberrant behavior, may be improved by UDT, including random UDT [
         <a href="#rid89">
          89

         The decision may be made to offer no additional short-acting opioid drug for breakthrough or incident pain, again because of the assumption that these agents are relatively more likely to be abused.

         In addition, clinicians should discuss safety strategies (eg, lock boxes) with patients to minimize the potential for involuntary diversion, which occurs when a controlled substance is stolen from a patient without their knowledge. This happens more frequently in patients with unstable housing or caregiver dynamics [

        <p>
         In some cases, no additional safety measures beyond routine precautions are needed even when risk factors exist because the severity of the disease or the setting of treatment is such that the likelihood of problematic behaviors is essentially zero. It is best if this understanding is documented in the medical record.

         Although there is large variation in the propensity for signs of opioid withdrawal associated with opioid dose reduction, and variation in the specific manifestations, patients generally reduce the dose without substantial adverse effects. A reduction of 10 to 20 percent of the total daily dose usually is tolerated. Should pain increase or signs of withdrawal appear, such as anxiety, insomnia, jitteriness, or diarrhea, the opioid dose can be increased and a smaller dose reduction implemented after the patient stabilizes.

         Cognitive and psychomotor adverse effects of opioids could potentially impair the ability to drive or work safely. Opioids can slow reaction time, cause drowsiness, or cloud judgment, particularly when they are first started, or when doses are increased [

          101

         There are no large trials examining the risk of driving while on opioids. Most epidemiologic studies and reviews suggest that motor vehicle accidents and fatalities, and citations for impaired driving, are

         Pain is a highly prevalent symptom in patients with cancer. Adequate pain relief can be achieved in more than 70 percent of patients when well-accepted treatment guidelines for cancer pain are followed. However, undertreatment may affect over 40 percent of patients with cancer-related pain. (See

         Among individuals with cancer, pain is best considered as a domain within the broader context of palliative care, an interdisciplinary therapeutic approach that focuses on the comprehensive management of the physical, psychological, social, and spiritual needs of patients with serious or life-threatening diseases and their caregivers. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pain management within the context of palliative care'

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Most recommended therapies for cancer pain are within the scope of both specialty and primary care medical practice, and the adequate treatment of cancer pain should be viewed as a best practice for all medical disciplines involved in the care of this population. When the clinical issues are complex, particularly when pain is difficult to control or accompanied by other concerns, referral to a palliative care specialist may be appropriate.

          General principles of pain management

         – An effective strategy for cancer pain management is predicated on the following broad principles (see

         The goal of the initial assessment is to characterize key elements of the pain, including the presence of a pain syndrome, if one can be defined, inferred pathophysiology and etiology of the pain, and disease extent as well as prior antineoplastic treatment. Reassessment is indicated whenever a change occurs. (See

         A stepwise and systematic approach to pain control should consider selection of appropriate drugs and prescribing techniques that can optimize their pharmacological outcomes  (

         The ability to assess and manage the risk of abuse, addiction, and diversion is one of the foundations to safe and effective opioid prescribing. The importance of risk management during the treatment of cancer pain is underscored the prevalence of opioid use disorder in populations with cancer-related pain, estimated to be approximately 8 percent. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Risk assessment and management for patients receiving opioids'

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         When the risk of aberrant drug-related behavior is assessed as low (as it is in most patients with cancer pain), prescribing of an opioid can proceed with simple and straightforward strategies for adherence monitoring and controlling drug use. Patients who are considered to be at relatively higher risk for aberrant drug-related behavior should have additional "control measures" incorporated into therapy  (

          Driving safety
         </strong>
         – Clinicians should counsel all patients on chronic opioid therapy about the potential for transient or lasting cognitive impairment that may affect driving or work safety. Patients who have been on a stable dose of opioids for at least one week who feel no cognitive changes can drive. However, for patients initiating opioid therapy or changing doses, driving or operating heavy machinery is unsafe and should probably be avoided until a stable dose has been reached. (See
