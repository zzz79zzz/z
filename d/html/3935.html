SCID can be categorized as typical SCID or, if less severe, leaky SCID based upon the severity of T cell qualitative and quantitative deficiency (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3955.html" rel="external">"Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): An overview"</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Typical SCID</strong> – These forms of CID have the most severe qualitative and quantitative T cell deficiency.

They may present via newborn screening (NBS) or have somewhat milder symptoms and/or a later presentation compared with those who have full loss of function of the gene product. They may also have Omenn syndrome.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Combined immunodeficiencies (CID)</strong> – CID are distinguished from SCID in that they do not characteristically lead to death from overwhelming infection in the first year of life, and the degree of T cell deficiency is typically less profound. In addition, CID syndromes frequently have associated clinical features ranging from recurrent infections and autoimmunity presenting early in life to latent onset of symptoms in the second decade of life or even later.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2802647992"><span class="h1">GENOTYPES AND IMMUNOPHENOTYPE SEVERITY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For some involved genes, the clinical presentation can be variable, ranging in severity from typical severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), to atypical/leaky SCID, to milder CID. Patients with SCID must be identified and treated with definitive therapies, such as hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) or gene therapy, very early in life to achieve a good chance for long-term survival. Thus, it is critical to evaluate for the severity of immunophenotype.</p><p>The most common gene defects associated with clinical presentation ranging from typical SCID to adult-onset CID are those associated with defects in the recombination-activating gene 1 (<em>RAG1</em>) and recombination-activating gene 2 (<em>RAG2</em>) genes. However, hypomorphic and CID phenotypes have been described for many of the genetic defects known to cause SCID.</p><p>Pathologic variants in <em>RAG1</em> and <em>RAG2</em> can cause both typical and leaky/atypical SCID. However, hypomorphic variants with partial protein function can also present with Omenn syndrome or have a relatively mild-appearing CID or common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). In particular, granulomatous lesions and autoimmune disease, especially autoimmune cytopenias, in addition to more typical infections associated with T cell lymphopenia but with a later age of onset have been described as part of the spectrum of disease symptoms observed in patients with pathologic variants in the <em>RAG1</em>/<em>RAG2</em> genes [<a href="#rid3">3-7</a>].

Algorithms for evaluation of patients with suspected immunodeficiency are published [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Specific tests are reviewed in detail separately (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3903.html" rel="external">"Laboratory evaluation of the immune system"</a>.)</p><p>The initial studies when CID is suspected should include absolute numbers and percentages of lymphocyte subsets (T, B, and natural killer [NK]) and assessment of T cell function, as well as the measurement of immunoglobulin levels  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107086" href="/z/d/graphic/107086.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) and specific antibody titers.</p><p>Further studies should include enumeration of naïve and memory T cells subsets and T cells expressing the gamma-delta T cell receptor (TCR) and assessment of T cell repertoire diversity through spectral flow cytometry when considering CID as a clinical diagnosis. Additional testing that also has diagnostic clinical utility but is not yet widely available outside of research-based settings includes assessment T cells expressing Va7.2, which are typically lower in patients with decreased recombinase activity, and enumeration of mucosa-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1559590894"><span class="h2">Confirmation of the genetic defect</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is often useful to determine the genetic defect since it influences the clinical phenotype and may help to guide decisions for clinical management and aid in prognosis. Additionally, knowledge of the underlying genetic defect will allow for appropriate family genetic counseling. The form(s) of genetic testing performed depends upon the clinical features and family history. If there is a known family history of a specific gene defect, assessment for that same defect by directed sequencing is appropriate. There are commercially available next-generation sequencing panels that assess for genetic defects known to have association with CID and for syndromes with features of CID. Whole exome and, increasingly, whole genome sequencing may also be performed as part of the diagnostic evaluation. Clinical judgment should be used to determine which genetic testing approach is most appropriate for a given patient.

Combined immunodeficiency (CID) syndromes are distinguished from severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in that they do not characteristically lead to death from overwhelming infection in the first year of life. In some cases, variants of a particular gene may lead to SCID or to milder CID, depending upon the extent of the gene defect. Some CID have associated or syndromic features  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef139940" href="/z/d/graphic/139940.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Definitions'</a> above and <a class="local">'Genotypes and immunophenotype severity'</a> above and <a class="local">'IUIS classification'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3951.html" rel="external">"Syndromic immunodeficiencies"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Presentation</strong> – Patients with CID often present in the first two years of life with recurrent infections and specific findings associated with the different disorders  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef139920" href="/z/d/graphic/139920.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). However, patients with milder defects may not present until later in childhood or even adulthood. Many of the CID syndromes have characteristic-associated clinical features that suggest a particular defect and help direct the diagnostic evaluation. (See <a class="local">'Presentation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>When to refer</strong> – All patients suspected of having one of these disorders should be referred to an immunology specialist for evaluation and an attempt to determine a definitive diagnosis. (See <a class="local">'Referral'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – To make the diagnosis in a patient with clinical features suggestive of a CID, the patient should meet both the clinical and laboratory criteria, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) must be excluded. However, it is not necessary to have the clinical or laboratory features to start treatment if the patient has a known genetic defect associated with CID (eg, the patient is identified before onset of symptoms and/or laboratory testing due to a known diagnosis in the family). An attempt should be made to confirm the specific genetic defect since it influences the clinical phenotype and may help to guide decisions for clinical management and aid in prognosis. Additionally, knowledge of the underlying genetic defect will allow for appropriate family genetic counseling. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management </strong>– The choice of treatment depends upon the type and severity of the immune defect. Treatment ranges from supportive therapies such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> replacement, antibiotic prophylaxis, and immune modulation/suppression to more definitive therapy with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).
