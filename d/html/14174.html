Polyneuropathies may be classified into two general categories based on pathophysiology: axonal and demyelinating. Axonal neuropathies cause symptoms and signs related to axon loss, while demyelinating neuropathies produce abnormalities due to impaired interaction between Schwann cells and their axons. Axonal neuropathies may be caused by a broad spectrum of systemic illnesses. The differential diagnosis of demyelinating neuropathies includes immune-mediated, toxic, and hereditary etiologies. Immune-mediated polyneuropathies will be reviewed here.</p><p>An overview of the causes of toxic neuropathies is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5284.html" rel="external">"Overview of polyneuropathy", section on 'Toxic'</a>.)</p><p>Hereditary disorders that cause neuropathies and hereditary neuropathies are discussed elsewhere.

Other infectious triggers of GBS include Epstein-Barr virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), cytomegalovirus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). GBS may also occur after another triggering event such as immunization, surgery, trauma, and bone marrow transplantation.</p><p>The key clinical features of GBS are progressive, mostly symmetric muscle weakness and absent or depressed deep tendon reflexes. The weakness can vary from mild to severe, with nearly complete paralysis of all extremity, facial, respiratory, and bulbar muscles. Dysautonomia accompanies weakness in 70 percent of patients. Variant forms of GBS associated with antibodies to GQ1b may present chiefly with ophthalmoplegia and ataxia, rather than limb weakness.</p><p>GBS usually progresses over a period of approximately two weeks. The clinical diagnosis is confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and clinical neurophysiology studies. An increased CSF protein with a normal CSF white blood cell count, called albuminocytologic dissociation, is found in up to 66 percent of patients with GBS in the first week after the onset of symptoms and in ≥75 percent of patients in the third week. Electrodiagnostic studies show evidence of acute polyneuropathy with either predominantly demyelinating (ie, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy [AIDP]) or axonal (ie, acute motor axonal neuropathy [AMAN] or acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy [AMSAN]) features. Testing for serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to GQ1b is useful for the diagnosis of Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS).</p><p>GBS is discussed in detail separately.

Both the cellular and humoral components of the immune system appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of CIDP and its variants. However, the precise cause is unclear, since specific provoking antigens have not been identified.</p><p>Typical CIDP is characterized by a fairly symmetric weakness of both proximal and distal limb muscles. Most patients have globally diminished or absent reflexes. Sensory impairment in CIDP is usually more pronounced for vibration and position sense than for pain and temperature sense; sensory symptoms are usually less prominent than weakness. Cranial nerve impairment and dysautonomia occur in a minority.

Additional diagnostic modalities used for some patients when clinical and electrodiagnostic features are atypical may include CSF analysis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of spine and peripheral nerves, peripheral nerve ultrasound, laboratory studies to assess for disorders that are either associated with or mimic CIDP, and nerve biopsy.</p><p>The primary therapies for CIDP are intravenous or subcutaneous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a>, glucocorticoids, and plasma exchange.
