The major manifestations are cardiac and cutaneous findings. The most serious complication of NL is complete heart block (approximately 20 percent have an associated cardiomyopathy at the initial diagnosis, whereas other infants may develop it later [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>]). In this topic review, the cardiac manifestations of NL are referred to as cardiac-NL and can include any degree of block (referred to as congenital heart block) that may or may not be accompanied by extranodal disease such as valvular abnormalities, endocardial fibroelastosis, and/or dilated cardiomyopathy. Very rarely, those manifestations may occur in the absence of any conduction defect [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>This discussion emphasizes issues related to the treatment and potential prevention of NL. Testing for candidate antibodies is important prior to initiating therapy for a presumed case of cardiac-NL because there are cases of heart block not associated with anti-Ro/SSA (Sjögren syndrome type A antigen) or La/SSB (Sjögren syndrome type B antigen), and, thus, the management may be different. This testing is discussed separately. The specific indications for cardiac pacing in infants with congenital complete heart block are also discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6402.html" rel="external">"Neonatal lupus: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Screening and surveillance'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/912.html" rel="external">"Congenital third-degree (complete) atrioventricular block"</a>.)</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, screening, and surveillance of NL are discussed in greater detail separately. Pregnancy in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and diagnosis and management of fetal arrhythmias are also reviewed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6402.html" rel="external">"Neonatal lupus: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4679.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy in women with systemic lupus erythematosus"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6765.html" rel="external">"Fetal arrhythmias"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2439789755"><span class="h1">IN UTERO MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Complete heart block, once identified, is ultimately irreversible (rare cases of transient reversal [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]) despite all therapies attempted to date, including glucocorticoids, apheresis, intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> (IVIG), and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8541" href="/z/d/drug information/8541.html" rel="external">hydroxychloroquine</a> [<a href="#rid2">2,7-9</a>]. Second-degree heart block may be reversible, but it also may progress to complete heart block despite therapy [<a href="#rid8">8-13</a>]. The clinical relevance of first-degree heart block is unclear since progression from first-degree block (defined as a PR interval longer than 150 msec) to more advanced heart block in untreated fetuses has not been well documented but can occur. Monitoring for heart block is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6402.html" rel="external">"Neonatal lupus: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Fetal surveillance for heart block'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1408265989"><span class="h2">Efficacy and side effects of fluorinated glucocorticoids</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Published data are limited and discordant regarding the efficacy of fluorinated glucocorticoids in reducing mortality in cardiac-NL. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">Dexamethasone</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9139" href="/z/d/drug information/9139.html" rel="external">betamethasone</a>, which are not inactivated by placental 11-beta dehydrogenase, may ameliorate pleuropericardial effusions or hydrops, and there are reports of improved outcomes [<a href="#rid8">8,14-16</a>]. However, there are risks of glucocorticoid therapy to both the mother (eg, infection, hypertension, avascular necrosis, insulin resistance, and gestational diabetes) and the infant (eg, oligohydramnios, growth restriction, and the still undetermined potential effect upon neurocognitive development) [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>]. No neurodevelopmental abnormalities were noted in 14 offspring of anti-Ro/SSA-positive (Sjögren syndrome type A antigen-positive) mothers exposed to antenatal betamethasone [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p>In a meta-analysis that included over 1000 cases (albeit there may have been overlap within registries, and most series were retrospective), fluorinated glucocorticoids did not improve fetal or neonatal survival [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. In addition, prolonged regimens of fluorinated glucocorticoids were associated with increased risk of fetal and maternal complications. A marginal but significant downgrading of congenital heart block was seen when comparing fluorinated glucocorticoids with or without other treatments, but this improvement was not evident with the use of fluorinated glucocorticoids alone. Moreover, it seems all degrees of block were included, making interpretation difficult. The use of fluorinated glucocorticoids for each degree of heart block is discussed in the sections below. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7998.html" rel="external">"Safety of rheumatic disease medication use during pregnancy and lactation", section on 'Glucocorticoids'</a> and <a class="local">'First-degree heart block'</a> below and <a class="local">'Second-degree heart block'</a> below and <a class="local">'Third-degree heart block'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3354678484"><span class="h2">First-degree heart block</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment of isolated first-degree block (defined in some series as a PR interval &gt;150 msec) with glucocorticoids in utero remains controversial because of the risks of therapy, the evidence that first-degree block can revert to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) without therapy, and the inconsistent evidence that untreated first-degree block in the fetus can progress to more advanced block.</p><p>Overall, the author's approach to first-degree block is to repeat the echocardiogram within 24 hours to confirm that the PR interval is indeed prolonged (at least 150 msec). If verified, the mother is started on oral fluorinated glucocorticoid (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a> 4 mg per day or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9139" href="/z/d/drug information/9139.html" rel="external">betamethasone</a> 3 mg per day), and fetal monitoring by echocardiography is performed weekly. If there is progression to complete block and no evidence of extranodal disease, then dexamethasone is discontinued. If the block remains at first degree or reverts to NSR, then dexamethasone may be continued to 26 weeks gestation and then discontinued since vulnerability is thought to decrease after that time period and further inflammatory insult may be less likely. In contrast, other experts would not treat fetal first-degree block and take an anticipatory approach. Daily home Doppler monitoring of the fetus by the mother can detect second-degree block [<a href="#rid21">21</a>] and is another potential monitoring strategy for identifying progression of first-degree block (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6402.html" rel="external">"Neonatal lupus: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Fetal surveillance for heart block'</a>). In sum,<strong> </strong>the overall absence of substantial evidence regarding management is due to the rarity of disease precluding prospective randomized studies, the fact that treatment is often provided to mothers with fetuses with first-degree block, and the variability in both the technique of detection and cutoff values to define first-degree heart block among the different studies. Particularly challenging is the continued management approach if the block does revert to NSR with glucocorticoid treatment since it is unclear whether improvement supports continuing therapy for the remainder of the pregnancy.</p><p>In a Canadian study of 165 fetuses of 142 anti-Ro/La antibody-positive women referred for serial echocardiography, fetal atrioventricular (AV) prolongation or type 1 second-degree block (occurring in 15) was not treated, and none progressed [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Spontaneous resolution was reported in other case series [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>]. In a series of 273 mothers participating in a home monitoring study, first-degree block was noted in four fetuses, one of whom also had endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) and was treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a>. None of the four fetuses developed advanced block [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p>Other small studies and case reports have shown normalization of AV conduction within one to two weeks in fetuses with first-degree heart block whose mothers were treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a> [<a href="#rid9">9,25-27</a>]. In a report from China, four anti-Ro/SSA-exposed fetuses with a PR interval of ≥160 msec treated with dexamethasone 4.5 mg and 400 mg <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8541" href="/z/d/drug information/8541.html" rel="external">hydroxychloroquine</a> showed resolution with normal electrocardiograms (ECGs) from 8 to 53 months postpartum [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p>Progression from first- to third-degree heart block was reported in two cases [<a href="#rid23">23,29</a>].</p><p>Progression of first-degree block to second-degree block was observed, despite <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a>, in one case in the Preventive Approach to Congenital Heart Block With <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8541" href="/z/d/drug information/8541.html" rel="external">Hydroxychloroquine</a> (PATCH) study [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H795105548"><span class="h2">Second-degree heart block</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most second-degree block detected in utero eventually progresses to complete heart block [<a href="#rid10">10,31,32</a>]. However, it is hypothesized that incomplete block represents a critical and potentially reversible inflammatory state (more advanced than first-degree block and thus more clinically concerning) in which the AV node has not already been damaged and irreversibly fibrosed. Thus, the goal of glucocorticoids and intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>] in the case of second-degree block is to decrease inflammation and prevent third-degree block. However, second-degree block can revert to NSR without treatment, and unfortunately not all cases respond to treatment.</p><p>Small, uncontrolled case series document that both treated and untreated patients with second-degree block can progress, stabilize, or revert to NSR [<a href="#rid8">8,9,11,22</a>]. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of five observational studies that included 71 fetuses exposed to maternal anti-Ro, the rate of progression in those treated and not treated with fluorinated glucocorticoids (primarily <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a>) was 52 (95% CI 23-79) and 73 percent (95% CI 39-94); the rate of regression (including to first degree, intermittent first/second degree, or NSR) was 25 and 23 percent; and the rate of complete regression to NSR was 21 (95% CI, 6-42) and 9 percent (95% CI, 0-41), respectively [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Given the small number of included cases and the subsequent absence of statistical power, it was not possible to quantify objectively the strength of association. In sum, antenatal glucocorticoid therapy was not associated with a statistically significant reduced rate of progression or increased rate of regression. The interval between prenatal diagnosis and treatment was not systematically recorded, and thus it is possible (and should be prospectively evaluated by employing home Doppler) that initiation of therapy immediately after diagnosis is critical with regard to efficacy. The authors of the meta-analysis concluded that the use of fluorinated glucocorticoids once second-degree heart block is diagnosed should "not be discouraged" until more robust evidence is available.</p><p>In another study evaluating nine studies involving 727 cases that overlap with the above study, the authors concluded that fluorinated glucocorticoids did not affect progression of incomplete block [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> is an alternative option [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. To address whether very early detection of second-degree block by the fetal home Doppler followed by rapid treatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a> and IVIG reverses second-degree block, a large, multicenter clinical trial (Surveillance and Treatment to Prevent Fetal Atrioventricular Block Likely to Occur Quickly [STOP BLOQ]) is underway (<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT04474223&amp;token=nbsXe3i4qfUea5RCPRHtOS7yhoEzH%2BMCpwZ1%2F1ekxPNe6GBUT7bpE0kw5PjlZEFMco2lME4AQV2wmS2222PhRA%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=113264" target="_blank">NCT04474223</a>).</p><p>These considerations notwithstanding, prenatal treatment with fluorinated glucocorticoids (eg, oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a> 4 to 8 mg per day or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9139" href="/z/d/drug information/9139.html" rel="external">betamethasone</a> 3 mg per day) with or without <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">IVIG</a> at 1 g/kg is usually prescribed by the author for mothers of fetuses with second-degree heart block, beginning as soon after detection as is feasible. Monitoring with at least weekly echocardiography is continued. The challenge is the decision of when to stop such therapy. If the fetus improves, continuing therapy through the end of pregnancy is reasonable. Gradual tapering of dexamethasone from 8 to 2 mg is probably warranted to limit side effects. However, discontinuation with vigilant observation (ie, weekly monitoring by echocardiography) is also an option since the vulnerability of the fetal heart decreases after 26 weeks gestation. If the fetus progresses to third-degree block or does not respond, discontinuation of therapy is reasonable if there is no other indication (eg, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, hydrops) for treatment with glucocorticoids. However, this approach is not uniformly agreed upon, as many clinicians still worry about progression. For IVIG, it is also unclear whether to continue every three weeks or discontinue after 26 weeks.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3708433794"><span class="h2">Third-degree heart block</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Complete heart block is associated with fetal demise in 5 to 20 percent [<a href="#rid1">1,14,31,34</a>]. Fluorinated glucocorticoids have not been shown to reverse third-degree block. In addition, most studies have not supported the use of fluorinated glucocorticoids to prevent disease progression or death. Thus, treatment of isolated third-degree block is generally <strong>not</strong> advised by the author, unless there are other factors that might indicate ongoing inflammation and glucocorticoid treatment (eg, cardiomyopathy, EFE). Management of the fetus with complete AV block is primarily expectant. Fetal echocardiography is usually performed weekly to detect extranodal disease, which may warrant treatment. Postnatal management, including indications for pacemaker implantation, and mortality risk factors are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/912.html" rel="external">"Congenital third-degree (complete) atrioventricular block", section on 'Postnatal treatment'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/912.html" rel="external">"Congenital third-degree (complete) atrioventricular block", section on 'Prognosis'</a> and <a class="local">'Cardiomyopathy/endocardial fibroelastosis'</a> below.)</p><p>In a multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized study, there was no reversal in 31 fetuses with third-degree heart block regardless of whether they were treated with glucocorticoids (n = 22) or not (n = 9) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In a study of 202 cases of third-degree block reported from France, the use of fluorinated glucocorticoids was not associated with improved survival [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. In another retrospective study that included 71 fetuses with isolated advanced heart block without extranodal disease in utero exposed to fluorinated glucocorticoids within one week of detection and 85 that were not treated, fluorinated glucocorticoids did not significantly prevent development of disease beyond the AV node, reduce mortality, or forestall/prevent pacemaker implantation [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>In a subsequent meta-analysis covering nine studies inclusive of 747 patients with varying degrees of congenital heart block, fluorinated glucocorticoids did not influence the overall birth rate, overall survival, progression of incomplete congenital heart block, pacing, or presence of extranodal disease [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. However, in a subgroup analysis, glucocorticoids did have a significant protective role in survival and pacing in patients with third-degree block with or without extranodal disease. The findings in third-degree block may reflect the higher rate of extranodal disease in untreated patients compared with patients exposed to fluorinated glucocorticoids. This implies that extranodal disease drives mortality, which has long been appreciated [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3232479434"><span class="h3">Maternal beta agonist therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Fetuses generally tolerate the arrhythmia well when ventricular rates are &gt;55 beats per minute (bpm) in the absence of anomalies [<a href="#rid35">35,36</a>]. Administration of maternal beta agonist therapy when the fetal heart rate is &lt;50 to 55 bpm was shown to increase the heart rate and stroke volume in small case series [<a href="#rid15">15,37</a>]. Most centers use this approach routinely if the fetal heart rate is &lt;50 bpm, although it has not been evaluated by comparative studies.</p><p>In a retrospective series of 44 fetuses with third-degree block all exposed to maternal anti-Ro/SSA antibodies, prognosis was evaluated based upon stratification into a high heart rate group (n = 18), for which all prenatal ventricular rate measurements were above the age-specific mean of the total cases, and a low heart rate group (n = 26), defined as having at least one observation below the mean during follow-up [<a href="#rid38">38</a>].

The cutoff for consideration is not universally agreed upon. In the Surveillance and Treatment to Prevent Fetal Atrioventricular Block Likely to Occur Quickly (STOP BLOQ) trial, the protocol calls for treatment only if the PR interval is ≥170 msec. The glucocorticoid is discontinued if there is progression to complete block and no evidence of extranodal disease. If the block remains at first degree or reverts to normal sinus rhythm (NSR), then the glucocorticoid is continued to 26 weeks gestation and then stopped since vulnerability decreases after that time period and further inflammatory insult is less likely. Observation rather than treatment is a reasonable alternative.

Therapy is tapered, but dexamethasone 2 mg is usually continued through the end of pregnancy even if the heart block regresses to NSR, although discontinuation after 26 weeks (less vulnerable period) is also reasonable. Glucocorticoids are typically discontinued if the fetus progresses to third-degree heart block or does not improve if there is no other indication for treatment with glucocorticoids (eg, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis), although continuing therapy through the end of pregnancy is also reasonable. Intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) at 1 mg/kg is also an option for second-degree block.
