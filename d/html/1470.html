However, the introduction of improved angioplasty equipment and new interventional devices in the 1980s made catheterization an important tool in the treatment of ischemic and other cardiovascular disease.</p><p>Although diagnostic catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are done by percutaneous puncture rather than incision, and under local rather than general anesthesia, they can cause a variety of adverse events, ranging from minor problems without long-term sequelae to major complications requiring immediate corrective action. Furthermore, newer interventional procedures may be associated with different and, in some cases, more frequent complications.</p><p>The most common complications associated with diagnostic cardiac catheterization will be reviewed here. The complications associated with cardiac catheterization involving PCI are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1562.html" rel="external">"Periprocedural complications of percutaneous coronary intervention"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">MAJOR COMPLICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The risk of producing a major complication (death, myocardial infarction, or major embolization) during diagnostic cardiac catheterization is generally well below 1 percent  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120337" href="/z/d/graphic/120337.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). As a result, the risk-to-benefit ratio still favors performing this procedure as a part of the evaluation of potentially fatal or lifestyle-limiting cardiac disease.</p><p>For the individual patient, the risk of an adverse event is dependent upon demographics, cardiovascular anatomy, clinical circumstances including comorbidities, the experience of the operator, and the type of procedure being performed  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51490" href="/z/d/graphic/51490.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54367" href="/z/d/graphic/54367.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Severe peripheral artery disease is a risk factor for all of the major complications.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Death</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Death following diagnostic cardiac catheterization is now rare. Compared with the 1 percent mortality rate seen in the 1960s, the second registry of the Society for Cardiac Angiography revealed that the procedural mortality had fallen to 0.1 percent in the more than 200,000 patients catheterized between 1984 and 1987 [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>High-risk subgroups have been identified in multiple large series [<a href="#rid1">1-9</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Age above 60 years and below one year and women have an increased mortality rate after catheterization.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>New York Heart Association functional class IV is associated with an almost tenfold increase in mortality compared with classes I and II  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683" href="/z/d/graphic/52683.html" rel="external">table 4</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A similar increase in risk is seen with severe disease of the left main coronary artery (compared to single vessel disease) and with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below 30 percent (compared to an LVEF above 50 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with valvular heart disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus requiring insulin therapy, peripheral artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and pulmonary insufficiency all appear to have an increased incidence of death and major complications from cardiac catheterization. Mortality is especially high in those with preexisting renal insufficiency who have further deterioration of renal function within 48 hours after the procedure, particularly when dialysis is required [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Acute renal failure'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Myocardial infarction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although periprocedural myocardial ischemia is fairly common, infarction is rare. The general risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in most series is less than 0.1 percent [<a href="#rid2">2-7</a>]. However, the risk of precipitating an MI in an individual patient is influenced by patient-related and technique-related factors. Risk factors that predispose patients to MI during the procedure include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The extent of disease (0.17 percent with left main coronary disease versus 0.06 percent in single vessel disease) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recent non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diabetes mellitus requiring insulin therapy [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Stroke</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The discussion of stroke consequent to cardiac catheterization is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14083.html" rel="external">"Stroke after cardiac catheterization"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h1">LOCAL VASCULAR COMPLICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Local complications at the site of catheter insertion are among the most common problems seen after cardiac catheterization  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef120337" href="/z/d/graphic/120337.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). These problems may include acute thrombosis, distal embolization  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93977" href="/z/d/graphic/93977.html" rel="external">image 1</a>), dissection or poorly controlled bleeding (which may be manifested as free hemorrhage or contained hematoma in the femoral or retroperitoneal areas), pseudoaneurysm, or arteriovenous fistula. Hemorrhage and hematoma are usually evident within 12 hours after the procedure by virtue of local discomfort, hypotension, or falling hematocrit, which lead to confirmatory noninvasive testing (ultrasound or computed tomography [CT]). In contrast, other complications such as pseudoaneurysm and arteriovenous fistula may not become apparent for days to weeks afterward.</p><p>Ultrasound-guided access of the femoral artery may improve efficacy and reduce vascular complications. A meta-analysis from 2020 reported a higher initial success rate (RR = 1.36; 95% CI 1.17-1.57) and a reduction in vascular complications (RR = 0.48; 95% CI 0.25-0.91) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>The vascular complications associated with percutaneous coronary intervention are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1562.html" rel="external">"Periprocedural complications of percutaneous coronary intervention"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Hemostasis at the femoral access site</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The traditional approach to catheter removal at the conclusion of cardiac catheterization was local hand-applied pressure for 15 to 30 minutes. Two alternative approaches are available: mechanical clamp compression and, more importantly, arterial puncture closing devices.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H678090977"><span class="h3">Mechanical clamp</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Mechanical clamp compression reduces the amount of staff time and effort required to assure hemostasis, and may reduce the rate of vascular complications. One trial randomly assigned 778 patients to hand applied pressure or mechanical clamp pressure; the latter reduced the frequency of ultrasound-defined femoral vascular complications (femoral artery thrombosis, echogenic hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, or arteriovenous fistulae formation) by 63 percent [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. However, clamping does not decrease the importance of having staff in attendance to ensure that the device is placed and remains in the correct position.</p><p>The circumstances which may make mechanical clamps the preferred method of achieving hemostasis include procedures where longer hemostasis time is anticipated: larger sheaths, excessively anticoagulated patients, recognized hematoma, and dual antiplatelet therapy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H678090984"><span class="h3">Closure devices</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Arterial puncture closing devices (APCDs) eliminate the need for prolonged arterial compression and reduce the subsequent interval of bed rest that is otherwise required. Two types of APCDs in clinical use include collagen hemostatic puncture closure devices  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61621" href="/z/d/graphic/61621.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid13">13-16</a>] and suture-mediated devices [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p>APCDs may increase the risk of local vascular complications. In a meta-analysis of 30 trials including 4000 patients who underwent coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), nonsignificant increases in the incidence of groin hematoma, bleeding, and pseudoaneurysm formation were associated with use of these devices compared to manual compression [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. When only those trials with an intention-to-treat analysis were included, the relative risks of groin hematoma and pseudoaneurysm formation were significantly increased (1.89 and 5.40, respectively).</p><p>A larger meta-analysis that included 30 studies involving 37,066 patients concluded that the risk of complications depended upon the specific device used and whether the procedure was a diagnostic catheterization or a PCI [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. In the overall analysis, there was a significant increase in risk with an APCD (odds ratio [OR] 1.34, 95% CI 1.01-1.79).</p><p>For reports limited to diagnostic studies, there were no significant differences between APCDs and mechanical compression, although there were trends toward fewer complications with the AngioSeal device (OR 0.71) and toward more complications with the VasoSeal and Perclose devices (OR 1.85 and 1.51, respectively).</p><p>For reports limited to PCI, there were no significant differences between APCDs and mechanical compression overall. However, there was a significant increase in vascular complications with the VasoSeal device (OR 2.52).</p><p>Closure devices also increase the risk of local infection or endarteritis [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>]. Although this complication is infrequent (0.3 percent in one series) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>], it can be serious when it occurs. Consideration should be given to periprocedural antibiotics in immunocompromised patients following prolonged arterial access or when sterility has been breached when a closure device is used. It may also be prudent for the operator to change gloves prior to using an arterial closure device (see <a class="local">'Infection'</a> below). An angiogram of the femoral artery should be performed prior to use of an APCD. Use of closure devices should be avoided if a hematoma has formed during the procedure, or in the presence of severe iliofemoral vascular disease, and when the access site is below the bifurcation of the superficial and profunda femoral arteries.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Chronic warfarin anticoagulation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients receiving chronic anticoagulation with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a>, the risk of excess bleeding (without warfarin discontinuation) needs to be balanced against the risk of thrombus formation and embolization (with short-term discontinuation). In most cases, we withhold warfarin and wait until the International Normalized Ratio (INR) reaches 1.5 before proceeding with catheterization. The following additional comments may help guide the periprocedural use of warfarin:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When the procedure cannot be delayed or for patients at particularly high risk of periprocedural embolic events with temporary <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> therapy discontinuation, such as those with prior embolization off warfarin therapy, a transradial approach may allow for reduced risk of major access-related bleeding in patients with an INR of 1.5 to 3 [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. If a transradial approach is not an option, then careful management of femoral artery hemostasis with manual compression or a closure device may also allow the procedure to be completed safely for INR of 1.5 to 3. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients with an INR &gt;3, administration of fresh frozen plasma prior to arterial sheath removal may be warranted. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The risk of local bleeding in warfarin-treated patients is likely to be greater in those undergoing PCI who are often treated with heparin, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/z/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a>, and a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor. These patients typically have longer intraarterial times and more manipulation of the arterial access site. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1576.html" rel="external">"Antithrombotic therapy for elective percutaneous coronary intervention: General use"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Hematoma formation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hematoma formation is not uncommon in the soft tissue of the upper thigh and the patient should be advised that the development of a large area of ecchymosis is likely. Although most resolve over a period of days, femoral nerve compression can occur, which may take weeks to months to resolve. Patients should be advised to avoid strenuous activity or lifting heavy objects within the first week following arterial catheterization. Surgical repair for a hematoma is generally not required.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Retroperitoneal extension</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If the arterial puncture occurs above the inguinal ligament, a hematoma may extend into the retroperitoneal space, causing hypotension and ipsilateral flank pain. CT scanning or abdominal ultrasonography can help to establish the diagnosis. Treatment is usually conservative, consisting of bed rest and blood transfusion rather than surgical correction. Reversal of systemic anticoagulation may be indicated if bleeding persists or is associated with hemodynamic compromise. If the puncture site is above the inguinal ligament and there is significant retroperitoneal hemorrhage, temporary balloon occlusion or placement of a covered stent may promote hemostasis. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h2">Arteriovenous fistula</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ongoing bleeding from the arterial puncture site may decompress into the adjacent venous puncture site, leading to the formation of an arteriovenous fistula. This complication may be recognized by the presence of a thrill or continuous bruit at the site of catheter insertion.</p><p>Surgical repair is usually necessary, since fistulae tend to enlarge over time. The most common finding at surgery is a puncture site below the common femoral artery, which illustrates the importance of careful technique in avoiding this complication [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h2">Pseudoaneurysm</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If a hematoma remains in continuity with the arterial lumen, a pseudoaneurysm may develop with blood flow into and out of the hematoma cavity during systole and diastole. A pseudoaneurysm is most often recognized by the presence of a pulsatile mass with a systolic bruit over the catheter insertion site; it can be confirmed by duplex ultrasonography. Almost all pseudoaneurysms occur within the first three days after removal of the arterial sheath, and most of the remaining cases by seven days after sheath removal [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p>The main risk factor for pseudoaneurysm formation is an inadequate period of manual compression. This was illustrated in a series of 581 angiographic procedures involving transfemoral arterial catheterization [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. A pseudoaneurysm occurred in 14 percent of the first 300 procedures in which standard manual compression was performed, compared to 1.1 percent of the next 281 procedures when manual compression was continued for at least five minutes after local bleeding had stopped.</p><p>Other risk factors include large bore sheaths, postprocedural anticoagulation, antiplatelet therapy during the intervention, age &gt;65 years, obesity, hypertension, peripheral artery disease, hemodialysis, cannulation of the superficial rather than common femoral artery, and complex interventions [<a href="#rid23">23-25</a>].</p><p>Surgical management should be performed when a pseudoaneurysm occurs at the site of a vascular anastomosis, becomes very large and threatens or causes skin necrosis, is expanding rapidly, occurs spontaneously, as it may be infected, or there is a failure of a minimally invasive procedure [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Expanding hematomas have a propensity towards eventual rupture, especially if the patient is maintained on anticoagulation [<a href="#rid1">1,7,26,27</a>].</p><p>Treatment of smaller pseudoaneurysms may be accomplished with either direct ultrasound-guided compression or with ultrasound-guided local injection of thrombin or collagen into the pseudoaneurysm cavity, which has a higher success rate [<a href="#rid23">23,28-30</a>]. Although an effective approach, ultrasound-guided compression is uncomfortable for both the patient and the person applying compression.</p><p>The success rate of ultrasound-guided injection of bovine thrombin was illustrated in a series of 240 patients with simple or complex pseudoaneurysms [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. The primary success rate was 96 percent with simple pseudoaneurysms and 89 percent with complex pseudoaneurysms. The secondary success rate was 99.6 percent (all but one patient). The authors also reviewed 34 studies with 1388 patients; the overall success rate was 97.2 percent.</p><p>The high success rate of ultrasound-guided injection has made it the treatment of choice for most postcatheterization pseudoaneurysms [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. However, the procedure should not be performed when, as defined above, there is an indication for surgical management.</p><p>In rare cases, pseudoaneurysms less than 2 cm can be managed conservatively and monitored by serial imaging to confirm spontaneous resolution.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h2">Arterial thrombosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Arterial thrombosis is rare and occurs slightly more often when the brachial approach is used [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. Predisposing factors to femoral artery thrombosis include small vessel lumen, peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus, female sex, placement of a large diameter catheter or sheath (eg, intraaortic balloon pump), or a long catheter dwell time [<a href="#rid2">2-7,26,27</a>].</p><p>Patients with lower extremity pain or paresthesia, plus reduced or absent distal pulses not responding to catheter removal, should be evaluated for possible flow obstructing thrombus or dissection. Urgent vascular surgery or thrombectomy may be required for preservation of the limb.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h2">Radial artery access</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Local vascular complications appear to occur less frequently with radial artery access. This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1562.html" rel="external">"Periprocedural complications of percutaneous coronary intervention", section on 'Vascular complications'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15202.html" rel="external">"Access-related complications of percutaneous access for diagnostic or interventional procedures"</a>). The SAFARI-STEMI Trial presented at the American College of Cardiology Conference in March 2019 found that in a contemporary practice, there was no significant difference in mortality or access site complications in patients randomized to femoral versus radial artery intervention. This was driven by improvements in outcomes with femoral access, possibly from use of ultrasound guidance, fluoroscopic landmark assessments, and use of micropuncture techniques.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17"><span class="h3">Is the palmar arch intact?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Radial artery cannulation is associated with a 5 to 19 percent chance of radial artery occlusion [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. This complication is not clinically important in most patients because the hand is perfused by both the radial and ulnar arteries with extensive collateral flow between the two.

The importance of an abnormal test was evaluated in a study of 55 patients undergoing coronary angiography, 20 of whom had an abnormal test [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. After 30 minutes of subsequent radial artery occlusion, the patients with an abnormal test had significantly reduced blood flow to the thumb and an elevated thumb capillary lactate.</p><p>Based upon such observations, radial artery catheterization is usually not performed in patients with an abnormal modified Allen test. A possible exception occurs in patients with an excessive estimated risk from a femoral approach (eg, severe peripheral artery disease, large abdominal aortic aneurysm, morbid obesity) [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p>The results of the modified Allen test can be altered by a number of factors, including overextension of the wrist, skin tension over the ulnar artery, and operator error. As a result, an appreciable number of false positive and false negative results have been reported [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. As an alternative, many centers use a more direct assessment of blood flow to the thumb during radial artery occlusion, which can be accomplished with pulse oximetry and plethysmography [<a href="#rid32">32,34</a>].</p><p>The traditional modified Allen test was compared to pulse oximetry and plethysmography in a consecutive series of 1010 patients referred for diagnostic cardiac catheterization [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. The modified Allen test was considered abnormal if palmar blanching persisted for ≥10 seconds after release of ulnar compression. Plethysmography was observed for two minutes during radial artery compression. Plethysmography was characterized as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A – No change in the amplitude of the pulse tracing during compression</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>B – Reduction in amplitude with compression</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>C – Loss of pulse tracing with initial compression, but recovery of flow during two minutes of compression (signifying development of collateral flow)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>D – Loss of pulse tracing with no recovery</p><p></p><p>Patients in categories A, B, and C were considered to have a patent ulnopalmar arch, and therefore eligible for radial catheterization.</p><p>The modified Allen test was abnormal in significantly more patients than plethysmography (6.3 versus 1.5 percent). The authors concluded that plethysmography more accurately demonstrates the adequacy of the ulnopalmar arch, and that the modified Allen test may unnecessarily exclude some patients from radial artery catheterization. However, the number of patients who underwent radial artery catheterization was not reported, and the value of either test for predicting ischemic complications following radial artery catheterization was not assessed.</p><p>Radial artery occlusion has been reported in 1 to 10 percent of patients [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. Systemic anticoagulation and use of smaller sheaths may reduce the risk. Also, sheath removal using a technique termed “non-occlusive hemostasis” may improve arterial patency. This technique involves using the minimal amount of compression to achieve hemostasis while still maintaining flow through the radial artery. This can be confirmed by using plethysmography to assess pulse amplitude when the ulnar artery is compressed simultaneously with non-occlusive compression of the radial artery. In the PROPHET study, patients were randomly assigned to standard compression versus plethysmography guided hemostasis [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. At one month, the incidence of radial artery occlusion was reduced from 7 to 1.8 percent with guided hemostasis. Similarly, the RACOMAP study demonstrated a 10-fold reduction in radial artery occlusion with arterial pressure guided versus occlusive hemostasis [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18"><span class="h1">ARRHYTHMIAS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A variety of arrhythmias and conduction disturbances can occur during catheterization.

Older adult women appear to be at particular risk.</p><p>Cardiac perforation is generally heralded by bradycardia and hypotension due to vagal stimulation induced by blood in the pericardium. If the patient is hemodynamically stable, echocardiography is suggested to document the presence of blood in the pericardial space. However, emergent pericardiocentesis should be performed via the subxiphoid approach in the presence of hemodynamic instability.</p><p>Since pericardiocentesis is itself associated with complications, it is best performed under echocardiographic guidance or with pressure monitoring.
