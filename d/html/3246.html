         Patients with cervical cancer limited to the cervix and uterus have early-stage disease. Primary treatment options for these patients include hysterectomy (ie, extrafascial, modified radical, radical), fertility-sparing surgery (ie, conization, trachelectomy), or radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy. The choice of therapy depends on tumor and patient factors, as well as available health system resources.
        </p>
        <p>
         The approach to patients with early-stage cervical cancers is reviewed here. Diagnosis of cervical cancer, treatment of more advanced disease, and specific issues regarding the management of cervical adenocarcinomas and small cell cancers are reviewed elsewhere.

         Staging of cervical cancer has changed significantly over time [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3

          table 1
         </a>
         ) except when describing studies where other staging systems were used. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system is shown in the table  (

        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis of cervical cancer is made by histologic evaluation of a cervical biopsy. In resource-limited settings, staging is clinical and based on physical examination, a limited number of endoscopic diagnostic procedures (examination under anesthesia, proctoscopy, cystoscopy, hysteroscopy), and basic imaging studies (chest radiograph and intravenous pyelogram). In resource-abundant settings, staging may additionally be based on an expanded list of imaging studies (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography) and pathologic findings. This is discussed in detail separately. (See

         For most patients with stage IA, IB1, and IB2 cervical cancer, we suggest surgery rather than primary RT; we reserve primary RT (with or without chemotherapy) for patients who are not candidates for primary surgery due to medical comorbidities, poor functional status, or limited health resources. This is based on the likely higher long-term morbidity with primary RT compared with surgery, including:

          Decreased quality of life
         </strong>
         – Quality of life (QOL) may be worse among patients who are treated with RT (with or without chemotherapy), but data are conflicting [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6-8
         </a>
         ]. In a study of 98 patients treated for early-stage cervical cancer by surgery (42 percent) or primary chemoradiation (58 percent), chemoradiation resulted in a higher incidence of bowel dysfunction compared with primary surgery (42 versus 7 percent) during the 5 to 15 years after diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. There were also nonsignificant trends toward higher incidence of urinary incontinence (20 versus 9 percent), sexual dysfunction (35 versus 20 percent), and pelvic pain (30 versus 12 percent, respectively) with chemoradiation. By contrast, in an observational questionnaire survey study including 100 patients with early-stage cervical cancer, more patients treated with surgery (with or without RT) compared with RT alone experienced lower extremity edema (35 versus 6 percent; odds ratio [OR] 8.3, 95% CI 2.3-30.8) or difficulty emptying their bladder (44 versus 8.5 percent; OR 8.4, 95% CI 2.6-27.1 ); one limitation of this study is that the majority (58 percent) of patients undergoing surgery also received RT. QOL issues in cervical cancer survivors are discussed in more detail below. (See

         <strong>
          Ovarian failure
         </strong>
         – Ovarian failure is common after pelvic RT; this is an important consideration given that over 40 percent of patients diagnosed with cervical cancer are under the age of 45. Pelvic RT (with or without concomitant chemotherapy) uniformly results in ovarian failure due to the doses required for curative-intent therapy; if ovarian preservation is felt to be important (eg, avoiding premature menopause, allowing future fertility options), transposition of the ovaries out of the radiation field should be considered. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3294.html" rel="external">
          "Ovarian transposition before pelvic radiation"
         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         By contrast, the ovaries are generally left intact at the time of surgery; however, patients may still be at risk for premature ovarian failure possibly due to impairment of ovarian perfusion. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Type of surgery'
         </a>
         below and

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, limited data suggest that surgery is at least as effective as RT:

         The only randomized trial was conducted in 1997 in 343 patients with stage IB and IIA cervical cancer and found that radical surgery compared with RT had equivalent rates of five-year survival (83 percent for both) and disease-free survival (DFS; 74 percent for both), and comparable recurrence rates (surgery: 25 percent; RT: 26 percent) [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Although severe morbidity was higher in the surgery group, it is not clear that these findings apply to current practice, given that contemporary surgical practices and more modern RT techniques likely result in fewer complications compared with procedures performed over twenty years ago.

         The largest observational study to address this issue was a retrospective study of 4885 patients with stage IB1 to IIA cervical cancer with data from the United States Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry. Surgery was associated with a survival benefit compared with RT alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.41, 95% CI 0.35-0.50) [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. A limitation of this study was that one-half of the patients in the hysterectomy group received adjuvant RT and comparisons were not made between patients treated solely with surgery versus RT.

         Modified radical hysterectomy includes removal of the uterus, cervix, upper one-fourth of the vagina, and parametria. Pelvic lymphadenectomy is performed at the time of modified radical hysterectomy; para-aortic lymphadenectomy is performed if the pelvic nodes are suspicious for metastatic disease. Although data are limited, some centers have replaced lymphadenectomy with sentinel lymph node evaluation. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See

         For patients with IA2 and higher tumors undergoing modified radical or radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer, we recommend laparotomy rather than minimally invasive surgery (MIS; conventional laparoscopy or robotic-assisted laparoscopy). For patients with smaller tumors (ie, stage IA1), however, we suggest MIS, after appropriate counseling of the risks and benefits associated with this technique; some patients with smaller tumors, however, may elect for laparotomy.
        </p>
        <p>
         MIS was employed for cervical cancer procedures starting in the early 2000s based on decreased operative morbidity with minimally invasive techniques. However, use of these minimally invasive approaches decreased after subsequent studies reported mixed oncologic outcomes, with some demonstrating that MIS is inferior compared with laparotomy for cervical cancer [

         A randomized trial included 631 patients with stage IA1 (with lymphovascular invasion), IA2, and IB1 cervical cancer who were assigned to radical hysterectomy using MIS or laparotomy; most patients (92 percent) had stage IB1 disease. Patients in the MIS compared with laparotomy group had similar rates of postoperative adjuvant therapy (29 versus 28 percent, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. The MIS group had a lower rate of DFS at 4.5 years (86 versus 96.5 percent) and lower DFS (91.2 versus 97.1 percent), overall survival (93.8 versus 99 percent), and a higher rate of death from cervical cancer (4.4 versus 0.6 percent) at three years. Approximately 42 percent of trial participants had tumors on final pathology that measured ≥2 cm; however, the authors noted that the trial was underpowered to evaluate outcomes for tumor size &lt;2 cm or other low-risk features (no LVSI, &lt;10 mm depth, no lymph node involvement).

         Similarly, in a meta-analysis of 15 observational studies including almost 9500 patients undergoing radical hysterectomy for stage IA1 to IIA cervical cancer, MIS compared with open surgery was associated with a higher risk of recurrence or death (pooled HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.36-2.15) [

         Patients who are not surgical candidates for treatment due to medical comorbidities or poor functional status should receive primary RT.

         Typically, the whole pelvis is treated to 45 Gy in 25 once-daily fractions of 1.8 Gy. Magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography are useful for radiation treatment planning to evaluate the size and extent of the primary tumor and the presence and extent of parametrial involvement, bladder or rectal invasion, and nodal disease. These regions are boosted with external beam radiation to 50.4 to 63 Gy. Brachytherapy is used to give the final dose to the cervical primary, to a total of 80 (small-volume cervical tumors) to 87 Gy or higher (larger-volume cervical tumors)  (

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         When indicated, computed tomography-based planning should be used to adequately visualize the cervix, rectum, bladder, small bowel, and nodal areas. The inferior border should give a minimum margin of 3 to 4 cm from the tumor, which can be aided by the placement of a marker at the time of simulation  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63554" href="/z/d/graphic/63554.html" rel="external">
          image 2
         </a>
         ). A marker can also be placed clinically in the cervix or if there is vaginal extent, at the most distal edge of the tumor. This will help ensure adequate coverage.
        </p>
        <p>
         The presence of distal vaginal disease into the lower one-third of the vagina places the inguinal lymph nodes at risk and they should be included in the treatment field.

        <p>
         Patients may be treated in prone or supine positions. For the prone position, a "belly board" is used to displace small bowel superiorly from the pelvis and reduce toxicity.

         Adjuvant pelvic radiation therapy (RT) targets the at-risk tissues in the pelvis to eradicate potential occult sites of disease. Traditionally, treatment has been delivered using a four-field technique, which employs equally weighted anteroposterior-posteroanterior (AP-PA) and opposed lateral beams. With conventional two-dimensional (2D) RT, radiation field borders and design were described relative to skeletal anatomy. With the use of three-dimensional (3D) imaging, 3D conformal RT plans should be designed to adequately cover soft tissue regions at risk, including nearby parametrial and vaginal tissue and the pelvic lymph nodes. It is important to consider variations in patient anatomy and postsurgical changes.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is necessary to adequately cover all locoregionally draining lymphatics, which include obturator, internal iliac, presacral, external iliac, and common iliac lymph nodes (and para-aortics if at sufficient risk for disease) through the vessel coalescence at the inferior vena cava, which roughly corresponds to a superior field border at the L4 to L5 disk space. Inferiorly, the field edge should extend 3 to 4 cm below the lowest extent of disease or to the bottom of the obturator foramen. The lateral margin should be set 1.5 to 2 cm lateral to the pelvic brim or at the lateral edge of the planned target volume contours and is designed to give a margin on the pelvic vessels and lymphatics  (

         Evidence suggests that more contemporary RT techniques administered postoperatively, such as IMRT, may achieve similar survival outcomes with an improved toxicity profile [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31-33
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in the phase III PARCER trial, among 300 patients with cervical cancer undergoing postoperative radiation, disease-free survival was similar with image-guided IMRT versus 3D conformal RT (77 versus 81 percent; HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.62-1.71), but three-year cumulative incidence of late toxicity was reduced (28 versus 49 percent; HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.33-0.76) [

Similarly, in a phase III trial of IMRT versus standard therapy for the postoperative treatment of cervical or endometrial carcinoma (TIME-C trial), among 278 patients randomly assigned to either traditional four-field pelvic irradiation or IMRT, IMRT decreased gastrointestinal and urinary toxicity, with a trend for an improvement in quality-of-life scores [

         </a>
         ]. In this trial, among 1048 patients with stage IB to IIA cervical cancer with adverse pathologic factors followed for a median of 56 months, the DFS for sequential chemoradiation versus RT alone was 90 versus 82 percent (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.96), and the five-year risk of cancer death was 92 versus 88 percent, respectively (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35-0.95), after adjustment for lymph node involvement. Sequential RT also improved three-year DFS compared with concurrent chemoradiation (95 versus 85 percent; HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.96). Improvements in DFS and cancer death risk observed with concurrent chemoradiation versus RT were not statistically significant.

         Although these results are promising, we await confirmatory clinical trials prior to recommending sequential chemoradiation, and instead suggest concurrent chemoradiation, given previous evidence of benefit in early-stage cervical cancer.

        <p>
         Among patients who have undergone surgical staging or lymphadenectomy, the number of involved lymph nodes also influences prognosis. In one report, five-year survival rates for patients with one, two, three to four, and five or more positive lymph nodes were 62, 36, 20, and 0 percent, respectively [

        </p>
        <p>
         The importance of LVSI as an independent risk factor is controversial.

         Compared with patients without a history of cervical cancer, cancer survivors did not appear to have issues related to difficulty achieving orgasm. Two studies suggest that orgasmic difficulties do occur but resolve within six months or one year following surgical or RT treatment, respectively.

         Dyspareunia is more common among cervical cancer survivors compared with patients without cervical cancer. Dyspareunia resolves within three months after surgery for cervical cancer, but persists up to two years or longer in patients treated with RT.

         Given the available data, we suggest hormone replacement therapy rather than nonhormonal treatments for patients with cervical cancer who experience bothersome menopausal symptoms (eg, vasomotor symptoms, vaginal dryness, or dyspareunia) as a result of treatment. General principles of the risk and benefits of postmenopausal hormone therapy are discussed separately. (See

         At the time of diagnosis, 1 to 3 percent of patients diagnosed with cervical cancer are pregnant or postpartum. About one-half of these cases are diagnosed prenatally. Decisions regarding timing of treatment of cervical cancer and delivery require careful consideration of the stage of disease, the trimester in which the diagnosis is made, and the preferences of the affected patient regarding the pregnancy.

          Prognosis

         – Stage is the most important prognostic factor, followed by nodal status. Outcomes are worse for patients with involved pelvic or para-aortic nodes  (
