         Management of distal sensory neuropathy involves addressing the patient's fear of amputation, appropriate foot care, and management of pain.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the patients described above, the pain in the lower extremities was nocturnal and the pulses in the feet were intact. There was no history of claudication. These findings are consistent with neuropathic, not ischemic, pain. These findings allow you to reassure the patient that the circulation is intact and that vascular surgery and amputation are not necessary. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5272.html" rel="external">
          "Screening for diabetic polyneuropathy", section on 'Clinical manifestations'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Pharmacologic management of painful diabetic neuropathy is aimed at alleviation of symptoms, so it is important to determine whether the pain interferes with sleep or other activities of daily living. This was true in the patients under consideration. Otherwise, reassurance that the circulation is intact, to the extent possible based on your evaluation, may be sufficient.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are several classes of medications that can alleviate the pain of distal sensory diabetic neuropathy. The choice among effective agents should be determined by the comorbidities or contraindications to these agents. In the 29-year-old woman described above, a tricyclic agent was an appropriate first choice. There was no contraindication to its use and the presence of depression was an additional indication.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the 69-year-old man, the presence of benign prostatic hypertrophy with symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction was a contraindication to the use of a tricyclic agent.

          Pregabalin

         , an effective and easy-to-use agent, was an appropriate first choice.

         The treatment of diabetic neuropathy is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See
