         Actigraphy is a validated method of objectively measuring sleep parameters and average motor activity over a period of days to weeks using a noninvasive accelerometer [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-6
         </a>
         ]. The accelerometer is housed in a small device that is worn like a wristwatch.
        </p>
        <p>
         Actigraphy is more accurate than self-reported sleep duration and, as such, may be more useful than sleep diaries in the assessment of patients with suspected sleep disorders. Because actigraphy is measured in the patient's home environment, it has greater external validity for certain sleep parameters compared with in-laboratory polysomnography.
        </p>
        <p>
         The main uses of actigraphy are to objectively measure sleep-wake cycles in patients with suspected circadian sleep-wake rhythm disorders and to complement self-reported sleep duration and other sleep parameters in patients with a range of sleep disorders, including insufficient sleep syndrome. Actigraphy can also provide useful follow-up information to assess treatment response.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic provides an overview of how actigraphy is used in adults and children with suspected sleep and circadian rhythm disorders and a brief discussion of consumer wearable devices. Clinical features and diagnosis of circadian sleep-wake rhythm disorders and other sleep disorders are presented separately. (See

         Actigraphy devices or actigraphs are relatively easy to use and require very little preparation. Most devices use a rechargeable
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9566" href="/z/d/drug information/9566.html" rel="external">
          lithium
         </a>
         battery that must be charged prior to use. Battery life is influenced by several factors, including the battery type, the epoch length, and special features (eg, light sensor).
        </p>
        <p>
         The device must be programmed prior to use. This typically involves entering patient information, setting the epoch length, and selecting data collection start and end times. The most validated and commonly used epoch lengths are 30 seconds and 1 minute [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].

         Patients should be provided with written instructions on use and care of the actigraph. The device is usually worn on the nondominant wrist. Patients should be informed that the actigraph records movement.
        </p>
        <p>
         An actigraphy log  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113720" href="/z/d/graphic/113720.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ) should be provided along with an explanation about the importance of completing the log daily for the entire monitoring period [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]. Log information improves the accuracy of the data analysis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Measured variables'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         If an event marker will be used, it may be helpful to show the patient a sample of the data obtained by the device, called an actigram  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106126" href="/z/d/graphic/106126.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ); it may also be helpful to show how the event marker shows up on the actigram (eg, wake time, bed time, and nap start and end times).
        </p>
        <p>
         If removed, the actigraphy device should be placed back on the same wrist. Water resistance should be noted and addressed appropriately with the patient. If a light sensor is being used, patients must ensure that clothing does not cover the sensor.

         Actigraphy provides reliable data about sleep in the home environment but does not provide information about sleep architecture or respiration. Actigraphy may have limitations in patients with limited mobility or movement disorders. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Validation and limitations'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In general, actigraphy should be used for two weeks in order to capture both working and nonworking days [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. The recording period should exclude holidays and travel, unless the purpose of using actigraphy is to assist with frequent jet lag (see
         <a class="local">
          'Occupational populations'
         </a>
         below). After the recording period, patients should be asked about any unforeseen events that may have disrupted sleep that were not noted on the actigraphy log (for example, patient or family member illness, acquiring a new pet).

         Actigraphy has been validated in a variety of adult patient populations [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2,5,6
         </a>
         ]. In general, results are most accurate in healthy adults. Even in patients with sleep disorders, which can affect validity of some parameters, actigraphy provides valuable information on sleep-wake patterns, activity, and light exposure. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Validation and limitations'

        <p>
         Actigraphy has been used to evaluate sleep-wake and activity patterns in patients with a broad range of medical and neurologic conditions, including cancer, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and traumatic brain injury. Actigraphy has been used successfully in the home environment as well as in nursing homes and inpatient hospital wards.

         Actigraphy is commonly used in the evaluation of circadian sleep-wake rhythm disturbances related to night shift work or frequent international travel. Polysomnography may not be feasible or necessary in such patients and does not capture the full range of symptoms, which may be most prominent in the occupational setting. Actigraphy can be used to monitor changes in sleep on both workdays and non-workdays, as well as during overseas travel.
        </p>
        <p>
         For suspected shift work disorder, individuals should begin the observational period on the last day of a work shift in order to capture several typical non-workdays as well as the sleep transition back to workday shifts. Shift workers may use different sleep patterns or strategies to switch back and forth from night sleep to day sleep [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. The recording period may need to exceed two weeks for some workers to include a full rotation of shifts. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97846.html" rel="external">
          "Sleep-wake disturbances in shift workers"

         Preparation for children is similar to adults, except that parents and caregivers should be included in the discussion regarding the purpose of the actigraph and its care. Specifically, care instructions should include discussion of whether there are periods of play (eg, playing a contact sport) that might result in a damaged or lost device. For younger children, naps should be noted on the actigraphy log.
        </p>
        <p>
         In infants and children under the age of three years, the actigraph is typically placed on the ankle rather than the nondominant wrist. The majority of validation studies on actigraphy devices and scoring algorithms in young children have been conducted using ankle placement. For children who cannot tolerate wrist or ankle placement (eg, children with autism spectrum disorder), one study has demonstrated the validity of placing the device in a specially designed pocket on the shirt sleeve [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that some settings and scoring algorithms are more accurate in younger populations [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Adolescents may need to wear actigraphy for 14 days or more to best capture variability in sleep schedules (eg, weekdays versus weekends) [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Parents/caregivers should complete an actigraphy log  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113720" href="/z/d/graphic/113720.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ) on behalf of a child, although one study suggested that actigraphy data without a log may still have acceptable accuracy [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Adolescents should complete their own actigraphy log, as parents/caregivers may not be completely aware of the adolescent's behavior.

         Actigraphy is a convenient way to objectively measure disrupted sleep patterns and sleep-wake cycles. Actigraphy measures sleep-wake periods over multiple days and nights in the patient's home environment, which is an advantage over single-night, in-laboratory polysomnography in certain circumstances. Actigraphy is not a replacement for polysomnography when electroencephalography is needed to characterize sleep architecture, sleep stage, or abnormal movements during sleep, or when sleep-related breathing disorders are suspected.

          Circadian sleep-wake rhythm disorders
         </strong>
         – The most common use of actigraphy is in patients with suspected circadian sleep-wake rhythm disorders, such as delayed sleep-wake phase disorder  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106126" href="/z/d/graphic/106126.html" rel="external">
          figure 1

          figure 2
         </a>
         ). In such patients, actigraphy data complements self-reported sleep parameters obtained from sleep logs and provides a necessary substitute for self-reported sleep parameters in patients who cannot reliably complete sleep logs. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97844.html" rel="external">

          Insomnia symptoms

         – Actigraphy is an important tool in the diagnostic evaluation of insomnia symptoms when there is suspicion for a circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder as an alternative diagnosis to chronic insomnia. (See

         <strong>
          Excessive daytime sleepiness
         </strong>
         – Actigraphy can be used to verify adequate sleep prior to conducting a multiple sleep latency test when there are concerns about the reliability of self-reported sleep. Similarly, actigraphy may be used to confirm or rule out insufficient sleep in patients presenting with complaints of excessive daytime sleepiness. (See

         <strong>
          Monitoring response to treatment
         </strong>
         – Follow-up actigraphy can be a very useful way to objectively measure treatment response and enhance patient education. Follow-up data can be particularly useful for patients undergoing cognitive behavioral therapy, for example, as it provides objective feedback on the impact of newly instituted behavioral changes. Patients with a range of sleep habits and sleep disorders can learn to monitor their own sleep and adopt better daily sleep habits by reviewing actigraphy reports with clinicians.

         Although actigraphy has been validated in a variety of populations against a reference standard (eg, polysomnography) in the same population, there are few studies providing normative data for actigraphically-derived sleep variables among healthy control populations. However, actigraphy-derived sleep values should track closely with age-appropriate clinical recommendations for sleep variables, such as sleep duration  (

         A systematic review of 81 studies of actigraphy provided data on a variety of sleep variables and concluded that actigraphy may be a valuable tool in the assessment of sleep characteristics in patients with a variety of sleep disorders, but that there is a need to establish normative data that account for demographic and developmental factors such as age, sex, ethnicity [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>

         Clinically validated actigraphs generally come with software that uses an algorithm to score the motion data as "sleep" or "wake." Some software packages have the ability to make this determination without actigraphy log information; however, we recommend that actigraphy log data be entered as a standard practice, as this data improves the accuracy of the analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Specifically, the software will only score immobility as "sleep" during an interval that has been recorded as "rest" in the actigraphy log. A summary of actigraphy log data in the patient report also provides useful biofeedback to patients, as it allows them to see the difference between when they thought sleep was occurring and when they actually slept.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to "sleep" and "wake," the actigraph and log data measure the following variables:

         – For a given interval of sleep, sleep onset latency is the time elapsed between the beginning of "rest" as noted on the actigraphy log and the beginning of "sleep" as scored by the software algorithm.

        <p>
         Data downloads show the 24-hour time interval on the X axis and sequential days on the Y axis. Motion activity registers as a signal: high signal activity is associated with wakefulness, while the absence of signal activity is associated with sleep  (

         In patients with non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder, actigraphy shows a pattern of sleep and wake times that are delayed each day by a few minutes to as much as an hour daily, depending on the patient's circadian period. For example, if a patient's endogenous circadian period is 24 hours and 20 minutes, the actigram may show a delay in both sleep onset and awakening by approximately 20 minutes daily.

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Actigraphy has been validated in a variety of populations [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3,5,6
         </a>
         ]. Compared with a gold standard of polysomnography, actigraphy is very accurate for identifying periods of sleep but is less accurate for identifying sleep onset and periods of wakefulness during sleep. When actigraphy is compared with polysomnography, its accuracy is approximately 90 percent for total sleep time but only 55 percent for determining the correct sleep stage [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Total sleep time and sleep efficiency tend to be overestimated by actigraphy, primarily because the delineation of sleep onset is difficult. This leads to overestimation of sleep time in situations in which patients lie in bed relatively motionless (eg, patients with insomnia, those who lie in bed watching television, older adults in a nursing home environment). In contrast, actigraphy may underestimate sleep in patients with a movement disorder.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another limitation compared with polysomnography is that actigraphy is not able to identify stages of sleep. (See

         </span>
         A large number of consumer wearable and nearable devices purport to assess sleep-wake periods, total sleep time, and even sleep stages. However, devices may not use an accelerometer validated for identification of sleep-wake periods. In addition, the algorithms used to determine sleep-wake periods are proprietary and often unavailable to clinicians and the public. As such, few devices have been validated for measuring sleep-wake periods.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the data are not entirely consistent, most studies have found that consumer wearable devices overestimate total sleep time and sleep efficiency and underestimate wake after sleep onset compared with polysomnography [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22-27
         </a>
         ]. Nevertheless, technology improves over time, and manufacturers' proprietary algorithms are constantly being updated. Patients are increasingly using these devices and looking to clinicians for guidance about what the data may mean and how to improve their sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some devices use photoplethysmography, a technology that monitors blood flow in tissue over time via flashing green light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that sense heart rate. Blood absorbs green light, and the higher the blood volume, the more green light is absorbed. This absorption amount can be quantified over time to show a "pulse" rate. Some devices use a combination of movement data and heart rate variability data, which fluctuate and correlate with wakefulness and the different sleep stages [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28,29
         </a>
         ]. Manufacturers' applications can integrate the data to display sleep information, including sleep stages. Applications may also include benchmark data for what is considered normal and provide educational material about sleep and ways to improve sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
         All of these data should be interpreted with caution. Devices rely on indirect measures of sleep, have data loss problems, and some devices are more accurate than others. The more advanced devices correlate approximately 70 percent of the time when compared with actigraphy and polysomnography [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. Some devices try to parse out "light sleep" and "deep sleep," although the terms are not standardized and there is little validation on the accuracy of these designations. One small study in healthy adolescents found that a consumer device accurately estimated sleep duration but not staging compared with clinical-grade actigraphy and polysomnography [

         While the devices are not validated and cannot be used for diagnosis or treatment of sleep disorders, patient-generated data may enhance the clinician-patient interaction when reviewed in the context of a clinical evaluation. Use of a device may indicate a patient's commitment to focus on sleep wellness, and the data may provide an opportunity to educate patients about the importance of healthy sleep habits. In some cases, data may point towards the presence of a sleep disorder and prompt formal sleep testing.

         When reviewing wearable device data with patients, we suggest the following approach:

         Review good sleep hygiene when appropriate and suggest that patients monitor the device data in response to behavioral changes. Multiple interruptions in sleep may reflect a sleep disorder or an environmental issue (eg, a dog in the bed waking the patient up). (See

          Definition
         </strong>
         – Actigraphy is a validated and reliable method for measuring sleep phase, duration, daily patterns, and efficiency over multiple days. The actigraphy device contains an accelerometer and is typically worn on the nondominant wrist. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Technique'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Indications for use
         </strong>
         – The most common use of actigraphy is in patients with suspected circadian sleep-wake phase rhythm disorders such as delayed sleep-wake disorder or shift work disorder. Actigraphy is also used to complement self-reported sleep duration and other sleep parameters in patients with a range of suspected sleep disorders and to document response to treatment. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Protocols'
         </a>
         above and

         <strong>
          Measured variables
         </strong>
         – When combined with an actigraphy log  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113720" href="/z/d/graphic/113720.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ), variables assessed by actigraphy include average activity during waking, sleep efficiency, sleep duration, sleep phase (eg, sleep onset, midsleep time, and wakeup time), variability of sleep, and light exposure. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Measured variables'

         <strong>
          Validation
         </strong>
         – Actigraphy has been validated against polysomnography and provides accurate estimates of sleep patterns in a variety of patient populations. Total sleep time and sleep efficiency tend to be overestimated by actigraphy, primarily because the delineation of sleep onset is difficult. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Validation and limitations'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Consumer wearables
         </strong>
         – Data from consumer wearable and nearable devices that assess sleep should be interpreted with caution. Devices rely on indirect measures of sleep, have data loss problems, and some devices are more accurate than others. Consumer devices are not validated to be a screening tool for sleep disorders. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Consumer wearable devices'

         above.)
        </p>

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Nonetheless, patient-generated data may enhance the clinician-patient interaction when reviewed in the context of a clinical evaluation. Use of a device may indicate a patient's commitment to focus on sleep wellness, and the data may provide an opportunity to educate patients about the importance of healthy sleep habits. (See
