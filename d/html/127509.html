Evaluation and management of traumatic liver, pancreas, and splenic injuries in children and bowel injuries associated with rectal foreign bodies are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13899.html" rel="external">"Liver, spleen, and pancreas injury in children with blunt abdominal trauma"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1377.html" rel="external">"Rectal foreign bodies", section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3027272697"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In children, blunt trauma accounts for more than 90 percent of abdominal injuries. Although the incidence of hollow viscus injuries in all blunt trauma patients is &lt;5 percent, these injuries comprise 15 to 20 percent of pediatric intra-abdominal injuries according to large multicenter reviews of children with intra-abdominal trauma [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Small bowel injury, especially to the jejunum or ileum, is the most frequent, followed by duodenal, colon, and gastric injury [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. The most common mechanism for these injuries is direct blunt-force trauma, such as from a motor vehicle collision, sports injury, assault or physical child abuse [<a href="#rid4">4</a>], or fall onto a bicycle handlebar or other object. Seat belts are an important contributor to hollow viscus injuries caused by motor vehicle collisions [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Pertinent anatomy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Mechanism of injury'</a> below.)</p><p>Although infrequent and often subtle at presentation because they do not lead to hemodynamic instability, hollow viscus injuries contribute to significant morbidity and mortality [<a href="#rid3">3,6</a>]. Operation is almost always required for these injuries in contrast to most other abdominal injuries, which are primarily managed nonoperatively. Delayed presentation or diagnosis can lead to intra-abdominal sepsis and death, and even timely operation carries with it significant risk of surgical site infection and intra-abdominal abscess [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H402342163"><span class="h1">PERTINENT ANATOMY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The anatomic location determines the likelihood of injury to specific portions of the gastrointestinal tract:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Small intestine</strong> – The anterior location of the jejunum and ileum puts them at highest risk for hollow viscus injury, especially from a seat belt injury mechanism [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. These injuries are most commonly perforations or mesenteric injuries that are sometimes referred to as "bucket handle" injuries, referring to the portion of intestine that is avulsed from the mesentery [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The duodenum is less commonly injured due to its retroperitoneal location, accounting for under 5 percent of all abdominal injuries; however, duodenal injuries can lead to high morbidity [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Concomitant injuries to the pancreas and vascular structures are common, and risk of leak from any repair is high given the combination of gastric, pancreatic, and biliary secretions; therefore, these injuries remain challenging for the trauma surgeon [<a href="#rid6">6,8</a>]. While duodenal perforation can occur with blunt trauma, including seat belt injury, duodenal hematoma is more common in children. Duodenal perforation can be difficult to diagnose because it is a retroperitoneal organ and peritonitis is less likely to be evident at presentation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Large intestine</strong> – Colonic injuries most commonly occur in the transverse and sigmoid segments, which are not retroperitoneal [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Large cecal or right colon hematomas can occur due to direct blunt trauma. Rectal injuries can also occur due to high-pressure jet streams or penetration of foreign bodies. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1377.html" rel="external">"Rectal foreign bodies"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Stomach</strong> – Gastric injuries are rare following blunt trauma, likely because the stomach is shielded by the rib cage. However, when perforations do occur, they are easy to diagnose because they will present with generalized peritonitis and a large amount of free air on imaging.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3193476690"><span class="h1">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Blunt hollow viscus injuries arise from sudden direct force applied to the abdomen. Common mechanisms include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Improper restraint with a lap seat belt in children younger than eight years of age or &lt;57 inches (145 cm) tall during a motor vehicle collision  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef129325" href="/d/graphic/129325.html" rel="external">image 1</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5,10-12</a>]</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fall from a bicycle or scooter onto the handlebar  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef129324" href="/d/graphic/129324.html" rel="external">image 2</a>) [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other direct blow to the abdomen (eg, sports injury, assault, or horse kick) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]</p><p></p><p>These mechanisms are specific to children because their thinner abdominal wall and lack of peritoneal fat provides less protection to the viscera.</p><p>Rare injuries include unintentional intestinal prolapse and evisceration from unsafe pool drains or rectal perforation caused by high-pressure water streams from a jet ski [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2739819370"><span class="h2">Lap seat belt injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Lap seat belt injury occurs when children are improperly restrained in a motor vehicle collision. The poor fit of a lap seat belt that is used without a properly fitted child safety seat in younger children permits the seat belt to ride up over the pelvis and compress the intra-abdominal contents against the spine during rapid deceleration. This injury pattern occurs most commonly in children between three to nine years of age [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>The "seat belt sign" refers to linear abdominal ecchymoses  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef117444" href="/d/graphic/117444.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>) across the abdomen, below the seat belt. They are strongly and independently associated with significant intra-abdominal injury, including hollow viscus injuries  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef129325" href="/d/graphic/129325.html" rel="external">image 1</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5,10,11</a>]. For example, in a multicenter prospective study from the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) group that analyzed blunt abdominal trauma in over 3700 patients, seat belt sign was present in 16 percent of patients, and hollow viscus injuries were significantly more common in children with a seat belt sign who underwent definitive testing compared with those who did not have a seat belt sign (11 versus 1 percent) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Furthermore, patients with a seat belt sign were more likely to undergo laparotomy than those without a seat belt sign (6 versus 1 percent). Of note, the 11 percent incidence of hollow viscus injury with seat belt sign in this study is lower than the 25 percent incidence reported in prior studies [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. The seat belt sign as an indicator of intra-abdominal injury is discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6553.html" rel="external">"Pediatric blunt abdominal trauma: Initial evaluation and stabilization", section on 'Seat belt sign'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H114945665"><span class="h2">Handlebar injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>During a fall from a bicycle or scooter, the handlebar can strike the abdomen with significant force. Hollow viscus injuries resulting from this mechanism are well described [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. Thus, any child with abdominal pain or abdominal wall bruising associated with a handlebar injury  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef117447" href="/d/graphic/117447.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>) warrants careful evaluation  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef129324" href="/d/graphic/129324.html" rel="external">image 2</a>). Because the initial fall may be viewed as trivial, the patient may occasionally present in a delayed fashion after the injury with anorexia and vomiting [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3014406748"><span class="h2">Direct blow</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Direct blows such as from a horse kick, sports injury, or assault may also cause a hollow viscus injury [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2586793755"><span class="h3">Child abuse</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of a hollow viscus injury in a child with a questionable or absent mechanism of injury is an important red flag for possible abuse, especially in a patient younger than five years of age [<a href="#rid4">4,19,20</a>]. Duodenal hematoma, duodenal perforation, and jejunal injuries are most commonly described. In a observational study of over 19,000 children with non-accidental trauma (child abuse) reported to the United States National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB), hollow viscus injuries accounted for 3 percent of all injuries and 28 percent of abdominal injuries [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Additionally, the presence of a hollow viscus injury in this population was the factor with the highest independent probability of death, probably due to the fact that the majority of these injuries had a delayed presentation for surgical care. In addition, evaluation and treatment of other abusive injuries and involvement of a multidisciplinary child abuse team, whenever available, are essential. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/103420.html" rel="external">"Physical child abuse: Recognition", section on 'Visceral injuries'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6600.html" rel="external">"Physical child abuse: Diagnostic evaluation and management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1536312228"><span class="h2">Pool drain evisceration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Rarely, intestinal prolapse, evisceration or amputation may result from a young child sitting directly on a pool drain [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. This action forms a seal around the drain and centers the negative pressure at the anus. This injury has resulted in intestinal failure and subsequent death from complications of multivisceral transplantation. Modern pool or spa drains have design features, such as a suction cover, that prevent this injury, but older private pools can still pose this hazard.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3624557214"><span class="h2">Hydrostatic rectal injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Rectal perforation can rarely occur from a high-pressure water stream from a jet ski directed into the anal canal [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3318436663"><span class="h1">STABILIZATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Initial evaluation of pediatric trauma patients should follow the standard Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol, with life-threatening injuries that compromise airway, breathing, and circulation addressed first  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64241" href="/d/graphic/64241.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Assessment for abdominal injury should take place as part of the secondary survey. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6571.html" rel="external">"Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child", section on 'Abdomen'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2480412818"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2721313401"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A focused history should identify the mechanism of injury, the presence of abdominal pain, vomiting, and any associated injuries found on the primary and secondary trauma surveys.

Vomiting, including bilious emesis, with an inability to tolerate oral intake is a frequent chief complaint that can arise from occult duodenal injury. If the abused child has a bowel perforation, fever may also be reported. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/103420.html" rel="external">"Physical child abuse: Recognition", section on 'Visceral injuries'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H455067239"><span class="h2">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with hollow viscus injury may have tachycardia, poor perfusion, and/or hypotension due to associated hemorrhage, sepsis, or both.

Free intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal air (even a few bubbles) confirms the diagnosis of hollow viscus perforation  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef129325" href="/d/graphic/129325.html" rel="external">image 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef129324" href="/d/graphic/129324.html" rel="external">image 2</a>). However, the initial CT frequently may be normal or have minimal findings. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6553.html" rel="external">"Pediatric blunt abdominal trauma: Initial evaluation and stabilization", section on 'Abdominal and pelvic CT'</a>.)</p><p>Initial CT is typically diagnostic in patients with gastric perforations because pneumoperitoneum and peritonitis develop soon after injury. By contrast, findings of bowel perforation take more time to develop and are often subtle soon after injury because pneumoperitoneum or free fluid caused by leakage of bile or stool may not be apparent [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In addition, injuries of retroperitoneal structures such as the duodenum and posterior ascending and descending colon can be even more difficult to diagnose during initial CT evaluation because they do not cause peritonitis.</p><p>Suggestive signs of bowel injury on CT include bowel wall thickening, mesenteric abnormality, irregular contrast bowel enhancement, and free fluid without solid organ injury [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]; but these findings, in isolation, are not diagnostic.</p><p>Bedside focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) has a limited role in patients with hollow viscus injury. Children with blunt abdominal trauma and intraperitoneal fluid on FAST who are too unstable to undergo CT of the abdomen typically warrant operative intervention in lieu of CT because the reason for instability is likely due to bleeding. Children with hollow viscus injury and sepsis who present many hours after injury may have free fluid, but since bleeding is unlikely, stabilization with fluid resuscitation and definitive imaging prior to operative repair is a safer approach.</p><p>The role of FAST for other intra-abdominal injuries is discussed separately.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6571.html" rel="external">"Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child", section on 'Fluid resuscitation'</a>.)</p><p>For stable patients with isolated hollow viscus injury, laparoscopy or traditional exploratory laparotomy may be used for the initial operative management of patients.</p><p>Exploratory laparoscopy is supported by a retrospective National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) study demonstrating fewer complications, lower mortality, shorter hospitalizations, and no increase in missed traumatic injuries for patients undergoing exploratory laparoscopy and repair for intra-abdominal injuries compared with laparotomy [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. However, patients undergoing laparoscopic repair had lower injury severity. If exploratory laparoscopy is used, any hollow viscus injuries that are seen can either be repaired laparoscopically, or the location and extent of the injury can be identified, which may limit the length of the open incision. With either the laparoscopic or open approach, a thorough abdominal evaluation should be performed.</p><p>The intraoperative management depends upon the type of injury, anatomic location, and severity:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lacerations of the stomach or small intestines</strong> – Small gastric or intestinal lacerations can be repaired primarily as long as the tissue appears well perfused. Larger injuries often require resection, which may be performed using a stapled wedge resection for gastric injury or a segmental intestinal resection [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Care must be taken to avoid narrowing of the lumen and to ensure that all devitalized tissue is resected.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Duodenal perforations are the most complex to manage because of the high risk of leakage caused by the high volume of gastric, pancreatic, and biliary fluid that passes through the duodenum daily. Small duodenal injuries may be managed with primary repair following debridement of devitalized tissue in a transverse fashion to avoid narrowing the duodenal lumen. It is vital that the duodenum is thoroughly mobilized (a full Kocher maneuver) in order to evaluate the posterior wall.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For duodenal injuries that disrupt more than 50 percent of the circumference (American Association for the Surgery of Trauma [AAST] grade III and higher [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]), options include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>End-to-end duodenostomy</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Tension-free, Roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Billroth II (antrectomy and gastrojejunostomy)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If these repairs are tenuous, or the patient is at high risk for dehiscence, then they can be protected with a pyloric exclusion to avoid gastric fluid from bathing the fresh anastomosis [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. A small observational study suggests that pyloric exclusion may not be necessary to assure good outcomes and may prolong hospitalization [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. However, more evidence is needed to determine the optimal approach. For unstable patients, placement of a tube duodenostomy within the defect that is externalized through the skin until the patient is stable enough for formal repair provides a "damage control" option [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Combined duodenal-pancreatic head injuries (rare in children) may end up requiring a pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure). However, this procedure is not recommended until the patient is stable; damage control options should be considered until the patient is stable enough for formal reconstruction [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>"Bucket handle" mesenteric injuries</strong> – Mesenteric injuries that lead to a "bucket handle" segment of devascularization of the associated intestine also require intestinal resection. If these injuries are not addressed, then they can lead to bowel stricture, and children will present a few weeks after injury with a bowel obstruction [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Injuries to the colon or rectum</strong> – Injuries to the colon or intraperitoneal rectum historically required diversion with a colostomy, but primary repair or segmental resection and anastomosis may be an option, even if there is stool contamination [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. For example, in a retrospective review from the NTDB of over 500 pediatric patients who received colostomies for colorectal trauma, diversion colostomies were associated with similar complication incidence, but longer hospital stays, compared with children undergoing primary anastomosis [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].

Potential antibiotic regimens include <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9775" href="/d/drug information/9775.html" rel="external">piperacillin</a> with tazobactam or <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13126" href="/d/drug information/13126.html" rel="external">cefepime</a> and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12606" href="/d/drug information/12606.html" rel="external">metronidazole</a>. IV fluid resuscitation should be initiated, as needed (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6389.html" rel="external">"Hypovolemic shock in children in resource-abundant settings: Initial evaluation and management"</a>), and the patient should be taken to the operating room as soon as possible. (See <a class="local">'Pneumoperitoneum or peritonitis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Awaiting clear manifestations of peritonitis may take up to 24 hours in stable patients with blunt intestinal injury. This delay in operation has raised concern for increasing the risk of morbidity and mortality from abdominal sepsis. This problem is highlighted in abused children with hollow viscus injuries, who always have a delayed presentation and have a 2.3 times increased risk of mortality compared with children that are not abused [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">However, limited evidence and our experience suggest that observation versus early surgery in stable children with possible hollow viscus injury is safe. For example, in a retrospective, observational, multicenter study of over 200 United States children with blunt intestinal injury, all deaths occurred in children undergoing operation within 12 hours and were associated with high injury severity scores [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Early and late complications were similar regardless of the time to surgery. However, over 90 percent of patients underwent surgery within 24 hours. Thus, evidence is limited regarding clinical outcomes in stable children with blunt intestinal injury who undergo surgery beyond 24 hours.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In adults, the Bowel Injury Prediction Score (BIPS), which includes a new computed tomography (CT) grading scale for mesenteric injury, has been proposed to increase the sensitivity of CT findings and aid in earlier diagnosis of blunt bowel and mesenteric injury [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. However, it requires further study, especially in pediatric patients. When adapted in a single-center retrospective study of patients with surgically proven bowel injury that included teenagers older than 14 years, the BIPS score only identified 56 percent of patients, and 9 percent of patients had completely normal CT at presentation. Additionally, free air, bowel wall thickening, hypoenhancement or discontinuity, or contrast extravasation were not commonly identified on initial CT [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Persistent symptoms but no clear findings of perforation</strong> – When the patient persists with concerning physical findings, repeat CT imaging is warranted. If radiographic findings are suggestive but not diagnostic, then diagnostic laparoscopy is an option to clarify the injury and intervention:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If a bowel perforation or bucket handle injury is identified on laparoscopy, then the operation may sometimes be completed using laparoscopic techniques, or, if laparotomy is necessary, then a smaller incision may be made to address the injury in an open fashion because the rest of the abdomen was already evaluated during laparoscopy. Smaller incisions generally lead to less pain and fewer associated complications. (See <a class="local">'Pneumoperitoneum or peritonitis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients with peritonitis caused by hemorrhage without perforation may not require open surgery or bowel resection if the bleeding is from the mesentery or a stable hematoma. Thus, laparoscopy avoids laparotomy for these patients. (See <a class="local">'Duodenal hematoma'</a> below and <a class="local">'Extraduodenal intestinal hematomas'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient improves</strong> – If no further signs or symptoms of hollow viscus injury develop by 12 hours, then oral intake can be started, and the patient can be discharged by 24 hours if they continue to tolerate advancing oral intake and remain stable with improvement or resolution of their signs and symptoms.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Observation of patients with equivocal findings after blunt abdominal trauma avoids unnecessary operation. In particular, early surgical intervention is <strong>not</strong> indicated in children with blunt abdominal trauma and isolated free intraperitoneal fluid on CT but no peritonitis on initial physical examination because the likelihood of hollow viscus injury appears to be low. For example, in a case series of 94 pediatric patients who had isolated free fluid on initial CT, only two (2.1 percent) had hollow viscus injuries, both of whom developed peritonitis after admission [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3449642372"><span class="h2">Duodenal hematoma</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with duodenal hematoma, nonoperative treatment is generally sufficient as long as there is no associated perforation. These patients initially have gastric outlet obstruction, which can be managed with nasogastric decompression and parenteral nutrition or feeding via a nasojejunal tube. The hematoma may take days to weeks to resolve [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]; however, given the high morbidity associated with duodenal surgery, this is an acceptable recovery time.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2144538614"><span class="h2">Extraduodenal intestinal hematomas</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Intestinal hematomas in sites other than the duodenum are rare in children with blunt abdominal trauma. With the exception of intramural cecal hematomas, they are managed similar to duodenal hematomas. However, because the thin wall of the cecum is associated with pressure necrosis and perforation, early surgical resection of intramural cecal hematomas may be warranted [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Otherwise, our experience suggests that colonic necrosis and perforation may occur, even in asymptomatic patients.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H239454965"><span class="h2">Suspected child abuse</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In addition to management as described above, children with hollow viscus injuries who have an implausible or absent history of trauma or have other signs suggestive of child abuse  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119441" href="/d/graphic/119441.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) warrant additional evaluation in consultation with a multidisciplinary child abuse team.

Child abuse is associated with an increased risk of death due to hollow viscus injury; this finding is likely explained by delayed presentation, which results in a higher likelihood of microbial contamination of the abdomen with postoperative sepsis [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p>Abscesses can generally be managed with percutaneous drainage and antibiotics. However, if there is a clear anastomotic breakdown or the patient develops sepsis, then reoperation with thorough abdominal washout and proximal diversion of the stool stream is of utmost importance for source control. Wound infections occur due to bacterial contamination during the operation, ongoing gastrointestinal leakage, or communication with intra-abdominal abscess and rarely result in a fistula. These are managed by partial or complete skin opening to permit passive drainage.</p><p>Finally, any abdominal operation carries a lifelong risk factor for future adhesive small bowel obstruction, although the risk appears to be low (2 to 4 percent) [<a href="#rid22">22,34</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2848430062"><span class="h1">FOLLOW-UP</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Because delayed complications are rare, children with hollow viscus injury who recover well after surgery and demonstrate full return of bowel function and clearance of infection typically need one or two follow-up visits with the surgeon.</p><p>If children are discharged after observation without evidence of hollow viscus injury, a single follow-up visit at two weeks, either by the pediatrician or trauma surgeon, is generally adequate to ensure that there is no delayed complication of intestinal obstruction from stricture due to either mesenteric bucket handle injury or partial bowel ischemia.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1961382371"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Initial evaluation of pediatric trauma patients with possible hollow viscus injury should follow the standard Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol, which prioritizes treatment of immediate life-threatening injuries that compromise airway, breathing, and circulation  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64241" href="/d/graphic/64241.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).
