The goal of management is to prevent possible progression to cancer while avoiding overtreatment since lesions can spontaneously regress and treatment can have morbid effects.</p><p>The initial approach to management of patients with CIN is reviewed here. This approach is derived from the 2019 consensus guidelines of the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) in collaboration with multiple professional societies and government organizations in the United States and Canada, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology, the American Cancer Society, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Cancer Institute.

There are two general approaches:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Close observation with human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, cervical cytology, and/or colposcopy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Treatment with excision or ablation of the cervical transformation zone, which is the anatomic area containing the transition from the squamous epithelium of the ectocervix to the glandular epithelium of the endocervix and specialized cells that are thought to be susceptible to HPV infection and transformation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3216.html" rel="external">"Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Terminology, incidence, pathogenesis, and prevention"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Hysterectomy is occasionally performed instead of excision or ablation but is unacceptable as a primary treatment for CIN in most instances. Medical therapies have also been described. (See <a class="local">'Investigational therapies'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>A patient's risk for progression to cancer is related in large part to their age and CIN grade:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Age</strong> – Patients younger than 25 years have a lower risk of developing cervical cancer than patients 25 years and older [<a href="#rid3">3-6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>CIN grade</strong> – CIN 1 is a low-grade lesion that has a low potential for progression to malignancy and a high potential for regression [<a href="#rid7">7</a>], while CIN 2,3 is a high grade lesion that has a higher potential for progression and a lower potential for regression [<a href="#rid8">8-14</a>].</p><p></p><p>Thus, observation is the preferred approach for most younger patients and those with CIN 1. Because some CIN 2 lesions will regress, observation is also an option for some patients with CIN 2, such as those who plan future childbearing and are concerned about the potential adverse obstetric outcomes (eg, preterm delivery) that have been associated with treatment of CIN. CIN 3, however, is a direct precursor to cervical cancer, and treatment is always recommended in these cases.</p><p>Although age and CIN grade are predictive of risk for progression to cancer, other factors also affect this risk. These factors include the patient's HPV and cytology results preceding the diagnosis of CIN. For this reason, the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology's recommendations for management of CIN also take these factors into account in determining an patient's risk for progression and in formulating a plan for observation versus treatment [<a href="#rid2">2,15,16</a>]. These risk estimates were derived from a cohort study of over 1.5 million patients followed for more than a decade [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>Unlike age and CIN grade, HPV vaccination status does <strong>not</strong> affect our approach and patients are managed similarly irrespective of HPV vaccination status [<a href="#rid15">15,17</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H84969301"><span class="h2">Evidence</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Effect of age</strong> – The low risk of cervical cancer in young patients is supported by data from the United States (1999 to 2008) showing that the annual incidence of cervical cancer at ages 20 to 24 years and 25 to 39 years was 1.4 per 100,000 females and 5.9 to 14.2 per 100,000 females, respectively [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although virtually all cases of CIN and cervical cancer are attributable to HPV infection and the rate of HPV infection is high in younger patient populations, the infection and associated cervical intraepithelial lesions often regress spontaneously in this population [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>]. As an example, in a cohort study of 2065 patients 18 to 29 years of age, 61 percent of patients with a newly diagnosed, high-risk HPV infection cleared the infection at 12 months of follow-up [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Natural history of CIN 1</strong> – The natural history of CIN 1 was shown in the following retrospective study of 680 patients (mean age 29.2 years) with biopsy-proven CIN 1 [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>At six months, 49 percent regressed to negative, 35 percent had persistent CIN 1, and 7 percent had high-grade lesions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Among patients with negative results at 6 months and followed to 12 months, 80 percent remained negative, 16 percent had low-grade lesions, and 4 percent had high-grade lesions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Among patients with persistent CIN 1 at 6 months and followed to 12 months, 50 percent regressed to negative, 46 percent had low-grade lesions, and 4 percent had high-grade lesions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Natural history of CIN 2,3</strong> – Data on the natural history of untreated high-grade disease (CIN 2,3) are limited since most patients are treated.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For CIN 3, the estimated spontaneous regression rate is 32 to 47 percent, with 12 to 40 percent progressing to invasive cancer if untreated [<a href="#rid8">8-13</a>]. The best data on the natural history of histologically confirmed CIN 3 are from an historic study that evaluated the incidence of invasive cancer over time in two groups of patients with CIN 3 (not all patients with CIN 3 received treatment): 143 patients received close follow-up but no treatment, and 593 patients received adequate or probably adequate treatment [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The cumulative incidence of invasive cancer of the cervix/vaginal vault was significantly higher in untreated patients at 10 years (20.0 versus 0.3 percent) and 30 years (31.0 versus 0.7 percent). Ninety-two of the 143 patients who were managed with close follow-up but no treatment had cytologic evidence of persistent disease 6 to 24 months after the initial diagnosis of CIN 3. In this subgroup, the cumulative incidence of invasive cancer of the cervix/vaginal vault at 10 and 30 years was 31 and 50 percent, respectively. Given the high rate of progression to invasive cancer, prolonged follow-up of persistent CIN is no longer recommended.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For CIN 2, it appears that at least one-half of patients will have regression if left untreated [<a href="#rid14">14,18,19</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 36 studies (both randomized trials and observational studies) including 3160 patients with CIN 2, at 24 months, lesions regressed in 50 percent of patients, persisted in 32 percent, and progressed to CIN 3+ in 18 percent [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The rate of progression increased with time, from 5 percent at 3 months to 24 percent at 36 months; this result is expected as most patients regress and those remaining are likely at a higher risk of progression. Progression rates were lower in patients with negative HPV testing at baseline; however, this was based on few data since HPV status was not reported in most studies and most patients regressed at 24 months regardless of initial HPV status. There were 15 cases of adenocarcinoma in situ and 15 cases of invasive cervical cancer (2 of these were advanced-stage disease). In a subsequent retrospective study including over 27,500 patients with a new diagnosis of CIN 2 managed with either surveillance or excision, 104 patients developed cervical cancer during the 20-year follow-up period [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. The cumulative risk of cancer at 20 years was higher in patients undergoing surveillance compared with excision (2.75 and 0.89 percent, respectively). Rates remained higher when the analysis was adjusted for subsequent excision for persistent or progressive disease in the surveillance group.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">One explanation for the lower rate of progression of CIN 2 compared with CIN 3 is that CIN 2 is more likely to be caused by oncogenic HPV subtypes 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, and 58, which have a weaker association with development of cancer than the more highly oncogenic subtypes HPV 16 and 18, which are commonly found with CIN 3 [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS ≥25 YEARS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1065225504"><span class="h2">CIN 1</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2334945047"><span class="h3">Preceded by LSIL or less</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with CIN 1 preceded by low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), or cytology that is negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (NILM) but positive for human papillomavirus (HPV) are at low risk for the development of cervical cancer, and observation is therefore recommended [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>In a cohort study in which over 100,000 patients had colposcopic biopsies demonstrating CIN 1 and were followed for a decade, the risk of developing CIN 3+ when preceding cytology was LSIL or less was [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>For LSIL, HPV-positive</strong> – One- and five-year risks were 0.7 and 2.3 percent, respectively.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>For ASC-US, HPV-positive</strong> – One- and five-year risks were 0.5 and 2.6 percent, respectively.

In these patients, the concern is that an underlying high-grade lesion has been missed by colposcopy and biopsy. In the cohort study described above, in which over 100,000 patients had colposcopic biopsies demonstrating CIN 1 and were followed for a decade, the risk of developing CIN 3+ when preceding cytology was ASC-H or HSIL was [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>For ASC-H</strong> – One- and five-year risks were 1.4 and 5.6 percent, respectively.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>For HSIL</strong> – One- and five-year risks were 3.9 and 6.5 percent, respectively.</p><p></p><p>Given these data, patients with a history of HSIL cytology are managed more aggressively than patients with a history of ASC-H [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].

Follow-up for these patients is with HPV testing in one year  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef127910" href="/d/graphic/127910.html" rel="external">algorithm 3</a>). However, treatment rather than observation may be reasonable in some patients (eg, patients in whom long-term follow-up may be difficult, patients who have completed childbearing and are not concerned about future obstetric complications).

For most patients, we suggest treatment rather than observation (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). However, for patients who desire future childbearing and are more concerned about the potential adverse obstetric outcomes (eg, preterm delivery) after an excisional procedure than risk of progression to cervical cancer, observation is a reasonable option  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef127905" href="/d/graphic/127905.html" rel="external">algorithm 5</a>).

CIN 3 is a direct precursor to cervical cancer; without treatment, up to 40 percent of patients will progress to cervical cancer. With treatment, this risk is essentially eliminated. The choice between excision or ablation is discussed in detail separately. (See <a class="local">'CIN 2,3'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/89208.html" rel="external">"Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Choosing excision versus ablation, and prognosis and follow-up after treatment", section on 'Factors to consider in choosing excision versus ablation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Patients &lt;25 years</strong> – For most patients &lt;25 years with:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>CIN 1 and preceding lesions that are ASC-US, LSIL, ASC-H, or HSIL, we recommend observation rather than treatment (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). In young patients, transient HPV infection is common, and the risk of progression to cancer is low for these lesions; treatment, however, is associated with potential adverse obstetric outcomes (eg, preterm delivery). Follow-up for these patients depends on the preceding cytology. For ASC-US and LSIL, repeat cytology is performed in one year  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef127914" href="/d/graphic/127914.html" rel="external">algorithm 6</a>); for ASC-H, repeat cytology is performed in one and two years  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef127910" href="/d/graphic/127910.html" rel="external">algorithm 3</a>); and for HSIL, colposcopy and cytology are performed in one and two years  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef127907" href="/d/graphic/127907.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>).

In young patients, approximately 60 percent of these lesions will regress by 24 months, and the risk of progression to cervical cancer is lower than the risk of potential future adverse obstetric outcomes (eg, preterm delivery). Follow-up initially consists of cytology and colposcopy at 6 and 12 months.

Pregnant patients with CIN 2 and 3 in whom invasive cervical cancer is not suspected can be observed with colposcopy and cytology every 12 to 24 weeks during pregnancy, or evaluation can be deferred until postpartum. A biopsy is repeated if the appearance of the lesion worsens or if cytology suggests invasive disease. Endocervical sampling with a curette and endometrial sampling are <strong>not</strong> performed. Treatment is performed only if invasive disease is suspected. (See <a class="local">'Pregnant patients'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>HPV vaccination</strong> – For patients who are candidates for HPV vaccination, a history of cervical dysplasia or genital warts is not a contraindication to vaccination. While vaccination does not have a therapeutic effect on preexisting HPV infection or cervical neoplasia, HPV vaccination is associated with a lower rate of CIN recurrence. In our practice, for patients who have not previously received the HPV vaccination series, we offer vaccination as part of their management course.
