A <strong>local recurrence</strong> is defined as reappearance of cancer in the ipsilateral preserved breast, if BCT was initially undertaken, or in the chest wall, if mastectomy was performed. As many patients have reconstruction following mastectomy, a chest wall recurrence may appear above or below implants or within autologous tissue. In contrast, a <strong>regional recurrence</strong> denotes tumor involving the ipsilateral regional lymph nodes, usually the ipsilateral axillary or supraclavicular, and less commonly the infraclavicular and/or internal mammary. The term <strong>locoregional recurrence</strong> is used to indicate a recurrence in either the ipsilateral breast, chest wall, and/or regional nodal basin.</p><p>The primary management of breast cancer has changed considerably over the past decade, and this may alter the incidence, presentation, and management of locoregional recurrences. With advances in systemic adjuvant therapy that have led to better survival rates [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], recurrences are less frequent and are sometimes delayed for several years. Furthermore, the use of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy rather than axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) as a method of staging the axilla may not only impact the incidence of regional recurrence but has also altered the approach to the patient with an isolated locoregional recurrence. </p><p>Aggressive multimodality treatment has the potential to provide long-term disease control for many patients who develop an isolated locoregional recurrence. Multidisciplinary evaluation and management of these cases appears to improve patient outcome and overall satisfaction [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>The management of a locoregional recurrence after mastectomy or BCT for operable breast cancer will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of recurrent breast cancer are discussed in another topic. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128420.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and evaluation of locoregional recurrences of breast cancer"</a>.)</p><p>Systemic therapy for locoregionally recurrent breast cancer is discussed in another topic.

In such patients, radiation alone generally cannot control the gross disease. As such, presentation at a multidisciplinary tumor board is recommended for many patients with locoregional recurrence. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128972.html" rel="external">"Systemic therapy for locoregionally recurrent breast cancer", section on 'Timing of treatment'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Radiation, when indicated, is performed after surgery when surgery is feasible and may occur after adjuvant chemotherapy. Decisions on whom should receive radiation are discussed in the sections below.

In patients who have had prior breast reconstruction, this may require removal of implants or takedown of autologous reconstruction. Even with complete resection, repeat chest wall recurrences are common (eg, 20 percent [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]), particularly in the absence of adjuvant chest wall radiation. Indications for radiation following resection of chest wall recurrences are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Radiation'</a> below.)</p><p>In cases where resection may be facilitated by downstaging the locally recurrent disease, initial treatment with systemic therapy is preferable. Unfortunately, there may be cases where the patient is not a candidate for systemic therapy or the tumor fails to decrease in size. In these cases, more extensive surgery may be indicated. Often, skin grafts or rotational flaps may be necessary after complete excision [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In rare cases, chest wall resection may be necessary to obtain negative margins [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1164902713"><span class="h2">Adjuvant treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The approach to adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) depends on whether initial postmastectomy RT was administered (after the initial diagnosis of breast cancer). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3812883996"><span class="h3">Systemic therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Adjuvant systemic treatment is discussed elsewhere.

Outcomes from several retrospective series in which the majority of patients underwent excision followed by RT are available [<a href="#rid6">6-16</a>]. We also extrapolate from favorable local control outcomes in the setting of newly diagnosed breast cancer, in which postmastectomy radiation for high-risk disease has shown both overall and disease-free survival benefits.</p><p>Optimal RT management generally involves treatment to the entire chest wall and draining lymph node areas, even if the recurrence is localized to a small area of the chest wall. Limited treatment of the chest wall increases the risk for future rerecurrences in the chest wall as well as supraclavicular and axillary regions [<a href="#rid9">9,13,17,18</a>]. The RT techniques usually employed are similar to those used for newly diagnosed breast cancer. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/789.html" rel="external">"Radiation therapy techniques for newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer", section on 'Whole-breast RT'</a>.) </p><p>In general, long-term local control is achieved in 42 to 86 percent of patients, and the 5 and 10 year overall survival rates range from 35 to 82 and 26 to 62 percent, respectively. Unfortunately, only about one-third of treated patients remain free from distant metastases at five years.</p><p>The approach to nodal irradiation is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Adjuvant nodal irradiation'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3465138419"><span class="h4">Select patients with previous RT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients who recur in the chest wall after a course of initial postmastectomy chest wall RT, full-dose reirradiation of the chest wall is generally not considered, because of concerns for long-term toxicity. Decisions regarding limited reirradiation are dependent on the features of each individual case. Our approach is as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients at low risk for additional local recurrence</strong> – Surgery alone may be an option in some patients in whom complete excision is expected. Acceptable results have been reported with more extensive surgery (very wide local excision of skin and subcutaneous tissue with partial or full-thickness chest wall resection) without RT in highly selected patients [<a href="#rid19">19-21</a>]. The likelihood of local control after surgery alone is highest when the recurrence pattern is a single nodule rather than multiple nodules, when surgical margins are negative, and for patients whose relapse-free interval is longer than two years [<a href="#rid22">22-26</a>]. Additionally, location of recurrence is a consideration; for example, patients with chest wall recurrence are more likely to undergo limited reirradiation compared with those with recurrences in the supraclavicular area, due to concerns for treatment-related brachial plexopathy in the latter group.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patients at high risk for additional local recurrence</strong> – For patients who remain at high risk of local recurrence (eg, those who have an incomplete excision, with or without neoadjuvant systemic therapy), retreatment of at least limited volumes with decreased total radiation doses are often offered, in order to maximize the opportunity for local control; whether survival is impacted is unclear. In general, if reirradiation is undertaken, we try to limit the dose to critical structures, including the brachial plexus, sometimes using a more superficial type of beam (eg, electrons) or twice-a-day irradiation (hyperfractionated RT) to reduce the significant risk of late side effects. The risk/benefit ratio in these situations must be individualized, taking into account the risk of additional recurrence, location of recurrence (and risk of retreatment), systemic options available, and time from the initial treatment.</p><p></p><p>The following represents the range of findings:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>One multi-institutional retrospective review of 81 patients who underwent reirradiation of the breast or chest wall (median reirradiation dose 48 Gy) for locally recurrent breast cancer reported an overall complete response rate of 57 percent at a median follow-up of 12 months (range 1 to 44) from the second radiation course [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. At reirradiation, 80 percent received standard 1.8 to 2.0 Gy daily treatments, 20 percent received twice-daily RT, 54 percent were treated with concurrent hyperthermia, and 54 percent received concurrent chemotherapy. The one-year local disease-free survival rate was significantly higher for patients without gross disease at the time of reirradiation (100 versus 53 percent). Reirradiation was well tolerated as only four patients developed late grade 3 or 4 toxicity. Of 25 patients who had follow-up exceeding 20 months, no late grade 3 or 4 toxicities were noted.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Local control rates of approximately 70 percent at one year have been noted in other small series of patients with a previously irradiated chest wall who were treated with limited irradiation fields to only the site of recurrent disease [<a href="#rid18">18,27,28</a>]. In general, treatment-related morbidity has been acceptable and limited to dry and/or moist desquamation with no evidence of soft tissue necrosis.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2480951897"><span class="h1">MANAGEMENT OF IN-BREAST RECURRENCE FOLLOWING BCT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many patients who develop an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) without distant disease have long-term and durable responses to local (surgical and/or radiation therapy [RT]) and systemic therapy. The optimal management of IBTR depends upon the management of the initial primary breast cancer (with or without RT), the overall medical condition of the patient, and the specific characteristics of the recurrence. </p><p>For patients who develop an IBTR, it is important to distinguish between a true recurrence and a new primary tumor, if possible, as it may have implications on the choice of treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128420.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and evaluation of locoregional recurrences of breast cancer", section on 'Distinguishing a new primary from a recurrence'</a>.)</p><p>While a mastectomy is the surgical standard of care for most patients with a local recurrence following breast-conserving therapy (BCT), repeat breast excision may be feasible for select patients who request breast conservation [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Preferred approach: Mastectomy'</a> below.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3478867292"><span class="h2">Preferred approach: Mastectomy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The standard approach for an IBTR after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and RT is mastectomy, provided there is no evidence of distant metastatic disease. However, repeat BCT may be offered to a select group of patients, as discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Repeat BCT as an alternative for select patients'</a> below.)</p><p>Most series report an operability rate of approximately 85 percent; reasons for nonoperability include simultaneous distant metastases, locally extensive recurrences, or inoperable regional nodal disease [<a href="#rid30">30-33</a>]. Systemic therapy may be used prior to surgery to improve operability. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128972.html" rel="external">"Systemic therapy for locoregionally recurrent breast cancer"</a>.) </p><p>Patients with skin involvement or an inflammatory type of recurrence have a poor prognosis [<a href="#rid31">31,34</a>]. These individuals, as well as those with locally fixed or large tumors, are usually treated with systemic therapy prior to locoregional therapy [<a href="#rid35">35-37</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128972.html" rel="external">"Systemic therapy for locoregionally recurrent breast cancer", section on 'Timing of treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Following a mastectomy for locoregional recurrence, the locoregional control rate (defined as the absence of further recurrence of breast or chest wall) ranges from approximately 50 to 95 percent [<a href="#rid29">29,30,38-48</a>]. Many patients with an isolated local recurrence treated with a subsequent mastectomy will survive at least 10 years; however, isolated local recurrence can be a harbinger of distant disease and early breast-cancer-related death [<a href="#rid49">49,50</a>]. Contemporary studies report that 10 year overall survival rates range from approximately 40 to 80 percent [<a href="#rid29">29,38,40,45,46,51-53</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H529082995"><span class="h3">Is there a role for chest wall radiation?</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are no data that address the benefit of chest wall radiation at the time of mastectomy performed for recurrent disease. </p><p>In women who initially were treated with lumpectomy and whole breast radiation and then had a mastectomy at the time of recurrence, reirradiation may rarely be offered, if very-high-risk features are present (eg, T3, multiple involved lymph nodes or lymph node with extracapsular extension, positive margins, skin involvement), particularly to those with a long time interval from the prior radiation. By contrast, chest wall radiation is offered more commonly to women who undergo mastectomy for a recurrence of a cancer that was not initially treated with radiation. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3472390607"><span class="h2">Repeat BCT as an alternative for select patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Repeat lumpectomy with or without breast radiation is an alternative to mastectomy for patients who experience a local recurrence, but this is not standard treatment [<a href="#rid29">29,47,48,54,55</a>]. This approach may be an option for select patients, according to the following treatment history:</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2901074321"><span class="h3">Patients with no prior radiation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who underwent BCS alone (without breast RT) may be candidates for repeat BCS followed by RT. In a retrospective review of patients who were initially treated with lumpectomy without radiation, repeat lumpectomy upon recurrence followed by adjuvant radiation was associated with a five-year local control rate of 82 percent (versus 32 percent among those treated with repeat lumpectomy only) [<a href="#rid56">56</a>]. In comparison, patients treated with a total mastectomy or a total mastectomy plus RT had local control rates of 60 and 52 percent, respectively. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3262325448"><span class="h3">Select patients with prior radiation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In general, for patients initially treated with BCS and radiation, recurrences are treated with mastectomy. Exceptions may be made in the following cases:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The patient is not an appropriate surgical candidate for mastectomy due to comorbid disease. In such cases, more limited surgery or primary systemic therapy may be considered. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/757.html" rel="external">"Overview of the approach to early breast cancer in older women", section on 'Nonsurgical candidates'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The patient is older with hormone-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative disease and is willing to complete a course of adjuvant endocrine therapy.

Candidates for this approach may include those with small tumor size and long disease-free interval (eg, tumor size ≤2 cm and &gt;48 months' time to relapse, respectively [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]).

(See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management of chest wall/breast recurrence</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients in whom an upfront resection is feasible, with acceptable risks of morbidity and anticipated cosmetic outcome, we typically proceed with initial surgery and use pathologic staging from the resection specimen to guide decisions regarding adjuvant systemic therapy. However, there are exceptions (eg, patients with isolated supraclavicular recurrences or those with a heavy burden of disease), in which cases we administer systemic therapy first, to facilitate successful locoregional treatment and to be certain that early evidence of distant metastases does not emerge. Multidisciplinary tumor board discussion can be helpful. (See <a class="local">'Sequencing local and systemic therapies'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients treated initially with mastectomy who develop a local recurrence only, we suggest wide local excision of all gross disease, whenever possible, for solitary or multiple nodules that are amenable to resection (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). For those who did not previously receive radiation, we also suggest postmastectomy radiation (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Radiation is also appropriate in select women who previously were irradiated (depending on location, time course, and risk features of the disease). (See <a class="local">'Surgical resection'</a> above and <a class="local">'Radiation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For women who develop an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) following breast-conserving therapy (BCT) and radiation, we suggest a mastectomy rather than repeat lumpectomy (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Although such patients are typically not treated with further radiation, chest wall radiation may be appropriate in rare high-risk cases (particularly if the time since last radiation was long). However, repeat BCT may be an appropriate alternative in select women (eg, those who were not initially treated with radiation or those with a small and late relapse). (See <a class="local">'Preferred approach: Mastectomy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Repeat BCT as an alternative for select patients'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management of lymph node recurrence</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The general approach to the patient with a regional breast cancer recurrence is to rule out distant metastases and, whenever possible, resect the area of recurrent disease. (See <a class="local">'Evidence of nodal recurrence'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients without palpable axillary lymphadenopathy who have no evidence of distant recurrence, we perform an axillary ultrasound. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>For patients with no clinical nodal involvement (examination and ultrasound are negative), who had a prior axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) initially, we do not re-explore the axilla. (See <a class="local">'No clinical evidence of nodal disease'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>For patients with no clinical nodal involvement, who have <strong>not</strong> had an ALND, our approach is to perform sentinel node mapping. (See <a class="local">'No clinical evidence of nodal disease'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients presenting with axillary recurrences (detected either clinically or based on sentinel node mapping):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Without prior ALND, we suggest a complete ALND (levels I and II) (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'Evidence of nodal recurrence'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>With prior ALND, an attempt at resection is also indicated. If the disease cannot be resected, then systemic therapy can sometimes be used to decrease the extent of disease, which is then followed by radiation. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients without prior nodal radiation who have experienced a locoregional recurrence of breast cancer, we suggest radiation to both the chest wall and regional lymph nodes rather than more limited or no radiation (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). For such patients who have previously had nodal irradiation, we typically do not reirradiate the lymph nodes. However, an exception may be made in select women with axillary recurrences (eg, in the setting of an incompletely resected axillary regional recurrence, or for local control of inoperable and/or progressive local disease that is nonresponsive to systemic therapy). This should be particularly considered in cases in which the inoperable and/or progressive disease is symptomatic or is likely to become symptomatic based on location and there has been a substantial time interval from the prior radiation. (See <a class="local">'Adjuvant nodal irradiation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients with isolated supraclavicular recurrences who are considered candidates for systemic therapy, we suggest initial systemic therapy rather than upfront surgery (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). At the time of restaging, if there is still no evidence of distant metastatic spread, surgery and/or radiation therapy (RT) can be considered, depending on the magnitude of the response, the volume of residual disease, whether RT was previously administered, as well as the expected morbidity of both therapies. (See <a class="local">'Isolated supraclavicular recurrence'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prognosis</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Locoregional recurrences are associated with a high risk of developing distant metastases and, consequently, poor survival. Better prognostic features include late rather than early recurrences (within two years) and isolated axillary recurrences rather than involvement of other nodal areas.
