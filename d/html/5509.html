This disease has a lengthy history; the first investigation of botulism occurred in the 1820s with a case series about hundreds of patients with "sausage poisoning" in a southern German town [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Several decades later in Belgium, the association was demonstrated between a neuromuscular paralysis and ham infected by a spore-forming bacillus that was isolated from the ham. The organism was initially named <em>Bacillus botulinus </em>after the Latin word for sausage, botulus.</p><p>The microbiology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of botulism will be discussed here.</p><p>Infant botulism is discussed briefly here and in greater detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6153.html" rel="external">"Neuromuscular junction disorders in newborns and infants", section on 'Infant botulism'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">MICROBIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>The causative organism</strong> – <em>C. botulinum</em> is a gram-positive, rod-shaped, spore-forming, obligate anaerobic bacterium. It is ubiquitous and easily isolated from the surfaces of vegetables, fruits, and seafood, and exists in soil and marine sediment worldwide [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. <em>C. botulinum</em> is divided into four distinct phenotypic groups (I to IV); it is more commonly classified into seven serotypes (A to G) based on the antigenicity of toxin production. A single strain usually produces only one toxin, but some strains may produce multiple toxins [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. <em>Clostridium butyricum</em> and <em>Clostridium baratii </em>are two other distinct Clostridia species that are known to have produced botulinum toxin (types E and F) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><em>C. botulinum </em>spores are heat resistant and can survive 100°C at one atmosphere for five or more hours. However, spores can be destroyed by heating to 120°C for five minutes [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. When appropriate environmental conditions are present, the spores will germinate and grow into toxin-producing bacilli. These environmental parameters include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Restricted oxygen exposure (either an anaerobic or semi-anaerobic environment).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>pH near 7.0 or greater. Growth is inhibited when the pH is &lt;4.6; however, a low pH will not degrade existing toxin.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A temperature of 25 to 37°C. Some strains may grow in temperatures as low as 4°C.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Contamination of food cannot reliably be suspected on the basis of appearance, odor, or taste. Some strains (A and B) produce proteolytic enzymes that denature and "spoil" food, producing an unpleasant appearance, taste, or smell. However, other strains do not have this effect.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Botulinum toxin</strong> – Eight distinct <em>C. botulinum</em> toxin types have been described: A through H. Of these eight, types A, B, E, and rarely F, G, and H, cause human disease; C and D cause disease in animals such as cattle, ducks, and chickens. <em>C. botulinum</em> toxin type H was first reported in 2014 and was the first new botulinum toxin type to be recognized in over four decades [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. In contrast with the spores, the toxin is a heat-labile polypeptide readily denatured by heating above 80°C. The polypeptide toxin is composed of a light and heavy chain with a combined molecular weight of 150 to 165 kDa.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Botulinum toxin is released as a single precursor polypeptide chain that is then cleaved by bacterial proteases into a fully active neurotoxin composed of a 50-kDa light chain and a 100-kDa heavy chain [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Although the precise molecular mechanism of botulinum neurotoxin action is not fully understood, evidence supports a multistep process that includes binding of the neurotoxin to specific receptors at the presynaptic nerve terminal, toxin internalization into the nerve cell with translocation across the endosomal membrane, and intracellular endopeptidase cleavage of proteins necessary for neurotransmitter release.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Botulinum toxin can affect both excitatory and inhibitory synapses but is more active in excitatory neurons. It inhibits the release of multiple compounds, including dopamine, serotonin, somatostatin, noradrenaline, and gamma aminobutyric acid. Because of its large size, the toxin is thought unlikely to be able to pass through the blood-brain barrier; however, evidence is mounting that it could reach the central nervous system through either systemic spread or axonal retrograde or anterograde transport.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Botulinum toxin is the most potent bacterial toxin and perhaps the most potent known poison. The minimum lethal dose in experimental mice of botulinum toxin is 0.0003 mcg/kg. By comparison, the MLDs for curare and sodium cyanide are 500 and 10,000 mcg/kg, respectively [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. It is estimated that 1 gram of aerosolized botulism toxin could kill at least 1.5 million people [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The toxin itself has no smell or taste. If ingested, the toxin is primarily absorbed by the stomach and small intestine, although the large intestine can absorb the toxin as well. The toxin is resistant to degradation by gastric acidity and human alimentary enzymes. However, botulinum toxin is inactivated in chlorinated water after only 20 minutes of exposure and in fresh water after three to six days [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Types of botulism and their sources</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The modern syndrome of botulism occurs in several forms, differentiated by the mode of acquisition. The most common types are infant, foodborne, and wound botulism. Iatrogenic botulism and adult intestinal colonization are rarer types: </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H782770965"><span class="h3">Infant botulism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Infant botulism occurs when <em>C. botulinum</em> spores are ingested, colonize the host's gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and release toxin produced in vivo. In the United States, most cases are thought to result from ingestion of environmental dust and soil containing <em>C. botulinum</em> spores. The incidence of reported cases is highest in California and Pennsylvania, states in which soil botulinum spore counts are high [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Infant botulism has classically been associated with the ingestion of raw honey. However, this is most likely a minor environmental reservoir, since widespread education of the public has done little to affect the incidence of infant botulism in the United States. </p><p>Infant botulism is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6153.html" rel="external">"Neuromuscular junction disorders in newborns and infants", section on 'Infant botulism'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Foodborne botulism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Foodborne botulism is caused by ingestion of food contaminated by preformed botulinum toxin. Toxin types A, B, and E have been associated with foodborne botulism.</p><p>Most cases of botulism are recognized when small outbreaks involving home-canned foods such as fruits, vegetables, and fish occur [<a href="#rid13">13-16</a>]. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the United States, the highest rates of foodborne botulism have been reported among Alaska Natives as a result of ingestion of aged, fermented fish and marine mammals (eg, seal or whale blubber, dried herring) [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>]. Surveillance data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) between 1947 and 2007 found a mean annual incidence of 6.9 cases per 100,000 Alaska Natives compared with an overall national rate of 0.0068 cases per 100,000 persons. Subsequently, confirmed cases of foodborne botulism have been reported annually from Alaska (whereas cases in other states are more sporadic) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Toxin type E is the most commonly implicated type in foodborne botulism in Alaska [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Prison brew (also known as pruno, hooch, moonshine, or bootleg), an illicit beverage typically made by fermenting fruit and sugar in water along with bread or potato, has been identified as a major source of outbreaks within prison populations [<a href="#rid20">20-22</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In China, home-fermented tofu and other fermented bean products cause more than half of the cases of foodborne botulism [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. </p><p></p><p>Commercial products and restaurants are occasionally sources; specific commercial sources have included carrot juice and sausage that were improperly refrigerated [<a href="#rid14">14,24-30</a>]. Foods that have been recalled for potential <em>C. botulinum</em> contamination can be searched in catalogs maintained by food regulatory agencies in the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fda.gov%2Fsafety%2Frecalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts&amp;token=%2FyIlhGEtXGvK%2FPIxEhHYRF9YGxJJNwQ4SyL7U%2FlbOalMhlv8hF0va2cYP7EUBDUgSVWuADdw3tjiUIZtFzqGDrDqJ2RTVY5bsXJV9DErBuQ%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=5509" target="_blank">United States</a>, <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Finspection.canada.ca%2F&amp;token=QxGCSKnVWxGBiFscjQ8Ls3ra4%2BmOVunhn7P04Xb%2BYaVwhPix7zIVGiPPFzIvfeqR&amp;TOPIC_ID=5509" target="_blank">Canada</a>, and the <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.efsa.europa.eu%2Fen&amp;token=q%2BtFDlZ3%2BJRQXZSWNuOsHBzaQClK11u8r%2BOryfge%2FBgUflL5jE31MsUYFpuZTrQE&amp;TOPIC_ID=5509" target="_blank">European Union</a>.</p><p>In a systematic review of cases of foodborne botulism between 1920 and 2014, 197 reported outbreaks were identified, 55 percent of which occurred in the United States [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. Outbreak sizes ranged from 2 to 97 (median 3) affected individuals. Commercial sources were associated with an outbreak size ≥12 cases. Toxin type A has caused the majority of the outbreaks in the United States, Europe, and Asia, whereas type E has caused the majority in Canada [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2691090541"><span class="h3">Wound botulism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><em>C. botulinum</em> can infect wounds and subsequently produce neurotoxin in vivo. In theory, wound botulism should only be associated with puncture wounds, subcutaneous abscesses, and deep space infections, which provide the anaerobic environment required for spores to germinate and the organism to thrive. Accordingly, wound botulism is associated with injection drug use, particularly with "black tar" heroin and subcutaneous or intramuscular injection (including “skin popping”) [<a href="#rid32">32,33</a>]. Recurrent wound botulism has occurred in some people who inject drugs [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. </p><p>However, cases have also been described involving abrasions, lacerations, open fractures, surgical incisions, and even a closed hematoma without appreciable skin defect [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. A case has been reported of pelvic abscess, paralysis, and toxemia due to <em>C. botulinum</em> following a laparoscopic appendectomy [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p>Wound botulism has also been reported in patients who inhale cocaine [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. In that case series, patients presented with sinusitis; <em>C. botulinum</em> was isolated from a sinus aspirate in one patient.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3809956868"><span class="h3">Rarer types</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Iatrogenic botulism</strong> – Iatrogenic cases of botulism have been rarely reported in patients who have received botulinum toxin for cosmetic or medical indications [<a href="#rid38">38-41</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">As an example, four cases of botulism were described in patients who had received botulinum toxin injections using an unlicensed, highly concentrated preparation of botulinum toxin A [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. The patients may have received doses as high as 2857 times the estimated human lethal dose by injection and had serum toxin levels 21 to 43 times the estimated lethal human dose by injection. After administration of equine serum antitoxin, all patients survived but required prolonged mechanical ventilation and physical rehabilitation. Milder cases of shorter duration have been described in patients who received lower, standard doses of cosmetic botulinum toxin [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The safety record of botulism toxin for cosmetic use is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13643.html" rel="external">"Overview of botulinum toxin for cosmetic indications", section on 'Clinical safety record'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Adult intestinal colonization</strong> – Adult intestinal colonization is also known as adult intestinal toxemia or enteric infectious botulism. Similar to infant botulism, it occurs when food contaminated with <em>C. botulinum</em> spores (but not preformed toxin) is ingested, and the bacteria colonizes the GI tract and produces toxin in vivo. (See <a class="local">'Infant botulism'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">This a rare form of botulism. Between 1980 and 2018, only 33 cases were reported in the literature [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. After infancy, the GI tract is typically resistant to colonization by <em>C. botulinum</em>. The alterations in intestinal flora or gut mucosa that predispose adults to intestinal colonization are unknown. Botulism attributed to intestinal colonization has been reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, recent GI surgery, and achlorhydria, as well as in an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipient [<a href="#rid42">42,43</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3178520199"><span class="h2">Incidence</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Botulism occurs globally. In the United States, approximately 200 cases of botulism are <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fbotulism%2Fsurveillance.html&amp;token=R4Uiw8%2FbmPVaqNHRDqpXLKZee2zklzJ%2BdtRIOHFM%2FChmMbVNwinYIbygKoHWaycCFRP8Pb4E6BlmOOkmg%2BwZ4Q%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=5509" target="_blank">reported to the CDC</a> each year [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Approximately 70 to 75 percent of cases are infant botulism, 20 to 25 percent are foodborne, and 5 to 10 percent are wound-related. Botulism due to adult intestinal colonization botulism is extremely rare. </p><p>In the United States, the incidence of infant and foodborne botulism has remained stable over the past several decades. In contrast, the incidence of wound botulism has increased over time [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. The ongoing opioid epidemic has the potential to fuel further increases in wound botulism incidence. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2347512486"><span class="h2">Potential for bioterrorism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Because <em>C. botulinum</em> toxin is extremely potent, it has been identified as a potential agent of bioterrorism [<a href="#rid45">45,46</a>]. The 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention prohibited both research on and production of bioweapons [<a href="#rid45">45</a>], although it has been suspected that Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and Syria have botulinum toxin supplies [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. Despite the potency of <em>C. botulinum</em> toxin, technical complexities in concentrating and stabilizing the toxin for aerosolization have remained major barriers to its deployment as a bioterrorism agent [<a href="#rid45">45,46</a>]. Aerosolized botulinum toxin was deployed unsuccessfully in Tokyo by the religious sect Aum Shinrikyo in 1995 prior to their use of sarin [<a href="#rid48">48</a>].</p><p>Aerosolized botulinum toxin, if successfully deployed, would likely produce an acute symmetric descending flaccid paralysis with prominent bulbar palsies (diplopia, dysarthria, dysphonia, and dysphagia) within 12 to 72 hours of exposure [<a href="#rid45">45,49</a>].</p><p>Contamination of a common food or water source resulting in mass foodborne botulism is another possible mode of attack [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2574929841"><span class="h2">Characteristic features</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The classic presentation of botulism is acute onset of bilateral cranial neuropathies associated with symmetric descending weakness [<a href="#rid5">5,50</a>]. Other key features of the botulism syndrome include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Absence of fever</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Symmetric neurologic deficits</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Normal sensorium and mental status</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Normal or slow heart rate and normal blood pressure</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Absence of sensory deficits, with the exception of blurred vision</p><p></p><p>In a report of 322 laboratory- or epidemiologically-confirmed cases of botulism in the United States from 2002 to 2015, 99 percent were afebrile, 98 percent had at least one symptom related to cranial nerve dysfunction, 93 percent had descending paralysis, and 91 percent remained alert and oriented [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. Neurologic deficits were primarily bilateral; unilateral facial paralysis, extraocular palsy, and ptosis each occurred in fewer than 15 percent of cases.</p><p>Additional details of the major clinical features include: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cranial nerve dysfunction</strong> – The onset of symptomatic illness is characterized by cranial nerve dysfunction, which includes blurred vision (secondary to fixed pupillary dilation and palsies of cranial nerves III, IV, and VI), diplopia, nystagmus, ptosis, dysphagia, dysarthria, and facial weakness. In a systematic review of 400 adults with botulism, 93 percent had cranial nerve findings at the time of presentation [<a href="#rid52">52</a>].

The possibility of botulism should be considered in any patient with acute onset of unexplained cranial nerve abnormalities. It should also be considered in patients with suspected myasthenia gravis or Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). In infants, botulism should be considered when there is acute onset of weak suck, ptosis, inactivity, and constipation (eg, floppy baby syndrome). </p><p>Specifically, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States suggests that botulism be suspected in patients who meet the following three criteria  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117102" href="/d/graphic/117102.html" rel="external">table 1</a>): </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>At least one specific symptom of cranial neuropathy – These include blurred or double vision, difficulty speaking, voice change, dysphagia or drooling, thick tongue sensation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>At least one specific sign of cranial neuropathy – These include ptosis, extraocular palsy or fatigability, decreased tracking, facial paresis or loss of expression, poor feeding or suck, fixed pupils, descending paralysis beginning with cranial nerves.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lack of fever.</p><p></p><p>These three criteria are met in the majority of reported cases of botulism. In a study that included 241 cases of botulism recorded in the National Botulism Surveillance Database in the United States, those three clinical criteria were met in 89 percent of patients [<a href="#rid59">59</a>]. In a medical record review of 99 other botulism cases from the database, these clinical criteria would have been able to identify 78 percent within 48 hours of hospitalization. Thus, these criteria could be helpful for clinicians to prompt consideration of botulism earlier in the course of disease. However, the specificity of these three criteria is unknown, and the absence of one of these criteria does not rule out the possibility of botulism. As an example, fever may be present because of a reason other than botulism, as with concurrent bacterial infection in wound botulism.

If the clinical presentation is sufficiently consistent with botulism to make a presumptive clinical diagnosis (cranial neuropathy with symmetric descending paralysis, particularly if the patient is alert, afebrile, and has no sensory deficit), public health officials should be contacted for assistance in diagnostic testing and treatment, which should be initiated before results of confirmatory diagnostic tests return.

Patients with botulism are typically fully alert but may have ptosis, dysarthria, and gait disturbances that could mimic intoxication or altered sensorium, and examination should distinguish these. Neurologic examination should also evaluate for other deficits (eg, sensory defects or unilateral findings) that would be atypical for botulism, although these do not rule out the possibility of botulism. In contrast to polyneuropathies that could mimic botulism (eg, GBS), reflexes are typically normal in patients with botulism unless the affected muscle group is completely paralyzed [<a href="#rid60">60</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Physical examination should also include a thorough skin and scalp examination for ticks, as patients with tick paralysis can present similarly.

The possibility of bioterrorism should also be considered when clusters of patients present with suspected botulism. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Other general laboratory or imaging studies are not necessary for the diagnosis of botulism but may be warranted to rule out other causes (eg, neuroimaging may be appropriate to evaluate for brainstem disease).

Nevertheless, individuals with suspected botulism and progressive symptoms should be treated with BAT regardless of time since onset of illness. BAT is likely less beneficial to those who have already progressed to complete paralysis, particularly if symptoms had been ongoing for more than seven days prior.

Specimens should be collected as soon as possible because toxin levels decrease over time; additionally, serum and gastric specimens should be collected prior to antitoxin administration. However, the decision to administer antitoxin should be based on the presumptive clinical diagnosis of botulism and not be delayed while awaiting results of confirmatory diagnostic studies. (See <a class="local">'Confirming the diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hospitalization and monitoring</strong> – Any patient with clinical signs, symptoms, or history suspicious for botulism should be hospitalized and monitored for progressive weakness and signs of respiratory failure that warrant intubation. (See <a class="local">'Supportive/respiratory care and monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Antitoxin </strong>– Antitoxin is the main therapeutic option for botulism. For patients with confirmed or highly suspected botulism, we recommend prompt administration of botulinum antitoxin (BAT) (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). In the United States, equine serum heptavalent BAT is used to treat non-infant botulism; human-derived <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8708" href="/d/drug information/8708.html" rel="external">botulism immune globulin</a> is used for infant botulism. Antitoxin is obtained through state health departments. (See <a class="local">'Botulinum antitoxin (BAT) for non-infant botulism'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6153.html" rel="external">"Neuromuscular junction disorders in newborns and infants", section on 'Infant botulism'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Limited role for antibiotics </strong>– Antibiotics to treat <em>C. botulinum</em> have no demonstrated benefit and have theoretical harm in patients with botulism, and they are not generally warranted. When antibiotics are used to treat concurrent infections (eg, wound infection, abscess, pneumonia), agents that potentiate neuromuscular blockade, such as aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9275" href="/d/drug information/9275.html" rel="external">clindamycin</a>, and polymyxins, should be avoided. (See <a class="local">'Wound management'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/110530.html" rel="external">"Acute cellulitis and erysipelas in adults: Treatment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prevention</strong> – Since most cases of botulism are acquired through food ingestion, the most critical aspect of botulism prevention is proper food handling and preparation. Good home-canning techniques will destroy spores. Infants &lt;12 months of age should not ingest honey. The most important measure for the prevention of wound botulism is prompt medical management of infected wounds.
