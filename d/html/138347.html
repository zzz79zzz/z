This topic will review these issues, including relevant factors in brain development, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences for brain malformations, specific types of brain malformations, and their clinical manifestations. Brain malformations will be discussed as isolated, distinct clinical entities. However, patients may have multiple different brain malformations, indicating a more diverse pathological process.</p><p>The evaluation of brain malformations in the prenatal period is reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6745.html" rel="external">"Prenatal diagnosis of CNS anomalies other than neural tube defects and ventriculomegaly"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2492587698"><span class="h1">NORMAL AND ABNORMAL BRAIN DEVELOPMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A brief outline of cerebral cortical development, greatly simplified, is presented here [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], which may be helpful in understanding how specific malformations develop.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Regionalization</strong> – The neural tube is induced from neuroectoderm by the signaling protein sonic hedgehog (SHH), which is secreted by the notochord. Retinoic acid (RA) and SHH are produced from the ventral region of the spinal cord, while other signaling proteins (Wnt and BMP family proteins) are produced by the dorsal spinal cord, thereby generating chemical gradients. Spinal cord precursors start expressing specific transcription factors based upon the relative amounts of ventralizing signals (SHH) and dorsalizing signals (Wnt and BMP proteins) and differentiate into different classes of neurons [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. A similar, although less completely understood, process occurs in telencephalon cerebral cortical development. For instance, SHH is expressed at the base of the future cerebral cortex, Wnt and BMP in the ventral region, and fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) at the very anterior portion of the brain [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Neuronal development</strong> – Neuronal precursors of the cerebral cortex proliferate with logarithmic growth during early development and prior to neuronal differentiation. This logarithmic growth is important to produce enough neurons later during cerebral cortical development. Once a cell becomes a neuron (terminal differentiation), it can no longer divide. During cerebral cortical development, precursor cells divide near the inner surface adjacent to the ventricle (the ventricular zone), while the future cerebral cortex (the cortical plate) with terminally differentiated neurons is adjacent to the outer portion (the pial surface). Neuronal precursor proliferation is more complex than described here [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Neuronal migration</strong> – Upon terminal differentiation, neurons migrate from the ventricular zone (which lines the inside of the developing ventricles) to the future cerebral cortex at the pial surface. As the brain grows during development, this distance becomes very large relative the size of the neuron. Newly differentiated neurons climb along a scaffold of other neuronal precursors, known as radial glia, that extend from ventricular to pial surface in a process known as radial migration. The neurons stop within the cortical plate using signals found at the pial surface. Neurons of the cerebral cortex terminally differentiate between approximately 8 and 20 weeks of gestation, and they complete migration by approximately 28 weeks of gestation. These processes outline the development of most glutamatergic neurons, which are the most common excitatory neurons of the cerebral cortex.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons, the most common inhibitory neurons, have a somewhat different pathway [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Most GABAergic neurons originate in the medial and lateral ganglionic eminence and migrate tangentially within the subventricular zone (adjacent to the ventricular zone) or the marginal zone (the outermost layer of the developing cortex) to reach their final location within the cortex [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Axonal pathfinding</strong> – During development, axons grow by reacting to proteins within their environment, either attracted or repelled (and sometimes both depending on context) to be guided to their proper postsynaptic targets [<a href="#rid7">7-9</a>]. Axonal pathfinding involves specialized growth cones at the tip of extending axons and numerous chemical cues and receptors that mediate growth cone movement.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Genetic mechanisms of malformations</strong> – Understanding genetic mechanisms of brain malformations is reasonably straightforward. A gene encodes for a protein that plays a role in cell proliferation, neuronal migration, axonal pathfinding, or other processes that are critical for brain development. Pathogenic variants differ in relative severity, leading to variability in phenotype. Identifying pathogenic variants that lead to brain malformations is important for future family and caregiver counseling. A thorough but negative genetic evaluation does not necessarily rule out genetic causes, as rare genetic pathogenic variants leading to brain malformations continue to be identified.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Environmental insults</strong> – Environmental insults are injuries to the brain. Insults such as TORCH (Toxoplasmosis, Others, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes simplex virus)/Zika infections, hemorrhage, ischemia, toxins, radiation, and other injuries will vary based upon the severity of the injury and the stage of brain development at the time the injury occurs. Different types of nongenetic injuries can lead to the same types of brain malformations. Most types of nongenetic injury are one-time events and have little risk of recurrence (with some exceptions such as teratogenic drug exposure). An insult early in development that destroys neuronal precursors will affect all neurons that would have been produced by those precursors. Injury during neuronal migration can lead to various malformations. Injury that occurs later in development on differentiated neurons is limited to the affected neurons. Therefore, the same injury early in brain development is often more severe than if it were to occur later in development.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H174011098"><span class="h1">MALFORMATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We discuss brain malformations as isolated, distinct clinical entities. However, some patients have multiple different brain malformations, indicating a more diverse pathological process.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H638688987"><span class="h2">Holoprosencephaly</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Holoprosencephaly is reviewed here briefly and discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2920.html" rel="external">"Overview of craniofacial clefts and holoprosencephaly", section on 'Holoprosencephaly'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Description and forms</strong> – Holoprosencephaly results from lack of separation of the forebrain, with the result that the two hemispheres remain fused. It occurs in a spectrum of severity:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Alobar is the most severe, with the frontal regions fused and the posterior region absent with a large single ventricle in its place.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Semilobar has posterior regions separated, while frontal cortical regions remain fused, which can include cerebral cortex and basal ganglia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Lobar is less severe, with only a small amount of nonfused cerebral cortex, typically in the frontal region, with basal ganglia that may or may not be fused.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Alobar, semilobar, and lobar forms have abnormalities that are more pronounced at the base of the brain, with olfactory nerves typically small to absent, while optic nerves are often small as well.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Middle-interhemispheric (syntelencephaly) holoprosencephaly has fusion higher in the middle portions of the brain (posterior frontal and parietal lobes), not at the base of the brain, and it is usually less severe. The olfactory bulbs are not typically involved.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Etiology</strong> – There are many causes of holoprosencephaly. Chromosomal anomalies (with abnormal karyotypes or chromosomal microarrays) are the most common causes, particularly trisomy 13. Other causes include point variants and deletions in specific genes, including <em>SHH</em> (sonic hedgehog), <em>SIX3</em>, and <em>ZIC2</em> [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. Pathogenic variants in the <em>SHH</em> gene, genes involved in SHH signaling, and other genes involved in forebrain induction indicate that holoprosencephaly results from failure of proper forebrain induction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Epidemiology and risk factors</strong> – Holoprosencephaly is one of the most common brain malformations in utero (up to 1:250). It often leads to spontaneous miscarriages and therefore is significantly less common in newborns (approximately 1:10,000) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Nongenetic risk factors for holoprosencephaly include maternal diabetes (strongest association), hypertension, fetal infections, salicylate, antiseizure medications, statins, retinoids, fetal alcohol exposure, and assisted reproductive technologies [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13322" href="/d/drug information/13322.html" rel="external">Folic acid</a> supplementation during pregnancy may reduce risk [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Associated conditions</strong> – Malformations in the face correspond to severity of brain malformations. Severe eye abnormalities include cyclopia, and less severe abnormalities include narrow-spaced eye with optic nerve hypoplasia. Nose malformations and cleft palate can also occur [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2920.html" rel="external">"Overview of craniofacial clefts and holoprosencephaly", section on 'Craniofacial clefts'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical aspects and prognosis</strong> – The severity of symptoms is correlated with the severity of brain malformations; alobar is typically more severe than semilobar, while lobar and interhemispheric are the least severe.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Infants with severe forms may not survive long after birth and often do not survive beyond one year of life, but patients with milder cases can survive into adulthood. Affected infants can have feeding difficulties, arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D, previously called central diabetes insipidus), other endocrine abnormalities, seizures, hydrocephalus, temperature instability, or central apnea. Children who survive early childhood typically have motor and speech delays and can have vision and hearing issues [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2245983018"><span class="h2">Microcephaly and microencephaly</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Microcephaly (small head) is largely correlated with microencephaly (small brain), such that head circumference is a marker of relative brain size.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Etiology</strong> – The causes of microcephaly  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75479" href="/d/graphic/75479.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) include destructive injuries during the pre-, peri-, or postnatal periods. Microcephaly is found in many genetic disorders; searching "microcephaly" in OMIM.org yields over 1800 results. Microcephaly is often present with other brain malformations as well as degenerative brain conditions and recognizable genetic disorders such as Angelman and Rett syndromes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Primary microcephaly (also known as microcephaly vera, or true microcephaly) is present at birth and uncomplicated by systemic anomalies. Most of the genes associated with primary microcephaly appear to play a role in centriole function [<a href="#rid4">4,19</a>]. The mechanism is not fully understood, but there is evidence that abnormal centriole function in neuronal precursors leads to premature terminal differentiation of precursors into neurons, reducing overall number of neurons produced due to inadequate proliferation [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Most of brain volume and growth during development is dependent upon synaptogenesis and axonal outgrowth. Fewer neurons produced early in development leads to less of these other processes and smaller brains as children grow. In addition to centriole genes, some DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) repair genes have been associated with microcephaly [<a href="#rid4">4,19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical aspects</strong> – Children with head circumference between 2 and 3 standard deviations (SD) below the mean (borderline microcephaly) can have normal development, while those with head circumference &lt;3 SD (99.7th percentile) below the mean (moderate microcephaly) should be evaluated for microcephaly. Reassuring factors include normal development in children with stable head circumference growth curves that are consistently no lower than 2.5 SD below the mean, in conjunction with parents with a small head and no other abnormalities. Falling further below the mean head circumference curves over time implies lack of proper growth. Delayed milestones should prompt evaluations and interventions, while loss of milestones typically requires more urgent evaluations. The differential diagnoses for microcephaly require accounting for neuroimaging, dysmorphology, developmental history, and neurologic and systemic findings [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2839.html" rel="external">"Microcephaly in infants and children: Etiology and evaluation"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14392.html" rel="external">"Microcephaly: A clinical genetics approach"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Profound microcephaly without any clear structural abnormalities can be associated with primary microcephaly; affected patients do not typically have any other neurologic findings besides developmental delay, which often involves severe motor and language delay. Head circumference at birth can be a low percentile or just below the bottom of the curve. However, the relative degree of microcephaly worsens over time due to lack of normal brain growth, not to worsening of disease (primary microcephaly is not a destructive process). The relative microcephaly is often profound, with head circumference up to 6 to 8 SD below the mean as children reach their later teens. Therefore, the relative level of microcephaly will worsen over time in patients with microcephaly vera. The SD above or below reference standards for normal head growth in infants according to age and sex can be determined using the World Health Organization infant head circumference calculator (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/d/html/15630.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Children with a pathogenic DNA repair gene variant can have seizures, ataxia, neuropathy, or immune deficiency. However, there are rare pathogenic variants that lead to moderate levels of primary microcephaly with milder delays or even normal developmental outcomes.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H120742686"><span class="h2">Macrocephaly and megalencephaly</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Macrocephaly (large head) is frequently associated with hydrocephalus but can be due to megalencephaly (large brain), also called macrencephaly  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65812" href="/d/graphic/65812.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Head circumference greater than 3 SD (99.7th percentile) above the mean is typically concerning, as head circumference 2 to 3 SD above the mean are reasonably common in normal individuals. However, a rapidly growing head circumference affecting infants can be concerning for worsening hydrocephalus.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Etiology and associated conditions</strong> – Megalencephaly can result from brain overgrowth or metabolic disorders that enlarge the brain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Metabolic disorders include organic acid processing disorders, lysosomal storage disorders, and leukodystrophies. Metabolic disorders are typically associated with developmental regression, abnormal imaging on MRI, or systemic abnormalities that will point towards these diagnoses [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Autism spectrum disorder has been associated with increased head size [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/627.html" rel="external">"Autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents: Clinical features", section on 'Macrocephaly'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Fragile X in males is one of the more common causes of intellectual disability/autism frequently associated with macrocephaly. Physical characteristics typically associated with Fragile X may not be present in younger children.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2939.html" rel="external">"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1): Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Macrocephaly'</a>.).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Deletion or loss-of-function variants of the overgrowth suppressor gene <em>PTEN</em>, a negative regulator of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, leads to different clinical phenotypes collectively known as PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. In addition to macrocephaly, symptoms can include autism, hamartomas, various cancers, various mucocutaneous lesions, and other features. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16543.html" rel="external">"PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes, including Cowden syndrome"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Activating pathogenic variants in the mTOR pathway (PI3K-AKT-mTOR) also lead to macrocephaly [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Examples include the megalencephaly-capillary malformation and megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-hydrocephalus syndromes that involve macrocephaly, polymicrogyria, capillary malformations of the nose/lip, and polydactyly (pathogenic variants can also involve the cell cycle-related gene <em>CCND2</em>). Hemimegalencephaly (ie, enlargement of one side of the brain, often associated with various malformations) typically results from somatic pathogenic variants within the mTOR pathways [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Clinical outcomes vary according to the pathogenic variant and typically correlate with severity and extent of brain malformations, with developmental delays and seizures common.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical aspects</strong> – Evaluation for macrocephaly should be initiated when a single head circumference (accurately measured) is abnormal or if serial measurements reveal progressive enlargement. Additionally, for infants age &lt;6 months, evaluation is warranted when there is an increase in head circumference of &gt;2 cm/month (&gt;0.8 inches/month). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2849.html" rel="external">"Macrocephaly in infants and children: Etiology and evaluation", section on 'Evaluation of postnatal macrocephaly'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Neuroimaging, preferably with MRI, should be obtained in infants and children suspected of having an expanding lesion. Imaging is necessary to determine if the volume increase is due to hydrocephalus, mass effect from cysts/tumor, enlarged bone thickness, or larger than normal brain tissue volume. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2849.html" rel="external">"Macrocephaly in infants and children: Etiology and evaluation", section on 'Neuroimaging'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Ultrasound can be used in infants up to approximately three months of age depending upon the size of anterior fontanelle. While not as good as MRI, it can typically determine if the cause is hydrocephalus and provide clues as to other causes. Computed tomography (CT) scans expose children to radiation and have suboptimal resolution compared with MRI, but they can determine if hydrocephalus is present.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1275362367"><span class="h2">Cortical migration disorders</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2655020170"><span class="h3">Lissencephaly</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Lissencephaly means "smooth brain," with decreased or absent development of cortical gyri and sulci gyration. Lissencephaly may be complete (agyria) or incomplete (pachygyria). Lissencephaly results from lack of normal neuronal migration from the ventricular surface to the cortical plate.</p><p>Lissencephaly can be divided into type 1 and type 2, which is anatomically characterized by a cobblestone appearance of the brain.

Genetic causes of type 1 lissencephaly include pathogenic variants in <em>PAFAH1B1 </em>(also known as <em>LIS1</em>), <em>DCX</em>, various tubulin genes, microtubule-associated proteins, and various other genes involved in cell motility. Pathogenic variants in some genes have been identified in a small number of families [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Point variants or small deletions within the <em>LIS1</em> gene lead to lissencephaly and larger deletions of multiple genes in 17p13.2, including the <em>LIS1</em> gene, which includes characteristic facial features associated with Miller-Dieker Syndrome. Pathogenic variants in the X-linked gene, <em>ARX</em>, lead to ambiguous genitalia in affected males. Variations in the pattern of microcephaly can suggest specific pathogenic variants; examples include greater severity of pachygyria affecting frontal or occipital regions, and the presence or absence of cerebellar hypoplasia [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>].</p><p>Outcomes with lissencephaly vary with the severity of the condition and whether it is complicated by microcephaly.

Band heterotopia is considered a variant of lissencephaly because it is caused by aberrant neuronal migration and is linked to similar pathogenic variants [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>].</p><p>Band heterotopia can be found in females with heterozygous pathogenic variants of the <em>PAFAH1B1</em> gene or the X-linked <em>DCX</em> gene. Random inactivation of one X chromosome in females will lead to expression of the normal or the pathogenic <em>DCX</em> gene within a migrating neuron. Neurons expressing the normal X chromosome will migrate properly. Conversely, neurons expressing the mutant <em>DCX</em> will be arrested during migration, leading to a band of gray matter within the white matter. In males, a pathogenic <em>DCX</em> variant on their single X chromosome causes abnormal migration of all neurons and results in lissencephaly. Band heterotopia can also occur in patients with somatic mosaicism of pathogenic variants that would typically lead to lissencephaly.

The gyri are visible via microscopy but are often smaller than the spatial resolution of conventional MRI sequences and field strengths; multiple small gyri visualized within a single MR image results in blurring, which can lead to the illusion of an abnormally thickened cortex and be misinterpreted as pachygyria. In addition, because the gyri are smaller than the resolution of the MRI, the gray-white border is not clearly seen. The fuzzy, irregular nature of the cortex along with the lack of a distinct gray-white border on MRI distinguishes polymicrogyria from pachygyria, even though the individual gyri may not be visualized.</p><p>Schizencephaly is a cleft in the cerebral cortex connecting the ventricular and pial surfaces that is lined with polymicrogyria [<a href="#rid41">41</a>].</p><p>The causes of polymicrogyria are diverse and include environmental and genetic etiologies [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. Polymicrogyria has been associated with utero vascular insults, TORCH infections (especially CMV, but also toxoplasmosis and syphilis), and multiple metabolic disorders including neonatal adrenal leukodystrophy, Zellweger syndrome, mitochondrial disorders, and maple syrup urine disease. It is associated with chromosomal deletions such as 22q11 and 1p36, autosomal dominant pathogenic variants in tubulin genes, autosomal recessive pathogenic variants such as <em>GPR56</em>, and others.</p><p>The cellular pathological processes leading to polymicrogyria are not completely understood and likely vary based upon etiology. Derangements at the end of migration involve the pial surface, such that gyri might abnormally fuse or that the process of gyration itself is disrupted. However, the mechanisms that result in normal gyral formation are not well understood, so this remains speculative. Pathogenic variants in <em>GPR56</em> lead to abnormal neuronal migration that passes through the cerebral cortex and breaches the pial membrane, resulting in the appearance of polymicrogyria [<a href="#rid42">42-44</a>]. Since this is the same mechanism that leads to cobblestone lissencephaly, polymicrogyria is pathologically classified with that disorder [<a href="#rid42">42,43</a>].</p><p>The outcomes of polymicrogyria vary according to severity and location. Perisylvian polymicrogyria is often associated with oral motor dysfunction (such as inability to stick out the tongue), swallowing and speech delays, and other motor delays.

The brain must fuse after it has separated, requiring that the proper induction of midline structures occurs prior to neurons crossing. Specific neurons will project through the CC starting around week 13 of gestation, and they must be specified via signaling and transcription factors. Axons receive extracellular guidance cues that help to lead them along the proper pathway in addition to other critical steps, resulting in a formed CC by week 20, but neurons continue to grow afterward [<a href="#rid47">47-49</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Since there are so many steps required for proper CC development, there as many likely potential causes of agenesis.

Genetic factors are believed to be the most common; ACC has been associated with over 200 genetic syndromes and chromosomal abnormalities [<a href="#rid52">52</a>].

While not as good as MRI, it can typically determine if the cause is hydrocephalus and provide clues as to other causes. CT scans expose children to radiation and have suboptimal resolution, but they can determine whether hydrocephalus is present.</p><p>Traditional MRIs typically require sedation until children are at least school age depending upon their ability to hold still. In the newborn period, many institutions are able to obtain a good-quality rapid MRI via a "feed and swaddle" method. Babies are fed and then wrapped in a blanket, which may allow the babies to sleep through the MRI without sedation. The author has found that this strategy is less effective as the child ages and typically does not work after three months. For infants older than three months of age, sedation is typically required for full MR imaging until the child is old enough to cooperate with holding still for a traditional MRI.</p><p>Some centers are able to obtain a rapid MRI evaluation that does not require sedation to look for hydrocephalus. These studies can have institution-dependent names such as Turbo T2 or MRI shunt series; they were first developed to replace CT scans to prevent repeated radiation exposures for patients with ventricular shunts (but requiring resetting adjustable magnetic flow valves if present). At the author's institution, T2 images are used along with gradient echo/susceptibility sequences (to detect blood) and can take as little as four minutes of scanning time. The goal is to get the best-quality imaging possible given patient cooperation, but it is not always successful if the child moves too much. The studies optimize visualization of the cerebrospinal fluid and parenchyma, so gray/white imaging can be less distinct than traditional MRI but can visualize white matter and parenchyma when successful. Since it requires neither sedation nor radiation, it can be a good option depending upon the clinical scenario.</p><p>Some malformations are identified on postnatal CT or ultrasound studies. Fetal head ultrasound and postnatal head CT have lower resolution than postnatal MRI. If possible, it is best to wait until a good MRI is obtained before providing a definitive diagnosis to families, as that provides the most complete and accurate assessment of brain changes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1293789454"><span class="h2">Optimal MRI sequences</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Optimal MRI sequences for identification may differ by age. Newborn imaging is preferable to imaging later in infancy because of myelination changes. For subtle changes, such as possible gray matter heterotopia within the white matter, re-imaging with MRI after 24 months may be required.</p><p>In older children and adults, white matter should be largely myelinated, making myelinated axons appear darker than gray matter on T2 sequences (gray matter has a higher water content than myelinated axons, and water is brighter on T2 sequences). In the newborn period, axons within the cerebral cortical areas are largely unmyelinated, and axonal tracks are brighter on T2 sequences compared with gray matter. Consequently, the distinction between gray and white matter is often unclear on T1 MRI sequences, making assessments of brain malformations more difficult. Therefore, this author typically relies on T2 sequences in the newborn period. However, MRI scanners and programming differences could produce different results at different institutions.</p><p>After a few months of age and extending to 18 to 24 months, axonal myelination occurs. During this time, partially myelinated axons might have the characteristics of gray or white matter, making interpretations more difficult. Clinical circumstances may dictate whether imaging is needed within the period of myelination. However, subtle changes, such as possible gray matter heterotopia within the white matter, are likely to be more apparent after 24 months when white matter myelination is relatively advanced.</p><p>In older children, T1 sequences are often best for detecting structural changes. On T1 sequences, fully myelinated white matter is brighter then gray matter, while cerebrospinal fluid is very dark. Magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequences are high-resolution, T1-like sequences. They are not routinely done for standard MRI studies but are often done for seizure protocols. MPRAGE sequences have thinner sections and are optimal for identifying subtle changes such as gray matter heterotopia (hence their use for the evaluation of seizures).

(See <a class="local">'Lissencephaly'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Cobblestone lissencephaly</strong> – Cobblestone lissencephaly has the appearance of smooth brain with small bumps on the surface of the cerebral cortex. Cobblestone lissencephaly results from neurons failing to stop at the cortical plate during migration. Cobblestone lissencephaly is found in patients with muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy. The dystroglycanopathies are caused by abnormal glycosylation of the protein alpha-dystroglycan. They are both genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous. (See <a class="local">'Cobblestone lissencephaly'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Band heterotopia</strong> – Band heterotopia (double cortex) is characterized by an abnormal subcortical band of neurons (gray matter) found within the white matter between the cerebral cortex and ventricle. Band heterotopia is most often found in females with heterozygous pathogenic variants of the X-linked <em>DCX</em> gene. Developmental delay and seizures are the most common issues in patients with band heterotopia. (See <a class="local">'Band heterotopia (double cortex)'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Periventricular heterotopia</strong> – Periventricular heterotopia are clusters of gray matter that are adjacent to the ventricle where only white matter is normally present. They are most commonly found in patients with epilepsy but can also be an incidental finding. (See <a class="local">'Periventricular heterotopia'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Polymicrogyria</strong> – Polymicrogyria is characterized by very small irregular gyri and abnormal cortical structure and lamination. Polymicrogyria can be challenging to recognize because the gyri are often smaller than the resolution of conventional MRI sequences and field strengths, and the gray-white border is not clearly seen. The causes of polymicrogyria are diverse and include environmental and genetic etiologies. The outcomes of polymicrogyria vary according to severity and location. Perisylvian polymicrogyria is often associated with oral motor dysfunction, swallowing and speech delays, and other motor delays; seizures are common. (See <a class="local">'Polymicrogyria'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Agenesis of corpus callosum</strong> – Agenesis of corpus callosum (ACC) ranges from complete to partial. The cause may be genetic, infectious, vascular, or toxic. ACC may occur as an isolated abnormality or may be a component of different syndromes that present with neuroanatomic pathologies. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic to severe neurodevelopmental impairment, and they depend in part upon whether ACC is complete or partial and whether ACC is isolated or associated with other abnormalities. (See <a class="local">'Agenesis of corpus callosum'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Septo-optic dysplasia </strong>–<strong> </strong>Septo-optic dysplasia is typically defined as two of the three following: absent septum pellucidum or ACC, optic nerve hypoplasia, and/or endocrine deficiencies due to hypothalamic-pituitary abnormalities. These are caused by defects in midline brain formation. (See <a class="local">'Septo-optic dysplasia'</a> above.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Jiang X, Nardelli J.
