While traditional definitions of dementia required a decline in at least two cognitive domains, the definition of major neurocognitive disorder as outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) only requires a substantial decline in a single cognitive area [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The deficits must represent a decline from previous level of function and be severe enough to interfere with daily function and independence. The most common form of dementia in older adults is Alzheimer disease (AD), accounting for 60 to 80 percent of cases. </p><p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate state between normal cognition and dementia in which there are objective cognitive impairments but no decline in overall level of function. While specific subtle changes in cognition can occur in normal aging, MCI can also be a precursor to dementia [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. At the same time, MCI may also represent a reversible condition in the setting of depression, as a complication of certain medications, or during the recovery from an acute illness. </p><p>As the population ages, the overall burden of dementia is increasing worldwide. With an aging population and growing awareness of AD and other late-life dementias, clinicians should be equipped to test for cognitive impairment and ask about functional decline to avoid failure to recognize cases of AD and related dementias. Clinicians will need to accurately diagnose and manage the early cognitive manifestations of AD and other dementias. </p><p>This topic will discuss the evaluation of patients with cognitive impairment and dementia. Recommendations for the evaluation of cognitive impairment and dementia are derived from our clinical experience as well as from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) practice guidelines [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>].</p><p>The clinical, diagnostic, and pathologic aspects of specific dementia syndromes are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5071.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of Alzheimer disease"</a>.) </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5085.html" rel="external">"Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of vascular dementia"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5088.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5070.html" rel="external">"Frontotemporal dementia: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5081.html" rel="external">"Mild cognitive impairment: Epidemiology, pathology, and clinical assessment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3708659909"><span class="h1">CAUSES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most dementia is caused by a neurodegenerative disease; these produce broadly overlapping clinical syndromes, albeit with some distinctive features.

The most common of these is:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Vascular dementia (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5085.html" rel="external">"Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of vascular dementia"</a>)</p><p></p><p>Most older adult patients with chronic dementia have AD (approximately 60 to 80 percent), and many of these patients also have concomitant cerebrovascular disease. The prevalence of vascular dementia and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is relatively high in patients who are Black and/or have hypertension or diabetes. Some of the reversible dementias (eg, metabolic dementias) tend to occur in younger individuals. DLB may be as prevalent as vascular dementia in older cohorts of patients [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. FTD, which has its usual age of onset before age 65 years, is less common than AD or vascular dementia.</p><p>Dementia may have more than one cause, particularly as the condition progresses and especially in older persons. In addition, medical illnesses and comorbidities exacerbating poor cognition are common in older adult patients with dementia; examples include chronic diseases such as congestive heart failure and renal insufficiency, as well as the effects of antihistaminergic and anticholinergic medications. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Mixed dementia refers to the coexistence of more than one dementia-producing pathology, most commonly AD and vascular dementia. </p><p></p><p>Less common etiologies include alcohol-related dementia, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), chronic subdural hematoma, and other central nervous system (CNS) illnesses (eg, prion diseases, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4840.html" rel="external">"Overview of the chronic neurologic complications of alcohol"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/111925.html" rel="external">"Sequelae of mild traumatic brain injury", section on 'Chronic traumatic encephalopathy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5084.html" rel="external">"Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3723.html" rel="external">"HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5069.html" rel="external">"Normal pressure hydrocephalus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7155.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1105.html" rel="external">"Subdural hematoma in adults: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Chronic subdural hematoma'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1199441673"><span class="h2">Dementia syndromes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most patients with dementia do not present with a self-complaint of memory loss; it is often a spouse or other informant who brings the problem to the clinician's attention. Self-reported memory loss does not appear to correlate with the subsequent development of dementia, while informant-reported memory loss is a much better predictor of the current presence and future development of dementia [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. Nevertheless, family members are often delayed in recognizing the signs of dementia, many of which are inaccurately ascribed to aging.</p><p>An essential aspect of dementia is that the cognitive impairment represents a change from baseline. With most of the dementia syndromes, the change is gradual and progresses over time; however, that aspect may not be appreciated by family members. By the time the patient has stopped driving or managing finances, subtle but worsening clinical manifestations have often been present for at least a few years. </p><p>Memory difficulty is the most common chief complaint; in addition, patients with dementia also have difficulty with one or more of the following [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Retaining new information (eg, trouble remembering events)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Handling complex tasks (eg, balancing a checkbook)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reasoning (eg, unable to cope with unexpected events)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Spatial ability and orientation (eg, getting lost in familiar places)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Language (eg, word finding)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Behavior</p><p></p><p>Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular dementia comprise the majority of cases such that in the absence of other compelling anomalies, these are often diagnosed presumptively (see <a class="local">'Making a presumptive diagnosis'</a> below). Their clinical syndromes, however, are somewhat nonspecific:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Alzheimer disease most commonly occurs in older adults, typically older than 65 years and with increasing incidence and prevalence over the next two decades, with memory impairment as the most common initial symptom. Other common early features are impaired executive function and reduced insight. Behavioral and psychologic symptoms, apraxia, and sleep disturbance become more common as the disease progresses. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5071.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of Alzheimer disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Vascular dementia or vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), particularly that associated with arteriolosclerotic small vessel disease, has a cognitive profile that is characterized by prominent impairments in executive function and processing speed. A step-wise progression in association with recognized or unrecognized strokes is characteristic, but a more gradual progression is also reported, not infrequently with concomitant AD. In many cases, a clinically diagnosed stroke appears to initiate the onset of what has been called poststroke dementia. Signs and symptoms related to diagnosed or undiagnosed stroke may also be present. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will show evidence of vascular disease; however, the extent of changes does not clearly correlate with the severity of dementia and its poststroke progressive course. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5085.html" rel="external">"Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of vascular dementia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Different causes of dementia present with different patterns of cognitive impairment in association with other neurologic manifestations. These differences are not always easy to distinguish, particularly in the very early stages of illness. Very late in the disease course, when patients are very disabled, the syndromes are also not easily distinguishable. </p><p>Conditions that include parkinsonism (tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and/or postural instability) along with dementia include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lewy body diseases (eg, Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies [DLB]) produce a gradual, progressive decline in cognitive abilities with motor parkinsonism. The presence of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, visual hallucinations, fluctuations in level of alertness, and prominent visuospatial dysfunction favor DLB as the cause of or contributor to the dementia. Notably, the dementia of Parkinson disease emerges five to eight years after the onset of the movement disorder, whereas DLB manifests parkinsonism and cognitive decline contemporaneously. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5088.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5089.html" rel="external">"Cognitive impairment and dementia in Parkinson disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare disease that includes dementia and parkinsonism. Distinctive early features of this disorder include vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, especially diminished downgaze, and prominent postural instability with falls. Behavioral changes including apathy, disinhibition, dysphoria, and anxiety are common. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14136.html" rel="external">"Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP): Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is an umbrella term for olivopontocerebellar atrophy, striatonigral degeneration, and Shy-Drager syndrome, and commonly presents with parkinsonism.

Features that distinguish normal aging from dementia include that deficits are generally not very progressive and usually do not affect daily function. In a study of 161 community-dwelling, cognitively normal individuals ages 62 to 100 years, learning or acquisition performance declined uniformly with increasing age [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. By contrast, delayed recall or forgetting remained relatively stable. Similarly, a second report found that aging was associated with decline in learning of new information but not in memory retention [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate category in which the severity of cognitive change appears worse than expected for normal aging but does not meet criteria for dementia. Its presence indicates a greater risk of progression to dementia, but it may also be stable and not progress or even revert to normal. (See <a class="local">'Mild cognitive impairment'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5081.html" rel="external">"Mild cognitive impairment: Epidemiology, pathology, and clinical assessment"</a>.)</p><p>Cognitive impairment related to dementia must be distinguished from delirium and depression  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51421" href="/z/d/graphic/51421.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Delirium is usually acute or subacute in onset and is associated with prominent deficits in attention; patients have fluctuations in their level of consciousness and have difficulty maintaining concentration  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef103327" href="/z/d/graphic/103327.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The distinction between delirium and dementia can be difficult and sometimes impossible in acute presentations. Dementia is a significant risk factor for delirium, and thus, delirium and dementia can co-occur. In addition, some dementia syndromes such as DLB have overlapping features with delirium.

The presentation of depression as dementia has been called "pseudodementia" or, more recently, "dementia of depression." Patients with depression may have signs of psychomotor slowing and give poor effort on testing ("I just can't do this"), while those with dementia often try hard but respond with incorrect answers. It is important for the clinician and/or test administrator to estimate the effort given by the patient. It is also important to realize that depression and dementia can occur in the same patient and that patients with dementia present with depression as a presenting complaint. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1719.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis and management of late-life unipolar depression"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91774.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Clinical features", section on 'Symptoms'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A full dementia evaluation probably cannot be completed in a routine 30-minute visit; adequate time should be arranged in a follow-up appointment or an initial longer evaluation. A family member or close friend familiar with the patient should accompany them to the visits to present symptoms they have seen and remember what the patient is told. The initial step at the follow-up visit is an assessment of cognitive function. This should be followed by a complete physical examination, including neurologic examination. The subsequent work-up may include laboratory and imaging studies [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) and Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for the diagnosis of dementia (major neurocognitive disorder) are shown in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91276" href="/z/d/graphic/91276.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1595672754"><span class="h2">Screening for dementia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening for dementia in older adults [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>].

The customary medical, psychiatric, and social histories also provide relevant information.</p><p>Patients and informants are often uncertain about the onset of symptoms since the appearance of dementia is insidious. Useful questions for the patient and informant are, "When did you first notice the memory loss?" and "How has the memory loss progressed since then?" By the time the patient has stopped driving or managing finances, the disease has often been present for a few years. </p><p>An assessment of daily activities also provides evidence of impairment, particularly in the context of what the patient had done previously, at their baseline. Work and education history help establish baseline; their current participation in handling finances, community and social activities, driving, and other household tasks helps assess current performance.</p><p>The clinical interview also allows the examiner to establish rapport with the patient. The comfort level established during the interview may lessen the frequency and severity of any subsequent test and performance anxiety that may be engendered by explicit testing. Family members should be present at both examination and follow-up. When explaining findings, it is important to make eye contact with and speak directly to the patient, and avoid speaking to the family directly. Asking the family members to "please listen carefully while I talk to [the patient]" will let them know that the information is for them as well.</p><p>Questions guided by the differential diagnosis are also helpful, including loss of vision or motor function, tremor, poor balance, falls, difficulty walking, urinary incontinence, prominent personality changes, behavioral disturbances, visual hallucinations, abnormal sleep, and excessive alcohol use.

Cognitive and behavioral assessments are designed to distinguish normal and abnormal performance arising across a range of different conditions.

The scope of the evaluation should be guided by the complaints brought forward by the patient or family member. </p><p>The MMSE, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and other brief screening tests for dementia have a pooled sensitivity of 75 to 92 percent and a specificity of 81 to 91 percent [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].

Agreement between the history and the mental status examination is strongly suggestive of the diagnosis of dementia. When the history suggests cognitive impairment but the mental status examination is normal, possible explanations include mild dementia, high intelligence or education, depression, or, rarely, misrepresentation on the part of the informants [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Conversely, when the mental status examination suggests cognitive impairment but the family and patient deny any problems, possible explanations include an acute confusional state, very low intelligence or education, or inadequate recognition by the family [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. For some, the diagnosis of dementia is regarded as shameful, and reluctance to recognize or acknowledge the problem must be addressed.</p><p>Neuropsychological assessment (psychometric testing) may be useful in difficult situations; repeated clinical assessments over time (eg, 9 to 12 months) are often the most helpful tool.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H761415211"><span class="h2">Screening for depression</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All patients being evaluated for cognitive impairment or dementia should be screened for depression.

Some patients with clinical features consistent with a neurodegenerative condition are found to have a reversible cause of dementia on an imaging study (eg, subdural hematoma, normal pressure hydrocephalus [NPH], treatable cancer). Because these are uncommon, many published guidelines on the clinical evaluation of dementia do not recommend routine imaging studies but include clinical prediction rules to identify patients who might have one of these reversible causes [<a href="#rid3">3,25,27-33</a>]. The prediction rules vary but often include factors such as younger age (&lt;60 years), focal signs, and short duration of symptoms (less than two years), among others.

Such differences in practice may be attributable to the context in which the patient is seen. Neurologists, who may only see a person once or for a very limited time period, will usually obtain imaging on a patient referred from primary care, whereas a primary care clinician who has the advantage of serial observations over time in patients known to them may order imaging studies more selectively.

Atrophy must be interpreted relative to the patient's age and other factors. Normal brain aging is associated with some of the same changes, although typically age-related atrophy is less rapid, and usually less severe, than that of neurodegenerative disease. It is estimated that the brain loses approximately 0.5 percent of its volume each year in normal aging, compared with 1 to 2 percent in MCI and 2 to 4 percent in dementia due to AD [<a href="#rid35">35</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Certain regions of the brain show selective vulnerability to different neurodegenerative disorders.

The change from DSM-IV to DSM-5 presumably reflects the problem that some individuals with dementia due to causes other than Alzheimer disease (AD; as well as many early-onset AD phenotypes) did not meet definitional criteria because memory function was intact or at least relatively intact compared with norms. That being said, for the most common forms of dementia, memory and language dysfunction are generally always present. </p><p>Prior versions of the DSM definition have had good to very good reliability for the diagnosis of dementia [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].

Given that 5 percent of individuals over age 65 years and 35 to 50 percent of persons over age 85 years have dementia, the pretest probability of dementia in an older person with verified memory loss is estimated to be at least 60 percent.

The same exclusions (delirium, psychiatric disease) apply. A formal neuropsychiatric assessment might be needed in order to make this diagnosis, given that the cognitive deficits are mild. After ruling out medications or over-the-counter drugs that interfere with memory and ascertaining that comorbid conditions (depression, congestive heart failure, etc) are not causing the amnestic syndrome, there is often no imperative to make a formal diagnosis in most cases, as there are no specific treatments.

(See <a class="local">'Cognitive testing'</a> above.)</p><p>Most observational studies have demonstrated a relatively high sensitivity (80 to 98 percent) and specificity (44 to 98 percent) for detection of dementia [<a href="#rid4">4,44-50</a>]. In a 2001 practice parameter, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) concluded that neuropsychological batteries are useful in identifying patients with dementia, particularly when administered to those at higher risk by virtue of memory impairment [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Aggregate total score accurately differentiated normal individuals from those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD) [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. However, it is important to recognize that scores can also be influenced by education, age, and fluency with the language of testing [<a href="#rid52">52</a>].</p><p>In addition to its role in helping to discriminate between normal aging and dementia, neuropsychological testing can identify patterns of deficits that suggest a particular cause of dementia (eg, AD versus dementia with Lewy bodies [DLB]) [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. However, no single item on the panel has high discriminatory ability, and the pattern of performance on various domains must be interpreted in conjunction with the history, neuroimaging studies, and other testing to arrive at a presumptive etiologic diagnosis [<a href="#rid54">54</a>].</p><p>Follow-up testing or just serial observations generally provide more helpful information than a single study, particularly when results are equivocal, in that evidence of decline can predict future decline [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]. Perhaps the most important thing to remember is that AD is a progressive disorder, as are other neurodegenerative causes of dementia, so unless a diagnosis is needed urgently (not likely), observations over time have high diagnostic utility. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5081.html" rel="external">"Mild cognitive impairment: Epidemiology, pathology, and clinical assessment", section on 'Neuropsychological testing'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4095034502"><span class="h2">Genetic testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Genetic testing for the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele (which increases the risk of developing AD) is not currently recommended [<a href="#rid56">56</a>], nor is genetic testing for other potential causes of dementia (eg, specific mutations) unless there is a specific characteristic family history suggesting a familial dementia [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5071.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of Alzheimer disease", section on 'Genetic testing'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5070.html" rel="external">"Frontotemporal dementia: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Genetic testing'</a>.)</p><p>In the absence of a family history, genetic testing for AD in patients with dementia is controversial because of the potential for misinterpretation. As an example, not all patients who are homozygotes for the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele will develop AD [<a href="#rid57">57</a>]. In addition, the lack of specific treatments for these disorders makes this type of testing less imperative.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3285603099"><span class="h2">Advanced neuroimaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The use of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using beta amyloid and other tracers, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and other functional neuroimaging techniques to assist in the differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementia is an area of ongoing evolution.

These are unusual causes of dementia and also have unusual presentations. Thus, LP is typically performed only in the setting of a rapidly progressive dementia, or in a younger patient, or as a follow-up to another abnormality identified on clinical history (eg, HIV), examination, laboratory testing (eg, abnormal syphilis serology), or neuroimaging (eg, meningeal enhancement).

In one series of 90 consecutive biopsies undertaken for the investigation of dementia, 57 percent were diagnostic, although biopsy-obtained information led to specific treatment interventions in only 11 percent [<a href="#rid58">58</a>].</p><p>Increasingly, LP for specific biomarkers and PET scans for specific proteins have made consideration of cortical biopsy even less necessary and narrowed biopsy indications even further. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1219319752"><span class="h1">SPECIAL POPULATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H626205472"><span class="h2">Younger patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The evaluation of younger patients with dementia is presented separately.

However, cognitive difficulty observed in a patient encounter, and family or patient concerns for memory and cognition, require thorough evaluation. (See <a class="local">'Screening for dementia'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>History</strong> – Family members or other informants who know the patient well are invaluable resources for providing an adequate history of cognitive and behavioral changes. A drug history is particularly important, as many medications may impact cognition in older patients. (See <a class="local">'History'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cognitive and neurologic examination</strong> – Adequate time should be arranged for a full assessment of cognitive function, followed by a complete physical examination, including neurologic examination.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A brief screening assessment such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is useful and may be sufficient cognitive assessment in some patients. (See <a class="local">'Cognitive testing'</a> above and <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Depression screening</strong> – Depression is a common treatable comorbidity that may also masquerade as dementia. (See <a class="local">'Screening for depression'</a> above and <a class="local">'Dementia mimics'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Laboratory testing</strong> – Screening for B12 deficiency and hypothyroidism is recommended for patients being evaluated for dementia. Other laboratory testing is performed selectively. (See <a class="local">'Laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Genetic testing for the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele is not currently recommended, nor is genetic testing for other potential causes of dementia. (See <a class="local">'Genetic testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Neuroimaging</strong> – A noncontrast MRI or head CT should be considered in the initial evaluation of all patients with dementia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The purposes of structural imaging are to detect treatable causes of dementia and to differentiate among various dementia subtypes. (See <a class="local">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis and ongoing assessment</strong> – History and examination along with limited laboratory testing and a neuroimaging study are usually sufficient to make a diagnosis of dementia and in most cases to identify a presumptive cause.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">As most causes of dementia are progressive, a follow-up visit after several months can often confirm the original diagnosis, can offer ongoing treatment and monitoring, and, in some cases, may cause a clinician to reconsider the original diagnosis if the progression does not occur or is atypical. (See <a class="local">'Criteria for dementia'</a> above and <a class="local">'Dementia syndromes'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Role of specialized testing </strong>– Other tests (neuropsychological assessment, advanced neuroimaging techniques, lumbar puncture [LP], and, rarely, brain biopsy) are performed in selected patients (such as those who are younger or have a rapidly progressive course) and when the presentation is otherwise atypical.
