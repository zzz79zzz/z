It involves obtaining the family and medical history from the patient and referring clinician, obtaining and reviewing medical records of the patient and family members, including genetic testing results, understanding the patient's perception of risk of developing a condition or recurrence of a condition, advising the patient about the availability of and advantages and disadvantages of genetic testing, assisting in choosing the most appropriate genetic test(s), and determining the implications of genetic test results and possible interventions for risk reduction, all in the context of the value system most relevant to the patient and family.</p><p>This topic provides guidelines for genetic counseling, including interpretation of the family history and assessment of risk for common adult-onset conditions.</p><p>Additional discussions about genetic testing, use of genetic information to guide drug dosing (pharmacogenomics), disclosure of incidental findings from genetic testing, and a glossary of genetics terminology are provided on the following reviews:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Genetic testing – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2901.html" rel="external">"Genetic testing"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pharmacogenomics – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2904.html" rel="external">"Overview of pharmacogenomics"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Personalized medicine, including direct-to-consumer testing – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14599.html" rel="external">"Personalized medicine"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Disclosure of incidental findings from genetic testing – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/96539.html" rel="external">"Secondary findings from genetic testing"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Genetics terminology – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2898.html" rel="external">"Genetics: Glossary of terms"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6320972"><span class="h1">DEFINITION OF GENETIC COUNSELING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As defined by the National Society of Genetic Counselors, genetic counseling is the process of helping people understand and adapt to the medical, psychological, and familial implications of genetic contributions to disease [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. This process integrates:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Collection of a detailed family history; interpretation of the family history with the medical history to assess the chance of disease occurrence or recurrence</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Education of the patient (and family) regarding the inheritance, testing, management, risk reduction, available resources and research regarding the condition</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Counseling to promote informed choices and appropriate interventions</p><p></p><p>Information used in genetic counseling may come from the patient, family members, referring clinician, medical record, and test results from other sources. The patient's desire, ability, and willingness to obtain more information are also important especially if medical records or test results from other family members are important to risk assessment. Genetic risk assessment is most accurate using confirmed family history information. According to the health belief model, the patient's perception of risk also influences the behavior; patients who have a perceived higher risk may be more enthusiastic about researching than those who do not perceive an increased risk. The genetic counselor or clinical geneticist uses family and personal medical history to formulate a diagnosis or risk assessment. Genetic counseling also includes providing information about strategies to modify the risk, including the possibility of genetic testing, and ways to incorporate the information as it pertains to medical management, emotional response, and family dynamics.</p><p>Genetic counseling can be conducted at any time along a life spectrum, from pre-conception to old age. This includes pre-conception and prenatal counseling about the potential health of a baby, genetic evaluation of a neonate with congenital anomalies or a toddler with developmental delay. Some inherited conditions are present at birth, while others do not manifest until adolescence or adulthood. While some genetic diseases are well-recognized as occurring later in life (eg, Huntington disease), in the last few decades, discovery of genes implicated in common adult-onset conditions such as heart disease, movement disorders, and cancer have increased the role of genetic counseling for risk assessment in adults.</p><p>Most genetic services are provided as outpatient consultations to the primary care provider and/or appropriate specialist, such as the neurologist, cardiologist, or oncologist (for familial adult-onset syndromes), or obstetrician (for preconception or prenatal counseling). Typically, patients will be referred back to their physicians with recommendations for their follow-up care. However, some specialist clinics will continue to follow patients at regular intervals, especially in pediatrics. This is particularly important for metabolic conditions, in which lifelong dietary interventions or medications are required.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6319979"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS FOR REFERRAL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The indications for genetic counseling are increasing as genetic and genomic testing becomes more accurate and affordable and as more interventions to reduce disease risk become available. If the personal or family history includes a confirmed clinical diagnosis with a known genetic etiology such as hemophilia, neurofibromatosis, or Marfan syndrome, a referral may be appropriate if the patient has questions about inheritance patterns or risk to self.</p><p>Genetic counseling may be linked with genetic testing (either in offering appropriate testing or interpreting results of testing), but it also may be an integral part of patient care in the absence of genetic testing. In some cases, risk assessment and counseling may be helpful in determining that testing is not needed. Engaging genetic counselors and/or clinical geneticists can be extremely valuable in navigating these issues.</p><p>Primary care providers should be comfortable initiating the process by obtaining an initial family history (see <a class="local">'Family history'</a> below and <a class="local">'Information to send with the referral'</a> below), categorizing the likely genetic risk for the individual (see <a class="local">'Increased risk'</a> below), and assisting in identifying an appropriate genetics professional. (See <a class="local">'Where to refer'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H807221"><span class="h2">Increased risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An initial family history includes assessment of genetic conditions in first-, second-, and third-degree relatives. The degrees of relatedness and the contributions to genetic risk are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118334" href="/z/d/graphic/118334.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and illustrated in the family pedigree schematic  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef118335" href="/z/d/graphic/118335.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Once the family history is obtained, the individual's level of risk can be categorized as average, moderate, or high for most adult-onset conditions  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71096" href="/z/d/graphic/71096.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Individuals presenting with strong family histories for conditions with a known genetic basis (those considered high risk) should be offered a referral to a clinical geneticist or genetic counselor. These individuals may have a significantly greater lifetime risk for developing the disease, and disease onset may occur earlier than would be detected by general population screening guidelines (such as for cancer, neurodegenerative disorder, or cardiovascular condition). An important implication for management is the need for increased screening or screening initiation at an earlier age. (See <a class="local">'Risk modification'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Individuals at moderate risk may not require counseling unless there are unusual circumstances (eg, status of family members not available). These individuals often have a two- to threefold increased risk for disease. However, some of these individuals may be offered more intensive screening than is recommended for those in the general population. As an example, a patient whose father had colon cancer at age 55 would fall into the moderate risk category, with an estimated twofold increased risk for colon cancer [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. Colonoscopy for this patient would be recommended at age 40 rather than the usual 50 years of age. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7572.html" rel="external">"Screening for colorectal cancer in patients with a family history of colorectal cancer or advanced polyp"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Individuals at relatively low risk for an inherited condition may still meet criteria for genetic testing, often when therapeutic options are available for individuals with certain genotype and the results of genetic testing will impact treatment decisions. For example, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends genetic testing for every male with metastatic prostate cancer, regardless of family history [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Some of these individuals may meet with a genetics professional prior to genetic testing. </p><p></p><p>The distribution among risk categories depends on the patient population. Among 200 pedigrees from patients seen in a prenatal clinic, 1 to 10 percent were classified as high risk for at least one common adult condition, and 5 to 15 percent were classified as moderate risk [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Similar prevalence of high-risk patients has been reported in other studies [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Although high- and moderate-risk patients account for only a small portion of the patient population, these kindreds represent a significant proportion of the disease burden. As an example, a study in Utah found that while only 14 percent of the population had a positive family history for coronary heart disease (CHD), these kindreds accounted for 48 percent of all the CHD in the state and for 72 percent of all early onset CHD [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Despite the appropriateness of referral for genetic counseling of high-risk individuals, these referrals often are not made. This was illustrated in a 2015 survey of 5558 women from a tumor registry who had breast, ovarian, or endometrial cancer, of whom 820 were identified as candidates for genetic counseling referral based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Of these, only 178 (22 percent), were referred for genetic counseling. Barriers to referral may include a perceived lack of benefit, uncertainty about the implications, lack of awareness of available tests or genetics professionals, patient fear or reluctance to undergo testing, and/or cost and reimbursement issues [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6320149"><span class="h2">Uncertainty about genetic basis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For many common adult-onset conditions such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and certain neurologic conditions, clinicians may be uncertain whether there is sufficient information about the genetic etiology for a referral to be useful. The lack of sufficient information to inform the evaluation will be especially true if the family size is small and the age at which the condition developed is younger than average; many conditions with a genetic etiology will have a younger age of presentation compared with that typically seen in the general population. The rapid rate of gene discovery following the mapping of the genome and the advent of genome-wide association studies and genomic sequencing has exponentially increased the information available, making it challenging to stay informed. Genetic counseling may be appropriate to address this uncertainty, especially if the individual providing the counseling has specific expertise in the condition in question.</p><p>In addition, there may be opportunities to participate in ongoing research protocols that may result in new discoveries:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Research or registry opportunities may exist that may allow early access to new genetic information and medical management or prevention opportunities for identified individuals or families [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Some families may choose to bank DNA for the possibility of future genetic testing even if a research registry is not available</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H807228"><span class="h2">Patient anxiety or misunderstanding about risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patient anxiety about a family member's condition or misunderstanding of risk may raise additional questions and/or concerns. For individuals or families with anxiety or misunderstanding about genetic risk, a genetic counseling consultation can provide education and counseling to help the individual understand and cope with risk information and make management decisions [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. </p><p>However, it is important to note that not everyone with a concern about genetic etiology of disease in themselves or family members will meet criteria to be further evaluated by a genetic professional.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6319654"><span class="h1">PREPARATION FOR REFERRAL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A discussion between the referring clinician and the patient is essential to prepare the patient and make the counseling appointment as useful as possible. This may include a review of the features of the family history that prompted the referral and the likely content of the counseling visit [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Clarifying the patient's concerns and distinguishing them from the provider's concerns increases the productivity of the referral and follow-up communications. As an example, if a provider is interested in genetic testing, but no relevant genes are yet associated with the clinical presentation in the patient or family and there are no management changes regardless of the testing, the visit may be perceived as unnecessary by the patient. The National Society of Genetic Counselors has created a resource for patients who have questions about the genetic referral and how to prepare (<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=http%3A%2F%2Faboutgeneticcounselors.com%2F&amp;token=wGxlpOldzjbceXhYeK2mLjJM7bQHvlLka4Ijrd%2FKEnD2BZjJSJOZGWVPP3SJhemq&amp;TOPIC_ID=103304" target="_blank">http://aboutgeneticcounselors.com/</a>).</p><p>The practical aspects of the referral also need to be evaluated. Historically, genetic counseling has been associated with universities and major medical centers, although community hospitals are often including the service as well. In addition, companies that offer counseling using telehealth services (eg, telephone, videoconferencing) are becoming more common, making access to genetic counseling easier. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many health care institutions have expanded telehealth genetic counseling services, which may further expand options for patients. More insurance companies are requiring that genetic counseling precede genetic testing, usually from an entity other than the laboratory, and as a result, many insurance companies authorize coverage, although plans vary and it is important to have the patient check with the specific plan.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6319774"><span class="h2">Information to send with the referral</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Referring clinicians make the initial assessment of the patient's family history and potential risk of genetic disease to determine the need for a genetic counseling referral [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Once a decision is made to refer a patient to a clinical geneticist or genetic counselor, the referring clinician should provide the following information to the consultant:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>At <strong>minimum</strong>, the referral should be accompanied by the specific question to be addressed by the referral. It is more useful to ask the counselor to "please evaluate to identify test or screening appropriate for family history of both thyroid and early onset breast cancer" than it is to state "breast cancer."</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>It is helpful for the referral to be accompanied by available family history information, including affected family members, their relationship to the patient, and their age at diagnosis. (See <a class="local">'Family/medical history from the referring clinician'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A summary of the patient's pertinent medical history, including relevant laboratory test results and/or biopsy reports.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Information if genetic testing has been performed on a family member (and the result, if known).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1827095283"><span class="h2">Family/medical history from the referring clinician</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinician initiating the referral must obtain a family history that is sufficient to establish whether referral is appropriate. Generally, this involves collection of potentially relevant information limited to first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, children) and second-degree relatives (eg, grandparents, aunts, uncles, grandchildren, half-siblings); third-degree relatives may also be included. These categories of relatedness are listed in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118334" href="/z/d/graphic/118334.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and illustrated in the schematic  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef118335" href="/z/d/graphic/118335.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Key questions to ask in obtaining a family history relate to patient concerns about disease, problems with pregnancy, occurrence of congenital anomalies, early deaths or disease onset, and determination of nongenetic risk factors for disease. Additional questions related to family size (eg, "How many brothers and sisters do you have?"; "Do you come from a large family?") are often helpful in interpreting the responses to the screening questions. Assessment of consanguinity, in which parents share a common ancestor, can also be helpful for determining the risk for an autosomal recessive condition. Patients may be unaware of precise medical diagnoses in family members, but can provide revealing information regarding symptoms, surgeries, and medication use. Patients may neglect to mention the medical conditions of siblings or other relatives who have died (often the most informative information). Direct questions addressing these issues are also helpful.</p><p>While there are advantages to using a family health history, several barriers still exist for providers, patients, and medical record systems in general [<a href="#rid14">14-16</a>]. One study in community family medicine practices found that family histories were only discussed in 51 percent of new patient visits and 22 percent of follow-up visits [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. A study that surveyed community health center patients concluded that those who were more likely to talk with doctors as well as family members about their family health history were more likely to report a history of cancer or heart disease, opening the opportunity for clinicians to obtain a more comprehensive family history [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. However, even when the family history is discussed, the level of detail and documentation of the history are often insufficient for making adequate risk assessments [<a href="#rid6">6,19,20</a>].</p><p>In some situations, such as an early onset presentation of an adult-onset condition, a genetic consultation may be warranted even if there is no relevant family history [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Small family size or underrepresentation of one sex may limit the ability to recognize patterns in the pedigree. As an example, small families or families with few females may fail to exhibit a strong pattern of breast and ovarian cancer even if a genetic mutation in <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> is present [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Uncertainty in parentage (or incorrect attribution of parentage) may render a pedigree inaccurate. Population-based studies have found that up to 15 percent of individuals may misidentify parentage [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. In other situations, such as adoption or estrangement, the family history may be unknown.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There may be other reasons for a negative family history, including risk-reducing interventions in some family members (eg, cholesterol lowering agent in an individual at risk for coronary heart disease, prophylactic mastectomy in an individual at high risk for breast cancer); incomplete penetrance of a disorder; or the affected individual may be the first in the family to carry the disease-associated gene variant (ie, a new mutation in the index case). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/96539.html" rel="external">"Secondary findings from genetic testing", section on 'Likelihood of detecting a secondary finding'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>It is also important to update the family history at subsequent visits, as the family history is dynamic and disease that was not previously apparent in a family member may become manifest. Follow-up visits should include questioning about recent deaths, births, or new diagnoses of significant conditions in family members.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1169524521"><span class="h2">Educating the patient regarding expectations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients should be informed of where they are being referred and what the process for scheduling an appointment will be if known (Will the clinic call the patient, or is the patient being asked to contact the clinic?). </p><p>The patient should know the reason for the referral and what question is to be answered (Is the pattern of disease consistent with a hereditary condition? Should the patient's management be altered? What are the risks for family members?). </p><p>Because genetic counseling does not always result in a recommendation for genetic testing, it is helpful for patients to be informed that they are being referred to determine whether genetic testing would be appropriate, rather than to have genetic testing. If the sole expectation of the visit is to have a genetic test done and this does not happen, patients can be frustrated rather than valuing that their risks and management could be better determined by other means, such as a family history-based assessment.</p><p>For individuals with a family history of a consanguineous relationship (ie, a common ancestor shared by both partners), there may be an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as fetal congenital anomaly, stillbirth, or perinatal mortality. The rate of consanguinity varies significantly between populations.

For patients with familial polyposis, colonoscopy screening is initiated at an earlier age than the general population.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If genetic testing identifies a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant, other at-risk family members can also be tested for the specific variant. For many conditions, screening and risk reduction strategies can be implemented for appropriate family members. Counseling regarding the risk in family members and discussions about family member testing and their notification (typically, by the affected individual using a letter prepared jointly by a genetic counselor and physician) are discussed separately.

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on "patient info" and the keyword(s) of interest.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Basics topics (see  <a class="medical medical_basics" href="/z/d/html/117182.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Genetic testing (The Basics)"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25206748"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Definition</strong> – Genetic counseling is the process of helping people understand and adapt to the medical, psychological, and familial implications of genetic contributions to disease. Most consultations occur over one to three visits. A preliminary assessment based on available data and family history  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef118335" href="/z/d/graphic/118335.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) may be conducted before the patient is seen. The initial visit focuses on reviewing information, providing accurate risk assessment, and addressing psychosocial issues. (See <a class="local">'Definition of genetic counseling'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indications</strong> – Individuals with strong family histories for conditions with known genetic bases considered high risk  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71096" href="/z/d/graphic/71096.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) should be offered referral to a genetics professional. Referral may also be appropriate if there is uncertainty about the genetic contributions to a disease in a family, patient anxiety about a family member's condition, or misunderstanding of risk. (See <a class="local">'Indications for referral'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preparation</strong> – The referral should include specific questions to be addressed, a summary of the family history, and patient's medical history, and results of available testing. The patient should understand that they are being referred to determine whether testing would be helpful. (See <a class="local">'Preparation for referral'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Risk assessment</strong> – The family history is the initial step in assessing inherited risk for many chronic conditions. When possible, patients should be encouraged to complete written or online family history questionnaires prior to their initial visit. Online resources are available for collecting family history information and constructing a family tree (pedigree) (see <a class="local">'Pedigree'</a> above). The family history should be clearly and completely documented in the medical record. (See <a class="local">'Family history'</a> above and <a class="local">'Initial risk assessment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Support and advice</strong> – The genetic counseling session also provides psychosocial support and information about risk modification strategies that may be appropriate for the patient and/or family. This may involve more aggressive screening (earlier, more frequent, other modalities), lifestyle or dietary modifications, and/or medical or surgical interventions. The counselor and referring clinician can coordinate long-term risk modification and management for patients and affected family members. The primary care clinician is often responsible for long-term follow-up. (See <a class="local">'Questions that may arise related to a genetic test result'</a> above and <a class="local">'Psychosocial support'</a> above and <a class="local">'Risk modification'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Testing and disclosure</strong> – Separate topic reviews discuss genetics terminology, genetic testing, personalized medicine (including direct-to-consumer testing), genomic sequencing, and disclosure of incidental findings from genetic testing. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2898.html" rel="external">"Genetics: Glossary of terms"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2901.html" rel="external">"Genetic testing"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14599.html" rel="external">"Personalized medicine"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/96539.html" rel="external">"Secondary findings from genetic testing"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H539087705"><span class="h1">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges Vickie Venne, MS, CGC, and Deborah Hartzfeld, MS, CGC, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">National Society of Genetic Counselors' Definition Task Force, Resta R, Biesecker BB, et al.
