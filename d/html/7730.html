         Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. GISTs that arise from the bowel wall typically present as subepithelial neoplasms in the stomach and small intestine; however, they can arise in any portion of the gastrointestinal tract and, occasionally, the omentum, mesentery, and peritoneum. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7745.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors", section on 'Clinical presentation'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Most GISTs harbor characteristic mutations in
         <em>
          KIT
         </em>
         or platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (
         <em>
          PDGFRA
         </em>
         ), which result in constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase receptors KIT and PDGFRA, respectively. Other GISTs have no detectable mutations in either
         <em>
          KIT
         </em>
         or
         <em>
          PDGFRA
         </em>
         (ie, "wildtype" GISTs); a majority of these have molecular alterations in either succinate dehydrogenase (
         <em>
          SDH
         </em>
         ) or other genes. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7745.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors", section on 'Molecular alterations'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8961" href="/z/d/drug information/8961.html" rel="external">
          imatinib
         </a>
         , inhibit tumor proliferation by blocking KIT and PDGFRA signaling, and are used to treat advanced and metastatic disease. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7725.html" rel="external">
          "Tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy for advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         TKIs can also be used to treat GISTs in the adjuvant setting (ie, after complete resection of a primary tumor at sufficient risk of recurrence) and the neoadjuvant setting (ie, to reduce tumor burden in locally advanced disease prior to resection). The approach to adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy for GISTs will be discussed here. The clinical presentation, diagnosis, prognosis, local treatments, and the use of TKIs for advanced GISTs are discussed separately.

          Surgery versus surveillance
         </strong>
         – All apparently localized GISTs ≥2 cm in size should be resected. However, there is no consensus on the management of smaller tumors, and management must be individualized. Although small gastric GISTs may be followed endoscopically until they grow or become symptomatic, the optimal frequency of follow-up and specific risks of this strategy are uncertain. An algorithmic approach to management of GISTs based upon size and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) appearance  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef139723" href="/z/d/graphic/139723.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1

          2
         </a>
         ] for gastric GISTs but not those at other sites in the GI tract. We agree with this approach. When endoscopic assessment is not possible, excision is the standard approach. (See

         – The goal of surgical treatment is macroscopically complete resection, if possible. While surgical resection is the treatment of choice for potentially resectable tumors, initial neoadjuvant therapy with

          Estimating recurrence risk

         – There is no consensus as to the indications for surgical management in patients with metastatic GIST.

         The optimal selection of patients with resected disease who are at sufficiently high risk for recurrence to warrant adjuvant therapy is not established. Several risk stratification tools are available, based upon tumor size, mitotic rate, location, the presence or absence of tumor rupture, and completeness of resection. However, particularly for tools, such as nomograms, that quantify the risk of disease recurrence after complete resection as a continuous variable, it is not clear what cutoff for disease recurrence should be used to select patients for

          imatinib

         . Thus, each case must be approached individually, balancing the estimated likelihood of a disease recurrence (based upon anatomic site, size, mitotic rate, and presence or absence of tumor rupture) with the risks of therapy. (See

         Some centers, including that of the authors, routinely genotype all patients with resected GIST who are being considered for adjuvant

         <em>
          PDGFRA

         exon 9 mutation, higher-dose imatinib (800 rather than 400 mg daily) is a reasonable option, if tolerated, although there are no prospective data upon which to base a recommendation either for or against this practice.

         The standard of care for patients with a primary resectable GIST is surgery, aiming for a macroscopically complete resection with negative microscopic margins. Complete resection is possible in the majority of localized GISTs, but only approximately one-half remain recurrence-free for five or more years with surgery alone. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Several criteria have been proposed, originally to classify the malignant potential of a GIST. Although the terms "benign" and "malignant" are not applied to GIST since all but subcentimeter tumors are considered to have at least some potential to behave in a malignant fashion (either with unresectable invasive recurrence or with metastatic disease), tumor size, mitotic rate, and site of tumor origin have gained the greatest acceptance as being predictive of the risk of recurrence and/or metastases [

         Risk stratification models, such as the original National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus criteria, have been proposed to distinguish prognosis in resected GIST  (

In the series of 289 patients used to construct this model, the cumulative five-year disease-specific survival rates for GISTs classified as risk level I through IV were 100, 96, 67, and 25 percent, respectively. The prognostic importance of mitotic rate, tumor size, and location was confirmed in an analysis of the adjuvant

        <p>
         Models such as these do not take into account the location of the primary GIST lesion. In general, tumors arising from the small bowel, colon, rectum, or mesentery are associated with less favorable outcomes than those arising from the stomach [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-9

        </p>
        <p>
         Based on data from the AFIP model, a tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system for GIST was developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) and published in 2010 [
         <a href="#rid10">

Although the T and N designations are the same for all disease sites, there are separate stage groupings for gastric/omental and small bowel/esophageal/colorectal/mesenteric and peritoneal primaries. Rates of disease progression for gastric, small bowel, and rectal GISTs, stratified by stage at diagnosis, are presented in the tables  (

         ] and incomplete resection are also independent risk factors that negatively impact disease-free survival. A modification of the NIH consensus criteria for risk stratification has been proposed that incorporates both site and tumor rupture as prognostic variables [

However, there is no clear consensus from expert groups as to what cutoff might constitute the lowest "acceptable" level of risk for metastasis or recurrence that would justify the use of adjuvant imatinib. Furthermore, it is not clear that any one prognostication tool outperforms the others [

         ]. Large tumor size, high mitotic counts, non-gastric location, presence of rupture, and male sex were all independent adverse prognostic factors. Most recurrences occurred within the first five years of follow-up, and most patients were cured by surgery alone (estimated 5-, 10-, and 15-year relapse-free survival [RFS] rates 71, 63, and 60 percent, respectively).
        </p>
        <p>
         A comparison of the NIH, modified NIH, and AFIP criteria showed that all risk stratification schemes appropriately predicted RFS and identified high-risk patients. The proposed modified NIH criteria  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef85938" href="/z/d/graphic/85938.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>

         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ] were best at identifying a single subgroup of patients at high-risk of recurrence [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. With all of the different classification schemes, those patients who were identified as intermediate-risk had a clinical course that was similar to that of the low-risk group, suggesting that only the high-risk patients would likely benefit from adjuvant therapy. These investigators also developed a novel risk stratification scheme in which tumor size and mitotic counts were assessed as continuous non-linear variables; novel prognostic contour maps were generated based upon these data plus site and tumor rupture. These maps were better than conventional models at predicting 10-year risk for GIST recurrence and would be particularly useful for discussing individual risk with patients as they are graphic and easy to explain.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whether the results of molecular testing should also be integrated into risk stratification schemes is unclear. There has been relatively little work to make predictions of risk based on genotypic subsets of primary resected GIST, although there are data to support the fact that certain genotypes (such as
         <em>
          KIT
         </em>
         wildtype GISTs that are SDH-deficient or NF-related, or platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha [
         <em>
          PDGFRA

          imatinib

         in the ACOSOG Z9001 trial. Among the possible reasons are the short duration of follow-up, the limited number of relapses, and the high degree of efficacy of imatinib in relapsed disease [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22

         ]. Furthermore, after the study was unblinded, all patients randomized to placebo were allowed to crossover to active treatment, thus obscuring any potential differences in OS between the groups.

        <p>
         Based upon these findings,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8961" href="/z/d/drug information/8961.html" rel="external">
          imatinib
         </a>
         was given accelerated approval in the United States in 2008 for adjuvant treatment of completely resected GISTs ≥3 cm in size, without definitive guidance as to the optimal duration of treatment or which patients are most likely to benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8961" href="/z/d/drug information/8961.html" rel="external">
          imatinib
         </a>
         was clearly effective at reducing disease recurrence in this trial, key questions remain. Two important issues are the value of longer duration imatinib following complete resection and the definition of subsets of patients who derive the most benefit from adjuvant imatinib. Patients with GIST of more than 3 cm are a highly heterogeneous population within which the risk of relapse and death varies considerably. Furthermore, as noted above, the risk of relapse is affected not only by size, but also by mitotic index, location of the primary site, and molecular factors. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Estimation of recurrence risk'
         </a>
         above.)

         Refining the indications for adjuvant treatment remains a big task for future studies.

         <a href="#rid26">
          26

         duration also influence prognosis. A multivariate analysis of data from the SSG XVIII trial identified four factors other than imatinib duration as being independently predictive of disease recurrence, including non-gastric location, high mitotic count, tumor rupture, and large size [

          13

         is administered for a minimum of three years after resection. Whether treatment should be continued for longer than three years is not known. Rates of disease recurrence have been high within 6 to 12 months of discontinuing adjuvant imatinib for up to three years, and it is possible that imatinib is maintaining tumor dormancy rather than eradicating microdeposits. Patients with intermediate- or high-risk tumors who are tolerating adjuvant imatinib may choose to remain on therapy for a total of five years or longer, rather than be subject to an increased rate of recurrence following discontinuation of the drug.

         Furthermore, although OS was improved with three years, as compared with one year, of therapy, suggesting an actual increase in cure, the survival gap became smaller with long-term follow-up [

         ); intermediate- or high-risk disease was defined as a primary GIST of any site ≥2 cm with a mitotic count ≥5 per 50 HPF, or a non-gastric primary GIST ≥5 cm. All patients received imatinib 400 mg daily for five years or until relapse, progression, or intolerance [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. Among the 91 enrolled patients, the median treatment duration was 55.1 months, and only 50 percent of patients completed a full five years of treatment. The main reasons for stopping treatment early were patient choice and adverse drug effects. The five-year estimate of RFS was 90 percent, while the OS rate at five years was 95 percent. One patient recurred and died during adjuvant imatinib; this patient had an imatinib-insensitive
         <em>
          PDGFRA
         </em>
         D842V mutation. Six other patients recurred after imatinib discontinuation. These results suggest that five years of imatinib therapy is effective in preventing recurrence in patients with sensitive mutations. However, nearly one-half of patients discontinued study treatment before five years of therapy, and most recurrences occurred after treatment discontinuation.
        </p>
        <p>
         With longer-term follow-up, if the same steep recurrence rates after treatment discontinuation are seen as were observed in the SSG XVIII trial, it will be likely that these patients had micrometastases that were not eradicated but remained under control for many years through drug therapy, and that even longer duration

        </p>
        <p>
         Given the lack of a control arm, the PERSIST-5 trial does not prove that therapy for longer than three years will be beneficial.

Five-year RFS rates for the one-year, one-to-three-year, three-to-five-year, and more than five-year groups were 52, 72, 73, and 93 percent, respectively, while the corresponding rates for five-year OS were 44, 82, 84, and 97 percent, respectively. Of the 190 patients who were classified as high risk according to the 2008 NIH risk classification scheme  (

The RFS rate of patients receiving imatinib for longer than five years was significantly better than that of those receiving treatment for less than five years. In contrast, among the 44 with intermediate-risk disease  (

Although risk stratification tools are available based upon tumor size, mitotic rate, location, and in some cases, the presence or absence of tumor rupture, it is not clear what cutoff for disease recurrence should be used to select patients for imatinib.

However, whether all patients in this broad category have a high enough risk of recurrence to warrant adjuvant therapy is not established.

         There are several clinical scenarios for preoperative (neoadjuvant) therapy. In all cases, the goal of treatment is a reduction in tumor size that may facilitate complete surgical resection and/or increase the likelihood of organ preservation.

        <p>
         For patients who are bleeding, the approach taken depends on the severity of the bleed. If the bleeding is brisk and life threatening, the patient needs surgery. However, if the patient is too frail to survive surgery, treatment with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8961" href="/z/d/drug information/8961.html" rel="external">
          imatinib

        </p>
        <p>
         An important point is that preoperative

          imatinib
         </a>
         prohibits accurate assessment of recurrence risk based upon analysis of the surgical resection specimen. As a result, for patients undergoing neoadjuvant imatinib, we continue imatinib postoperatively to complete a total of three years of imatinib therapy (combined preoperative and postoperative).

         Thirty of the 52 analyzable patients had locally advanced primaries, and 22 had locally recurrent or potentially resectable metastatic disease. Among the patients with localized primary disease, only two (7 percent) had an objective response to preoperative

         In the latest update, at a median follow-up of 5.1 years, the estimated five-year progression-free and disease-specific survival rates for patients presenting with localized primary disease were 57 and 77 percent, respectively; the corresponding rates were 30 and 68 percent in those with recurrent or metastatic disease [

The objective response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) was 62 percent, and the complete (R0) resection rate was 91 percent (48 of 53). Of the 48 patients undergoing R0 resection, preservation of at least one-half of the stomach was achieved in 42. After R0 resection, all patients received imatinib at the same dose as was used preoperatively for at least one year.

         Patients being considered for neoadjuvant treatment of a GIST should be managed in a center that has a strong multidisciplinary team approach. The usual schema is to administer
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8961" href="/z/d/drug information/8961.html" rel="external">
          imatinib

        <p>
         The best method to assess response of a GIST to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is controversial. PET-CT scanning using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is highly sensitive for detecting GIST, as for other types of tumors with a high glucose metabolism. Accumulating data support the view that very early evidence of tumor response (within days of instituting
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8961" href="/z/d/drug information/8961.html" rel="external">
          imatinib

         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]) can be obtained by the use of metabolic imaging as compared with conventional CT scanning. A clinical scenario where obtaining a baseline and follow-up PET-CT scan after two to four weeks of TKI therapy might prove useful is a borderline resectable GIST (or a potentially resectable tumor that requires extensive organ disruption), in which there is a narrow window for moving to alternative therapy (eg, potentially function-impairing resection or alternative TKI) if imatinib were to be ineffective. This is particularly important if routine genotyping is not practiced. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Imatinib dose'

        <p>
         However, in most cases, periodic cross-sectional imaging using conventional CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis every eight to twelve weeks is sufficient to assess response. The following caveats must be kept in mind, however (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7725.html" rel="external">

         Radiographically, GISTs may actually increase in size during early treatment as a consequence of intratumoral hemorrhage or myxoid degeneration. A decrease in tumor density as seen on CT (the corollary of decreased FDG uptake on PET, see above) is an important early clinical marker of antitumor activity. Once tumors become hypodense (cystic), the size of the lesions may decrease slowly and eventually stabilize.

In these situations, the size of the primary tumor (eg, &gt;15 cm) often is justification enough for consideration of adjuvant therapy.

         There are no evidence-based guidelines on what constitutes appropriate follow-up after treatment of a GIST, and there is no consensus on this issue. Relapses most often occur to the liver and/or peritoneum; other sites of metastases, including bone metastases, are rare. Guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [

         Very low-risk tumors do not require routine follow-up, although patients should be informed that recurrences are still possible. We generally offer one abdominal CT two years following treatment completion, as most recurrences are mesenteric and can be better visualized on CT; if there is no evidence of disease recurrence, we do not offer further imaging. Another option is imaging annually or every two years, although data are limited for this approach and patients should be counseled on the risks of radiation exposure.

         UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, "The Basics" and "Beyond the Basics." The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.

          Surgical resection
         </strong>
         – The standard treatment for patients with a primary resectable GIST is surgery, aiming for a macroscopically complete resection with negative microscopic margins  (

         <strong>
          Estimating recurrence risk
         </strong>
         – An estimation of recurrence risk following resection of a GIST is used to select patients for adjuvant

         </strong>
         – For most patients with GIST, standard initial treatment is with surgery rather than neoadjuvant systemic therapy. Exceptions are made for the following subsets of patients with tumors with either a

          Rectal tumors
         </strong>
         – For such patients with a rectal tumor, neoadjuvant

         <strong>
          Locally advanced tumors without distant metastases
         </strong>
         – For patients with a nonmetastatic locally advanced or borderline resectable GIST, we suggest initial therapy with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8961" href="/z/d/drug information/8961.html" rel="external">
          imatinib
         </a>
         rather than attempted resection (

          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). For such patients, neoadjuvant imatinib prior to surgery may be helpful to facilitate resection and/or reduce surgical morbidity. If possible, such patients should be enrolled in a clinical trial. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Neoadjuvant therapy'

         <strong>
          Rationale
         </strong>
         – The rationale for this approach is that upfront surgery in the above cases may lead to unnecessary morbidity;
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8961" href="/z/d/drug information/8961.html" rel="external">
          imatinib
         </a>
         is an effective systemic therapy that can improve subsequent surgical outcomes. Neoadjuvant therapy may permit patients to switch from an open to a minimally invasive surgical approach, avoid complex multivisceral resection, or preserve the affected organ in those with disease involving the esophagus, esophagogastric junction, duodenum, or rectum. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Indications for neoadjuvant therapy'

         <strong>
          Molecular genotyping
         </strong>
         – For most patients being evaluated for neoadjuvant
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8961" href="/z/d/drug information/8961.html" rel="external">
          imatinib
         </a>
         , testing for specific molecular alterations can be used to guide the selection and dosing of neoadjuvant therapy  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef139727" href="/z/d/graphic/139727.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 2

         ). (See

         <strong>
          Dosing
         </strong>
         – For most patients, we initiate neoadjuvant
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8961" href="/z/d/drug information/8961.html" rel="external">
          imatinib
         </a>
         at a dose of 400 mg daily. If an exon 9 mutation is identified in a rare patient being considered for neoadjuvant imatinib, the option of a higher daily dose (800 mg per day) should be discussed with patients, although there are no prospective data upon which to base a recommendation either for or against this practice. Most of these patients will have a small bowel primary tumor and be referred for upfront surgery rather than neoadjuvant imatinib. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Imatinib dose'

         <strong>
          Response assessment
         </strong>
         – If genotyping for molecular alterations is not available or routinely pursued, it is wise to check for an early response to neoadjuvant

          imatinib

         <strong>
          Treatment duration
         </strong>
         – The optimal duration of neoadjuvant TKIs is not established. The decision as to how long to administer

          imatinib

         and when to operate (ie, at first resectability versus after achieving maximal response) must be individualized and based upon drug tolerance, tumor location and extent, the results of periodic radiographic assessment, and the urgency of surgical treatment. In general, we treat to maximal response and try to limit neoadjuvant treatment to no more than 10 to 12 months. (See
         <a class="local">
