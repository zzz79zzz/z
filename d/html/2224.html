Over 90 percent of women with epilepsy will have good outcomes [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>There are several important issues to be addressed by the care team when a woman with seizures becomes pregnant. Successful management of these pregnancies therefore ideally involves prepregnancy consultation and close collaboration between the obstetric and neurology providers as a multidisciplinary team.</p><p>This topic will discuss the management of epilepsy during pregnancy, delivery, and the postpartum period. The risks associated with epilepsy and the risks of antiseizure medication (ASM) treatment during pregnancy are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2218.html" rel="external">"Risks associated with epilepsy during pregnancy and the postpartum period"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3274730695"><span class="h1">RISK CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Historically, considerations of the effects of epilepsy on pregnancy have focused on the structural and neurodevelopmental teratogenic effects of antiseizure medications (ASMs). While these considerations are important, they overlook the risks associated with nonteratogenic outcomes of pregnancy. These issues are reviewed briefly here and discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2218.html" rel="external">"Risks associated with epilepsy during pregnancy and the postpartum period"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>What effect do maternal epilepsy and seizures have on the course of pregnancy? Patients with epilepsy may be at increased risk for a range of perinatal complications compared with the general population, including pre-eclampsia, premature delivery, hemorrhage, fetal growth restriction, and stillbirth. Studies have also suggested an increased risk of maternal mortality. These risks emphasize the importance of careful monitoring during pregnancy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2218.html" rel="external">"Risks associated with epilepsy during pregnancy and the postpartum period", section on 'Morbidity and mortality'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>What effect does pregnancy have on seizure risk? Most women with epilepsy will have no alteration of their seizure pattern during pregnancy, but some women experience seizure worsening compared with their baseline. Possible risk factors for increased seizures during pregnancy include baseline seizure frequency before pregnancy, underlying localization-related (focal) epilepsy, ASM polytherapy, patient adherence, and altered pharmacokinetics of ASMs during pregnancy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2218.html" rel="external">"Risks associated with epilepsy during pregnancy and the postpartum period", section on 'Effect of pregnancy on seizures'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>What effect do ASMs have on the fetus? Major congenital malformations are more common in fetuses exposed to ASMs in utero compared with offspring of untreated women with epilepsy and women without epilepsy. Across all studies, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10035" href="/d/drug information/10035.html" rel="external">valproate</a> carries the highest risk for major malformations. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9769" href="/d/drug information/9769.html" rel="external">Phenytoin</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9763" href="/d/drug information/9763.html" rel="external">phenobarbital</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10006" href="/d/drug information/10006.html" rel="external">topiramate</a> have also been associated with relatively high baseline rates of major malformations. Some ASM polytherapy regimens also increase the risk, particularly those that include topiramate or valproate. In utero exposure to some ASMs is associated with impaired cognitive and neurologic development. The spectrum of structural and neurodevelopmental teratogenic risks for different ASM monotherapies is depicted in the figure  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef118230" href="/d/graphic/118230.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2218.html" rel="external">"Risks associated with epilepsy during pregnancy and the postpartum period", section on 'Effects of ASMs on the fetus and child'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PRECONCEPTION MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A broad overview of the management of women with epilepsy, beginning before conception, is provided in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef126399" href="/d/graphic/126399.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3271644542"><span class="h2">Counseling</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Counseling all women of childbearing age about potential future pregnancies is important because approximately one-half of pregnancies are unplanned and the risks of complications can be minimized by interventions before and early on in pregnancy [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. In addition, many women with epilepsy report limited knowledge about key issues regarding pregnancy and childbirth [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Therefore, clinicians should discuss the importance of planning a pregnancy for women with epilepsy who are of childbearing potential at each visit [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Such counseling should include information about contraception, the potential of antiseizure medications (ASMs) to cause contraceptive failure, contraceptive efficacy considering the ASM prescribed, the risks of ASMs on pregnancy outcomes, possible changes needed to optimize the ASM regimen, and the importance of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8475" href="/d/drug information/8475.html" rel="external">folic acid</a> supplementation to prevent neural tube defects [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Folic acid supplementation'</a> below.)</p><p>Additionally, as many states in the US have legalized the use of recreational marijuana, its use in pregnancy is increasing [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. However, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists warns against marijuana use during pregnancy or lactation [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Patients should be instructed not to use marijuana for seizure control or as an adjunctive treatment for seizure control during pregnancy. In particular, effects on the developing fetal brain are likely and have not yet been characterized.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3659796643"><span class="h2">Contraception</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ideally, pregnancies for women on ASMs should be planned. This allows the clinical team and the patient to choose the best treatment regimen for disease control that has an acceptably low structural and neurodevelopmental teratogenic risk profile. For women taking hormonal contraceptives, the use of enzyme-inducing ASMs is associated with an elevated risk of unplanned pregnancies [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Thus, for women on these ASMs, it is ideal to use an intrauterine device (IUD) or intramuscular depot <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9600" href="/d/drug information/9600.html"

Another study in women using the etonogestrel contraceptive implant demonstrated that carbamazepine lowered etonogestrel concentrations below the threshold of ovulatory suppression [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Finally, a study of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10006" href="/d/drug information/10006.html" rel="external">topiramate</a> also demonstrated that even this weak enzyme-inducing ASM can have significant effects on etonogestrel levels, reducing them to below the threshold of ovulatory suppression in 30 percent of users [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Contraceptive failure in women taking enzyme-inducing ASMs during use of hormonal pill, patch, or ring contraceptives as well as progestin implants has been described in multiple reports [<a href="#rid11">11,14,16</a>].

Efficacy rates of various contraceptive options in the general population are reviewed separately.

Thus, for patients on these ASMs, the intrauterine device is the preferred method of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC).

Some patients can be well controlled with serum concentrations below the “therapeutic range.” There are abundant, consistent data verifying that valproate carries a substantially increased risk for major congenital malformations, adverse neurodevelopmental consequences, and autism/autism spectrum disorder. While the valproate-associated teratogenic and neurodevelopmental risk are dose-related, there is no “safe” dose at which these risks are eliminated [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].

Both diagnoses (eclampsia and new onset or late relapse of epilepsy) can be pursued and treated in parallel until one can be safely excluded.

Lamotrigine clearance decreases quickly in the first few weeks postpartum, and dose adjustments should be made relatively quickly. In one case series, adherence to a postpartum taper schedule of lamotrigine over 10 days reduced the likelihood of maternal lamotrigine toxicity [<a href="#rid59">59</a>]. The dose was incrementally reduced at postpartum days 3, 7, and 10, with return to preconception dose or preconception dose plus 50 mg to help counteract the effects of sleep deprivation. A later formal pharmacokinetic modeling study of lamotrigine clearance postpartum suggested that it could take up to 19 days after delivery for return to baseline clearance [<a href="#rid64">64</a>], so we now aim for reaching our target dose at approximately two weeks postpartum.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3240893082"><span class="h2">Avoiding sleep deprivation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The risk of seizures may be increased in the postpartum period, sometimes for several months, due to sleep deprivation [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Families and caregivers should be counseled, ideally as a function of prenatal care, to plan adequate sleep while caring for a newborn. Typically, most families and caregivers adopt a "shift" approach so the mother can reliably obtain uninterrupted and regular nightly sleep, and many couples enlist the help of other relatives. Additionally, even if the mother has been seizure free for a long time, she should take a more conservative safety approach until she is getting regular sleep again, given that sleep deprivation is a strong provoker of many seizure types [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H432715122"><span class="h2">Safety precautions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Common sense safety considerations must be discussed; these include not driving, not having the mother bathe the baby alone, and not co-sleeping with the baby. Baby carriers should generally be discouraged, and mothers encouraged to transport their baby in a stroller. The mother should also be discouraged in the early postpartum period from taking a bath herself behind a closed, locked door or when no other adult is around.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h2">Breastfeeding</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Given the benefits to breastfeeding with regard to both short- and long-term neonatal health, taking ASMs does not contraindicate breastfeeding [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. However, we acknowledge that new mothers with epilepsy are less likely to breastfeed compared with new mothers from the general population [<a href="#rid92">92-94</a>]. Therefore, clinicians should reinforce the benefits and consider lactation consultation [<a href="#rid94">94</a>].</p><p>In agreement with a 2019 report from International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Task Force on Women and Pregnancy [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], we encourage women to consider breastfeeding, but with adaptation according to how sensitive their seizures are to sleep deprivation, based upon their history and their epilepsy syndrome. Many women choose to breastfeed but will introduce the bottle in the hospital. This allows another adult to give at least one feeding via bottled formula or pumped breastmilk, permitting the mother to obtain at least one four-hour stretch of uninterrupted sleep per 24 hours. We recommend this and another two hours of sleep through naps to achieve a minimum of six hours of sleep per 24 hours to reduce the risk of seizures. However, there are no high-quality studies evaluating the risk of seizures in the postpartum period relative to specific sleep patterns.</p><p>All of the ASMs are measurable in breast milk, but levels in breast milk are variable [<a href="#rid95">95-97</a>]. The reported percentage of maternal plasma levels in breast milk varies from 5 to 10 percent with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10035" href="/d/drug information/10035.html" rel="external">valproate</a> [<a href="#rid98">98</a>], to 41 percent with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9545" href="/d/drug information/9545.html" rel="external">lamotrigine</a> [<a href="#rid99">99</a>], to 90 percent with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9440" href="/d/drug information/9440.html" rel="external">ethosuximide</a> [<a href="#rid100">100</a>], to 100 percent with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9904" href="/d/drug information/9904.html" rel="external">levetiracetam</a> [<a href="#rid101">101</a>]. However, the ASM levels in the nursing infant's blood are often much lower [<a href="#rid102">102</a>], and are always substantially lower than the umbilical cord blood ASM concentration at delivery, which is close to unity to the maternal blood concentration [<a href="#rid103">103</a>]. In a prospective study of 139 mother-infant pairs exposed to a variety of ASMs, almost 50 percent of ASM concentrations in the nursing infants were less than the lower limit of detection; the median percentage of infant-to-mother concentrations ranged from ranged from 0.3 to 44.2 percent [<a href="#rid102">102</a>]. Small studies of lamotrigine reported that infant plasma concentrations were 18 to 30 percent of maternal plasma concentrations [<a href="#rid99">99,104</a>]. Small studies of levetiracetam, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10006" href="/d/drug information/10006.html" rel="external">topiramate</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8483" href="/d/drug information/8483.html" rel="external">gabapentin</a> have found that, while present in breast milk in concentrations similar to maternal plasma, the concentrations in infant plasma were low, suggesting rapid elimination [<a href="#rid101">101,105,106</a>].</p><p>There is little evidence to support that ASM exposure from breast milk has clinical effects on the newborn [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Anecdotal reports suggest that problems tend to occur only with the highly sedating drugs, such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9763" href="/d/drug information/9763.html" rel="external">phenobarbital</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9811" href="/d/drug information/9811.html" rel="external">primidone</a>, or benzodiazepines. Nursing newborns may become irritable, fall asleep shortly after beginning to nurse, or fail to thrive. If this occurs, breastfeeding may need to be discontinued. However, for the vast majority of ASMs, especially those used first line in contemporary neurology practice, adverse effects on nursing infants are lacking.</p><p>Moreover, neurodevelopmental studies in children of women with epilepsy on ASMs demonstrate benefits to nursing [<a href="#rid94">94</a>]. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were examined in 181 children exposed to either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9198" href="/d/drug information/9198.html" rel="external">carbamazepine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9545" href="/d/drug information/9545.html" rel="external">lamotrigine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9769" href="/d/drug information/9769.html" rel="external">phenytoin</a>, or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10035" href="/d/drug information/10035.html" rel="external">valproate</a> in utero; 42.9 percent of these children were breastfed a mean of 7.2 months. Intelligence quotients (IQs) for breastfed children were four points higher than the non-breastfed group after adjusting for potential confounding through propensity score matching, and in specific cognitive domains, verbal abilities were higher [<a href="#rid107">107</a>]. No adverse effects of ASM exposure via breastmilk were observed. Another study that included 223 children exposed to ASMs in utero found that prenatal exposure was associated with adverse developmental outcomes regardless of breastfeeding status during the first year of life, but that infants who were breastfed continuously for more than six months had slightly better outcomes than those who were not breastfed [<a href="#rid108">108</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H650334954"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
