         Hypogonadism in a male refers to a decrease in either or both of the two major functions of the testes: sperm production and testosterone production (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7474.html" rel="external">
          "Male reproductive physiology"
         </a>
         ). These abnormalities can result from disease of the testes (primary hypogonadism) or disease of the pituitary or hypothalamus (secondary hypogonadism). The distinction between these disorders is made by measurement of the serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH):

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         The patient has primary hypogonadism if his serum testosterone concentration and/or sperm count are low and/or his serum LH and FSH concentrations are high.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The patient has secondary hypogonadism if his serum testosterone concentration and/or the sperm count are low and/or his serum LH and FSH concentrations are not elevated, as they would be if gonadotroph cell function were normal.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Secondary hypogonadism differs from primary hypogonadism in two characteristics:

          ●
         </span>
         Secondary hypogonadism is usually associated with similar decreases in sperm and testosterone production. This occurs because the reduction in LH secretion results in a decrease in testicular testosterone production and, therefore, in intratesticular testosterone, which is the principal hormonal stimulus to sperm production. In contrast, primary hypogonadism is usually associated with a greater decrease in sperm production than testosterone production because the seminiferous tubules are damaged to a greater degree than the Leydig cells. Men with primary hypogonadism, therefore, might have normal serum testosterone and LH concentrations even when the number of ejaculated sperm is very low or zero and the FSH concentration is elevated.

          ●
         </span>
         Primary hypogonadism is more likely to be associated with gynecomastia, presumably because elevated serum FSH and LH concentrations stimulate testicular aromatase to increase the conversion of testosterone to estradiol.

         Sexual differentiation in all of these disorders is that of a
         <strong>
          normal male
         </strong>
         because testosterone secretion by the fetal Leydig cells in the first trimester of pregnancy, when sexual differentiation occurs, is stimulated by placental human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) that binds to and stimulates luteinizing hormone (LH) receptors on Leydig cells.

         In contrast, phallic development during the third trimester is subnormal because testicular testosterone secretion at this stage is dependent upon fetal LH secretion, which is subnormal. This leads to diminished testosterone secretion by the fetal testes, resulting in birth with a small phallus, called micropenis.

         Eunuchoid proportions (greater arm span than height [&gt;5 cm] and greater distance from pubis to floor than pubis to crown) result when epiphyseal closure is delayed because subnormal serum testosterone levels cause subnormal estradiol levels. An exception is if growth hormone is also subnormal.

         Congenital secondary hypogonadism that occurs in the absence of any other pituitary hormonal deficiencies may be the consequence of a number of disorders including congenital gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) beta- or LH beta-subunit mutations.

         Several different mutations of the luteinizing hormone (LH) beta-subunit gene have been reported, all leading to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. In all of them, the clinical presentation was delayed puberty and low testosterone in the men in the families, but the LH and FSH concentrations differed. In one family, LH secretion was not impaired, but its binding to its receptor was impaired, so serum LH concentrations were elevated [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. In a second family, the mutation prevents dimerization of LH, so it is not secreted and the serum LH is low [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. In a third family, the mutation prevents normal intracellular processing of mRNA, so the serum LH concentration is undetectably low [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Two different mutations were described in an additional patient with delayed puberty and azoospermia [

         Another rare cause is a mutation in the gene for the beta-subunit of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). A man with this mutation had delayed puberty with low serum testosterone and FSH concentrations, but a high serum LH concentration. The low serum testosterone concentration is hard to explain because Leydig cells do not have FSH receptors. However, this finding may indicate that normal human Leydig cell function is dependent on normal function of Sertoli cells, which do have FSH receptors [

         Secondary hypogonadism that occurs in association with impaired secretion of other pituitary hormones has been shown to result from impaired expression of transcription factors necessary for early differentiation of the pituitary during embryogenesis, including LHX3, LHX4, HESX1, and PROP-1 [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8

         Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism can be caused by any disease that affects the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (see

         In general, a mass lesion in the pituitary or hypothalamus is more likely to diminish the secretion of gonadotropins than that of corticotropin (ACTH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Patients may present, therefore, with hypogonadism without either adrenal or thyroid deficiency.

         Androgens, estrogens, and progestins can suppress gonadotropins and thereby suppress testicular function. The high doses of androgens that athletes take cause suppression of gonadotropins after discontinuation, sometimes for many months, and during this time the man is hypogonadal (see

         Chronic treatment with glucocorticoids can lead to hypogonadism. In one study, 16 men with chronic pulmonary disease who received high-dose glucocorticoid therapy for at least one month had a mean serum testosterone concentration of 211 ng/dL (7.3 nmol/L), compared with 449 ng/dL (15.6 nmol/L) in 11 men matched for age and disease [

         Any critical illness, such as surgery, myocardial infarction, or head trauma, can cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. One study of 35 critically ill men, as an example, found that the serum testosterone concentration fell 43 to 58 percent within the first few days after the onset of the illness [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16

Thus, the low serum testosterone concentration was probably due to decreased secretion. Serum LH concentrations in these men also fell, indicating a pituitary or, more likely, hypothalamic cause of the hypogonadism.
        </p>
        <p>
         A subsequent study of 59 men with critical illness demonstrated that the degree of hypogonadism was directly related to the severity of the illness (

         Men who have type 2 diabetes mellitus are more likely to have low serum testosterone concentrations than nondiabetic men, but the nature of the relationship is unclear.

        </p>
        <p>
         However, men who are obese may also have low free testosterone concentrations. These abnormalities were shown in a report from the European Male Aging Study in which data from 3220 men ages 40 to 79 years at eight sites were analyzed [

Free testosterone, however, was similar in normal weight and overweight men, but lower in obese men. Serum LH concentrations were not elevated in the obese men, indicating that the overweight men had secondary hypogonadism. In short, obese men may have a low total serum testosterone concentration because of a combination of low SHBG and secondary hypogonadism. Measurement of the serum free testosterone concentration is necessary to determine if an obese man's low total testosterone is due only to low SHBG or to secondary hypogonadism as well.

The standardized mean difference between the testosterone values before and after the initiation of CPAP was -0.14 (95% CI -0.63 to 0.34). These results suggest that the low testosterone levels in men with sleep apnea may be the result of the concomitant obesity and not sleep apnea itself.

         Primary hypogonadism results from disease of the testes, while secondary hypogonadism results from disease of the pituitary or hypothalamus. The distinction between these disorders is made by measurement of the serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). (See

         Secondary hypogonadism differs from primary hypogonadism in two characteristics:

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Secondary hypogonadism is usually associated with a similar decrease in sperm and testosterone production. This occurs because the primary reduction in LH secretion results in a decrease in testicular testosterone production and, therefore, in intratesticular testosterone, which is the principal hormonal stimulus to sperm production. In contrast, primary hypogonadism is usually associated with a greater fall in sperm production than in testosterone secretion because in primary hypogonadism the seminiferous tubules are damaged to a greater degree than the Leydig cells.
        </p>
        <p>

          ●
         </span>
         Primary hypogonadism is more likely to be associated with gynecomastia, presumably because elevated serum FSH and LH concentrations stimulate testicular aromatase, which increases the conversion of testosterone to estradiol.
