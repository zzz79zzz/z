         Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the initial method of choice for evaluating most pericardial diseases, given its ability to provide both anatomic and physiologic/hemodynamic information. When competently performed in patients with good acoustic windows, TTE accurately detects pericardial effusions and provides clinically relevant information about their size and hemodynamic importance.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will discuss the TTE approach to evaluating the pericardium, along with normal pericardial anatomy, indications for performing TTE, and a brief description of some pericardial pathologic processes. Detailed discussions of pericardial pathology, along with the imaging evaluation of the pericardium in particular disease states, are presented separately. (See

         The normal pericardium is a fibroelastic sac containing a thin layer of fluid that surrounds the heart.

         The normal pericardium consists of two layers: a fibrous outer layer and a serous inner layer. The serous layer is a closed sac with the visceral component lining the epicardium and the parietal component lining the fibrous outer layer. The outer fibrous pericardium produces one of the most strongly reflective or echo-producing areas of the heart, and it normally moves anteriorly with the epicardium. The pericardium is reflected from the pulmonary veins as they enter the left atrium. The fibrous component has attachments to the sternum and to the diaphragm [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Normally, a small amount of fluid (less than 50 mL) is contained within the closed sac of the serous layer. Because of the pericardial reflection at the level of the pulmonary veins, pericardial fluid rarely accumulates in this area posterior to the left atrium because the potential space available decreases abruptly.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pericardial fat is also commonly seen on two-dimensional (2D) TTE  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef120997" href="/z/d/graphic/120997.html" rel="external">
          movie 1
         </a>
         ). Accumulation is most common in the interventricular and atrioventricular grooves and on the right ventricular (RV) free wall. This normal but highly variable finding is most commonly seen anterior to the heart in the parasternal long axis view and in the subcostal views. The best clues to its identity as fat are its absence posteriorly, normal motion of the pericardium, and low intensity echoes (often seen as faint linear striations) within the pericardial space.

         In patients with a normal pericardium, intrathoracic pressure decreases during inspiration, leading to an increase in venous return to the right heart and transient increase in RV chamber size. Because the normal pericardium accommodates the increased venous return by stretching, this increase in venous return does not impair left ventricular (LV) filling.

         When visualized on 2D echocardiography, the layers of the pericardium appears as thin echogenic lines surrounding the myocardium. The normal thickness of the visualized pericardial layers is less than 3 mm by echocardiography [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ], but it can be difficult to make accurate measurements due to suboptimal image quality and motion throughout the cardiac cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the normal healthy pericardium, there is less than 50 mL of serous fluid in the pericardial sac formed by these layers [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. The interposition of this fluid between the pericardial layers can result in a very small physiological separation of the layers, which may be appreciated on M-mode echocardiography only during systole  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61898" href="/z/d/graphic/61898.html" rel="external">

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         When inspecting the pericardium in a real-time 2D TTE examination, it is important to appreciate the motion of the heart within it. Normally, the heart and epicardial pericardium move and twist within the parietal pericardium.

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         In the short axis, the motion is due to the twisting of the heart during systole and untwisting during diastole.

         In the apical four chamber view, the motion is due to both the torsion and the longitudinal muscle shortening.

         The four chamber sub-costal view is particularly useful in detection of the motion between the pericardial layers. This normal independent motion is impaired or lost when pericardial inflammation and/or scarring results in adhesions between the visceral and parietal layers.

         Echocardiography can be somewhat limited for diagnosing loculated effusions. Both cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and cardiac computed tomography (CT) are generally preferred to echocardiography for measuring pericardial thickness and identifying loculated effusions, with CMR providing greater discrimination between pericardium and small pericardial effusions [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. CT is preferable for detecting pericardial calcification. CMR is the preferred method to identify pericardial inflammation/pericarditis. (See

          Constrictive pericarditis

Such patients may be mistakenly thought to have only cardiac tamponade; however, persistent elevation of the right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures after drainage of the pericardial fluid points to the underlying constrictive process.

         The TTE is often normal in patients with the clinical syndrome of acute pericarditis unless it is associated with increased pericardial fluid/abnormal pericardial effusion, which is present in approximately 60 percent of patients [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. While the finding of more than trivial pericardial effusion in a patient with known or suspected pericarditis supports the diagnosis, the absence of a pericardial effusion or other echocardiographic abnormalities does not exclude it. Large and/or hemodynamically significant pericardial effusions are rare as the initial presentation of acute pericarditis. CMR is the preferred imaging method to diagnose the pericardial inflammation seen in pericarditis. (See

         TTE has an important role in diagnosing the presence of pericardial effusion, estimating the relative size of the effusion, and evaluating the hemodynamic importance of an effusion  (

         ). Key elements of the pericardial effusion which should be described include size (maximal thickness and if it varies by location) and location (circumferential versus loculated).
        </p>
        <p>
         A transudative pericardial fluid appears on an echocardiogram as an echolucent (dark) space between the pericardium and the epicardium. Small collections of pericardial fluid, which can be physiologic (up to 50 mL), may be visible during ventricular systole. Effusions exceeding 50 mL are seen as an echo-free space throughout the cardiac cycle. Typically, a small (50 to 100 mL) free-flowing pericardial effusion is seen posterior to the LV; this space diminishes and finally disappears as the echo beam approaches the base of the LV and the left atrium  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61763" href="/z/d/graphic/61763.html" rel="external">
          image 2
         </a>
         ). Accumulation of pericardial fluid above the right atrium in the apical four chamber view with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position is, perhaps, the single most sensitive and specific indication of a pericardial effusion  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82562" href="/z/d/graphic/82562.html" rel="external">
          image 3
         </a>
         ). However, in the case of a free-flowing effusion, the site of accumulation may be positional as there is gravity dependence. As the effusion increases in size, it is typically seen anterior to the RV and best seen from the subcostal view.
        </p>
        <p>
         The size of a pericardial effusion is graded semi-quantitatively, and when measured, it is measured in diastole.

         The pericardial effusion should be described as circumferential or loculated and transudative or exudative. Exudative effusions are echo-filled. Additionally, though size is relevant (as mentioned earlier) the hemodynamic consequence of a pericardial effusion is also related to the rate of fluid accumulation. Echocardiography is also helpful to determine if the effusion can be drained percutaneously and to assist monitoring during pericardiocentesis. (See

         Pericardial fluid ceases to be circumferential and free flowing and becomes loculated or compartmentalized as a result of a variety of disease processes, most commonly following cardiac surgery or following pericardial hemorrhage (eg, as a complication of percutaneous coronary intervention or pacemaker lead placement). Pericardial stranding, suggestive of fibrous material within the pericardial effusion, is easily seen on echocardiographic imaging, often as a precursor to loculation of the effusion  (

         A loculated, eccentric effusion or localized hematoma can produce regional cardiac tamponade in which only selected chambers are compressed. Regional cardiac tamponade is most often seen after pericardiotomy or MI. Clinical suspicion should be heightened in these settings. Establishing the diagnosis is challenging and may require additional echocardiographic views (eg, subcostal or transesophageal echocardiography) and other advanced imaging techniques (eg, CT). (See

Generally, in the parasternal long-axis view, pleural effusions extend posterior to the descending thoracic aorta, while pericardial effusions extend anterior to the descending thoracic aorta.

         If pericardial thickening fails to resolve, chronic pericardial thickening with constrictive pericarditis can develop.

         Localized pericardial thickening or the presence of a pericardial effusion can represent manifestation of primary pericardial malignancy, the result of a pericardial tumor from metastatic disease, or contiguous encroachment of a noncardiac tumor into the pericardial space  (

         If a large tumor invades locally from the lateral chest, it is often possible to appreciate a locally dense area along the lateral border of the heart. The telling characteristic of these masses is often their relative immobility during the cardiac cycle as seen by echocardiography, CMR, or cardiac CT; as the heart abuts these masses, they seem fixed in space and can distort the normal chamber contour. Thoracic magnetic resonance (MR) or CT are often helpful in characterizing mediastinal masses. (See

         The normal pericardium exerts considerable influence on cardiac motion, providing stability to the location of the heart in the chest, and limits the dilatation of the chambers. Complete or partial congenital absence of the pericardium is rare and most commonly noted incidentally during surgery or at autopsy [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. In up to 50 percent of cases, congenital absence of the pericardium is associated with other congenital cardiac defects, including atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, and tetralogy of Fallot, among others [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. While most patients have no symptoms, nonspecific symptoms including dyspnea, chest pain, and palpitations are present in others. Partial absence of the pericardium sometimes results in herniation of a chamber through the defect and can be a rare cause of chest pain. There are reports of type A aortic dissection in patients with congenital absence of the pericardium; the mechanism is speculated to be excessive motion of the heart [
         <a href="#rid1">

         Partial or complete absence of the pericardium may be suspected but cannot usually be definitively diagnosed by echocardiography, although most TTE findings are nonspecific. The orientation and distance between the transducer and the posterior wall on TTE have been suggested as diagnostic parameters, but in general, thoracic MR and CT are preferred for visualizing the pericardium and confirming the diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,13

         In patients with complete absence of the pericardium, echocardiography may visualize more of the RV than typically seen on routine left parasternal echocardiogram, which is due to enlargement of the RV, excessive motion of the posterior LV wall, and shift of the heart to the left. These changes may result in paradoxical motion of the interventricular septum. All of these findings mimic RV volume overload as seen in atrial septal defect or tricuspid insufficiency [

         In patients with partial absence of the pericardium who have herniation of a chamber, TTE may show a wall motion abnormality along the line of demarcation. If the pericardial defect is left sided, it is the left atrial appendage that is most likely involved. However, if a coronary artery is compressed, a true wall motion abnormality may indeed exist [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11

        <p>
         No specific treatment is required for most patients with complete congenital absence of the pericardium, as such patients appear to have a normal life expectancy. Partial defects may lead to herniation in which case surgery is indicated. The pericardium can be removed if the defect is large or closed if it is a smaller defect. Surgery in the absence of herniation can be considered if the patient is symptomatic, while occasionally prophylactic closure to prevent future herniation is indicated.

         The normal pericardium consists of two layers: a fibrous outer layer and a serous inner layer. Normally, a small amount of fluid (less than 50 mL) is contained within the closed sac of the serous layer. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Normal anatomy'
         </a>
         above.)

         When visualized on two-dimensional echocardiography, the layers of the pericardium appear as thin echogenic lines surrounding the myocardium. The normal thickness of the visualized pericardial layers on TTE is less than 3 mm. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Normal appearance on echocardiographic imaging'

         In general, TTE should be part of the routine imaging evaluation in the following circumstances: all patients with suspected pericardial disease, including effusion, constrictive pericarditis, or effusive-constrictive pericarditis; all patients with suspected bleeding into the pericardial space (eg, trauma, perforation, post-operative), as a follow-up study to evaluate recurrence of effusion following treatment or to diagnose early constrictive pericarditis, and in patients with pericardial friction rub developing in acute myocardial infarction (MI) accompanied by symptoms such as persistent pain, hypotension, and nausea. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Indications'

         Pericardial abnormalities can result from a number of cardiac and systemic conditions, including acute pericarditis, pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, constrictive pericarditis, pericardial tumors, and pericardial cysts, among others. Pericardial thickening, loculated effusions, and congenital absence of the pericardium are often better diagnosed using cardiac computed tomography (CT) or cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR).

          'Conditions associated with pericardial pathology'
