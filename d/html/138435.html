         Some patients with HIV who are virologically suppressed may benefit from a switch of their antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen. Reasons for the switch may include side effects, pill burden, new or worsening medical comorbidities (eg, chronic kidney disease), drug-drug interactions, and/or use of an older regimen with a higher risk of long-term toxicity. When switching regimens, both oral and injectable options are available.
        </p>

         This topic will review the use of the long-acting injectable regimen,

         Some patients who are virologically suppressed may need to change their regimen due to side effects or concerns about long-term toxicity. Two-drug regimens may be suitable for patients who have developed or are at risk for developing toxicity from nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) like

         Long-acting, injectable, two-drug therapy may be a good option to replace oral antiretroviral therapy (ART) in select patients who have difficulty swallowing pills, difficulty storing their medications at home due to concerns around confidentiality or stigma, or a preference for nondaily dosing or injectable therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Reports from two large, phase 3 randomized studies found that individuals who met specific enrollment criteria and who received intramuscular (IM)

         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. In these studies, which together included 1178 participants, approximately 93 percent of those who received the injectable regimen achieved an HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL at week 48 compared with 93 to 96 percent of those receiving daily oral therapy. Although many experienced mild or moderate injection site reactions, this rarely led to treatment discontinuation.

         <a href="#rid7">
          7

         ; reasons to suspect such resistance include imperfect adherence or virologic failure while taking a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) in the past. In some studies, baseline rilpivirine proviral resistance mutations were a significant predictor of virologic failure with

         Ideally, patients should have no history of virologic failure (even with NNRTI/INSTI regimens). However, certain acquired resistance mutations may be acceptable if there are no other good treatment options. Trials generally excluded individuals with any history of virologic failure; the only resistance mutation typically permitted for enrollment in the trials was a K103N mutation (the NNRTI mutation associated with resistance to

         Two-drug regimens, including long-acting injectable therapy, should generally be avoided in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, as such patients should receive a tenofovir-containing ART regimen whenever possible. (See

         In some studies, there was a higher likelihood of virologic failure in patients with HIV subtype A1 or A6 virus (which most often occurs in Eastern Europe and Central Asia [

         <a href="#rid13">
          13

         Among those who do not achieve virologic suppression, a small number will experience virologic failure (HIV RNA ≥200 copies /mL on two occasions). In clinical trials, most of these patients developed integrase and/or NNRTI resistance-associated mutations, even though none had missed an injection dose by more than seven days (ie, they received on-time injections). This may necessitate a switch to an oral salvage antiretroviral therapy regimen, such as with a boosted protease inhibitor plus other agents. (See

         <a href="#rid7">
          7

         ]. The reason for this difference is unclear. One possible explanation is that more individuals with confirmed virologic failure in the eight-week group were found to have baseline proviral

         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. However, this has not been confirmed to be the explanation. Of the eleven participants in the trial who met criteria for confirmed virologic failure, six had two or more factors that may predict virologic failure with this regimen (pre-existing proviral rilpivirine resistance-associated mutations, HIV-1 subtype A1 or A6, or BMI greater than 30 kg/m

         In some cases, the dosing interval may be dictated by clinic resources and insurance company reimbursement since the majority of patients will maintain virologic suppression with either dosing schedule, as described above. (See

         When there is a choice, we counsel patients on the trade-offs. Every eight-week dosing offers more convenience with fewer visit than every four-week dosing. However, the risk of virologic failure appears to be higher than with every four-week dosing, although the risk of virologic failure with every eight-week dosing is still low. (See

If low-level viremia persists despite on-time injections and correct administration, we would have a low threshold to switch back to a three-drug oral ART regimen with a high barrier to resistance.

Induration, nodules, bruising, and itching may also occur. For most individuals, these are mild and do not lead to discontinuation of the treatment, but patients can be counseled to apply an ice pack or warm compress, massage the area, or take as needed over-the-counter analgesics to help with the reactions (assuming there are no medical contraindications to these). The majority of reactions resolve spontaneously within a few days (median duration three days) [

         Some patients who are virologically suppressed may need to change their regimen due to side effects or concerns about long term-toxicity. There are several oral options as well as the long-acting injectable regimen, cabotegravir-rilpivirine. (See
         <a class="local">

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Long-acting injectable therapy may be a good option to replace oral antiretroviral therapy (ART) in patients who have difficulty swallowing pills, difficulty storing their medications at home due to concerns around confidentiality or stigma, or a preference for nondaily dosing or injectable therapy. Clinical trials have found that individuals who received intramuscular (IM)

         , we review the importance of adherence to injections, which requires visits to the clinic. Cabotegravir-rilpivirine is not designed for self-administration. If doses are missed, patients may experience prolonged periods of subtherapeutic ART levels, which puts them at risk for developing virologic resistance. (See

          Selecting a dosing interval

          cabotegravir-rilpivirine

         can be administered every four or eight weeks  (

          table 1

         ). In some cases, the dosing interval may be dictated by clinic resources and insurance company reimbursement since most patients will maintain virologic suppression with either dosing schedule. (See

         When there is a choice, we counsel patients on the trade-offs. Every eight-week dosing offers more convenience with fewer visits than every four-week dosing; however, there appear to be more virologic failures (HIV viral load &gt;200 copies/mL on two occasions) with every eight-week dosing, although the risk of virologic failure even with every eight-week dosing is low.
