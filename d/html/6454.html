         Abdominal pain is one of the most common complaints in childhood and one that frequently requires urgent evaluation in the office or emergency department. The cause is typically a self-limited condition, such as constipation, gastroenteritis, viral syndrome, or functional abdominal pain [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. The challenge for the clinician is to identify those few patients with abdominal pain who have potentially life-threatening conditions  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65488" href="/z/d/graphic/65488.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). The diagnosis is often suggested by the child's age and clinical features (ie, associated symptoms and physical examination findings). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Life-threatening causes'
         </a>

         Pain receptors in the abdomen include visceral receptors (located on serosal surfaces, within the mesentery, and within the walls of hollow viscera) and mucosal receptors. Visceral receptors respond to mechanical and chemical stimuli whereas mucosal receptors respond primarily to chemical stimuli.
        </p>
        <p>
         Visceral pain is usually poorly localized. Most visceral digestive tract pain is perceived in the midline because of bilaterally symmetric innervation. In some conditions, such as appendicitis, precise localization of the pain may develop or worsen once the overlying parietal peritoneum (which is somatically innervated) becomes inflamed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pain originating in the viscera may sometimes be perceived as originating from a site distant from the affected organ. Referred pain usually is located in the cutaneous dermatomes sharing the same spinal cord level as the visceral inputs  (

         Children with abdominal pain who have sustained trauma must be carefully evaluated for intraabdominal injuries. Mechanisms typically associated with significant injury (ie, solid organ laceration or perforated viscus) include motor vehicle collisions, pedestrian struck by a motor vehicle, falls, sports-related injuries, and child abuse. Clinical manifestations of serious injury include abdominal bruising (eg, "seat belt sign"), abdominal distension, abdominal tenderness, and peritoneal signs (eg, abdominal wall rigidity, rebound, or guarding), or shoulder pain referred from diaphragmatic irritation.

         The three most predictive clinical features of appendicitis are pain in the right lower quadrant, guarding, and migration of periumbilical pain to the right lower quadrant. However, at least one of these manifestations is frequently absent, particularly in younger children. Clinicians should therefore consider the diagnosis of appendicitis in children who have a history of abdominal pain and vomiting, with or without fever or focal abdominal tenderness. (See

         </span>
         Intussusception (invagination of a part of the intestine into itself, causing obstruction) typically occurs among children two months to two years of age. Although rare, intussusception may occur in older children, and is typically associated with a "lead-point" such as a Meckel diverticulum.
        </p>
        <p>
         Children most commonly present with characteristic pain that develops suddenly, is intermittent, severe, and classically accompanied by inconsolable crying with drawing up of the legs toward the abdomen. Bilious emesis may develop as the obstruction progresses.
        </p>
        <p>
         Between the painful episodes, the child may behave normally. Initial symptoms can be confused with gastroenteritis. Lethargy or altered consciousness can be the primary symptom of intussusception, especially in infants. Although few children will have gross blood or currant jelly stool, many will have fecal occult blood. Presentations may be variable, however, with some children having no apparent pain or blood in the stool. (See

         Neonates may have emesis (bilious or nonbilious) with apparent abdominal discomfort as the result of midgut volvulus  (

         ). Over 50 percent of children with malrotation present before one month of age with this life-threatening condition. Among older children with volvulus from malrotation, the onset of symptoms is usually acute, but some children present with more chronic patterns of episodic vomiting and abdominal pain. (See

         Infants with incarcerated inguinal hernias are usually irritable and crying. Vomiting and abdominal distention may develop, depending on the duration of incarceration and whether or not intestinal obstruction has occurred. On physical examination, a firm, discrete inguinal mass, which may extend to the scrotum or labia majora, can sometimes be palpated in the groin. (See

         Children with abdominal pain and/or vomiting who have had previous abdominal surgery may have a small bowel obstruction (SBO) as the result of adhesions. Ischemic bowel injury may cause shock due to hypovolemia and/or sepsis.

         In retrospective series describing children who had abdominal surgery, 1 to 5 percent developed adhesions within five years of surgery [

         Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) occurs less commonly in children than in adults and may be complicated by severe hemorrhage or perforation. The clinical manifestations of PUD vary by age. Vomiting, hemorrhage, and perforation are more commonly seen in young children, while older children and teenagers have a presentation similar to adults consisting of epigastric pain, often occurring several hours after eating. Some cases of PUD are related to
         <em>
          Helicobacter pylori

         ]. Peptic ulcers among children less than 10 years of age are often due to medications (corticosteroids or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) or major stresses. Approximately half of PUD cases are idiopathic in nature [

The vaginal bleeding associated with ectopic pregnancy is typically preceded by amenorrhea. However, some adolescents may misinterpret bleeding as normal menses, and may not realize they are pregnant prior to developing symptoms associated with ectopic pregnancy. This is particularly true in adolescents who have irregular menses or who do not keep track of menstrual cycles. (See

         Mesenteric lymphadenitis is an inflammatory condition of the mesenteric lymph nodes that can present with acute or chronic abdominal pain. Because the nodes are usually in the right lower quadrant, mesenteric lymphadenitis sometimes mimics appendicitis and intussusception. In one series of 70 children with clinically suspected acute appendicitis, 16 percent had a final diagnosis of mesenteric lymphadenitis established by ultrasound, clinical course, or surgery [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The prevalence of mesenteric lymphadenitis may be increasing, likely related to the increased use of diagnostic imaging for the evaluation of children with abdominal pain. Mesenteric lymphadenitis is diagnosed by an ultrasound that shows abdominal lymph nodes (greater than 8 mm in diameter) [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,18
         </a>
         ]. The presence of enlarged lymph nodes on diagnostic imaging does not, by itself, exclude a diagnosis of appendicitis; it is necessary to demonstrate a normal appendix as well [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. Etiologies of mesenteric lymphadenitis include viral and bacterial gastroenteritis (eg, Yersinia enterocolitica), inflammatory bowel disease, and lymphoma; viral infection is most common. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3139.html" rel="external">

         Acute mesenteric lymphadenitis is a self-limited condition. Treatment involves supportive care including pain management and adequate hydration [

          18
         </a>

         <a href="#rid20">
          20

         Common etiologies of abdominal pain caused by gynecologic conditions in adolescent females include dysmenorrhea, mittelschmerz, ruptured ovarian cyst, pelvic inflammatory disease, and pregnancy-related complications. These are discussed in detail separately. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Of these, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), an acute infection of the upper female genital tract, may be the cause of lower abdominal pain in sexually active females and is a frequent reason for acute presentation for lower abdominal pain in adolescents. Pain often begins during or shortly after menses. There may be vaginal discharge. Rarely, sepsis and tuboovarian abscess are life-threatening complications of PID. Diagnosis relies on cervical motion tenderness on examination with or without evidence of a sexually transmitted infection. (See

         – Abdominal migraine (included in childhood periodic syndromes) often presents with acute onset of abdominal pain that is typically periumbilical but is occasionally more diffuse. It is more common after age seven years. The pain is often incapacitating, with or without vomiting and headache. A family history of migraine is common. Since this condition is a recurrent problem, there may be a history of similar presentations. The first episode must be differentiated from gastrointestinal and other nongastrointestinal causes of acute onset abdominal pain.

          Wandering or accessory spleen

         – Wandering spleen refers to acquired laxity or congenital underdevelopment or absence of the primary ligamentous attachments of the spleen in the left upper quadrant [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. As a result, patients are at increased risk of splenic torsion and infarction. Wandering spleen is most commonly seen in children and is associated with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, prune-belly syndrome, renal agenesis, and gastric volvulus. It typically presents with acute, diffuse, severe abdominal pain. Patients may also have an abdominal mass which is mobile to the left upper quadrant and may have an indented border. Ultrasound is most helpful in establishing a preoperative diagnosis and can assess adequacy of splenic perfusion. According to case series, approximately two-thirds of patients require splenectomy. Early diagnosis permits splenopexy and preservation of splenic function.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Accessory spleens arise from incomplete fusion of the spleen during embryonic development and may occur in up to 30 percent of patients. Although typically asymptomatic, torsion of the accessory spleen on its blood supply can be associated with acute, acute intermittent, or chronic abdominal pain [

         <strong>
          Importance
         </strong>
         – Abdominal pain is one of the most common complaints in childhood and one that frequently requires urgent evaluation in the office or emergency department. Although the cause is typically a self-limited, minor condition, such as constipation, gastroenteritis, or viral syndrome, potentially life-threatening causes that require urgent treatment, such as appendicitis or bowel obstruction, must be promptly identified  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Background'
         </a>
         above.)

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Visceral abdominal pain is generally poorly localized. Once the parietal peritoneum becomes irritated (as occurs in appendicitis when the serosal surface becomes inflamed), pain may become more localized. Referred pain usually is located in the cutaneous dermatomes sharing the same spinal cord level as the visceral inputs  (

         ). (See

          'Neurologic basis of abdominal pain'

         <strong>
          Life-threatening causes
         </strong>
         – Life-threatening causes of abdominal pain often result in hemorrhage, obstruction, and/or perforation (such as occurs with trauma, intussusception, volvulus, or appendicitis). Extraabdominal causes (ie, hemolytic uremic syndrome and myocarditis) usually have other distinguishing clinical features. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Life-threatening causes'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Common causes
         </strong>
         – Common causes of abdominal pain include constipation, gastrointestinal infections, infections outside of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (eg, lower lobe pneumonia, streptoccocal pharyngitis, urinary tract infection, or pelvic inflammatory disease), and, in infants, colic. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Common causes'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>

         <strong>
          Other causes
         </strong>
         – Less common causes may present with abdominal pain caused by gastrointestinal or genitourinary conditions as well as poisoning or systemic disease (See
         <a class="local">
          'Other causes'
         </a>
         above.)
