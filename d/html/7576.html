         Types of tests for CRC screening include stool-based testing to detect either hemoglobin in blood that may be coming from a lesion or DNA alterations suggestive of malignancy; direct visualization with endoscopy, either with a scope that allows for biopsy and lesion removal at the time of the test or with a tiny camera that visualizes lesions as it passes through the intestinal tract; and radiologic imaging to visualize lesions.

         Multiple screening tests are available to detect colorectal cancer (CRC) and adenomatous polyps. Tests for CRC differ with regard to sensitivity and specificity  (

         A patient with any positive (ie, abnormal) screening test for CRC other than colonoscopy itself requires a timely colonoscopy to evaluate for adenomatous polyps (ie, adenomas) and CRC [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Specifics are described separately. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Patients who have had adenomas identified may require periodic follow-up with colonoscopy to assess for new lesions because adenomas may lead to CRC over time. The frequency of testing depends on the type of polyps identified. This is discussed separately. (See

         Patients with an incomplete or inadequate screening test for reasons described below should have the screening test repeated unless there was an abnormal finding that is being evaluated [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-7

         ]. Whether a test was partially completed or not completed at all, the test should be repeated within three months. Some experts wait six months to repeat a colonoscopy if a poor preparation limited visibility of the colon mucosa.
        </p>
        <p>
         Screening tests for CRC may be incomplete or inadequate for a number of reasons such as patient preparation (eg, inadequate laxative preparation for colonoscopy), anatomical factors (eg, contour of the colon that limits the passage of a scope), partial sampling (eg, completion of fewer than three cards during fecal occult blood testing [FOBT]), and equipment factors (eg, use of an outdated reagent to develop a stool test).

         FIT is performed on a small sample of stool that the patient provides in a special container. The frequency of testing varies in different locations, from annually in the United States to every two or three years in some countries.
        </p>
        <p>
         FIT requires only one stool sample and does not require restrictions to medications or diet prior to providing the sample; foods with peroxidase activity do not produce a false-positive FIT.

          Aspirin
         </a>
         and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) generally do not need to be temporarily discontinued to do a FIT test. In one observational study, FIT performance was better (higher sensitivity, only slightly lower specificity) among regular aspirin users compared with nonusers [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. However, in another observational study, there was no difference among regular aspirin users and nonusers in the positive predictive value (PPV) of FIT for advanced adenoma or CRC [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. A randomized trial found no difference in detection of advanced colorectal adenoma after a single dose of aspirin was given two days before FIT sample collection compared with no antecedent aspirin use [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         We suggest using a FIT test that generates a quantitative result rather than only a qualitative result, if available. These two methods to determine the presence of blood in the stool differ chemically, but both report the result as either positive or negative for hemoglobin rather than providing a numerical value [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. FIT that uses quantitative analysis is processed using standardized automated analyzers in certified laboratories and has the potential to produce more consistent results, with a higher PPV [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The patient may obtain the specimen collection kit at the clinician’s office, pharmacy, or by mail, depending on the protocol of the clinician’s office. The patient returns the FIT container (often by mail) to a laboratory for testing. Patients should be advised to return it within 24 hours of collection, because FIT sensitivity declines with delayed return after sampling. In one study, delayed return of the FIT more than five days after sampling, compared with no delay, was associated with a decreased rate of adenoma detection (odds ratio [OR] 0.6) [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Exposure to high ambient temperatures that accelerate hemoglobin degradation may decrease the sensitivity of FIT, although the impact of temperature on sample positivity rates is relatively small and the US Multisociety Task Force recommends that FIT mailing does not need to be adjusted based on ambient temperature [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16
         </a>
         ]. Although the ideal ambient temperature range for FIT sample preservation is not known, specimens may be refrigerated prior to return to the laboratory.

         FIT is convenient for a patient to do. Dietary and medication restrictions are not needed. It does not require a bowel preparation, sedation, or time away from work or family (although if the FIT is positive, a colonoscopy will be advised for further evaluation). FIT requires only one sample rather than three days of samples as for guaiac-based fecal occult blood testing (gFOBT). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Follow-up of abnormal test results'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Because FIT is more convenient, it may have higher adherence. In a randomized trial of patients invited to participate in screening using one of three tests, participation rate was highest for FIT screening compared with FOBT or sigmoidoscopy (61 versus 49 versus 32 percent) [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         FIT is more sensitive than gFOBT for colon lesions [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,18
         </a>
         ]. In addition, a positive FIT has high specificity for lower gastrointestinal bleeding. However, FIT can be positive due to an upper gastrointestinal bleed that is large enough for hemoglobin to escape degradation during transit.

         ). The evidence of effectiveness of FIT is based on observational studies, indirect comparison with studies of other screening strategies that have undergone controlled trials, and modelling studies [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>

         <strong>
          CRC and advanced adenoma detection
         </strong>
         – In a meta-analysis of 19 studies evaluating FIT for detecting CRC in asymptomatic adults, with a reference standard of either colonoscopy or at least two years of follow-up, pooled sensitivity for one-time evaluation was 0.79 (95% CI 0.69-0.86) and specificity was 0.94 (95% CI 0.92-0.95) [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Similarly, in a review of two meta-analyses of average-risk populations, one-time FIT sensitivity was approximately 80 percent for detecting CRC [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. The sensitivity and specificity of FIT for detection of advanced adenoma are lower than that for CRC and have been estimated as 25 to 56 percent for sensitivity and 68 to 96 percent for specificity [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Successive testing improves sensitivity, although specificity and PPV are likely to decline. The trends for PPV are dissimilar for CRC versus adenoma detection. In one study, during four rounds of testing every two years with FIT, CRC detection rates fell with successive screening, likely representing the gradual culling of neoplasms in earlier rounds [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,21
         </a>
         ]. However, the detection rate and PPV of FIT for advanced adenoma were more stable during the four screening rounds.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         When compared with gFOBT, screening using FIT has higher detection rates for CRC and advanced adenomas due to higher sensitivity and higher screening participation rates with FIT [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,22-24
         </a>
         ]. Based on one meta-analysis, FIT was superior to gFOBT for detection of both CRC (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.2–3.2) and advanced neoplasia (RR 2.28, 95% CI 1.68–3.10) with no loss of specificity [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         FIT appears to be less sensitive for detection of right-sided than of left-sided lesions [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. In one study, mean stool hemoglobin concentration was lower for patients with right-sided CRC compared with left-sided CRC and also lower than the positivity threshold used for quantitative FIT in the United States [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. In another study in Italy, people ages 50 to 69 years performed FIT every two years over a 12-year period [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28,29
         </a>
         ]. Over the multiple rounds of FIT screening, the proportion of clinically important cancer cases that were missed or developed de novo before the next screening was due was relatively unchanged in the right colon while it declined in the left colon. This finding is consistent with a lower sensitivity of FIT for right-sided lesions, although the result could also occur from rightward shift of colon cancer with aging of the cohort over 12 years.

          Obtaining stool samples
         </strong>
         – gFOBT test cards are obtained from the clinician’s office in person or by mail. The test cards have an expiration date on the packaging, which should be reviewed. The patient uses one test card for each of three consecutive bowel movements obtained at home, applying two samples from a bowel movement on the card where indicated [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42

         Stool for gFOBT should NOT be obtained during digital rectal examination (DRE). DRE may induce microtrauma and cause a false-positive result.

         Advantages of gFOBT screening include that it is noninvasive and does not require bowel preparation or sedation. Additionally, a visit with a clinician is not needed to obtain the stool sample, perform the test, and interpret the result, which simplifies testing in resource-limited settings. However, the test is to be done annually, and sample collection takes a longer time than for FIT because three consecutive samples are required. If the gFOBT is positive, a colonoscopy is needed for further evaluation. Positive results may also occur with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. (See

         Sedation is generally used during colonoscopy in the United States, although in other countries sedation is frequently not used. When sedation is used, the patient must be accompanied when discharged and needs to avoid activities that require mental alertness for a specified period of time and until the sedative effect clears.

         In a pragmatic, randomized trial among 84,585 adults 55 to 64 years of age in Poland, Norway, and Sweden, there were fewer cases of CRC among those invited to undergo a single screening colonoscopy than in the usual-care group (259 versus 622) over a median follow-up period of 10 years (risk ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.70-0.93) [

In an analysis comparing everyone invited to screening (including those who did not undergo screening) with usual care, a mortality benefit of invitation to colonoscopy screening was not observed. However, in an adjusted analyses that mimicked a scenario in which 100 percent of participants assigned to screening had undergone colonoscopy, the estimated risk of CRC death at 10 years was 0.50 (95% CI 0.27-0.77), which is similar in magnitude of protection from death from prior observational studies.

          Limitations
         </strong>
         – While colonoscopy is often considered the gold standard test, it does not detect all advanced adenomas and CRC.

         <a href="#rid68">
          68,74
         </a>
         ], studies find that colonoscopy is less effective in detecting and therefore also preventing death from right-sided compared with left-sided lesions. The potentially lower effectiveness of colonoscopy for right-sided CRC may reflect flaws in the design of some observational studies, incomplete colonoscopic examination of the right colon, or biologic differences in right-sided tumors, such as more flat or rapidly growing neoplasms [
         <a href="#rid76">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Some adenomas and cancers may be difficult to detect because of the contour or location of the lesion. Flat or depressed lesions, even if small, are at least as likely to represent advanced adenoma or CRC as raised or polypoid lesions and can be difficult to detect by colonoscopy. In a population-based study of over 5000 CRC patients, 2.9 percent were diagnosed with CRC an average of 26 months after an index colonoscopy, and over half of those were attributed to lesions missed during the colonoscopy [
         <a href="#rid76">
          76,78
         </a>
         ]. Compared with other CRC patients, CRC diagnosed in the period after a colonoscopy was likely to be more proximal, smaller, and more often flat. In another study of patients who received both colonoscopy and CTC, 14 of 15 non-rectal neoplasms missed by colonoscopy were located on a mucosal fold and five of six missed rectal lesions were located within 10 cm of the anal verge [
         <a href="#rid79">
          79
         </a>
         ]. The authors estimated that when state-of-the-art, three-dimensional CTC was used as a reference standard, the miss rate of colonoscopy for large adenomas (≥10 mm) was 12 percent.

         Identifying quality indicators that may be used to help improve performance of colonoscopy is an area of ongoing study; as an example, longer withdrawal time has been associated with higher rates of lesion detection. Some guidelines propose that an individual endoscopist's adenoma detection rate meet or exceed a specified frequency for a standard cohort of screened patients. These and other quality indicators are discussed in detail separately. (See

          Frequency of screening
         </strong>
         – Although there is limited evidence to determine the optimal frequency for screening colonoscopy for patients at average risk for CRC, available studies suggest that a 10-year interval is an acceptable strategy if the screening examination is negative and of adequate quality.

         Sigmoidoscopy examines only the distal portion of the colon. However, 41 to 45 percent of CRCs are in the right side of the colon and may be missed on a sigmoidoscopy [
         <a href="#rid86">
          86
         </a>
         ]. Adenoma distribution varies by age and sex and may also vary by social factors such as race. There is also a shift toward a greater prevalence of right-sided lesions with age. Females have a higher percentage of right-sided colon lesions than males. According to 2016 cases in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry, 36.3 to 40.2 percent of CRC in males was in the right colon compared with 46.2 to 50.6 percent in females [

         Colon perforation is the most important complication of sigmoidoscopy. In a Medicare population, perforation rates were 0.88 per 1000 sigmoidoscopies, about half that of colonoscopy (1.96 per 1000 colonoscopies, odds ratio [OR] 0.56) [
         <a href="#rid87">
          87
         </a>
         ]. Comorbidities and older age increased the risk of perforation on sigmoidoscopy. Perforation increased the risk of death (OR 8.8, 95% CI 1.6-48.5) compared with no perforation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Small polyps can be biopsied/removed during sigmoidoscopy. However, excision of larger lesions (&gt;1.0 cm) is usually done during a subsequent colonoscopy.

         Bowel preparation is less intensive than for colonoscopy or CTC, and sedation is not needed.

         – Repeating sigmoidoscopy at five-year intervals appears to provide additional effectiveness over one-time screening. In one randomized trial, participants who had a negative first screening sigmoidoscopy were offered a second sigmoidoscopy at either three or five years [

CRC or advanced adenoma was found in 38 per 1000 persons at the first screen and in 50 per 1,000 in the first and second rounds of screening combined, which represented a 32 percent higher cumulative yield. Overall, a second screening examination identified one additional cancer and 17 advanced adenomas for every 1000 re-screenings.

          Differences by sex

         – A number of studies have found that sigmoidoscopy is more effective in men than women, perhaps because of the higher proportion of right-sided (proximal) lesions in women. In one study, 66 percent of men with advanced colon lesions would have had their lesions detected with sigmoidoscopy alone, compared with 35 percent of women with advanced adenoma or CRC [

         Sigmoidoscopy is associated with a greater reduction in CRC-related mortality and CRC incidence in men as compared with women, particularly with increasing age among women. According to a pooled analysis of randomized trials (287,928 individuals), compared with no screening, sigmoidoscopy was associated with decreased CRC incidence in men (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.70-0.83) and in women younger than 60 years (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59-0.84); however, in women 60 years and older, CRC incidence was similar among screened and non-screened (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.02) [

         While clinical trial data have not substantiated an added benefit of combined testing, there are theoretical advantages to using both fecal blood testing (fecal immunochemical test [FIT] or guaiac-based fecal occult blood test [gFOBT]) and sigmoidoscopy to screen a patient. Sigmoidoscopy directly visualizes part of the distal colon and thus may show lesions that FOBT might not detect, whereas FOBT and FIT may assess the entire colon, although they too are more effective for left-side lesions.

         With colon capsule endoscopy, the patient swallows a capsule containing tiny wireless video cameras that take images as the capsule traverses the colon. Colon capsule endoscopy is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use only in patients who had an incomplete colonoscopy, not as a screening option by itself. The colon capsule endoscopy procedure, advantages, and disadvantages are summarized below and are described separately. (See

        <p>
         Colon capsule endoscopy requires a bowel preparation; however, it does not require sedation or dietary or medication adjustments. Colon capsule endoscopy does not allow for biopsy or polyp removal during the test because lesion detection is done by visualization with a camera that is not attached to any other instruments.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a prospective study in asymptomatic patients using high-quality colonoscopy as the reference standard, capsule endoscopy identified subjects with ≥1 adenoma of ≥6 mm with sensitivity 88 percent and specificity 82 percent, and adenomas ≥10 mm with sensitivity 92 percent and specificity 95 percent [

         Computed tomography colonography (CTC) involves obtaining multiple, thin-slice CT data and using computers to construct images of the bowel mucosa in two and three dimensions, with other enhancements to assist in interpretation. CTC is usually performed every five years. Evidence of efficacy of CTC and other colorectal cancer (CRC) screening strategies are described in a figure  (

        </p>
        <p>
         Bowel preparation (laxative or non-laxative) is required before the procedure. An intravenous catheter may be inserted to allow administration of drugs such as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8493" href="/z/d/drug information/8493.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Sedation is not required. Patients undergoing CTC are exposed to radiation. If the CTC shows a colon lesion, a colonoscopy will be advised for further evaluation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Follow-up of abnormal test results'

         Incidental radiologic findings in other organs may require additional testing. It is unclear if detection of such incidental findings improves patient health outcomes or results in additional harms.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are no controlled trials of the effectiveness of screening CTC on CRC incidence or death. Sensitivity of CTC for the detection of cancers and adenomas ≥10 mm, based on seven studies, has been reported to range between 67 and 94 percent, with specificity of 96 to 98 percent [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. Sensitivity of laxative-free CTC (which uses an oral preparation that tags stool so that it can be electronically cleansed from the radiographic images) is somewhat lower than for CTC with laxative bowel preparation [
         <a href="#rid109">
          109
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         CTC has been compared with colonoscopy. In one study of parallel programs for screening with either CTC (with follow-up colonoscopy if CTC is positive) or colonoscopy alone in the same institution, more than four times as many polyps were removed in the colonoscopy-alone group compared with the CTC group, but there was no difference in the number of large adenomas and small advanced adenomas removed [
         <a href="#rid110">

        <p>
         In microsimulation models, screening average-risk individuals aged 50 to 75 years by CTC every five years may yield similar life years gained as colonoscopy every 10 years, sigmoidoscopy every 10 years with fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) yearly, and annual FIT alone  (

          Multiple tests are available
         </strong>
         – Multiple screening tests are available to detect adenomatous polyps and colorectal cancer (CRC) before they become symptomatic. Tests for CRC differ with regard to sensitivity and specificity, frequency of testing, evidence of effectiveness  (

          Colonoscopy after abnormal test
         </strong>
         – A patient with any positive (ie, abnormal) screening test for CRC other than colonoscopy itself requires a timely colonoscopy to evaluate for adenomas and CRC. Specifics are described separately. (See

         <strong>
          Stool-based tests
         </strong>
         – Stool-based screening tests for colon cancer are generally much more sensitive for detection of colorectal cancer than for precancerous adenoma polyps  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116366" href="/z/d/graphic/116366.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The frequency of testing differs among the tests. Stool-based tests include:

         <strong>
          Fecal immunochemical tests
         </strong>
         – Fecal immunochemical tests (FIT) measure hemoglobin in the stool; a single stool sample is evaluated. Indirect evidence suggests that FIT reduces deaths due to CRC. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) for blood'

          Guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests
         </strong>
         – Guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests (gFOBT) should be done using a highly sensitive guaiac reagent. One test card is used for each of three consecutive bowel movements obtained at home. Randomized trials have shown that screening with gFOBT reduces CRC-related mortality. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT)'

         <strong>
          Multitarget stool DNA testing
         </strong>
         – Multitarget stool DNA testing (sDNA-FIT, also known as MT-sDNA, FIT-DNA, or Cologuard), is a composite of stool tests that include molecular assays for DNA mutations (a test for CRC-biomarkers), and FIT. Testing requires shipping an entire bowel movement obtained at home. Sensitivity for CRC appears to exceed that for FIT; evidence for improved clinical outcomes is indirect. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Multitarget stool DNA tests with fecal immunochemical testing'

         <strong>
          Endoscopic tests
         </strong>
         – Endoscopic screening tests for colon cancer are generally highly sensitive for detection of CRC and adenomatous polyps within the reach of the scope being used  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116366" href="/z/d/graphic/116366.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Colonoscopy
         </strong>
         – Colonoscopy allows for detection and biopsy of polyps and CRC and removal of precancerous polyps, all during one test. The procedure is associated with some risks and requires dietary and medication adjustment, and a bowel preparation; conscious sedation is often used. Colonoscopy detects precancerous adenomas and CRC with high sensitivity and acceptable specificity. At present, efficacy regarding clinical outcomes is limited to observational rather than randomized trials. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Sigmoidoscopy
         </strong>
         – Sigmoidoscopy reaches from the rectum up to the splenic flexure, allowing visualization of lesions, biopsy, and removal of polyps in the left-side of the colon only. Bowel preparation is less intensive than for colonoscopy, and sedation is not needed. Randomized trials have shown that screening sigmoidoscopy reduces CRC-related mortality. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Sigmoidoscopy'

         <strong>
          Combined tests
         </strong>
         – There are theoretical advantages to using both fecal blood testing (FIT or gFOBT) and sigmoidoscopy to screen a patient, although data have not substantiated an added benefit of combined testing. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Sigmoidoscopy plus FIT or gFOBT'

         Colon capsule endoscopy is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use only in patients who had an incomplete colonoscopy, not as a screening option by itself. During the test, the patient swallows a capsule containing tiny wireless video cameras that take images as the capsule traverses the colon. Colon capsule endoscopy requires a bowel preparation; however, it does not require sedation or dietary or medication adjustments. This test appears to have a sensitivity and specificity similar to colonoscopy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Colon capsule endoscopy'

         Computed tomography colonography (CTC, formerly "virtual colonoscopy") uses thin-slice CT data to construct images of the bowel mucosa. Bowel preparation (laxative or non-laxative) is required before the procedure. Sedation is not required. CTC detects large (&gt;1 cm) polyps about as well as colonoscopy but is less sensitive for detection of smaller polyps. Incidental radiologic findings in other organs may require additional testing. Further studies are needed to define its efficacy for clinical outcomes. (See
