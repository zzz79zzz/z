The acute illness is self-limited and is characterized by high fever; nonexudative conjunctivitis; inflammation of the oral mucosa; rash; cervical adenopathy; and findings in the extremities, including swollen hands and feet, red palms and soles, and, later, subungual peeling. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6417.html" rel="external">"Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6416.html" rel="external">"Kawasaki disease: Epidemiology and etiology"</a>.)</p><p>Children with KD are at risk for serious cardiovascular sequelae, particularly coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs), which can lead to myocardial ischemia, infarction, and sudden death. The risk of developing CAAs is highest among children with KD who are not treated early in the disease with high-dose intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> (IVIG). Thus, initial management of patients with KD is focused on early diagnosis and treatment with IVIG. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6423.html" rel="external">"Kawasaki disease: Initial treatment and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p>The management and prognosis of cardiac sequelae of KD, including CAAs, will be reviewed here.

There are no available randomized trials of antithrombotic therapy in children with KD and CAAs. Management is based largely upon adult data for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/110006.html" rel="external">"Aspirin for the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1505.html" rel="external">"Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease (secondary prevention) or at very high risk"</a>.)</p><p>The management approach described in the following sections is generally consistent with the 2017 guidelines of the American Heart Association [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1476724871"><span class="h2">Risk stratification of coronary artery abnormalities</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Risk stratification is based principally on the echocardiographic coronary artery luminal dimensions  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113212" href="/z/d/graphic/113212.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>Additional features that may increase the long-term risk of myocardial ischemia include [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Long length and distal location of aneurysms</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Large total number of aneurysms</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Multiple branches affected</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Luminal irregularities</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Vessel wall abnormalities (calcification, luminal myofibroblastic proliferation)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Functional abnormalities (impaired vasodilation, impaired flow reserve)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Absence or poor quality of collateral vessels</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Previous revascularization performed</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Previous coronary artery thrombosis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Previous myocardial infarction</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ventricular dysfunction</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1465307134"><span class="h2">Antithrombotic therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the acute phase of illness, patients with KD are generally treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> at moderate doses (30 to 50 mg/kg per day in four divided doses) for its antipyretic effect, if there are no contraindications. However, it does not reduce the incidence of coronary aneurysms. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6423.html" rel="external">"Kawasaki disease: Initial treatment and prognosis", section on 'Aspirin'</a>.)</p><p>To reduce the risk of coronary thrombosis, low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> (3 to 5 mg/kg per day) is continued for a minimum of four to six weeks following the acute phase treatment, at which time, it can be determined if coronary abnormalities have developed. The transition from moderate- to low-dose aspirin is typically made once the patient has been afebrile for 24 to 48 hours. By four to six weeks, if CAAs have not developed, aspirin is discontinued. For patients with CAAs who continue on aspirin therapy, long-term use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8547" href="/z/d/drug information/8547.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a> and other nonsteroidal cyclooxygenase inhibitors may be harmful and should be avoided [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p>All children should have general counseling regarding healthy lifestyle and activity at primary care visits. It is also reasonable for the primary care provider to assess usual risk factors for atherosclerosis at least one year from the episode of acute KD. (See <a class="local">'Counseling and screening for risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p>Additional treatment depends chiefly on the size and persistence of CAAs  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115401" href="/z/d/graphic/115401.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>), as discussed in the following sections.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H930703088"><span class="h3">No coronary involvement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with no coronary involvement (Z-score always &lt;2 <strong>and</strong> no more than a 0.9 decrease in Z-score during follow-up) can discontinue <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> therapy after four to six weeks. No further medical therapy is necessary, and long-term follow-up with a pediatric cardiologist is generally not indicated. The primary care provider should provide general counseling regarding healthy lifestyle and physical activity promotion. (See <a class="local">'Long-term follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H531075933"><span class="h3">Dilation only</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with dilation only (Z-score ≥2 to &lt;2.5 <strong>or</strong> if initially &lt;2, a ≥1 decrease in Z-score during follow-up) can discontinue <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> therapy after four to six weeks. No further medical therapy is necessary. If luminal dimensions have returned to normal, long-term follow-up with a pediatric cardiologist is generally not indicated. If dilation persists, patients are followed to 12 months and then every two to five years.

Other antiplatelet agents (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/z/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a>) are reasonable alternatives for patients who are intolerant to aspirin. Additional medical therapy is generally not necessary. Some experts use statins in this setting for the theoretical benefit of its non-lipid-lowering (pleiotropic) effects, although data to support this approach are limited. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4546.html" rel="external">"Mechanisms of benefit of lipid-lowering drugs in patients with coronary heart disease"</a>.)</p><p>If the aneurysm regresses to a normal size or to dilation only, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> can be discontinued. Long-term follow-up is as described below. (See <a class="local">'Long-term follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4265848258"><span class="h3">Medium aneurysms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with medium-size aneurysms (Z-score ≥5 to &lt;10, with absolute dimension &lt;8 mm), we suggest continuing low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> (3 to 5 mg/kg per day). We typically continue aspirin even if the aneurysm remodels to normal or dilation only, unless the patient experiences or is at risk for adverse effects from aspirin therapy.</p><p>In select high-risk patients with persistent medium-sized aneurysms, dual antiplatelet therapy (eg, with addition of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/z/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a> [0.2 to 1 mg/kg per day]) may be considered. Data are limited to guide this practice. We base the decision to use dual antiplatelet therapy on the size of the aneurysm (eg, Z-scores 7.5 to &lt;10). Other experts may consider additional risk factors. (See <a class="local">'Risk stratification of coronary artery abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p>Additional medical therapy is generally not necessary, although some experts may also use statins in this setting. Long-term follow-up is as described below.

Clinical trials evaluating the DOACs <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="85642" href="/z/d/drug information/85642.html" rel="external">apixaban</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="99275" href="/z/d/drug information/99275.html" rel="external">edoxaban</a> in this setting are ongoing [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. Until additional data are available, use of DOACs in pediatric patients with KD is generally limited to the setting of a clinical trial. Use of DOACs in children with venous thromboembolism is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5916.html" rel="external">"Venous thrombosis and thromboembolism (VTE) in children: Treatment, prevention, and outcome", section on 'Direct oral anticoagulants'</a>.)</p><p>Observational data suggest that combined therapy with an anticoagulant plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> may be more effective than aspirin alone [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. If the CAA regresses to a small or medium size, systemic anticoagulation can be discontinued. If the CAA remodels to medium size, dual antiplatelet therapy (eg, aspirin plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/z/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a>) or aspirin alone is used instead of aspirin plus an anticoagulant.</p><p>Special considerations regarding antithrombotic therapy in select patients with large and giant CAAs include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Infants</strong> – In infants, anticoagulation treatment should be based on the criterion of Z-score ≥10 rather than maximum internal diameter of ≥8 mm [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. LMWH is preferred over <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> because of its predictable anticoagulant response. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5911.html" rel="external">"Neonatal thrombosis: Management and outcome", section on 'Anticoagulant agents'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5916.html" rel="external">"Venous thrombosis and thromboembolism (VTE) in children: Treatment, prevention, and outcome", section on 'Anticoagulant agents'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>High-risk</strong> – Patients with giant CAAs who have had a recent coronary artery thrombosis are at high risk of myocardial infarction and may warrant more intensive antithrombotic therapy. In such patients, treatment with "triple therapy" (ie, low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> plus a second antiplatelet agent [eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/z/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a>] plus systemic anticoagulation) may be considered.

Frequent evaluation with echocardiography and electrocardiography (ECG) should be performed in patients with giant aneurysms. A worsening of ventricular function or a change in ECG should raise suspicion for coronary thrombosis. (See <a class="local">'Long-term follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p>In a meta-analysis of six retrospective studies in patients with giant CAAs, combined therapy with systemic anticoagulation (chiefly <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a>) plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> was associated with lower rates of myocardial infraction (odds ratio 0.27, 95% CI 0.11-0.63) and death (odds ratio 0.18, 95% CI 0.02-0.29) compared with aspirin alone [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In a retrospective study of patients with giant CAAs, there was no difference in the frequency of thrombotic coronary artery occlusions between LMWH and warfarin therapy [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].

(See <a class="local">'Medium aneurysms'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Large and giant aneurysms – For patients with large and giant aneurysms (Z-score ≥10 or absolute dimension ≥8 mm), we suggest long-term systemic anticoagulation with either low molecular weight heparin (LMWH; eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9407" href="/z/d/drug information/9407.html" rel="external">enoxaparin</a>) or vitamin K antagonist (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a>) in addition to low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). If the aneurysm regresses to a small or medium size, anticoagulant therapy can be discontinued, but low-dose aspirin is continued. (See <a class="local">'Large and giant aneurysms'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Avoid other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) while on </strong><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a><strong> therapy</strong> – For patients with CAAs who continue on aspirin therapy, long-term use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8547" href="/z/d/drug information/8547.html" rel="external">ibuprofen</a> and other NSAIDs may be harmful and should generally be avoided.

The choice of therapeutic intervention depends on the size of the patient and the timing of AMI relative to the phase of illness (see <a class="local">'Myocardial infarction and coronary thrombosis'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients who are beyond the acute/subacute phase of the illness and who are large enough for use of adult-sized catheters, we suggest immediate coronary angiography with mechanical restoration of myocardial blood flow (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In smaller patients and those in the acute/subacute phase of illness, we suggest systemic recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8478" href="/z/d/drug information/8478.html" rel="external">alteplase</a> 0.5 mg/kg per hour intravenously for six hours) in conjunction with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> and heparin (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Long-term follow-up</strong> – The long-term follow-up care of patients with KD is based on the coronary artery status and includes assessment of other cardiovascular risk factors, screening for dyslipidemia, promoting a heart-healthy diet, and exercise recommendations  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113211" href="/z/d/graphic/113211.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). In patients with CAAs, assessment for inducible myocardial ischemia (with stress echocardiography, stress electrocardiography (ECG), stress magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], and/or nuclear medicine perfusion imaging) may be appropriate depending on the size of the CAA and presence of coronary stenosis. (See <a class="local">'Long-term follow-up'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5772.html" rel="external">"Cardiovascular sequelae of Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and evaluation", section on 'Stress testing for inducible ischemia'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In patients with evidence of reversible ischemia on stress testing, we suggest that coronary artery revascularization intervention be performed (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a class="local">'Coronary revascularization procedures'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prognosis</strong> – For patients with KD and CAAs, the risks of serious morbidity and mortality are directly related to maximum aneurysm size. Small and medium aneurysms generally have a favorable prognosis, with a low risk of myocardial ischemic events and/or mortality. In contrast, patients with large and giant aneurysms (ie, Z-scores ≥10 or an internal diameter &gt;8 mm) have a higher risk of complications including myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or sudden death. These risks are highest in patients with CAAs with maximum Z-score ≥20.
