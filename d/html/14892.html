         Patients with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) have impaired function due to difficulty maintaining wakefulness or alertness at appropriate times during the day. Complaints of EDS, or related terms such as tiredness, fatigue, and lack of energy, constitute some of the most common issues presented to clinicians. EDS is important to recognize because it can signal an undiagnosed sleep disorder or other treatable condition. In addition, EDS can have negative impacts on a broad range of activities and raise safety risks while driving or operating other machinery.

         This topic provides a general overview of the epidemiology, etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of disorders that cause excessive daytime sleepiness. Classification of sleep disorders, sleep deprivation, and quantification of sleepiness are discussed separately. (See

         Daytime sleepiness is defined as excessive when it causes a subjective complaint or interferes with function. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition, Text Revision (ICSD-3-TR) defines EDS as the inability to maintain wakefulness and alertness during the major waking episodes of the day, with sleep occurring unintentionally or at inappropriate times almost daily for at least three months [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         ].

         The terms hypersomnia and hypersomnolence are sometimes used interchangeably with EDS. In the ICSD-3-TR, hypersomnolence is used to describe symptoms including excessive sleepiness and increased sleep duration, and hypersomnia refers to specific disorders characterized by hypersomnolence [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Fatigue refers to a subjective lack of physical or mental energy. Clinical fatigue incorporates three components, present to variable degrees in individual patients: inability to initiate activity (perception of generalized weakness, in the absence of objective findings); reduced capacity to maintain activity (easy fatigability); and difficulty with concentration, memory, and emotional stability (mental fatigue) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2783.html" rel="external">
          "Approach to the adult patient with fatigue"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In practice, patients may use terms such as fatigue, tiredness, low energy, and sleepiness interchangeably. Although successful distinction is sometimes possible and can lead to different diagnostic approaches, data from patients with sleep disorders suggest that the terms, as used and emphasized by patients, have significant overlap. As an example, among 190 patients with laboratory-confirmed sleep-disordered breathing, 40 percent identified lack of energy as their worst problem, about 35 percent identified tiredness or fatigue, and only 25 percent identified sleepiness as their worst problem [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, when a sleep disorder is treated, patients may report less fatigue, tiredness, and lack of energy, as well as less sleepiness [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].

         EDS is reported by 10 to 25 percent of the general population [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The quality of the data is limited by use of subjective measures in almost all studies, and variability between studies in questions used to assess for EDS. EDS has been reported to decrease with age in some studies, and to increase with age in others. Most studies show an equal sex ratio or a female predominance of up to two to one [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6-8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In a prospective population-based study that included over 4000 women without sleepiness at baseline, EDS developed in 8 percent of women over a 10-year period [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. The strongest independent risk factors for incident EDS were insomnia and smoking; others included anxiety and/or depression, somatic symptoms, snoring, and obesity.

         The causes of EDS are numerous, and multiple factors may contribute in any one patient. Some of the most common causes of EDS are insufficient sleep, depression, medications, and comorbid medical and psychiatric disorders. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and treatable cause of EDS that may not be readily apparent by history; though less common, hypersomnias of central origin such as narcolepsy should also be considered  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef86811" href="/z/d/graphic/86811.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Rarely, somatic symptoms and malingering account for symptoms of hypersomnia.

         Insufficient sleep can be self-imposed or socially provoked, as in shift work or other forms of sleep restriction. It can also result from an underlying comorbidity such as depression, medical illness or pain. Certain medications and drugs of abuse can alter sleep quantity and quality. (See

         Parasomnias are not usually associated with EDS. Insomnia can sometimes be associated with EDS, but more commonly insomnia is associated with fatigue. In fact, patients with insomnia often exist in a state of hyperactivation and have difficulty napping during the day, just as they have difficulty sleeping at night. (See

         In the evaluation of EDS, the history is directed at refining the complaint of sleepiness and identifying potential causes. The history should elicit a detailed description of the complaint, attempting to differentiate sleepiness from other common problems such as fatigue, lack of energy or weakness. It may be helpful to explain the difference between the terms and to ask a series of targeted questions for each symptom  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef86812" href="/z/d/graphic/86812.html" rel="external">
          table 2

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Sleepiness manifests mainly during sedentary activities, in contrast with fatigue, which typically affects pursuit of more active goals. The clinician should ask about the propensity to fall asleep in low stimulus situations, such as long drives, reading, watching television, talking on the phone, interacting with friends, and completing desk work. Patients should also be asked to what extent they have a problem with daytime sleepiness. The answer to this question often is different from what a clinician might expect after asking about drowsiness during sedentary activities.
        </p>
        <p>
         The medication list should be reviewed for any potentially contributory agents  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef86811" href="/z/d/graphic/86811.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         As EDS is frequently a symptom of sleep deprivation or an underlying sleep disorder, a sleep history should be taken in all patients. A good sleep history includes detailed information about symptoms of disturbed sleep, the duration of the symptoms (ie, acute or chronic), and the sleep environment. The history should include information about sleep times, such as bedtime, duration until sleep onset, final awakening time, consistency of bedtimes and awakening times, nap times, and nap lengths. The patient should be asked about sleep problems, including the number and duration of awakenings over a typical 24-hour period or a week.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients who cannot provide an adequate sleep history or who report considerable day-to-day or night-to-night variability can be asked to complete a daily sleep log for one or two weeks. Sleep logs record sleep times, sleep problems, and subjective sleep quality, so that the clinician may review the information for diagnosis and evaluate treatment efficacy without being misled by recall errors  (

         In addition to daytime sleepiness, the cardinal features of narcolepsy (cataplexy, sleep attacks, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis) are not always volunteered and may be elicited by a careful history. (See

         Patients should be screened for depression with questions about depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, change in appetite or weight, psychomotor retardation or agitation, low energy, poor concentration, thoughts of worthlessness or guilt, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. We recommend using a simple two- or nine-item screening tool such as the PHQ-9, which is easy to use, reliable and valid in primary care settings  (

         Interviewing family members and caregivers can be particularly informative. Sleepiness is not always obvious to the person suffering from it, and a spouse, family member, or friend can often provide helpful observations on the impact of the patient's EDS. All individuals should also be asked whether sleepiness affects quality of life, relationships with others, ability to concentrate, work productivity, and mood.

         In most cases, a patient with EDS will not show specific findings on examination. Falling asleep while waiting for the clinician, excessive yawning, difficulty keeping eyes open, and poor concentration may help support the history if present, but if absent do not exclude EDS. The physical exam can also provide clues to an underlying sleep disorder. As an example, excessive oropharyngeal tissue, retrognathia, large neck circumference and obesity may be seen in patients with OSA. (See

         The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a one-page questionnaire that asks respondents to estimate their likelihood in recent times of dozing off or falling asleep in eight sedentary situations such as sitting and reading, traveling as a passenger in a car for an hour without a break, or sitting quietly after lunch without alcohol (

         ESS scores greater than 10 are considered abnormal and supportive of a complaint of EDS. The ESS is easy to administer and can be helpful in that a high score raises the likelihood that a patient's complaint is truly EDS as opposed to fatigue or low energy. The validity of the ESS and its advantages and disadvantages are discussed separately. (See

         In many patients, the cause of EDS is apparent from the history and no diagnostic testing is necessary. This may be the case in patients who take offending medications or in those with clear sleep deprivation or medical or psychiatric conditions known to be associated with EDS. In other patients, particularly those in whom the history and examination suggest the possibility of sleep-related breathing disorders (such as sleep apnea) or central disorders of hypersomnolence, additional formal testing in a sleep laboratory should be pursued.

         Polysomnography is recommended in the evaluation of EDS when suspicion is raised for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), other sleep-related breathing disorders, periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), narcolepsy, other central hypersomnias, or seizures during sleep. Polysomnography can also help identify the cause of insomnia in patients who do not have clear reasons for insomnia by history and examination. (See

         Sometimes, the PSG shows evidence of recent sleep deprivation, such as short nocturnal sleep latency, increased overall sleep efficiency, or an increase in the expected amount of deep non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep. However, the novel experience of a sleep laboratory and recording equipment can hinder rapid sleep onset, deep sleep, or demonstration of sleep stages as they would appear in a more habituated setting, so the absence of polysomnographic features suggestive of EDS should not reduce concern for a complaint of EDS.

         The multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) should only be performed immediately after a PSG. The PSG should confirm that the patient obtained sufficient sleep (generally six hours or more) to allow interpretation of the MSLT results. The PSG may also provide relevant information about the quality of sleep and contribute to evidence of narcolepsy. The MSLT then provides an objective assessment of daytime sleepiness (as demonstrated by an individual's tendency to fall asleep at different times throughout the day [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]) and an assessment for narcolepsy.
        </p>
        <p>
         The MSLT consists of five daytime nap attempts while sleep/wake states are recorded in a sleep laboratory [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17
         </a>
         ]. For results to be valid and reliable, patients must have had (as above) sufficient sleep the night before, must not have been sleep deprived recently, and when possible should not be taking – or have recently discontinued – medications that affect sleep or daytime sleepiness. In addition, naps should not be performed during a patient's usual sleep period. These issues may be more important for younger patients. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7688.html" rel="external">
          "Quantifying sleepiness", section on 'Multiple sleep latency test (MSLT)'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The primary results obtained from the MSLT are the mean sleep latency (based on standard EEG, EOG, and EMG criteria) and the number of naps that include REM sleep (known as sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods, or SOREMPs). A mean sleep latency less than eight minutes is generally considered to be consistent with objective evidence of EDS, in a properly performed MSLT that follows sufficient nocturnal sleep (of at least six hours) on PSG during the previous night. Although this cut-point (eight minutes) divides a largely unimodal distribution, with normal individuals sometimes scoring lower and patients with sleep disorders sometimes scoring higher, mean sleep latencies less than eight minutes are considered supportive of several specific sleep disorders. As examples:

         A mean sleep latency less than eight minutes, plus two or more SOREMPs, support a diagnosis of narcolepsy in the appropriate clinical circumstances. One of the two SOREMPs can occur on the PSG performed on the previous night. (See

         A mean sleep latency less than eight minutes, plus fewer than two SOREMPs, can support a diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia in the appropriate clinical setting. (See

         In general, short mean sleep latencies on an MSLT are more informative than longer latencies. In other words, negative results (ie, sleep latency greater than eight minutes) should not be used to argue that a patient complaining of EDS is not in fact sleepy. Normal results on an MSLT can provide some reassurance, but cannot guarantee a patient's ability to remain awake when driving or during other potentially dangerous circumstances. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/101086.html" rel="external">
          "Drowsy driving: Risks, evaluation, and management", section on 'Polysomnography and other testing'

        </p>
        <p>
         The MSLT is indicated when clinical suspicion exists for narcolepsy [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ], and may be useful in other circumstances when an objective measure of sleepiness is desired. The test is not routinely indicated, however, in evaluation for suspected OSA, sleepiness due to medical or neurological causes, insomnia, or circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders.
        </p>
        <p>
         A related study, the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT), is not routinely indicated in the initial evaluation of EDS. It may be considered to assess an individual's ability to remain awake when the inability to do so could constitute a public or personal safety issue [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. However, results must be integrated with findings from the clinical history and compliance with therapy, and normal MWT results do not guarantee adequate alertness and safety.
        </p>
        <p>
         Neither the MSLT nor the MWT have been well validated prospectively as predictive tools for accident risk in real-world circumstances. However, case-control and cross-sectional studies do suggest validity of these assessments, with accuracy sufficient for research if not individual patient risk assessment [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,19

Actigraphy (in addition to sleep logs) is also useful during the one-to-two weeks just before an MSLT, to establish whether sleep deprivation is likely to impact the MSLT results. (See

         A decision on referral of a patient with EDS will depend on the experience, subspecialty training, and comfort level of the practitioner, as well as local availability of appropriate specialists. EDS is a serious, life-threatening condition that cannot be ignored. Especially when chronic, the clinician should assess and manage the patient, including follow-up to ensure adequate control, or provide an appropriate referral to obtain the necessary medical attention. Safety precautions in the meantime should be explained and emphasized with each patient.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some accredited sleep disorders centers require that a patient be seen by an affiliated sleep medicine physician before polysomnography or other testing. In such cases, the sleep medicine physician often directs treatment efforts as well. Other accredited centers will see some patients after they are tested and found to have a sleep disorder, or they will work with outside physicians who are comfortable with the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders.

         <strong>
          Definition
         </strong>
         – Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is defined as inability to maintain wakefulness or alertness during the major waking episodes of the day. It is distinguished from fatigue, which refers to a subjective lack of physical or mental energy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Definitions'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Causes
         </strong>
         – The causes of EDS are numerous and include at least four broad categories: insufficient sleep, sleep disorders, medical and psychiatric conditions, and medications. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Causes'

         Insufficient sleep can be self-imposed or a consequence of work and other external obligations.

         Sleep disorders that contribute to EDS include sleep-related breathing disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA); circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders; and central disorders of hypersomnolence, such as narcolepsy.

         <strong>
          Initial evaluation
         </strong>
         – The most important tool in the evaluation of a patient with EDS is the history, including a detailed sleep history, looking for clues to an underlying sleep disorder or explanation for insufficient sleep. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a standardized measure of subjective sleepiness that is not diagnostic but can be useful in clinical practice. Additional objective testing in the sleep laboratory can also be helpful. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Initial evaluation'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Role of polysomnography
         </strong>
         – A polysomnogram should be ordered when the clinician suspects OSA, other sleep-related breathing disorders, periodic limb movement disorder, narcolepsy, other central hypersomnias, seizures during sleep, or unexplained insomnia. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Polysomnography'

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         A home sleep apnea test may be an appropriate alternative to polysomnography in a sleep laboratory when a patient's history and physical exam suggest high pretest probability for moderate to severe OSA. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Home sleep apnea testing'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Additional testing
         </strong>
         – The multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) is indicated and should be performed immediately after polysomnography when clinical suspicion exists for narcolepsy or other disorders of central hypersomnolence, or when objective assessment of daytime sleepiness is desired. When an assessment of ability to remain alert is the main question, a variant of the MSLT, the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT), may be appropriate. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Multiple sleep latency test'
