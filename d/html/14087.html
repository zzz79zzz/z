Commonly triggered by viral infections, ADEM is caused by an inflammatory reaction in the brain and spinal cord. The onset of encephalopathy and multifocal neurologic deficits is acute and often rapidly progressive.</p><p>This topic will review the pathology, epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of ADEM in adults. Clinical aspects of ADEM in children are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6184.html" rel="external">"Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in children: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6208.html" rel="external">"Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in children: Treatment and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H193267831"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pathogenesis of ADEM is reviewed here briefly and discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6184.html" rel="external">"Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in children: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>Although the pathogenesis is incompletely understood, ADEM appears to be an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system that is triggered by an environmental stimulus in genetically susceptible individuals. One proposed mechanism is that myelin autoantigens such as myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, and myelin oligodendrocyte protein share antigenic determinants with those of an infecting pathogen. Antiviral antibodies or a cell-mediated response to the pathogen cross-react with the myelin autoantigens, resulting in ADEM.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H193267837"><span class="h1">PATHOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Gross neuropathologic brain sections of patients with ADEM often reveal edema [<a href="#rid1">1</a>] (consistent with observations that ADEM typically improves with glucocorticoid treatment and causes only minimal neurologic sequelae). However, in other cases the brain may appear normal [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>The most common histopathologic finding is perivenous infiltration of lymphocytes; neutrophils, plasma cells, microglial cells, foamy macrophages, and eosinophilic granulocytes have also been observed [<a href="#rid1">1,3</a>]. Many reports emphasize the finding of perivenous sleeves of inflammation and demyelination as the pathologic hallmark and predominant lesion of ADEM [<a href="#rid1">1-7</a>]. In some ADEM cases, these perivenous lesions may eventually coalesce to form confluent regions of demyelination [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. This is in contrast with multiple sclerosis, which is typically associated with multifocal, discrete lesions.</p><p>Myelin breakdown products are seen as lipids in macrophages [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. An inflammatory infiltrate surrounding blood vessels is often described as cuffing of vessels [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Additional features may include vasculitic-type lesions consisting of inflammation in the vessel walls [<a href="#rid1">1,8</a>], perivascular necrosis [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>], lymphocytic infiltration of the meninges [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], and glial nodules in gray matter [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Reactive astrocytes are seen in some cases, and gliosis often replaces the inflammatory exudate [<a href="#rid2">2,4</a>]. Axonal damage has been observed in fatal cases of ADEM [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H193267843"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ADEM is an uncommon illness in adults, thus the precise incidence is unknown [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. It is thought to occur more frequently in children. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6184.html" rel="external">"Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in children: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>ADEM is an expanding phenotype that may overlap with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody-associated disorder (see <a class="local">'MOG antibody-associated disorder'</a> below). In a population-based study from Minnesota that evaluated autoimmune and infectious encephalitis, the prevalence of ADEM <strong>without</strong> MOG antibodies was 3.3 per 100,000 population, while the prevalence of MOG-associated demyelination was 1.9 per 100,000 [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>ADEM has been reported in adults 18 to 82 years of age; the median age ranges from 33 to 41 [<a href="#rid12">12-16</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Association with preceding infection</strong> – In retrospective studies, ADEM is associated with a preceding infection in 50 to 75 percent of adult cases [<a href="#rid15">15-18</a>]. As an example, in a study that included 20 adult patients with an initial diagnosis of ADEM, a preceding infection was present in 14 (70 percent) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Note that all of these reports are retrospective and limited by potential referral or recall bias [<a href="#rid15">15-18</a>]. Nevertheless, these data suggest that infection may be involved in triggering the onset of ADEM.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">While ADEM is often preceded by a viral or bacterial infection, an underlying pathogen is not always identified, and ADEM may follow a nonspecific upper respiratory or gastrointestinal illness [<a href="#rid12">12,19</a>]. The list of infectious pathogens associated with ADEM includes rubella, mumps, varicella, measles, smallpox, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, human herpes virus-6, influenza, HIV, and <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> [<a href="#rid1">1,2,20-24</a>]. In addition, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may be associated; a few case reports have described patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who had clinical and neuroimaging findings consistent with ADEM. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/128153.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Neurologic complications and management of neurologic conditions", section on 'Other acute neurologic manifestations'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Weak association with immunization</strong> – Although early reports suggested that a small minority of ADEM cases followed immunization, subsequent studies have found little or no association between ADEM and immunization. The frequency of ADEM in the United States following any vaccine was explored using the Vaccine Safety Datalink, which captured approximately 64 million doses of 24 different vaccines administered between 2007 and 2012 [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. There was no increase in the risk of ADEM during the primary exposure window (5 to 28 days prior to onset) for any vaccine with the possible exception of the tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine (odds ratio [OR] 15.8, 95% CI 1.2-471.6). However, this result was based on only two cases of ADEM, one of whom received a second vaccine concurrent with Tdap. In addition, adjustments for multiple comparisons were not performed. Overall, the attributable risk for ADEM following Tdap was 0.385 per one million doses (95% CI 0.04-1.16).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In early reports, ADEM sometimes occurred after administration of the rabies (Semple) vaccine, which has not been used in the United States for decades [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Typically, adults and children developed encephalomyelitis 8 to 21 days following the immunization (range 6 to 45 days). Neurologic complications suggestive of ADEM were also reported (rarely) after vaccines against smallpox, influenza, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, measles, rubella, and polio [<a href="#rid1">1,27-30</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H193267849"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3189701136"><span class="h2">Classic ADEM</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Classic descriptions of ADEM involve a preceding infectious illness in most but not all cases (see <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above). After a lag time of a few days to two months (mean 26 days) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>], the typical presentation involves the acute onset of multifocal neurologic symptoms with encephalopathy, often with rapid deterioration prompting hospitalization [<a href="#rid12">12,13,19,31</a>]. Most patients present with motor deficits; these may involve a single limb or result in paraparesis (partial paralysis of both legs) or quadriparesis [<a href="#rid2">2,12</a>]. Sensory deficits are frequent, and brainstem involvement is common, including oculomotor deficits and dysarthria [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>Additional signs and symptoms may include headache, malaise, meningismus, ataxia, aphasia, optic neuritis (sometimes bilateral), nystagmus, extrapyramidal movement disorders, urinary retention, seizures, and increased intracranial pressure [<a href="#rid2">2,12,13,15,16</a>].</p><p>In children, where ADEM is more common than in adults, the presence of encephalopathy is one of the required clinical features for a diagnosis of ADEM, as outlined in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74896" href="/d/graphic/74896.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). In adults, the presence of encephalopathy is clinically important, as it helps to identify individuals who are less likely to have a different disease, such as multiple sclerosis, and more likely to have ADEM. However, encephalopathy has not always been a required feature for diagnosis, thus it has been reported in only 20 to 56 percent of adult cases [<a href="#rid2">2,12,15,16</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Making the diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H278794034"><span class="h2">Variant forms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHL) is considered a variant type of ADEM. Some experts recognize additional variants of ADEM, including site-restricted forms such as postinfectious myelitis or myeloradiculoneuritis, and a form with mixed central and peripheral nervous system involvement [<a href="#rid24">24,32</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H278794085"><span class="h3">Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>AHL, also called acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis (AHEM) or acute necrotizing hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (ANHLE) of Weston-Hurst, is considered a hyperacute variant of ADEM. Typically, AHL presents after an infectious illness with meningismus, headache, seizures, multifocal neurologic signs, asymmetrical neurologic deficits, and rapid progression to coma [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain usually reveal hemorrhagic lesions in the white matter [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Additional pathologic features include edema, petechial hemorrhages of the corona radiata, perivascular hemorrhages, destruction of the vessel walls with fibrin deposition, and neutrophilic infiltrates [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Neuroimaging in one rapidly fatal case did not reveal the presence of hemorrhagic lesions  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89986" href="/d/graphic/89986.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>); however, focal hemorrhages were seen on gross sections of the brain at autopsy in the white matter of the bilateral posterior frontal and parietal lobes [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H278794145"><span class="h3">ADEM with peripheral nervous system involvement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Adults with postinfectious neurologic syndromes may have clinical or subclinical electrodiagnostic evidence of peripheral nervous system involvement [<a href="#rid24">24,32</a>]. As an example, one report evaluated 176 adults (median age 69 years), consisting of one group with purely central nervous system syndromes (30 with encephalitis, 35 with encephalomyelitis, and 47 with myelitis) and a second group with both central and peripheral nervous system syndromes (30 patients with encephalomyeloradiculoneuritis and 34 with myeloradiculoneuritis) [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Peripheral nerve involvement was defined by the presence of electrodiagnostic abnormalities. Clinical symptoms of peripheral nerve injury, including distal limb paresthesia, perineal anesthesia, and muscle atrophy, were present in 29 of the 64 patients (46 percent) with electrodiagnostic evidence of peripheral nerve injury. Patients with peripheral nerve involvement were significantly older and had a worse prognosis and an elevated risk of relapses compared with those having only central nervous system syndromes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2244518522"><span class="h1">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2722160911"><span class="h2">When to suspect ADEM</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of ADEM should be considered in patients with unexplained acute encephalopathy and multifocal neurologic signs and symptoms.</p><p>Note that ADEM is an evolving topic in both children and adults given the development of cell-based assays for the detection of anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies.</p><p>Most of the literature describing adults with ADEM was published prior to the systematic implementation of these assays and widespread testing for anti-MOG antibodies. Thus, it is challenging to differentiate the clinical, radiographic, and prognostic features of ADEM with and without MOG-IgG antibodies. However, in patients without MOG-IgG autoantibody, ADEM is typically monophasic, whereas adults who have an ADEM-like presentation and are seropositive for MOG-IgG antibodies are more likely to have recurrences [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. An ADEM-like presentation may also be the first attack of neuromyelitis optica or, rarely, multiple sclerosis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2269347963"><span class="h2">Approach to evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The evaluation of a patient with suspected ADEM begins with a detailed clinical history and examination, which often reveals encephalopathy polyfocal neurologic symptoms. Patients with suspected ADEM should have the following studies:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>MRI of the brain, cervical and thoracic spine with and without contrast. (See <a class="local">'Neuroimaging'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis including (see <a class="local">'CSF analysis'</a> below):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Cell counts, protein, glucose, culture (and viral studies if suggested by the clinical setting and history of outbreaks, such as herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, enterovirus, and West Nile virus)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Qualitative assessment of CSF and serum for oligoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) bands using isoelectric focusing, including IgG synthesis rate and IgG index</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Serologic studies for anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies. (See <a class="local">'Serum autoantibodies'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1494833742"><span class="h3">Neuroimaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with suspected ADEM should undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (without and with contrast), which is the neuroimaging modality of choice. MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine is also indicated if there are symptoms or signs of myelopathy, and is helpful in differentiating ADEM from other central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disorders such as NMOSD and MS. Therefore, all patients with evidence of CNS demyelination should have MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine, even in the absence of myelopathy.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Head CT</strong> – Many patients with suspected ADEM or a variant (eg, acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis [AHEM]) present to an emergency room, and an urgent head computed tomography (CT) scan may be necessary in order to exclude other causes of neurologic disease (see <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below). However, head CT is usually normal or nondiagnostic, especially early in the course of ADEM, although some patients may have scans showing evidence of focal or multifocal white matter damage [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. Regardless of head CT findings, MRI is indicated because it is more sensitive for discriminating demyelinating lesions in the brain and particularly in the spinal cord.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Brain MRI</strong> – Brain lesions on MRI associated with ADEM are typically bilateral and asymmetric and tend to be poorly marginated [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Most patients have multiple lesions in the deep and subcortical white matter, characteristic of demyelination. On MRI, the lesions of ADEM are hyperintense on T2-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89988" href="/d/graphic/89988.html" rel="external">image 1</a>) [<a href="#rid34">34,35</a>] and are usually less conspicuous on unenhanced T1-weighted sequences [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. However, large lesions can be slightly hypointense on unenhanced T1 sequences. There can be considerable heterogeneity: large confluent lesions  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef111832" href="/d/graphic/111832.html" rel="external">image 2</a>), single solitary lesions, and multiple small lesions have been described [<a href="#rid5">5,37</a>]. Lesions may be seen in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, including corpus callosum and centrum semiovale, as well as in the gray matter, including the cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus [<a href="#rid12">12,15,16,38</a>]. Infratentorial lesions in the brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord are common [<a href="#rid2">2,12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Brain MRI is almost always abnormal in ADEM. One series reported that brain MRI was normal in only 3 of 228 children and adults with ADEM; in these three cases, imaging of the cervical and thoracic spine was performed but results were not reported [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Others have noted that there may be a delay in the appearance of MRI lesions [<a href="#rid31">31,39,40</a>]; in one report the time lag to MRI lesion appearance was eight weeks from ADEM symptom onset [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Spinal cord MRI</strong> – Lesions in the spinal cord are common in ADEM, although an isolated spinal cord lesion without supratentorial involvement is rare [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. Both long and short segment cord lesions have been reported, but large confluent intramedullary lesions that extend over multiple segments are more common [<a href="#rid41">41</a>], particularly with MOG antibody-associated ADEM.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Enhancing lesions</strong> – Gadolinium enhancement of MRI lesions in ADEM is variable.

Nevertheless, most patients improve with treatment, and spontaneous recovery has occurred in patients with mild symptoms [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. Complete recovery has been reported in 10 to 46 percent of adults [<a href="#rid12">12,15,19</a>]. Cognitive impairment, mostly affecting attention and concentration, has persisted in some.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mortality</strong> – ADEM may be fatal especially in fulminant cases, with mortality rates of 4 to 12 percent reported in larger modern series [<a href="#rid12">12,15,50</a>].

Thirty-five percent of survivors in this series were left with permanent disability.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Relapses</strong> – Although traditionally considered to be a monophasic illness, up to one-quarter of adults with ADEM experience at least one relapse [<a href="#rid16">16,56</a>]. Of note, patients in these studies were not routinely tested for the presence of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies, which is associated with a higher likelihood of relapses. Nevertheless, ADEM has recurred in cases without MOG antibodies. In such recurrences, the symptoms often localize to the site of the central nervous system that was originally affected. In fact, new clinical symptoms may localize to a previously silent lesion on neuroimaging [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Relapses may also present as cognitive difficulties or neuropsychiatric disease, such as depression or psychosis [<a href="#rid57">57</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Persistent seropositivity for anti-MOG antibodies is associated with an increased risk for relapse [<a href="#rid18">18,48</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Recurrent ADEM frequently responds to glucocorticoid treatment.

Histopathology of ADEM reveals perivascular infiltration of lymphocytes. Perivenous demyelination is a frequent finding. (See <a class="local">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a class="local">'Pathology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>ADEM is an uncommon disease, but the precise incidence in adults is unknown. ADEM is thought to be more frequent in children than adults. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>ADEM typically presents after a preceding illness with multifocal neurologic signs and encephalopathy (altered mental status). Other common neurologic manifestations include motor, sensory, cranial nerve, and brainstem deficits as well as nonspecific symptoms such as headache and malaise. (See <a class="local">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis is a hyperacute variant of ADEM that may be fatal. Petechial or gross hemorrhages may occur  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89986" href="/d/graphic/89986.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The evaluation for ADEM requires neuroimaging, preferably with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and serum autoantibody testing for anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4), preferably with a cell-based assay. (See <a class="local">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>On MRI, lesions associated with ADEM are typically bilateral but may be asymmetric and tend to be poorly marginated. Most patients have multiple lesions in the deep and subcortical white matter. The lesions are hyperintense on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recover (FLAIR) sequences  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89988" href="/d/graphic/89988.html" rel="external">image 1</a>); on unenhanced T1-weighted sequences, small lesions are usually inconspicuous while large lesions are mildly hypointense. Gadolinium enhancement is variable. (See <a class="local">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Lumbar puncture may be normal, or may reveal a lymphocytic pleocytosis or elevated protein. The presence of oligoclonal bands in the CSF (but not serum) or elevated immunoglobulin G (IgG) index is more common in multiple sclerosis but can also be seen in ADEM. (See <a class="local">'CSF analysis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Anti-MOG antibodies are indicative of MOG antibody-associated disorder, which can manifest as ADEM. Anti-AQP4 antibodies are indicative of NMOSD. (See <a class="local">'Serum autoantibodies'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The diagnosis of ADEM is considered in patients with encephalopathy and unexplained acute multifocal neurologic signs and symptoms. The diagnosis is supported by the presence of one or more supratentorial or infratentorial demyelinating lesions on brain MRI and the absence of destructive "black hole" lesions on T1-weighted MRI. A preceding infection and abnormal CSF are suggestive of ADEM, but not required for the diagnosis. There are no specific biomarkers to establish the diagnosis. (See <a class="local">'Making the diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In adults, ADEM is difficult to distinguish from multiple sclerosis. Other entities to be considered in the differential of ADEM include infectious meningoencephalitis, neurologic sarcoidosis, vasculitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and Behçet syndrome. (See <a class="local">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Immune suppression is the mainstay of treatment for ADEM. For adults with ADEM, we recommend initial therapy with high-dose glucocorticoids (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_3" rel="external">Grade 1C</a>). Reasonable regimens include intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9639" href="/d/drug information/9639.html" rel="external">methylprednisolone</a> 1000 mg daily for three to five days. For patients with suspected ADEM who present with symptoms suggestive of encephalitis, it is reasonable to treat empirically with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9335" href="/d/drug information/9335.html" rel="external">acyclovir</a> until an infectious etiology is excluded. For those who have an insufficient response to intravenous glucocorticoid treatment, therapeutic options include intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) treatment, 0.4 g/kg daily for five days, or plasma exchange. (See <a class="local">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Most patients with ADEM improve with treatment, but complete recovery occurs in only 10 to 46 percent of adult patients, with motor deficits and/or cognitive impairment often persisting in the remainder. In fulminant cases, death may result. Relapses, though unusual, have occurred. Relapses that involve a different region of the central nervous system should raise suspicion for multiple sclerosis.
