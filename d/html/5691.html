Although complications of eosinophilia are more common in patients with higher AEC (eg, &gt;1500/microL), some patients with persistent hypereosinophilia do not develop organ damage and, conversely, a patient with mild eosinophilia may have significant organ involvement. Organ damage must be evaluated by clinical evaluation and laboratory testing. (See <a class="local">'Initial evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>AEC does not identify the cause</strong> – The degree of eosinophilia may help to narrow the differential diagnosis, but the AEC is not sufficient to establish the diagnosis. As an example, marked eosinophilia (eg, ≥20,000/microL) can be seen in drug hypersensitivity reactions or myeloid neoplasms, but is unlikely to be associated with asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Importantly, all patients with an AEC &gt;1500/microL should be evaluated for hypereosinophilic syndrome, as described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2211.html" rel="external">"Hypereosinophilic syndromes: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis", section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4274654456"><span class="h2">Diagnostic vigilance</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Consider diverse causes</strong> – It is important to consider many possible causes for eosinophilia. Even in apparently straightforward cases (eg, a child who has long-standing mild eosinophilia and atopy, a traveler returning from a parasite-endemic area with new eosinophilia and gastrointestinal complaints), there may be other, less apparent causes of eosinophilia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Remain vigilant</strong> – It is especially important to consider other diagnoses when eosinophilia does not respond as expected to an intervention (eg, treatment of an infection, withdrawal of a presumed offending agent). Furthermore, a high degree of suspicion and thoughtful evaluation may be required to identify certain syndromes, such as primary immunodeficiencies, autoimmune illnesses, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA; formerly called Churg-Strauss syndrome).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2005630393"><span class="h1">URGENCY OF EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The urgency of evaluation is informed by the clinical status of the patient and the level of eosinophilia.</p><p>Eosinophilia may be encountered in the course of evaluating other clinical conditions or as an incidental finding on a complete blood count (CBC) and differential. We use both the patient's clinical status and the level of absolute eosinophil count (AEC) to guide the urgency of evaluation. In the sections that follow, we offer examples of clinical presentations that inform the pace of evaluation. However, these examples should serve as illustrations rather than strict guidelines, and they should not override the clinician's judgment regarding urgency of evaluation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2405020440"><span class="h2">Acutely ill or extremely high AEC</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hospitalization is generally warranted for patients who are acutely ill or who have an extremely high or rapidly rising AEC. Hospitalization permits management of medical emergencies while the cause of eosinophilia is being investigated. Importantly, management of medical emergencies should not be delayed by the diagnostic evaluation. Since therapy (eg, high dose glucocorticoids) can affect the results of diagnostic testing, every effort should be made to obtain appropriate studies before initiating emergency treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2210.html" rel="external">"Hypereosinophilic syndromes: Treatment", section on 'Studies to obtain urgently'</a>.)</p><p>Emergency treatment may be needed for hemodynamic instability, severe respiratory compromise, delirium, coma, mononeuritis multiplex, or other life-threatening or disabling conditions that may reflect irreversible eosinophil-associated tissue damage to the heart, lungs, nervous system, or other organs. A decision to treat on an emergency basis should be based on the severity of illness and the likelihood of eosinophilia as the cause, rather than the level of AEC alone. Emergency management of the acutely ill patient with eosinophilia, including treatment with high dose steroids, leukapheresis, and/or cytoreduction is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2210.html" rel="external">"Hypereosinophilic syndromes: Treatment", section on 'Immediate treatment for severe disease'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4522.html" rel="external">"Hyperleukocytosis and leukostasis in hematologic malignancies", section on 'Management of hyperleukocytosis'</a>.)</p><p>An extremely high AEC alone (eg, ≥50,000/microL), significant cytopenias (eg, neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia), or leukemic blasts on the blood smear should be evaluated urgently even if the patient is clinically stable, as it may reflect a potentially life-threatening disorder (eg, hematologic malignancy) or impending medical emergency. The decision to hospitalize should be made on a case-by-case basis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2211.html" rel="external">"Hypereosinophilic syndromes: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis", section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> and <a class="local">'Suspected hematologic disorder'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H169766254"><span class="h2">Symptomatic, but clinically stable</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For the patient who is symptomatic but clinically stable, the urgency of evaluation depends on the clinical presentation, level of eosinophilia, and concern on the part of the clinician and/or patient.</p><p>In general, the AEC alone should not determine the urgency of evaluation in a clinically stable patient. However, patients with ≥5000 eosinophils/microL or rapidly rising AEC should be evaluated promptly. All patients with AEC ≥1500/microL should be evaluated for hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2211.html" rel="external">"Hypereosinophilic syndromes: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis", section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>For other symptomatic but clinically stable patients, the urgency of evaluation is informed by findings that may reflect organ involvement and/or the cause of eosinophilia, and by concerns on the part of the clinician and patient. As examples, patients with chest pain, elevated cardiac troponin, or an unexplained abnormal chest X-ray should be evaluated promptly, regardless of the AEC. Conversely, it may be reasonable to conduct the evaluation over a period of weeks or longer for a patient with an AEC of 1400/microL and eczema, previously diagnosed asthma, or a recently treated helminth infection.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1800792404"><span class="h2">Asymptomatic or incidental eosinophilia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All patients with AEC ≥1500/microL should have a CBC repeated in one to two weeks to determine if the eosinophilia is transient, stable, or rising; the CBC should be repeated even when eosinophilia is detected incidentally in an asymptomatic patient. Persistent AEC &gt;1500/microL or a rising AEC should be evaluated promptly for HES, even though it is uncommon for such patients to be completely asymptomatic. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2211.html" rel="external">"Hypereosinophilic syndromes: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis", section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>For asymptomatic patients with eosinophilia &lt;1500/microL, it may be reasonable to postpone a repeat CBC and evaluation for a month or longer. However, it is important to first ensure that there are <strong>no</strong> clinical findings suggestive of eosinophilic end-organ damage, no history of travel or residence in helminth-endemic areas, and no features suggestive of a malignancy (eg, significant anemia or thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy) before deferring the evaluation.</p><p>Evaluation of the patient with incidental eosinophilia (ie, elevated AEC that was detected by routine testing, without associated symptoms) is described below. (See <a class="local">'Incidental eosinophilia'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3506149612"><span class="h1">INITIAL EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial evaluation should assess the patient for clinical findings that may be attributable to eosinophilia, and seek to determine the underlying cause.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2556803697"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The history should elicit symptoms that may reflect organ involvement by eosinophils, including a complete review of systems, because of the protean manifestations of organ involvement by eosinophils. The history should seek to identify conditions that may cause eosinophilia, including asthma, atopy, rheumatologic conditions, infections, malignancy, potential exposures (eg, medications, diet, infections), and family history.

Eosinophilia may be the sole abnormality on the CBC, or it may be accompanied by other abnormalities.

(See <a class="local">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Causes</strong> – Eosinophilia may be caused by numerous conditions  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76434" href="/d/graphic/76434.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), including allergic diseases, medication reactions  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef84015" href="/d/graphic/84015.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), infectious  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef84014" href="/d/graphic/84014.html" rel="external">table 4</a>), inflammatory, and neoplastic disorders  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59869" href="/d/graphic/59869.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Causes and evaluation of eosinophilia in children are similar to those of adults, but some disorders are more common in children (eg, asthma, atopy, allergies, certain leukemias) (see <a class="local">'Children'</a> above). Eosinophil biology and pathophysiology, and the causes of eosinophilia are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/100544.html" rel="external">"Eosinophil biology and causes of eosinophilia", section on 'Major causes of eosinophilia'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Absolute eosinophil count (AEC) does not predict organ involvement</strong> – The AEC alone does not accurately predict the likelihood of organ involvement nor define the underlying cause of eosinophilia. It is important to consider many possible causes in the evaluation of a patient with eosinophilia. (See <a class="local">'Important concepts'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Determining the urgency of evaluation</strong> – The patient's presentation, AEC, and evidence of organ involvement inform the urgency and nature of the evaluation (see <a class="local">'Urgency of evaluation'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Acutely ill or extremely high AEC</strong> – We suggest hospitalization and urgent evaluation for patients with hemodynamic instability, severe respiratory compromise, delirium, coma, other life-threatening conditions, extreme elevations of AEC, or worrisome findings on blood smear (eg, leukemic blasts). (See <a class="local">'Acutely ill or extremely high AEC'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Management of medical emergencies should not be delayed by the diagnostic evaluation of eosinophilia. Patients with an acute illness due to leukostasis or organ dysfunction from eosinophil infiltration may require urgent treatment with high dose steroids, leukapheresis, and/or cytoreduction as described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2210.html" rel="external">"Hypereosinophilic syndromes: Treatment", section on 'Immediate treatment for severe disease'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Symptomatic, clinically stable</strong> – For symptomatic but clinically stable patients, the urgency of evaluation is informed by the presence of symptoms or other findings that may reflect organ involvement, and by the AEC and concerns on the part of the clinician and patient. (See <a class="local">'Symptomatic, but clinically stable'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Asymptomatic or incidental eosinophilia </strong>– Evaluation of asymptomatic patients with <strong>no</strong> clinical findings suggestive of organ damage or concerning travel/residency history is informed by the AEC and concerns of the clinician and patient. (See <a class="local">'Asymptomatic or incidental eosinophilia'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial evaluation</strong> – Initial evaluation for all patients should include history with a complete review of systems to elicit the wide range of symptoms that may reflect organ involvement or an underlying cause of eosinophilia and possible exposures including medications, diet, and travel/residence; physical examination; CBC and differential; review of the blood smear; and other laboratory studies. (See <a class="local">'Initial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Specific clinical scenarios</strong> – Signs and symptoms, in combination with the results from the initial evaluation should direct further evaluation. (See <a class="local">'Tests for selected patients'</a> above and <a class="local">'Clinical scenarios'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Monitoring over time</strong> – The nature and timing of follow-up evaluation is guided by the underlying cause, level of eosinophilia, clinical setting, organ involvement, and concerns of the patient and practitioner, as described above.
