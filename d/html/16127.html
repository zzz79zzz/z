         The era of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to declining rates of opportunistic infections and a new focus on other leading causes of morbidity, such as end-stage liver disease secondary to chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>

         ]; ART should include agents with dual activity against HIV and HBV.
        </p>
        <p>
         The pretreatment evaluation of chronic HBV in patients living with HIV will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of HBV infection in patients with HIV are discussed separately. (See

         Most patients with HIV and chronic HBV will be treated for their HIV and HBV, regardless of the stage of liver disease or their level of immunosuppression (ie, CD4 cell count). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3652.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The pretreatment evaluation of such patients includes obtaining baseline markers of disease activity (used to monitor the response to therapy), information to determine which antiviral agents to use for HBV treatment, and information to assess for other causes of liver injury and complications of advanced liver disease (eg, varices, hepatocellular carcinoma).

         Certain baseline tests are obtained to assess the level of HBV activity, and are also used to monitor response to therapy and/or guide future treatment decisions. These tests include aminotransferase levels, HBV DNA level, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), and hepatitis B e antibody (anti-HBe). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Aminotransferase levels'

        <p>
         Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) are typically obtained prior to the pretreatment evaluation as they are needed to make the diagnosis of chronic or occult HBV. (See

         The activity of HBV infection is inferred by elevations of aminotransferase levels. Reductions in these levels are suggestive of a treatment response. (See

         HBV DNA is also used to monitor response to therapy. One treatment goal is to achieve an undetectable HBV DNA. Patients who do not achieve an appropriate virologic response may be non-adherent to their medications or may have developed drug-resistant HBV. (See

         HBeAg is a marker of HBV replication and infectivity. For individuals who are HBeAg positive, seroconversion from HBeAg to anti-HBe is usually associated with declines in serum HBV DNA. A more detailed review of serologic markers for HBV infection is found elsewhere. (See

         Most patients with HIV and HBV coinfection will be treated with an antiretroviral regimen that includes a tenofovir-emtricitabine containing backbone; these agents are considered first-line treatment for both infections. However, the ultimate choice depends upon the patient’s prior treatment history for HIV and/or HBV, as well as their kidney function. The presence of hepatitis D coinfection may also impact treatment. (See

         We obtain a baseline serum creatinine and urinalysis prior to starting treatment. The approach to treatment depends in part upon the estimated glomerular filtration rate. (See

         Patients should be tested for antibody to hepatitis D virus (HDV), which can only cause infection in patients with chronic HBV and may accelerate liver disease progression.

         Patients with HIV may be at increased risk for hepatic steatosis compared with those who do not have HIV, and this may be associated with abnormal aminotransferase levels. Hepatic steatosis may be suggested on ultrasound, which is also used to screen for hepatocellular carcinoma. It may also be suggested from transient elastography if a controlled attenuation parameter score is also obtained. (See

          History

         – Patients should be asked about easy bruisability, jaundice, dark urine, light stools, history of gastrointestinal bleeding (eg, hematemesis or melena), signs associated with hypogonadism (eg, impotence, infertility), and pruritus. In addition, insomnia, altered sleep patterns, and recent automobile accidents may suggest the presence of early hepatic encephalopathy. (See

         – Patients should have a physical examination to determine if there are any stigmata of advanced liver disease (eg, spider angiomata, splenomegaly, palmar erythema, asterixis). Decompensated liver disease is likely if ascites and/or encephalopathy are present. (See

          Laboratory testing
         </strong>
         – Patients should have laboratory testing that includes a complete blood cell count, as well as measurements of albumin and the prothrombin time. A low albumin and/or an elevated prothrombin time are suggestive of advanced liver disease with hepatic decompensation. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia may heighten suspicion of portal hypertension. Although certain findings are suggestive of advanced liver disease, they may also be a result of HIV infection. (See

         <strong>
          Evaluation for fibrosis
         </strong>
         – Patients should also be assessed for fibrosis through the use of a noninvasive method (eg, biomarkers, such as fibrosis marker panels; calculated scores, such as AST to platelet ratio index; or ultrasound-based technology, such as liver elastography). Some centers can provide magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), which is highly accurate but relative expensive. Increasing data support the use of noninvasive methods rather than liver biopsy to evaluate liver stage. As an example, a meta-analysis of 2772 Asian patients with chronic HBV found that the sensitivity and specificity of transient elastography for cirrhosis was 84.6 and 81.5 percent, respectively [
         <a href="#rid5">

         All patients with HIV and chronic HBV infection should have a baseline ultrasound to screen for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients with obesity may require biphasic or triphasic computed tomography (CT) or enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, since ultrasound may provide an inadequate survey of the liver in such patients. Simple contrast CT is not recommended for HCC screening. A discussion on how to monitor patients with HBV for HCC is found elsewhere. (See

         <strong>
          General approach
         </strong>
         – The pretreatment evaluation of patients with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection typically includes: a detailed history and physical examination to assess for hepatotoxic medications and evidence of advanced liver disease; laboratory testing to evaluate markers of HBV activity, kidney function, liver function, and coexisting causes of liver disease; assessment of liver disease through noninvasive testing; and ultrasound imaging to screen for evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma.

         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Determining HBV disease activity
         </strong>
         – Certain baseline tests are obtained to assess the level of HBV activity, and are also used to monitor response to therapy and/or guide future treatment decisions. These tests include aminotransferase levels, HBV DNA level, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), and hepatitis B e antibody (anti-HBe). For some patients, HBV resistance testing should also be performed. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Baseline markers of disease activity'

         <strong>
          Considerations for regimen selection
         </strong>
         – Most patients with HIV/HBV coinfection will be treated with an antiretroviral regimen that includes a tenofovir-emtricitabine containing backbone; these agents are considered first-line treatment for both infections. However, the ultimate choice depends upon the patient’s prior treatment history for HIV and/or HBV, as well as their kidney function. The presence of hepatitis D coinfection may also impact treatment. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Information needed for drug selection'

         <strong>
          Evaluation for other causes of liver disease
         </strong>
         – Patients with chronic HBV infection should be evaluated for other causes of liver disease. Many of these can be addressed, which may help prevent the progression to end-stage liver disease. (See

         <strong>
          Additional testing
         </strong>
         – Patients should be evaluated for cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, osteoporosis, and immunity to hepatitis A virus. The results of this evaluation may prompt the need for additional tests and/or treatments that can reduce the risk of future complications. (See
