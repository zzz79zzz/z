Goiters can be diffuse or nodular, depending on the cause, and may be associated with normal, decreased, or increased thyroid hormone production. The clinical manifestations vary with thyroid function and with the size and location of the goiter. The evaluation of the adult with goiter will be reviewed here. The treatment of goiter in adults and the evaluation and treatment of goiter in children are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/100444.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of benign goiter"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7820.html" rel="external">"Treatment of benign obstructive or substernal goiter"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7873.html" rel="external">"Treatment of toxic adenoma and toxic multinodular goiter"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5844.html" rel="external">"Approach to congenital goiter in newborns and infants"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/120705.html" rel="external">"Approach to acquired goiter in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4373117"><span class="h1">ANATOMICAL RELATIONSHIPS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In healthy adults without iodine deficiency, a normal thyroid gland is approximately 4 to 4.8 x 1 to 1.8 x 0.8 to 1.6 cm in size, with a mean sonographic volume of 7 to 10 mL and weight of 10 to 20 grams [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Thyroid volume measured by ultrasonography is slightly greater in men than women, increases with age and body weight, and decreases with increasing iodine intake. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15313.html" rel="external">"Technical aspects of thyroid ultrasound", section on 'Estimation of thyroid gland volume'</a>.)</p><p>The normal thyroid gland is immediately caudal to the larynx and encircles the anterolateral portion of the trachea  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66834" href="/z/d/graphic/66834.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). The thyroid is bordered by the trachea and esophagus posteriorly and the carotid sheath laterally. Enlarging thyroid lobes usually grow outward because of their location in the anterior neck in front of the trachea, covered only by thin strap muscles, subcutaneous tissue, and skin. As a result of this outward growth, even very large goiters may not compress the trachea or impinge on the great vessels lateral to the lobes. However, in patients with substantial enlargement of one lobe or asymmetric enlargement of both lobes, the trachea, esophagus, or blood vessels may be displaced or, less often, compressed. Bilateral lobar enlargement, especially if the goiter extends posterior to the trachea, may cause either compression or concentric narrowing of the trachea or compression of the esophagus or jugular veins.</p><p>The thoracic inlet is an ovoid area that measures approximately 5 x 10 cm bounded by the sternum anteriorly, the first thoracic vertebral body posteriorly, and the first ribs laterally  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79394" href="/z/d/graphic/79394.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). The inlet is traversed by the trachea, esophagus, blood vessels, and nerves. The inferior pole of each thyroid lobe normally lies above the thoracic inlet. However, with some goiters, there is growth of one or both lobes through the inlet into the thoracic cavity, which can result in obstruction of any of the structures in the inlet. Such goiters are called substernal, although retrosternal is probably a more precise term. Most substernal goiters are in the anterolateral mediastinum, but approximately 10 percent are located primarily in the posterior mediastinum [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. The prevalence of substernal goiter as a percentage of thyroidectomies ranges from 2 to 19 percent [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H62289320"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of goiter worldwide. In mildly and moderately iodine-deficient regions in Denmark, goiter (as determined by ultrasonography) is present in 15 and 22.6 percent of the population, respectively [<a href="#rid5">5</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7828.html" rel="external">"Iodine deficiency disorders", section on 'Diffuse and nodular goiter'</a>). In the United States, where significant iodine deficiency does not exist, multinodular goiter, chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis, and Graves' disease are more common causes of goiter. In older adults, multinodular goiter is most common.</p><p>Other less common causes of goiter include tumors, thyroiditis, and infiltrative diseases  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67399" href="/z/d/graphic/67399.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7824.html" rel="external">"Overview of thyroiditis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7861.html" rel="external">"Infiltrative thyroid disease"</a>.)</p><p>The risk of thyroid cancer within a multinodular goiter is approximately 3 to 5 percent [<a href="#rid6">6</a>], similar to the risk in a solitary thyroid nodule. In a series of 718 patients operated on for goiter in Pakistan, 3 percent of patients were found to have a malignancy [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. In a surgical series (with potential selection bias) of 3233 patients with multinodular goiter, in which all patients had preoperative ultrasounds and patients who had indeterminate, suspicious, or malignant (Bethesda 3 to 6) preoperative FNA were excluded, 31.7 percent had incidental thyroid cancers, of which 56 percent were papillary microcarcinomas [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10798374"><span class="h1">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with iodine deficiency or chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis, an increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion is the predominant cause of goiter. In contrast, most patients with sporadic nontoxic multinodular goiters have normal serum TSH concentrations. In these individuals, the thyroid enlargement is probably caused by several growth factors (including TSH) that act over time on thyroid follicular cells that have different synthetic and growth potentials. There is often a family history of goiter, suggesting that genetic factors may also play a role. The result is diffuse and later multinodular thyroid enlargement. Some nodules eventually become autonomous due to activating mutations in the TSH receptor or G proteins within the thyroid follicular cells. The following observations support this sequence of events [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Thyroid volume is larger in older patients</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The longer the patient has a goiter, the larger the size of the goiter</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The larger the size of the goiter, the lower the serum TSH concentration</p><p></p><p>In patients with Graves' disease, TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb) stimulate the TSH receptor to cause thyroid growth and excessive hormonal secretion. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7841.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of Graves' disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H62289353"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinical manifestations of goiter depend upon the presence of thyroid dysfunction and upon the growth rate of the goiter. Some patients may have symptoms and biochemical evidence of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. However, the majority of patients with goiter are asymptomatic and biochemically euthyroid. Patients with longstanding, large goiters may develop symptoms of obstruction due to progressive compression of the trachea or sudden enlargement (usually accompanied by pain) secondary to hemorrhage into a nodule.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6514313"><span class="h2">Asymptomatic</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most goiters grow very slowly over many decades. Therefore, the majority of patients with goiter are asymptomatic. The goiter may first be noted on physical examination or found incidentally on cross-sectional imaging studies performed for unrelated reasons.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6514256"><span class="h2">Thyroid dysfunction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If the goiter is due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis or severe iodine deficiency, patients may have symptoms of hypothyroidism (eg, fatigue, constipation, cold intolerance). If due to multinodular goiter (with autonomy) or Graves' disease, patients may have symptoms of hyperthyroidism (eg, palpitations, dyspnea on exertion, unexplained weight loss). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7846.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7833.html" rel="external">"Overview of the clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6514262"><span class="h2">Obstructive symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with longstanding goiters (cervical or substernal) may develop symptoms of obstruction due to progressive compression of the trachea or sudden enlargement (usually accompanied by pain) secondary to hemorrhage into a nodule. The majority of patients with obstructive cervical goiters have had a visible goiter for many years. Most patients with substernal goiter (77 to 90 percent in two series) also have visible goiters [<a href="#rid3">3,11</a>], although some are found incidentally on imaging studies performed for unrelated reasons. In those without visible goiter, substernal goiters may also be found because of obstructive symptoms. Since goiters tend to grow slowly, substernal goiters are most commonly discovered during the fifth and sixth decades of life and are found more often in women than men [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>].</p><p>The most common symptom in patients with obstructive cervical or substernal goiter is exertional dyspnea, which is present in 30 to 60 percent of patients [<a href="#rid3">3,13-18</a>]. This symptom usually occurs when the tracheal diameter is less than 8 mm [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. In some patients with substernal goiter, dyspnea is primarily positional or nocturnal and it occurs primarily during maneuvers that force the thyroid into the thoracic inlet, such as reaching and bending. When tracheal compression becomes severe (luminal diameter less than 5 mm), stridor or wheezing occurs at rest [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. This upper airway wheezing must be distinguished from asthma. An upper respiratory illness may exacerbate upper airway obstruction.</p><p>Cough is present in 10 to 30 percent of patients, and it may be positional [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Pain is unusual, but a choking sensation is common.</p><p>Goiter may contribute to obstructive sleep apnea, and thyroidectomy may improve symptoms [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. In a study of 45 patients with snoring symptoms who were undergoing thyroidectomy for any reason (42 percent for goiter or compressive symptoms), 29 percent had improved snoring frequency, apnea, and frequency of daytime somnolence after surgery [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p>A variety of other symptoms can be induced by obstructive goiter:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dysphagia is a less common complaint because of the posterior position of the esophagus</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Compression of a recurrent laryngeal nerve may cause transient or permanent vocal cord palsy, resulting in hoarseness</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Phrenic nerve paralysis</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Horner's syndrome due to compression of the cervical sympathetic chain</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rarely, jugular vein compression or thrombosis, cerebrovascular steal syndromes, or even the superior vena cava syndrome [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3028821662"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of a goiter is usually made at the time of a physical examination. One or more discrete nodules may be palpable.

It is important to rule out malignancy through history, clinical examination, ultrasound, and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of large or suspicious nodules. In the United States, in the absence of autoimmune thyroid disease (Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Graves' disease) and thyroid malignancy, benign multinodular goiter is the most likely diagnosis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6514249"><span class="h2">History and physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In patients with goiter, the following elements of the history should be determined:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Preexisting chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis (the only known risk factor for primary thyroid lymphoma, a relatively rare disease)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Iodine intake (including country of origin)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Head and neck irradiation or radioiodine exposure from nuclear power plant accidents (Chernobyl, Fukushima)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Medication history</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Family history of benign or malignant thyroid disease</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Presence of obstructive symptoms (eg, dyspnea, cough, wheezing) or symptoms of hyper- or hypothyroidism</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Presence of systemic "B" symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss, drenching night sweats)</p><p></p><p>The thyroid and surrounding neck structures should be carefully examined. We prefer to palpate the thyroid from the front of the patient so that landmarks such as the cricoid cartilage and sternocleidomastoid muscles are visible. The isthmus is located just below the cricoid. Thumbs or fingers are placed obliquely between the sternocleidomastoid and the trachea, compressing thyroid tissue on the tracheal surface. It is helpful to watch the patient swallow a sip of water before palpation, assessing for enlargement and asymmetry. Then, having the patient swallow water during palpation allows the examiner to feel the upward movement of the thyroid gland. The neck should be palpated to assess:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Size of the thyroid gland</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Presence of firm or dominant nodules</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Presence of cervical adenopathy </p><p></p><p>The presence of a thyroid bruit (a sign of increased blood flow) may indicate hyperthyroidism, typically due to Graves' disease. One or more discrete nodules may be palpable. However, the physical examination of goiter is highly inaccurate [<a href="#rid6">6,23,24</a>]. Glands that are diffuse on physical exam are often nodular by sonography, and most individuals with thyroid enlargement and a solitary palpable nodule on physical examination actually have multiple nodules when investigated by sonography.</p><p>Tracheal deviation may be visible or palpable if the goiter is asymmetric. Rarely, dilated neck veins are present. All patients with obstructive symptoms caused by a cervical goiter alone have obvious thyroid enlargement, as do many patients with substernal goiter. The possibility of substantial substernal extension is suggested by the inability to identify the lower end of the thyroid gland. When the lower end cannot be identified with the patient sitting, it may be possible to do so if the patient lies down with a pillow under the shoulders to hyperextend the neck.</p><p>Pemberton's maneuver can be used to exacerbate obstructive symptoms by forcing the thyroid into the thoracic inlet  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79394" href="/z/d/graphic/79394.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). In this maneuver, the examiner holds the patient's arms vertically above the head for approximately 60 seconds. The test is considered positive if the patient's neck veins become more distended or if the patient develops facial plethora, cyanosis, or inability to swallow, or if dyspnea or stridor appear or worsen. Rarely, a cervical goiter becomes impacted in the thoracic inlet by this maneuver or by acute neck flexion or reaching; this is called the "thyroid cork" phenomenon [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p>Apparent bronchospasm may represent upper airway obstruction or bilateral vocal cord paralysis. Careful auscultation of the chest and airway in positions that minimize and maximize potential upper airway obstruction (described above) may suggest the need for further evaluation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H62289336"><span class="h2">Initial testing</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H62289413"><span class="h3">Thyroid function tests</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Serum TSH should be measured in all patients with goiter (discovered either by palpation or incidentally noted on a radiologic procedure)  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101377" href="/z/d/graphic/101377.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Patients with goiter may have normal thyroid function, hyperthyroidism (subclinical or overt), or hypothyroidism (subclinical or overt). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7847.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of hyperthyroidism"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7871.html" rel="external">"Disorders that cause hyperthyroidism"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7893.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of and screening for hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7886.html" rel="external">"Disorders that cause hypothyroidism"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>TSH below normal</strong> – If the TSH is below normal, serum free thyroxine (T4) and total triiodothyronine (T3) should also be measured.

In fact, because of the iodine content within the gland, contrast is never needed to image the thyroid. If imaging after administration of a radiocontrast agent is required to identify vascular structures, a patient with subclinical or overt hyperthyroidism should be pretreated with an antithyroid drug to prevent thyroidal organification of iodine.
