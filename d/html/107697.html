          —
         </span>
         For euthymic, postpartum patients who were successfully treated for major depression with antidepressants in the past, including women who discontinued successful maintenance pharmacotherapy for depression shortly before or during pregnancy, and are now at risk of developing major depression due to a prior history of depression, we suggest prophylaxis with the previously used antidepressants [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Women with a prior history of depression frequently prefer antidepressants for prevention of recurrences [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Although concerns have been raised about using antidepressants in women who are breastfeeding their infants, the general consensus is that the risks of a depressive episode outweigh the risks of infant exposure. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1704.html" rel="external">
          "Postpartum unipolar major depression: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis", section on 'Adverse consequences'

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         We generally resume the previous regimen in the third trimester (eg, two to four weeks prior to delivery), to ensure patients are at a therapeutic dose at time of delivery. Doses typically are titrated up as is done for initial treatment. Higher doses may be required in the third trimester to offset decreased maternal serum drug concentrations that can occur due to expanded plasma volume, hepatic enzyme induction, and increased drug clearance [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. However, a reasonable alternative is to resume antidepressants after delivery when postpartum patients are medically stable. Information about prescribing antidepressants during pregnancy is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/108004.html" rel="external">
          "Unipolar major depression in pregnant women: Prevention and general principles of treatment", section on 'Pharmacotherapy'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Some postpartum women who are at risk for recurrences of major depression may want to avoid pharmacotherapy. Reasonable alternatives to antidepressants include psychotherapy (eg, cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy), psychosocial interventions (eg, home visits), or close monitoring (eg, clinical interviews every one to four weeks, depending upon clinical urgency).

         For euthymic, postpartum patients who are at highest risk of developing postpartum major depression due to a prior history of depression (see
         <a class="local">
          'Indications'
         </a>
         above), and who have not been successfully treated with antidepressants in the past, we suggest prophylaxis with either cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy, depending upon availability. This approach is consistent with guidance from the US Preventive Services Task Force, which found that cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy can prevent perinatal depression [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. A reasonable alternative is a psychosocial intervention such as home visits by clinicians (eg, nurses) or telephone support by nonprofessionals.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, either pharmacotherapy or watchful waiting are reasonable alternatives. Pharmacotherapy is more widely available than cognitive-behavioral therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy. We generally initiate an antidepressant regimen in the third trimester (eg, two to four weeks prior to delivery).

         Randomized trials that excluded pregnant and lactating women have demonstrated that maintenance treatment with antidepressant drugs is efficacious in preventing unipolar major depression. (See

        <p>
         In addition, randomized trials in postpartum women indicate that nonpharmacologic interventions, such as psychotherapy (eg, cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT] or interpersonal psychotherapy) or psychosocial interventions (eg, home visits), can prevent postnatal unipolar depression. As an example:

         In a meta-analysis of 20 randomized trials (n &gt;14,000) that compared nonpharmacologic treatment (eg, psychotherapy or psychosocial interventions) with control conditions (eg, usual care), the risk of depressive symptoms was reduced in patients who received active treatment (relative risk 0.8, 95% CI 0.7-0.9) [

         Postpartum antidepressants are not a contraindication to breastfeeding and patients should not be discouraged from breastfeeding. Antidepressants are generally compatible with breastfeeding, and most studies demonstrate low or undetectable serum levels of medication in infants. Nevertheless, uncommon adverse effects may occur, and infants should be monitored for sedation, difficulty feeding, and/or difficulty sleeping. (See

         CBT is a time-limited psychotherapy that combines cognitive therapy and behavioral therapy. Cognitive therapy attempts to modify the dysfunctional thoughts and beliefs about oneself, the world, and the future (eg, “I’m no good”); behavioral therapy focuses upon modifying the patient’s problematic behavioral responses (eg, inactivity) to environmental stimuli or dysfunctional thoughts through techniques such as problem solving, stimulus control, and exposure with response prevention.

         Randomized trials indicate that CBT can prevent postpartum depressive episodes and that individual treatment is the preferred method of administration. As an example, a meta-analysis of 12 studies (primarily randomized trials, sample size not reported) compared CBT with a control condition; most of the studies administered the study treatments during pregnancy.

         Mindfulness based cognitive therapy is a group program that combines the clinical application of mindfulness meditation with elements of CBT. The treatment is generally used to delay or prevent recurrence of unipolar major depression, based upon randomized trials in the general population of patients with depression. (See

Active treatment, called Practical Resources for Effective Postpartum Parenting, consisted of four sessions with a psychologist during the third trimester and first six weeks postpartum, in which mothers learned to change the infant’s crying and fussing behavior. Usual care consisted of two sessions with a psychologist, during which symptoms of postpartum depression were discussed and patients received referrals for psychiatric care. Assessment at six weeks postpartum found that rating scale scores for depression and for anxiety were each lower in patients who received active treatment than usual care. However, assessments 10 weeks postpartum found that symptoms were comparable in the two groups.

         A subsequent study randomly assigned pregnant women between 16 and 20 weeks gestation (n = 639) to exercise or to no intervention [

         </a>
         ]. The exercise program consisted of supervised aerobic and resistance training for one hour, three times per week, for 16 weeks. Adherence to exercise was poor, and the rate of depressive episodes during the first three postpartum months was comparable in the exercise and control groups (6 and 9 percent of patients).

         Interventions to prevent postpartum unipolar major depression are indicated for women who are at increased risk of developing the disorder. Risk factors that have the largest effect and are most consistently associated with postpartum depression include a past history of either perinatal or nonperinatal depression and/or depression during the current pregnancy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Indications'
         </a>

         For postpartum patients who were successfully treated for major depression with antidepressants in the past, we suggest prophylaxis with antidepressants rather than no treatment (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). The antidepressant of choice depends upon patient's past response to antidepressants.

         We generally start the antidepressant in the third trimester, but it is reasonable to start the drug after delivery when postpartum patients are medically stable. Reasonable alternatives to pharmacotherapy include psychotherapy (eg, cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy), psychosocial interventions (eg, home visits), or watchful waiting (clinical interviews every one to four weeks). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Prior history of successful treatment with antidepressants'

         For patients who are at risk of developing postpartum major depression and have not been successfully treated with antidepressants in the past, we suggest prophylaxis with psychotherapy or psychosocial interventions, rather than no treatment (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">
          Grade 2B
         </a>
         ). We typically prefer cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, or mindfulness based cognitive therapy depending upon availability. However, either pharmacotherapy or watchful waiting are reasonable alternatives. (See
         <a class="local">
          'No history of successful antidepressant treatment'
