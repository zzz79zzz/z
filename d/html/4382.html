Cells in tissue, which previously received a photosensitizing chemical, die when exposed to a specific light wavelength. </p><p>Since the early 1900s, PDT has been used to treat cancers of the esophagus, stomach, bladder, skin, oropharynx, pleura, and biliary tree. The same principles of PDT can be applied using bronchoscopes to treat airway disease, primarily endobronchial non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).</p><p>The principles and procedure, as well as the indications, contraindications, expected adverse events, and complications of bronchoscopic PDT, are reviewed in this topic. Other bronchoscopic techniques used to manage airway disease and the use of PDT for the treatment of other types of cancers are described separately.

Photosensitized tissue is subsequently exposed to light (usually 48 hours later) (see <a class="local">'Bronchoscopic phototherapy'</a> below). The light induces a type II photo-oxidative intracellular reaction, in which molecular oxygen is transformed to singlet reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. The presence of excessive amounts of intracellular ROS results in cell death and, consequently, tissue necrosis.</p><p>Tumor cells and the neovascular endothelium of tumors preferentially retain the photosensitizer such that the cytotoxic reaction is somewhat selective for neoplastic cells [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Capillary damage and tumor necrosis begin within hours after illumination; however, the maximal clinical effect of tissue destruction takes a few days to be appreciated. This is key to understanding that PDT is a delayed effect therapy and debridement bronchoscopy needs to be scheduled within a couple of days after illumination/activation. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Light source</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A laser light source, typically administered via a flexible bronchoscope, with a specific wavelength (eg, optimal wavelength for photofrin is 630 nm) is required for photodynamic therapy (PDT) to be effective. Tissue is typically destroyed to a depth of approximately 5 to 10 mm [<a href="#rid4">4</a>] (see <a class="local">'Bronchoscopic phototherapy'</a> below). The most commonly used light source is the diode laser  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104815" href="/d/graphic/104815.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). Since these lasers emit non-thermal laser light, the effects of PDT are not immediate; however, the non-thermal property eliminates the risk of airway fire, an adverse effect that may occur with thermal techniques (eg, bronchoscopic laser, electrocautery, or argon plasma coagulation) if the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) is higher than 0.4. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4392.html" rel="external">"Bronchoscopic laser in the management of airway disease in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4396.html" rel="external">"Endobronchial electrocautery"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4405.html" rel="external">"Bronchoscopic argon plasma coagulation in the management of airway disease in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Dosimetry</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Total energy delivered depends upon the timing of illumination after injection of the photosensitizing agent and the energy delivered through the fiber:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Timing – According to the drug package insert, endoscopic introduction of the light source should be scheduled 40 to 50 hours after injection. In practice, most interventionalists generally schedule light application approximately 24 to 72 hours after injection (usually 48 hours). This allows for the sensitizer to concentrate in tumor cells and wash out of normal mucosa, thus minimizing damage to adjacent nonmalignant tissue. Treatment at shorter times will lead to indiscriminate damage because there is equal concentration of photosensitizing agent in tumor and normal tissues. The concentration is sufficient in the tumor for approximately five to seven days, thus making a second light application effective at the clean-up bronchoscopy (three days after first treatment and five days after injection). A second light application is only occasionally needed when there is residual viable endobronchial tumor that significantly narrows the airway lumen. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Energy – It is recommended initially to apply 200 Joules per cm treated (range 50 to 300 Joules). Higher amounts of energy may be administered for larger, bulky, obstructing lesions, while smaller amounts are usually administered for smaller or distal lesions. If a profound response is expected for tracheal and mainstem bronchial lesions, it is sometimes safer to use a lower energy to avoid sloughing of necrotic tissues, which can acutely worsen airway obstruction. Additional energy may be applied during a follow-up bronchoscopy two days later if needed after the clean-up (ie, debridement) bronchoscopy. Additional photosensitizer should not be administered any more than every six weeks to limit toxicity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although animal models suggest that t light dosing administered as a lower power delivered over a longer time achieved local tumor control [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], human studies are needed for this "slow and low” approach. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">While bronchoscopists sometime customize the laser settings based on the tumor’s location, length, vascular supply, and degree of airway obstruction, light dosimetry is not usually determined based on the thickness of the lesion. Dosimetry is impacted, however, by the length of the lesion, with fibers selected so that the entire length (vertical extent) of the lesion is being illuminated. The settings can be entered manually, but the laser software also automatically calculates the power and time based on the desired energy (Joules) and laser fiber length (cm). One commercial laser is used only for its illumination properties and not for thermal ablation, so it is not used for other purposes such as coagulation or ablation outside of its PDT application. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H103488341"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS AND EFFICACY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) therapy is typically a palliative or adjunctive therapy used to relieve non-life-threatening symptomatic airway obstruction (eg, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis) due to malignant or, less commonly, nonmalignant conditions that are not amenable to first-line therapies. It may also be used to treat patients with inoperable radiographic occult lung cancer (ROLC) or patients with stump recurrence following resective surgery. Ideal lesions are intraluminal and short (ie, &lt;1 to 1.5 cm) and with an endoluminal surface that is without significant necrotic debris; extrinsic lesions should <strong>not</strong> be treated with PDT.</p><p>The management of patients with central airway obstruction and the choice of modality used to treat this population, including locally ablative bronchoscopic techniques, are discussed separately  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef72854" href="/d/graphic/72854.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef64246" href="/d/graphic/64246.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4384.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of malignant central airway obstruction in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H80979126"><span class="h2">Airway obstruction</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H80979138"><span class="h3">Malignant</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H326785587"><span class="h4">Tumor or patient characteristics</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common indication for bronchoscopic PDT is symptomatic obstruction of a central airway due to an intrinsic tumor  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef55320" href="/d/graphic/55320.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). In general, PDT is a palliative therapy used in patients for whom other first-line treatment modalities are not feasible (eg, surgery). Occasionally, it is used adjunctively before salvage chemotherapy, radiation (eg, external beam radiation or brachytherapy), or surgical resection. For optimal effects, lung units distal to the obstruction should be functioning or "recruitable," and repeated therapies are sometimes required.</p><p>Selecting patients who have tumors likely to respond to PDT is critical. Similar to patients with lung cancer who present with mediastinal or parenchymal masses, patients with airway malignancy should undergo an identical staging process, during which computed tomography (CT), bronchoscopy, and endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-transbronchial needle aspiration are typically performed  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805" href="/d/graphic/109805.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). This process is important for several reasons (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4632.html" rel="external">"Overview of the initial evaluation, diagnosis, and staging of patients with suspected lung cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88822.html" rel="external">"Selection of modality for diagnosis and staging of patients with suspected non-small cell lung cancer"</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Assessing tumor extent</strong> – For most patients with intraluminal tumor, but in particular those with post-resectional stump recurrence and ROLC (ie, early lung cancer or carcinoma in situ) for which PDT is being considered (often with a curative intent), EBUS evaluation of tumor extent is particularly important. Assessment without EBUS may lead to underestimation of tumor invasion in the airway wall and may reduce the efficacy of PDT [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The identification of additional tumors, mediastinal, hilar or interlobar nodal involvement, or tumor beyond the airway wall may result in the avoidance of PDT and prompt alternate therapies (eg, radiotherapy). Commercially available EBUS scopes (outer diameters of 6.7 to 6.9 mm depending on the brand) can be advanced to the lobar bronchi but are usually larger than segmental airways. The balloon-based radial probe, however, can be advanced further but it is not widely commercially available. (See <a class="local">'Radiographic occult lung cancer'</a> below.). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Assessing tumor characteristics</strong> – For all patients with symptomatic airway obstruction from an intraluminal tumor, assessing the macroscopic tumor characteristics are easily performed prior to PDT with bronchoscopy and CT.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">When applied for curative intent in patients with early airway lung cancer, the ideal lesions are short, typically &lt;1 to 1.5 cm (ie, no longer than the length of the light diffuser). While there is no specific upper limit of the lesion’s thickness, for curative intent, PDT should be offered for lesions that do not extend beyond the airway cartilage as assessed on imaging [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. For palliative intent, lesions that are deep or shallow and lesions that are associated with complete or partial obstruction that is non-life-threatening can be treated with PDT. However, necrotic debris and blood interfere with light penetration such that mechanical debridement with a rigid bronchoscope, cryotherapy, or a variety of flexible bronchoscopic techniques prior to PDT is required in such cases. Although most cases of symptomatic airway obstruction are located centrally (ie, trachea and mainstem bronchi), lesions down to the second or third order of bronchi can be successfully treated with PDT, which is an advantage over bronchoscopic laser, where there is increased risk of airway and vessel perforation in lobar and segmental airways.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Long, extensive lesions of the airway (especially if they extend to segmental airways) cannot be effectively treated with PDT. Airway patency beyond the level of obstruction is usually necessary for PDT to be effective. Since PDT requires direct or close contact with the tumor for it to be effective, it cannot be used for lesions that cause external compression  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef104814" href="/d/graphic/104814.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). In addition, PDT should not be used for tumors associated with life-threatening obstruction (ie, critical tracheal or bilateral mainstem bronchial tumors), since its effect is not immediate and tumor sloughing following illumination may transiently worsen the degree of airway obstruction prior to debridement bronchoscopy. These and other contraindications are discussed separately. (See <a class="local">'Contraindications'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Although laser, electrocautery, and argon plasma coagulation are bronchoscopic ablative therapies that are immediate acting, PDT is longer lasting, may have a survival benefit when compared with neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd;YAG) laser [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>], and can be used following ablation to maintain local control of large, bulky tumors. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4396.html" rel="external">"Endobronchial electrocautery"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4403.html" rel="external">"Airway stents"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4402.html" rel="external">"Flexible bronchoscopy balloon dilation for nonmalignant airway strictures (bronchoplasty)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4408.html" rel="external">"Endobronchial brachytherapy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4384.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of malignant central airway obstruction in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4407.html" rel="external">"Bronchoscopic cryotechniques in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly squamous cell carcinoma, is the most common malignancy subjected to bronchoscopic PDT. However, case reports of successful management of other types of malignancy have been described, including small cell lung cancer and endobronchial metastases of nonpulmonary malignancies [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. Histologic type needs to be clarified prior to PDT as certain tumor types have a more profound response, which may result in excessive tumor sloughing (eg, small cell carcinoma). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H326785528"><span class="h4">Efficacy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In most patients (up to 80 percent), PDT can palliate the symptoms associated with central airway obstruction (ie, trachea and mainstem bronchi), as well as those associated with distal endobronchial obstruction (eg, down to the second or third order of bronchi)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104076" href="/d/graphic/104076.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid9">9,11-19</a>]. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In an analysis of patients with stage III and IV NSCLC and central airway obstruction, addition of PDT resulted in a similar mortality to patients treated with radiation and chemotherapy. However, addition of non-PDT ablation showed higher mortality compared with the radiation and chemotherapy group [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a more subsequent analysis, patients treated with PDT, radiation and chemotherapy had a lower mortality than patients treated with radiation alone, (50 and 53 percent lower, respectively) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In an observational study of 175 patients with endobronchial NSCLC, PDT resulted in palliation of symptoms (cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis) in most patients [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In another retrospective study of 133 patients with airway obstruction (mostly NSCLC), two-thirds of whom were inoperable, two or more PDT treatments resulted in improved airway patency (81 percent) and dyspnea (74 percent); median survival was 4.4 years [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Most cases of airway obstruction were located in the mainstem bronchi (&gt;50 percent); one case was located in the trachea, and the remainder were in the second and third order bronchi (eg, bronchus intermedius, orifice of the right middle or lower lobe).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a retrospective study of 100 patients with airway obstruction due to advanced inoperable bronchogenic cancer (mostly NSCLC), mean endoluminal obstruction decreased from 86 to 18 percent, and lung function improved as evidenced by an increase in mean forced vital capacity (increased by 430 mL) and forced expiratory volume in one second (increased by 280 mL) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Median survival was five months, and overall two-year survival was 1 percent.</p><p></p><p>Case reports also describe successful use of PDT as an adjunctive therapy (eg, PDT plus chemotherapy, sleeve lobectomy, bronchoscopic laser, or bronchoscopic brachytherapy) in the treatment of NSCLC [<a href="#rid21">21-26</a>]. Similarly, it has been used successfully for local control in patients with intractable endobronchial disease who have failed other therapies (eg, surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation) [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Whether ionizing radiation can activate <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9791" href="/d/drug information/9791.html" rel="external">porfimer</a> sodium (Photofrin) has not been studied. Therefore, it is recommended that two to four weeks be allowed after PDT before starting radiotherapy. Similarly, if PDT is to be given after radiotherapy, the acute inflammatory reaction from radiotherapy usually subsides within four weeks after completing radiotherapy, after which PDT may be given. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H326786697"><span class="h4">Comparison with other ablative procedures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although there are no high-quality studies comparing the use of PDT with other bronchoscopic ablative therapies, when used appropriately, they all appear to result in similar rates of airway patency and symptom palliation (hemoptysis, dyspnea, cough).

Diffusing fibers are mounted at the tip of a one-meter fiberoptic cable, which can be placed in the biopsy channel of most flexible bronchoscopes and is fitted with a connector for easy attachment to the light source. Standard diffusers are 1.07 mm (flexible diffuser) or 1.7 mm (rigid diffuser) in diameter with available lengths of 10, 15, 20, 25, and 50 mm. The 50 mm diffuser is not recommended for airway applications. Ideally, the diffuser length should roughly equal the tumor’s vertical extent. If the lesion is longer than the chosen diffuser, the light fiber is repositioned to the non-treated area, and an additional light application is administered until the entire tumor has been treated (typically estimated visually). Each treatment usually takes approximately eight minutes (to deliver a total of 200 Joules). The most commonly used design is a cylindrical diffuser, which emits light laterally in a 360-degree arc near its tip  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81291" href="/d/graphic/81291.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For bulky tumors, if possible, the rigid or flexible diffusers should be nearly completely embedded into the lesion since PDT works best by transillumination. This not only protects healthy mucosa from light exposure but also delivers more energy to the tumor itself. Inserting the tip is difficult to perform for lesions smaller than 0.5 cm as well as nonobstructing lesions. In such cases, the fiber should be as close to the lesion as possible to avoid light attenuation through air (ie, adjacent location) In addition, for hypervascular lesions, we prefer that the probe be adjacent to the target tissue rather than embedded in the lesion to avoid bleeding, which could interfere with light penetration into the tumoral tissue.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Once the diffuser is in place, light is applied at a typical initial energy of 200 Joules per cm (range is 50 to 300 Joules).

Some centers perform one PDT session only, while others routinely perform two sessions (eg, one initial session and a second at the time of follow-up bronchoscopy). However, in our experience, the number of sessions varies depending on the tumor size and tumor response. Follow-up bronchoscopy for secretion clearance is most frequently performed within two to four days after each illumination, during which time repeat illumination of the target lesion may be performed if additional response is needed  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54311 graphicRef57883 graphicRef68408" href="/d/graphic/54311.html" rel="external">picture 3A-C</a>). Repeat illumination for more profound effect should be carefully considered as the delayed effect of tissue necrosis of up to 6 mm could potentially damage the airway wall and adjacent vasculature.

Although of unproven value, many experts perform a clinical evaluation at six weeks to assess the symptomatic response, as well as chest radiography, lung function, and six-minute walk testing to assess the radiographic and physiologic response.</p><p>Many experts, however, admit patients for observation if PDT was applied for main airway involvement, especially in patients with poor performance status, those at high risk of developing a significant complication, or those who travel from afar who may not be able to access the facility quickly enough in the event of a complication. </p><p>The general follow-up of patients who undergo bronchoscopy or treatment for central airway obstruction (eg, follow up computed tomography [CT]) is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4384.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of malignant central airway obstruction in adults", section on 'Follow-up'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4398.html" rel="external">"Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Overview"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/105799.html" rel="external">"Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Preparation, procedural technique, and complications", section on 'Postprocedure monitoring'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H61453797"><span class="h2">Repeat bronchoscopy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A repeat bronchoscopy is performed in 48 to 72 hours following illumination/activation, when the inflammatory response is particularly prominent and the resulting secretions can cause airway compromise. At that time, all debris should be removed with a flexible bronchoscope, which is usually sufficient. Repeat illumination/activation may be performed at that time, particularly if a response is observed and it is assessed by the clinician that the patient may benefit from additional therapy (ie, significant residual airway obstruction postdebridement). (See <a class="local">'Bronchoscopic phototherapy'</a> above.)</p><p>Although not mandatory, many clinicians perform repeat bronchoscopy at six weeks to assess efficacy (eg, degree of airway patency). This is especially relevant these days in the era of immunotherapy as pseudo-progressive or hyper-progressive disease could result in early recurrent airway obstruction. Repeat PDT may be planned for the future, depending upon the observed response. Photosensitizing agent is administered no more than once every six weeks.</p><p>For patients with radiographically occult squamous cell carcinoma of the airway (ie, microinvasive carcinoma) who are treated with curative-intent photodynamic therapy, the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) recommends surveillance bronchoscopy at one, two, and three months and thereafter at three-month intervals during the first year, then every six months until five years [<a href="#rid48">48</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Photosensitivity precautions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For six weeks following the procedure, patients should use protective clothing and eyewear whenever exposed to <strong>sun</strong>light or sunbeds. Sunscreen does <strong>not </strong>provide effective protection, since it does not filter all visible wavelengths. Shaded light, light from most artificial light sources, and light from television do not generally pose problems. However, if it is predicted that the patient will be in strong artificial light for a prolonged period (eg, operating room or intensive care unit), covering their skin to avoid skin activation is prudent. Eye and dental exams should be avoided during the photosensitivity period. The protection against and treatment of phototoxicity are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6620.html" rel="external">"Overview of cutaneous photosensitivity: Photobiology, patient evaluation, and photoprotection", section on 'Photoprotection'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6622.html" rel="external">"Photosensitivity disorders (photodermatoses): Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment", section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1160967236"><span class="h1">FUTURE DIRECTIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Active research looks to expand the usefulness of photodynamic therapy (PDT). In 2012, experts called for an organized approach to the use of PDT among the institution members of the National Comprehensive Cancer Networks (NCCN) including a web-based PDT registry because it would be a critical tool for assembling data and linking institutions [<a href="#rid49">49</a>].</p><p>Areas for expansion of PDT being explored include the use of ancillary devices such as navigational bronchoscopy [<a href="#rid50">50</a>] and ultrasound guidance for interstitial treatment [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. Combination of photosensitizer and chemotherapeutic agents into nanoparticles is another line of investigation [<a href="#rid52">52</a>]. It is being combined with radiation therapy to take advantage of potential enhancement by ionizing radiation [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. Also, it is being evaluated as neoadjuvant treatment prior to definitive resection [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. While bronchoscopic PDT for peripheral lesions seems to be feasible and safe based on a few reports, the exact dosimetry and effectiveness of PDT for peripheral lung tumors remains to be determined in future studies. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bronchoscopic photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a non-thermal ablative technique that can be used to treat central airway disease in adults. A photosensitizing agent, which is administered systemically, is preferentially taken up by neoplastic tissue. Approximately 48 hours later, photosensitized tissue is exposed to light of a specific wavelength, which induces a cytotoxic reaction, resulting in cell death and tissue necrosis. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above and <a class="local">'Principles of photodynamic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bronchoscopic PDT is typically a palliative or adjunctive therapy used to relieve non-life-threatening symptomatic airway obstruction due to malignancy (usually non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC]) that is not amenable to first-line therapies. Less commonly, it may be used to treat hemoptysis due to airway lesions, inoperable nonmalignant conditions of the airway (eg, papillomatosis, granulation tissue), inoperable radiographic occult lung cancer (ROLC), and stump recurrence and residual mucosal disease following resective surgery. Ideal lesions for curative intent treatment are intraluminal and short with an endoluminal surface that is without significant necrotic debris. In most patients with obstructing carcinoma (up to 80 percent), PDT can palliate the symptoms associated with airway disease. (See <a class="local">'Indications and efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with extrinsic lesions or life-threatening airway symptoms should<strong> not</strong> be treated with PDT. In addition, PDT should be avoided in those at risk of adverse effects from bronchoscopy, sedation/anesthesia, or worsening respiratory failure from necrotic debris, as well as in those with known photosensitivity or lesions close to invading a major blood vessel. (See <a class="local">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>PDT should be performed by physicians trained in its use. Adequate anesthesia is mandatory in order to eliminate coughing and inadvertent repositioning of the light source during the procedure. The photosensitizing agent is injected intravenously (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9791" href="/d/drug information/9791.html" rel="external">porfimer</a> sodium 2 mg/kg of total body weight). Approximately 48 hours later, a light source, typically diode laser, is introduced via a flexible or rigid bronchoscope. The laser diffuser should preferentially be embedded into the lesion or placed as close to it as possible. Light is applied at a typical initial energy of 200 Joules per cm (range is 50 to 300 Joules) with no more than three or four treatments per lesion in one session. The probe is removed, secretions are suctioned, and the bronchoscope is removed. (See <a class="local">'Procedure'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Complications can be PDT specific or due to bronchoscopy and/or procedural sedation. They occur in 5 to 15 percent of patients, with photosensitivity as the most common reported PDT-specific adverse reaction. Other PDT-related complications include airway edema and secretions that can worsen respiratory failure, as well as hemoptysis and chest pain. (See <a class="local">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bronchoscopic PDT does not require any particular, immediate follow-up care in the absence of complications, other than that required routinely for bronchoscopy and incentive spirometry for secretion clearance. However, repeat bronchoscopy is generally required within two to three days for clearance of endobronchial debris, during which time repeat illumination is sometimes performed, if necessary. After six weeks, repeat PDT may be planned for the future (eg, six weeks or longer), depending upon the observed response. In the special case of curative-intent PDT for early airway squamous cell carcinoma, scheduled surveillance flexible bronchoscopy is recommended.
