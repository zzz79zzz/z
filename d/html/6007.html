There are unique challenges to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of HIV infection among adolescents. A comprehensive program for adolescents at risk for HIV infection must include efforts at preventing infection (such as outreach programs and access to pre- and postexposure prophylaxis), easily accessible testing, risk reduction counseling, and behavioral health services. Education and prevention efforts must take into account the developmental level of the patient, as well as social and psychological variables. Programs that have been successful are youth-friendly, peer-oriented, inclusive of all sexual and gender groups, and targeted toward specific high-risk behaviors, offering a range of services through multidisciplinary teams [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>Issues surrounding HIV infections vary widely between adolescents in resource-rich and resource-limited settings. This topic will review, principally within developed settings, the epidemiology of and risk factors for HIV infection among adolescents, strategies to provide services to adolescents, and age-specific recommendations for initiating treatment. Other aspects of pediatric and adolescent HIV infection are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5962.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology of pediatric HIV infection"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5963.html" rel="external">"Pediatric HIV infection: Classification, clinical manifestations, and outcome"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3724.html" rel="external">"The natural history and clinical features of HIV infection in adults and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H950902955"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In 2019, there were an estimated 1.7 million adolescents aged 10 to 19 living with HIV worldwide. The great majority of affected adolescents (88 percent) are in sub-Saharan Africa [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. In 2015, HIV-associated mortality was the eighth leading cause of adolescent death globally [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>In developed settings such as the United States, HIV infection rates vary by age, race, ethnicity, and geography  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77548" href="/d/graphic/77548.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55634" href="/d/graphic/55634.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). In the United States, youth aged 13 to 24 years accounted for an estimated 21 percent of all new HIV infections in 2018. The majority of adolescents and young adults with HIV acquired HIV through sexual activity. Young men who have sex with men accounted for 82 percent of new HIV infections in males in this age group. Black youth accounted for an estimated 52 percent of all new infections, followed by Hispanic/Latino (25 percent) and White (18 percent) youth [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Geographically, southern states are disproportionately affected by HIV. Southern states accounted for more than one-half of new HIV diagnoses in 2018, while making up only 38 percent of the national population. It is estimated that over 40 percent of youth with HIV in the United States do not yet know that they are infected [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>Although the vast majority of youth acquire their infections through sexual activity, there remains a small proportion who were infected perinatally. The survival of these children to adolescence and adulthood represents the success of antiretroviral therapy (ART), aggressive prophylaxis, and treatment of opportunistic infections [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. In the United States, by the end of 2015, approximately 1.1 million people of all ages were living with HIV, with an estimated 10,000 individuals being classified as having become infected perinatally. These patients are rarely diagnosed in adolescence, but they make up a sizable proportion of youth living with HIV in the United States. (See <a class="local">'Vertically infected adolescents'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H714627222"><span class="h1">RISK FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Biologic, behavioral, and socioeconomic factors that contribute to the risk of becoming infected with HIV among adolescents are the same as in adults and are generally similar to those of other sexually transmitted diseases. These issues are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/115.html" rel="external">"Sexually transmitted infections: Issues specific to adolescents", section on 'Risk factors'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16612.html" rel="external">"HIV infection: Risk factors and prevention strategies", section on 'Risk factors for infection'</a>.)</p><p>Factors that place adolescents at high risk of acquiring HIV infection (thus warranting annual HIV testing) are summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73710" href="/d/graphic/73710.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. Among youth living with HIV, the predominant mode of acquisition is high-risk sexual behaviors (ie, male-to-male sexual contact and heterosexual contact with a person known to have or to be at high risk for HIV infection)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76228" href="/d/graphic/76228.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p>Other important risk factors for unrecognized HIV infection in youth include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Inadequate sex education</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Socioeconomic challenges, including poverty</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Housing and food insecurity</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Incarceration</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lack of medical insurance or limited access to confidential sexual health services</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stigma and misperceptions about HIV and feelings of isolation, especially among gay, bisexual, or transgender adolescents</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of sexual trauma</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cognitive or behavioral health issues, including substance use</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2932770685"><span class="h1">COUNSELING AND TESTING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A comprehensive program for youth and adolescents at risk for HIV infection should include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Efforts at preventing infection (such as outreach programs, including proactive education and counseling about condoms, pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP], and postexposure prophylaxis). This is especially important in populations at high risk for acquiring HIV (men who have sex with men, transgender persons, and people who sell sex).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Easily accessible, confidential sexually transmitted infection (STI) and HIV testing and STI treatment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Counseling to support risk reduction.</p><p></p><p>At-risk adolescents may be among the least likely to seek testing or be engaged in routine preventive health care [<a href="#rid1">1,9</a>]. A report from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System estimated that &lt;10 percent of high school students in the United States were tested for HIV [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/115.html" rel="external">"Sexually transmitted infections: Issues specific to adolescents", section on 'Specific concerns in adolescents'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1788090970"><span class="h2">Routine screening</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We agree with the recommendations of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the United States Preventive Services Task Force that all individuals aged 13 to 64 years be routinely screened for HIV infection [<a href="#rid7">7,8,10</a>]. Screening is usually implemented through an "opt-out" strategy, in which the patient is informed, verbally or in writing, that HIV testing will be performed unless he or she declines. The Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine also supports offering HIV testing as part of routine care for sexually active adolescents [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that routine HIV screening be offered at least once to all adolescents (whether or not they report sexual activity) by 16 to 18 years [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. Adolescents at high risk  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73710" href="/d/graphic/73710.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) should be tested earlier and should have screening repeated annually.</p><p>HIV testing should be incorporated into routine adolescent health care maintenance performed by the primary care provider. In most countries, a separate written consent for HIV testing is not required and parental consent or disclosure is not necessary for testing adolescents who do not wish to involve their parents. Though pretest counseling is an important aspect of care, particularly in adolescents at high risk, it is not a requirement and should not preclude performing routine screening [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3736.html" rel="external">"Screening and diagnostic testing for HIV infection", section on 'Consent'</a>.)</p><p>Routine testing allows the identification of acute HIV infections and early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Acute infection is associated with higher viral loads and higher infectivity compared with chronic infection [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Initiating ART in the acute or early stage of infection will decrease onward infection. Early initiation of treatment is associated with improved clinical outcomes. In addition, it is important to subsequently notify partners and provide them with screening. This helps identify individuals who are at risk for acquiring HIV and provides them with ART PrEP. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/113426.html" rel="external">"HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H765201017"><span class="h2">Pretest considerations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The encounter for HIV testing serves as an opportunity to educate the teen and lay the groundwork for therapy, if indicated. The following issues should be considered:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Reason for testing</strong> – Many adolescents seek testing within 24 hours of risky behavior. In this setting, it is particularly important for the adolescent to understand the need to retest if this initial test is negative. Another common reason adolescents seek testing is that they have already been given a positive test result but are seeking confirmation. Detailed discussions surrounding the timing of HIV testing and confirmation testing are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3736.html" rel="external">"Screening and diagnostic testing for HIV infection", section on 'Tests'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/86984.html" rel="external">"Acute and early HIV infection: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Comorbidities and resources</strong> – Many adolescents with HIV have psychological comorbidities that have contributed to high-risk behaviors and will affect their ability to comply with complex treatment regimens [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Information regarding social and economic support systems will be essential to developing successful treatment and prevention plans. (See <a class="local">'Psychosocial evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Privacy</strong> – Under the laws in the United States, adolescents generally can seek testing and treatment of any sexually transmitted illness (including HIV) without the permission of their parents. However, since a positive HIV test will permanently alter a patient's life, we encourage patients to consider who they would rely on for support in the event that the test is positive. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/106.html" rel="external">"Confidentiality in adolescent health care", section on 'Sexually transmitted infections'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/105.html" rel="external">"Consent in adolescent health care", section on 'Sexually transmitted infections'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prevention</strong> – In advance of testing, all adolescents are encouraged to develop a personal protection plan that outlines the steps the patient will take to reduce risky behavior in the future. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/108.html" rel="external">"Guidelines for adolescent preventive services", section on 'Step 4: Solutions'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7595.html" rel="external">"Prevention of sexually transmitted infections", section on 'Prevention counseling'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fhiv%2Ftesting%2Findex.html&amp;token=R4Uiw8%2FbmPVaqNHRDqpXLMosnhXm5KefdI5%2FnL26MxCRtl7U7e%2BnVa1RRM90MqmNiES6Iadxz1X%2F%2BR84nDi8AA%3D%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=6007" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> provides guidelines for HIV counseling, testing, and referral [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2909023443"><span class="h2">Post-test counseling</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Results should be revealed in a secure, private setting. The adolescent should be given time to react to the news, whether good or bad. The meaning of the result should be explained again, emphasizing the need for and timing of retesting if there has been any recent high-risk behavior.</p><p>Adolescents whose tests are negative should be encouraged to follow their personal protection plan. Referral for additional services may be useful. Adolescents with a positive test should be reassured about their future, informed about the availability of treatment, and linked to age-appropriate HIV medical care for confirmatory testing and further evaluation. Active interventions that directly link patients to HIV care (eg, a referral supported with a case manager or patient navigator) are more effective than merely providing contact information for HIV treatment centers. Consultation with a local youth HIV program and behavioral health services prior to the medical visit may help ensure appropriate interventions and answers to patient questions at the time of the medical visit.</p><p>In addition, the patient often will need assistance with the complex issue of disclosure of HIV status to family or trusted adults and/or to partners. Disclosure to others is complicated by fear of rejection and isolation and also requires support from health care providers. In many states, anonymous partner notification is available through the public health system.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2366398277"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once linked to HIV care, the medical evaluation and diagnosis of HIV in adolescents are the same as in adults. This is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/86984.html" rel="external">"Acute and early HIV infection: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H877436999"><span class="h1">EVALUATION OF THE HIV-POSITIVE ADOLESCENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ideally, youth with HIV will have access to medical treatment in a youth-friendly center that emphasizes patient-centered multidisciplinary care to address both the medical and psychosocial needs of this vulnerable population. A multidisciplinary treatment team may include HIV-experienced clinicians, pharmacists, medical case managers, social workers, and mental health providers.</p><p>The initial evaluation begins with a thorough medical and psychosocial history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and immunizations.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H341522461"><span class="h2">Psychosocial evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of HIV infection may be traumatic to the newly diagnosed adolescent and their family. Often, the first task for the HIV clinical team is helping the patient (and family members, if aware and involved) cope with the psychosocial impact of the diagnosis. Completing the initial medical and psychosocial evaluations over several visits can help establish rapport with the patient, allow the patient and/or the family time to adjust to the diagnosis, and assist the treatment team's ability to gather more information about the patient's circumstances and support system.</p><p>Once the patient and family have accepted the diagnosis, patient education is more likely to be successful. Topics to discuss include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Basic information about HIV infection, transmission, treatment, and prognosis</strong> – Patients may have urgent questions about mortality, childbearing, and future outlook. These should be addressed in a reassuring and hopeful manner, expressing the new diagnosis as an opportunity to be and stay healthy. In addition, family members often have questions about the risk of transmission within the household.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Goals of therapy</strong> – Achieving and maintaining viral suppression, which will decrease HIV-associated complications and prevent transmission to others. It is helpful to provide a simple explanation of important measures of immune function and viral load.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The proposed antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen or regimen choices, including dosing schedule and potential side effects.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The importance of adherence to ART and the potential for the development of drug resistance as a consequence of suboptimal adherence.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Risk reduction and disclosure to sexual partners, especially with untreated patients who are still at high risk of HIV transmission.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4108053905"><span class="h2">Readiness to initiate antiretroviral therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A key factor to explore when considering initiating treatment is whether the patient is ready and able to adhere to HIV treatment. Readiness is the opinion held by both the patient and the medical team that the patient desires and is motivated to adhere to ART. It is also helpful to assess the patient's commitment to other aspects of HIV medical treatment, including office visits and laboratory tests.</p><p>There is no single objective measure for assessing readiness, nor does a patient's readiness always correlate with subsequent medication adherence [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. We find it helpful to start the conversation by simply asking patients if they want to start treatment for HIV infection. Having a good support system is an important part of readiness. This can include both family members and friends, even if the patient is not yet ready to disclose their infection status to these individuals. In addition, success in academic and/or vocational endeavors may signify self-efficacy skills that would facilitate disease management. Other important factors to consider include assessment of high-risk behaviors, substance abuse, mental illness, comorbidities, socioeconomic factors (eg, unstable housing, food insecurity, lack of privacy to store medication), medical insurance status and adequacy of coverage, transportation barriers, ability to regularly fill and pick up prescriptions, and other factors that might impair adherence to ART and increase the risk of HIV transmission. If concerns or barriers are identified, appropriate support should be offered.</p><p>For patients who feel ready to start treatment and are perceived to be ready by the care team, ART initiation may occur rapidly, even on the first visit. Others may be reluctant to engage in care, and this conversation may continue over several visits before initiating ART. During this time, the treatment team should try to identify and address important barriers.</p><p>Once the patient and health care team have agreed to initiate ART, the treatment plan should be developed in partnership with the patient. It is important to consider the patient's daily schedule (sleep, work/school, meals, and privacy); tolerance of pill number, size, and frequency; any issues affecting absorption (eg, use of acid-reducing therapy and food requirements); and potential interactions with other medications. With the patient's input, a medication choice and administration schedule should be tailored to his or her needs.</p><p>It is important to review the logistics of obtaining medications and refills in detail with the patient. Transportation to pharmacy and to clinic visits should be assessed with linkage to appropriate services as needed.
