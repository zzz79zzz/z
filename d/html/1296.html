         The term aseptic meningitis syndrome was initially described in 1925 by Wallgren as an acute community-acquired meningitis with a negative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Gram stain and culture, absence of a systemic illness or parameningeal focus, and a benign clinical outcome. The most common etiologies are viruses (enteroviruses, arboviruses, herpes simplex
         <em>
         </em>
         virus type 2) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. However, this term also includes more than 100 causes, such as other infections (mycobacteria, fungi, spirochetes), parameningeal infections, medications, and malignancies  (

         ) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. In many patients with aseptic meningitis, this diagnostic uncertainty has fostered hospital admissions and unnecessary cranial imaging and empirical antibiotic therapy.

         This topic will provide an overview of the diagnostic approach to patients who present with presumed aseptic meningitis, as well as a review of the most common etiologies. The approach to diagnosis and management of patients with suspected bacterial meningitis is presented elsewhere. (See

         In patients who present with suspected meningitis, the initial history provides important information that impacts diagnostic testing and empiric treatment. (See

          Features consistent with bacterial meningitis
         </strong>
         – Patients with bacterial meningitis are usually quite ill and often present soon after symptom onset. The classic triad of acute bacterial meningitis consists of fever, nuchal rigidity, and a change in mental status but is only present in 41 percent of patients [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Patients with aseptic meningitis often present with a few-day history of fever, headache, stiff neck, nausea, and photophobia. In contrast to bacterial meningitis, patients do not present with altered mental status and the onset may be less acute. A detailed discussion of the clinical features of bacterial meningitis are presented elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1287.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical features and diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis in adults", section on 'Clinical features'

          Features consistent with encephalitis
         </strong>
         – The presence or absence of normal brain function is the important distinguishing feature between encephalitis and aseptic meningitis.

         Patients with aseptic meningitis may be transiently lethargic but their cerebral function remains normal.

         </span>
         By contrast, patients with encephalitis commonly have altered mental status. A consensus statement of the international encephalitis consortium developed the following case definition for encephalitis: altered mental status for more than 24 hours without an alternative diagnosis (major criteria) with at least two (possible) or three or more (probable or confirmed) of the following six criteria: 1) fever &gt;38°C (100.4°F); 2) generalized or partial seizures not attributed to a pre-existing seizure disorder; 3) new onset focal neurologic findings; 4) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white blood cell (WBC) count &gt;5/microL; 5) new or acute neuroimaging abnormalities; and 6) abnormal electroencephalogram consistent with encephalitis [
         <a href="#rid4">

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         However, the distinction between the two entities can sometimes be blurred since some patients may have both a parenchymal and meningeal process with clinical features of both. The patient is usually labeled as having meningitis or encephalitis based upon which features predominate in the illness although meningoencephalitis is also a common term that recognizes the overlap.

         <strong>
          Travel and exposure history
         </strong>
         – A travel and exposure history can provide important clues. Clinicians should assess for exposures to mosquitoes (arboviruses), rodents (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [LCMV]), and ticks (
         <em>
          Borrelia burgdorferi
         </em>
         ), as well as travel to certain areas (tuberculosis, coccidioidal infection), sexual activity (herpes simplex virus [HSV]-2, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV],
         <em>
          Treponema pallidum
         </em>
         ), and contact with other individuals with similar symptoms or viral exanthems (enteroviruses). (See

         <strong>
          Season
         </strong>
         – Certain infections have a seasonal distribution. As an example, aseptic meningitis occurring during the summer or fall is most likely to be caused by enteroviruses (eg, Coxsackievirus, echovirus, other nonpoliovirus enteroviruses) or by human parechovirus [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Other infections that occur during this time frame include arboviral and Lyme meningitis. However, infections due to other pathogens (eg, herpes viruses) can occur at any time. (See

          Findings concerning for bacterial meningitis

         – It can be difficult to distinguish aseptic and bacterial meningitis on clinical exam alone. However, one distinguishing feature may be the presence of altered mental status and focal neurologic signs in patients with bacterial meningitis. In addition, although rash can be associated with many types of meningitis, the presence of petechiae and palpable purpura would be suggestive of meningococcal disease. (See

         When it is not clear whether the patient has a viral or bacterial process, the treating physician can choose empiric antibiotics for 48 hours while awaiting culture results.

         Aseptic meningitis occurring during the summer or fall is most likely to be caused by enteroviruses (eg, Coxsackievirus, echovirus, other nonpoliovirus enteroviruses) or by human parechovirus, the most common causes of viral meningitis [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. However, seasonal variation of certain central nervous system (CNS) viral infections is relative and not absolute. Enteroviruses continue to cause 6 to 10 percent of cases of viral meningitis in the winter and spring despite their predilection for inciting illness in the late summer and fall [

          17,18
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Enteroviral meningitis has a subacute presentation with a median duration of symptoms of three days before presentation. Signs and symptoms typically include headache, fever, nausea or vomiting, malaise, photophobia, and meningismus [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,20

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings are typical of other viral meningitides and include a white blood cell (WBC) count that is generally less than 250 cells/microL with a lymphocytic pleocytosis, a modest elevation in CSF protein concentration (generally less than 100 mg/dL) [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for enteroviruses should be done in patients presenting with aseptic meningitis to confirm the diagnosis, as this can decrease the economic burden on health systems by decreasing the use of unnecessary antimicrobial therapy, cranial imaging, and frequency/duration of hospital admissions [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,22,23
         </a>
         ]. CSF nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for enteroviruses yield sensitivities that range from 86 to 100 percent and specificities that range from 92 to 100 percent. NAAT testing is included in multiplex PCR tests that can be performed in one hour [

         Primary infection with HIV frequently presents as a mononucleosis-like syndrome, manifested by fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, rash, and pharyngitis. A subset of these patients will develop meningitis or meningoencephalitis, with headache, confusion, seizures, or cranial nerve palsies. (See

         In patients with acute HIV, the CSF profile characteristically has a lymphocytic pleocytosis, an elevated protein concentration, and a normal glucose concentration  (

         Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is a human zoonosis caused by a rodent-borne arenavirus. LCMV is excreted in the urine and feces of rodents, including mice, rats, and hamsters, and is transmitted to humans by exposure to secretions or excretions (by direct contact or aerosol) of infected animals or contaminated environmental surfaces [
         <a href="#rid9">

        </p>
        <p>
         Affected patients generally present with an influenza-like systemic illness accompanied by headache and meningismus. Although LCMV is rarely documented as a cause of aseptic meningitis, a seroprevalence of 5 percent was documented in a study of 400 patients with neurologic infections in Finland [

Clinically, Lyme disease is largely indistinguishable from viral meningitis, with headache, fever (which is usually mild), photosensitivity, and neck stiffness. In one study, children were unlikely to have Lyme meningitis if all of the following were absent: ≥7 days of headache, any cranial neuritis, or ≥70 percent CSF mononuclear cells [

         is endemic in desert regions of the southwestern United States and Central and South America. This infection has protean manifestations, and primary infection is frequently unrecognized. Meningitis is the most lethal complication of coccidioidomycosis and is therefore crucial to recognize.
        </p>
        <p>
         Symptoms of meningitis, including persistent and severe headache, usually develop within several months of the initial infection. Abnormal neurologic findings on physical examination are frequently absent early in the course of coccidioidal meningitis.
        </p>
        <p>
         The CSF WBC counts range from one to several hundred cells. A significant number of eosinophils may be present, but this finding is not specific for coccidioidal meningitis. The CSF glucose concentration may be depressed and is occasionally profoundly low in association with an elevation of the CSF protein concentration.
        </p>
        <p>
         A definitive diagnosis of coccidioidal meningitis is supported by isolating
         <em>
          Coccidioides
         </em>
         species from CSF or other CNS specimens; however, most cases are presumptively diagnosed by identifying anticoccidioidal antibodies in the CSF and/or a CSF coccidioidal antigen. For most patients with coccidioidal meningitis,

         Patients with tuberculous (TB) meningitis typically present with a subacute to chronic presentation, with protracted headache, vomiting, confusion, and varying degrees of cranial nerve signs with basilar involvement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. Mental status changes can occur, leading to coma, seizures, and, at times, hemiparesis. Although signs of disseminated TB are of diagnostic importance, they are often absent. The Lancet consensus criteria can be useful to differentiate TB meningitis from bacterial meningitis but is not able to differentiate it from other types of chronic meningitis, such as neurobrucellosis or fungal meningitis [

         Several neoplasms involve the leptomeninges. Hematologic malignancies have a particular propensity to seed the central nervous system (CNS), especially large cell lymphomas and acute leukemias. Solid tumors frequently causing carcinomatous meningitis include breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, gastrointestinal malignancies, and cancers of unknown primary origin. (See

         The CSF profile may include an elevated protein concentration and a lymphocytic pleocytosis; a very high protein concentration suggests a CSF block. There may be a low glucose concentration, sometimes close to zero. CSF eosinophilia can be seen in Hodgkin lymphoma.

         Mollaret meningitis is a form of recurrent benign lymphocytic meningitis (RBLM), an uncommon illness characterized by greater than three episodes of fever and meningismus lasting two to five days, followed by spontaneous resolution [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22,40
         </a>
         ]. There is large patient-to-patient variation in the time course to recurrence, which can vary from weeks to years. One-half of patients can also exhibit transient neurological manifestations, including seizures, hallucinations, diplopia, cranial nerve palsies, or altered consciousness.
        </p>
        <p>
         The most common etiologic agent of Mollaret meningitis is herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2; some patients may have evidence of genital lesions at the time of presentation [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. HSV-1 and Epstein Barr virus can rarely be the cause of RBLM [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. The management of HSV meningitis is discussed above. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Herpes virus meningitis'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with recurrent meningitis due to HSV-2, the use of suppressive therapy should be determined on a case-by-case basis. Although suppressive therapy can lead to a decrease in genital outbreaks and possibly recurrent meningitis outbreaks, available data does not support the use of suppressive antiviral therapy for preventing recurrent meningitis [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Only one small, randomized trial has evaluated whether suppressive therapy with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10034" href="/z/d/drug information/10034.html" rel="external">
          valacyclovir
         </a>
         (500 mg twice daily for one year) was more effective than placebo in preventing recurrent HSV-2-related recurrent meningitis [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. Study participants had been diagnosed with acute meningitis related to primary HSV-2 infection or had a history of recurrent meningitis in the past. During the first year of follow-up, suppressive valacyclovir did not have an effect on the number of episodes of meningitis, although genital HSV-2 recurrences were lower in the treatment arm. However, during the second year, when patients were without study drug, the risk of recurrence of verified and probable HSV-2 meningitis was higher among patients who had been exposed to valacyclovir (hazard ratio, 3.29: 95% CI, 10.06-10.21). This trial was limited by several factors, including inclusion of patients without a clear etiologic diagnosis at study entry, use of symptoms alone for the diagnosis of recurrent meningitis, and small sample size.
        </p>
        <p>
         Noninfectious etiologies for Mollaret meningitis have also been proposed. As an example, patients with an intracranial epidermoid cyst or other cystic abnormalities in the brain can develop meningeal irritation due to intermittent leakage of irritating squamous material into the CSF [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ]. This may be detected by polarizing microscopy of CSF. Imaging studies should be performed subsequently when the patient is asymptomatic, since the epidermoid cyst is often collapsed immediately after leaking its contents. (See

         Chronic meningitis is defined as meningitis lasting for four weeks or more and is a complex entity with both infectious and noninfectious causes  (

          Definition and etiologies
         </strong>
         – The term aseptic meningitis typically describes an acute community-acquired meningitis with a negative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Gram stain and culture. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The most common etiologies are viruses. However, this term also includes more than 100 causes, such as other infections (mycobacteria, fungi, spirochetes), parameningeal infections, medications, and malignancies  (

          Initial evaluation
         </strong>
         – The initial evaluation of a patient with presumed meningitis includes a careful clinical evaluation as well as specific diagnostic testing. This evaluation informs the use of empiric antimicrobial therapy.

         <strong>
          Clinical evaluation
         </strong>
         – Clinicians should evaluate patients for features consistent with bacterial meningitis or encephalitis, as well as historical clues or physical exam findings that may support a specific etiology. This includes the presence of underlying conditions, especially those that may result in some degree of immune compromise. (See

         <strong>
          Diagnostic testing
         </strong>
         – For patients with suspected meningitis, blood cultures should be obtained, and a lumbar puncture (LP) should be promptly performed. The decision to perform imaging (eg, CT scan) prior to LP is discussed elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1287.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical features and diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis in adults", section on 'Indications for CT scan before LP'

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         CSF should be sent for cell count, glucose, protein, and bacterial culture. In addition, when aseptic meningitis is being considered, molecular tests for the most common etiologies (eg, enterovirus, herpes viruses) should be performed. (See
         <a class="local">

          Role of empiric therapy
         </strong>
         – The decision to administer empiric antimicrobial therapy in a patient with possible aseptic meningitis depends primarily upon the concern for bacterial meningitis, which is based on the history, physical examination, and CSF findings  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76324" href="/z/d/graphic/76324.html" rel="external">
          table 3

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         When it is not clear whether the patient has a viral or bacterial process, the treating physician can choose empiric antibiotics for 48 hours while awaiting culture results  (
