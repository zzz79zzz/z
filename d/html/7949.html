        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Although viral testing may lead to donor notification about a potential risk, donation centers emphasize that blood donation should not be used as a means of obtaining this testing, as that may place the recipient at increased risk. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Other incentives'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Over time, organizations such as the Association for the Advancement of Blood &amp; Biotherapies (AABB), the US Food and Drug administration, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), continue to assess infectious and other risks and make recommendations to blood collection establishments and/or establish requirements regarding screening and deferral criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
         When it is first suspected that an infectious agent may be transmitted by transfusion, the initial response is to develop donor deferral policies using epidemiologic data. After this initial step, subsequent review often leads to the nationwide implementation of a particular donor screening procedure following recommendations of these agencies [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In the past, when such procedures were implemented, they tended to become permanent, even if their efficacy could not be established. However, certain requirements have subsequently been modified, either in response to acquiring additional epidemiologic data or for extraordinary circumstances such as during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9-12
         </a>
         ]. Zika virus testing is an example in which testing was implemented when there was concern about infections among donors that were acquired during travel, and for which testing was removed when this risk became negligible. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7950.html" rel="external">

         One of the major motivations for donation is altruism, based on a sense of societal responsibility and/or personal awareness of the benefits of donation [

         Data collected in the United States from the 1970s showed higher rates of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity in paid donors, higher rates of hepatitis in recipients of paid versus volunteer donor blood, and a substantial decrease in cases of post-transfusion hepatitis in transfusion recipients following elimination of financial incentives for blood donation [
         <a href="#rid16">

         </span>
         In 1978, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) instituted regulations that required the labeling of a blood unit as either from a volunteer or a paid donor, and several states passed legislation prohibiting the use of blood donated in exchange for payment [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. The result has been the almost total elimination of paid donors from the whole blood collection system in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Since the late 1970s, almost all blood components in the United States (whole blood, red blood cells [RBCs], platelets, and plasma for transfusion) come from volunteer donors [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]; an exception has been a small number of platelet apheresis units [
         <a href="#rid21">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Distinct from blood donation is plasma donation for the production of plasma derivatives. Donors of this type of plasma donation are frequently paid in some countries including the United States, although not in others. Safety is maintained in manufactured plasma derivatives such as albumin,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16471" href="/z/d/drug information/16471.html" rel="external">
          immune globulin
         </a>
         , and clotting factors because they undergo multiple processing steps that inactivate infectious organisms (these include cold ethanol purification, affinity chromatography, nanofiltration, solvent/detergent treatment, pasteurization). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7925.html" rel="external">
          "Plasma derivatives and recombinant DNA-produced coagulation factors", section on 'Purification methods'

        </p>
        <p>
         In Europe, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) provides oversight for plasma-derived products. Both the EMA and the World Health Organization recommend that two distinct steps with different mechanisms be used to inactivate viruses in plasma derivatives or a manufacturing process be used that reliably inactivates enveloped and non-enveloped viruses [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22

         </span>
         In addition to relying on donor altruism, some blood collection agencies also use incentives other than the direct payment of cash; these include compensation for time missed from work, gifts, monetary credit, and free laboratory screenings for analytes of potential health significance [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23,24
         </a>
         ]. Research into the effectiveness of incentives shows differing results as summarized in a systematic review of this subject [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Although there has been concern that incentives may have an adverse influence on blood safety, several reports suggest that well-selected incentives given to first-time or repeat donors do not have an adverse effect on blood safety, as monitored by donor infectious disease testing results [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23,26-29
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Potential donors should be advised that donation should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be used as a means of obtaining testing for HIV or other infectious diseases, which was a motivation for some donors in the 1980s during the early days of the HIV epidemic [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30-33
         </a>
         ]. Some centers have adopted additional approaches such as specifically asking donors if they are donating to get an HIV test or offering free HIV testing to people who desire it without requiring that a blood donation be made.

         The major procedure for screening donors at the donation site is the medical history interview, which includes questions about potential infectious risks and donor characteristics that might increase the risk of transfusion reactions.

          Infectious diseases
         </strong>
         – Risk of infections is assessed by questions about risk factors for HIV, history of infections, travel history, and vaccinations. For some disorders including variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) and malaria, non-laboratory donor screening procedures are the only method available for increasing transfusion safety [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34-37
         </a>
         ]. For other infections for which laboratory screening tests are available such as HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV), the medical history may reveal infections that are in the window period that precedes development of a positive laboratory test. (See

          TRALI
         </strong>
         – Individuals with a previous history of their donations causing transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) are deferred from apheresis platelet and plasma donations; some blood collection centers defer them from all donations. The risk of TRALI from different blood components and the mitigation strategies used for each component are presented separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7926.html" rel="external">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         While there are distinct advantages to eliminating donors with possible risks of disease transmission, there are also negative consequences of this approach [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. Donor deferral criteria often have poor specificity, and as a result, a large number of donors will be deferred who could have safely donated [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. This is especially concerning when the blood supply is limited, such as during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, when there have been concerns that donations would be reduced and the blood supply would be insufficient. The FDA altered some donor eligibility and deferral criteria during the pandemic to increase the donor pool. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7950.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         There is no available algorithm to decide if a given procedure or screening question should be implemented. Such decisions must attempt to balance the extent of disease transmission, the severity of the consequences to the recipient, the expected sensitivity (effectiveness) of the procedure, and the number of donors lost by implementation of the procedure.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although cost-effectiveness analyses of some donor interventions have been performed, there has not been any consensus on how to use these analyses to guide decision-making [

         Another tool related to donor deferral is the use of a computerized registry of deferred donors; this allows identification of donors from whom blood (or blood components) should not be collected or used for transfusions [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. Such deferral registries are composed of data obtained during a successful or unsuccessful prior donation attempt that resulted in a donor being permanently or indefinitely deferred, for reasons such as those noted above. When such registries are used prior to donation, they can ensure that blood from such high-risk donors is not collected.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is no single national blood service in the United States. Instead, blood collection is conducted by many organizations, including the American Red Cross, America's Blood Centers, OneBlood, New York Blood Center, Versiti, Vitalant, and others. These organizations have multiple locations widely distributed across the country, and registry information present in one organization's database may not be available to other blood collection organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pre-donation deferral avoids the costs and burdens of phlebotomy and reduces the risk that a unit from a deferred donor might be transfused to a recipient. If a unit is collected from a deferred donor and this information is not discovered until post-donation (see
         <a class="local">
          'Post-donation screening'
         </a>
         below), the unit is retrieved, quarantined, and destroyed.

         </span>
         The primary post-donation procedure for enhancing recipient safety is laboratory testing of the donated unit for multiple infectious disease markers. These are listed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7946.html" rel="external">
          "Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         A second safety procedure is the telephone callback. At the time of blood donation, donors receive instructions that they may call the blood center sometime after the donation to report additional pertinent medical history information. Telephone callbacks fall into two prominent categories:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Donors may call back to report the development of an acute illness, such as fever, upper respiratory tract infection, or a gastrointestinal disorder, occurring up to several days post-donation.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Donors may call back to indicate risk factors for HIV or other infectious diseases that might not have been disclosed at the time of donation.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Blood centers are required to have established policies for managing post-donation telephone callback information. In general, if post-donation information would have caused the donor to be deferred, blood centers will quarantine and destroy any components that have not yet been shipped and will transmit pertinent information to the hospital transfusion services that have received components from the donation. The transfusion service will retrieve any components that are still in their inventory and either return them to the blood center or destroy them. If the unit has already been transfused, information is conveyed to the patient's clinicians who will then determine (often in consultation with the blood center's medical director) if recipient notification and testing is required. Post-donation information that affects the eligibility evaluation of the donor must be reported by licensed blood establishments to the FDA.

         Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a genetic condition caused by homozygosity for the C282Y variant in the
         <em>
          HFE
         </em>
         gene that can lead to increased iron absorption. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Not all C282Y homozygotes develop iron overload; those who do require therapeutic phlebotomy to remove iron and reduce the risk of organ damage from excess iron. Red blood cells from individuals with HH are normal, and many of these individuals wish to donate blood removed by phlebotomy rather than have it be discarded. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7136.html" rel="external">
          "Management and prognosis of hereditary hemochromatosis"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Blood centers in the United States can make individual decisions about whether to accept donations from persons with HH; if they choose to accept such donations, they must adhere to the following regulatory requirements:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The donor with HH must meet all qualification criteria for donating blood (with the exception of the eight-week inter-donation interval).

        <p>
        </p>

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         A clinician must provide an order for therapeutic phlebotomy for HH.

         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         The blood center making the collection must perform therapeutic phlebotomies for any patient with HH at no charge, regardless of whether they meet all blood donor qualification criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         These requirements are intended to remove any monetary incentive for a patient with HH to be a blood donor. If these criteria are met, the collected unit of blood does not require special labeling. If therapeutic phlebotomy is required more frequently than an eight-week interval (the minimum inter-donation interval for allogeneic blood donors), such donated units also may be used for transfusion provided all other criteria are met.
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence regarding the safety of blood donated from individuals with HH includes the following:

         A systematic review from 2012 evaluated the relative safety of blood from donors with HH and found no evidence to suggest that their blood would present a greater risk to recipients than blood from the general population [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45

         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Thus, deferral criteria for the protection of the donor are based upon establishing that the donor is not likely to have an increased risk of an immediate post-donation reaction, a post-donation reaction that is especially severe or prolonged, or cardiovascular factors that do not permit adequate hemodynamic compensation. Donors are asked questions about their overall state of health and cardiac and pulmonary conditions, which is intended to reduce the likelihood of complications such as myocardial ischemia or syncope related to donation.

         Since 2009, rather than rely solely on the donor's weight, the American Red Cross and some other regional blood centers have implemented a selection criterion for 16 to 18 year old donors. EBV is calculated based on the donor's sex and self-reported height and weight. Donors are determined to be ineligible if their EBV is &lt;3500 mL [

         Injuries related to the needlestick are very rare and generally resolve. To determine the frequency of these rare reactions, data from 22 million donations from six countries over a three-year period (2015 to 2017) were pooled and analyzed [

          Risk factors
         </strong>
         – Contributing factors include psychologic distress (ie, fear of needles, pain, and/or the sight of blood), volume removal of 450 to 500 mL of whole blood, and an orthostatic blood pressure effect superimposed on a post-donation hypovolemic state. In practice, it is difficult to distinguish between the two mechanisms (vasovagal versus hypovolemic versus a combination of both) [
         <a href="#rid82">
          82

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The risk of hypovolemic reactions is greater in individuals with lower total blood volumes, and the risk of vasovagal reactions is greater in individuals who are younger, have lower body weight, and are first-time donors. Small studies focusing on high school student donors have confirmed a higher risk of reactions in this age group [

         <strong>
          Timing
         </strong>
         – Most vasovagal and hypovolemic reactions occur immediately after donation or at the refreshment table. Thus, it seems prudent to make sure the donor sits up and stands up slowly, make sure they feel well before walking to the refreshments table, and encourage them to stay at the table for 10 to 15 minutes for observation and fluid replenishment.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In a study involving 194,000 donations, there were 178 such reactions that led to a syncopal episode (incidence of 0.09 percent) [
         <a href="#rid70">
          70
         </a>
         ]. Of these, most occurred in the donation center before, during, or after donation (mostly in the refreshment area); only 19 occurred off-site. Five individuals hit their head and were seen in the emergency department; none were admitted to the hospital. It is these rarer delayed reactions that occur after the donor has left the donation site that have the potential to lead to more severe injury.

          Prevention

         Hemoglobin levels will be gradually restored over the following weeks, with a shorter interval in persons with adequate iron stores and in those who are taking oral iron supplementation. The replenishment of iron stores is a slower process (measured in months) than is the increase in hemoglobin, especially in individuals whose pre-donation iron stores are low. Oral iron supplementation enhances the rate of iron store repletion [

         The donor's hemoglobin concentration is estimated prior to donation using a fingerstick blood sample. Donors are deferred for preexisting anemia; the acceptable minimal hemoglobin level for blood donation in the United States is 12.5 g/dL for females and 13.0 g/dL for males, as mandated by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7

         Blood centers have varying policies for recommending whether donors with anemia should seek medical attention.

          Iron supplements
         </strong>
         – Use of low-dose oral iron supplements has been explored as a means of mitigating iron deficiency in blood donors; this will enhance the ability of some donors to make frequent donations. There is controversy regarding whether iron deficiency in the absence of anemia is associated with significant symptoms in a healthy blood donor population [
         <a href="#rid93">
          93,94
         </a>
         ]. Because of the lack of data collected specifically in blood donor populations, the use of oral iron supplements as a source of post-donation iron replacement is not standard practice in most countries, including the United States [

Some blood centers recommend that certain groups of donors such as premenopausal females or frequent repeat donors consider taking oral iron supplements to restore their pre-donation iron levels. Donors with concerns or those who experience side effects from oral iron can elect not to take the supplements.

          Monitoring iron stores

         ]. However, in the United States, there are no point-of-care ferritin tests that can be used at the donation site. Although routine monitoring of iron stores in all donors is not performed, many United States blood centers obtain a post-donation ferritin test for specific subpopulations of donors such as repeat donors or teenage donors (ages 16 or 17 to 18 or 19). Teenage donors with a low serum ferritin are subsequently deferred for 6 to 12 months [

         In contrast to standard whole blood donation, apheresis donation is performed as a way to collect platelets or plasma without removing red blood cells (RBCs). Two intravenous catheters are connected to an apheresis machine that collects plasma or platelets and returns the remaining blood to the patient. Apheresis donations allow significantly more plasma or platelets to be collected from a single donor, and the procedure can be performed more frequently than whole blood donation.

         Apheresis platelet donation can remove 3 to 4 billion platelets, which in a single donation will not make the donor thrombocytopenic but carries a theoretical risk of thrombocytopenia over the long term [

         There are accumulating data that lymphopenia may occur in frequent platelet apheresis donors (donation frequency 20 to 24 plateletpheresis sessions in a 365-day period). A cross-sectional study observed of donors with this donation frequency found lower CD4-positive lymphocyte counts (&lt;200 cells/microL) in 6 of 20 (30 percent) [

         A commentary synthesizing the data from these studies concluded that it is increasingly confirmed that very frequent or prolonged donation on the Trima platform likely does result in lower baseline lymphocyte counts, in at least some proportion of donors [

          Indications and uses of directed donations

         </span>
         Prior to 1983, recipient-specific donations were considered medically indicated in a limited number of situations such as kidney transplantation or platelet transfusions for individuals with refractoriness to transfusion or infants with isoimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia.
        </p>
        <p>
         During the height of the AIDS epidemic, directed donations increased dramatically in direct response to concerns about blood safety. Subsequently, directed donations have declined to &lt;1 percent of whole blood donations; one report cited 0.12 percent of donations in 2010, and an updated report cited 0.15 percent in 2017 [
         <a href="#rid123">
          123,124
         </a>
         ]. While any blood component (red blood cells, plasma, cryoprecipitate, platelets, or granulocytes) can be directed towards a particular patient, the vast majority of directed donations are for red blood cells (RBCs).
        </p>
        <p>
         Because directed donation requires that the donation be routed to a specific designated recipient, the logistics and scheduling of collections for designated donations is more difficult than for general allogeneic donations. Allogenic blood transfusions are one of the most common and also safest hospital procedures. Thus, many hospitals strongly discourage directed donation.
        </p>
        <p>
         A potential use of directed donations is for a family member to donate when the patient has an alloantibody to a high-frequency red cell or platelet antigen; a family member would have a higher chance of being negative for the antigen than would the general donor population.
        </p>
        <p>
         In some cases a directed (designated) donor is used as a means of reducing recipient exposure to certain antigens present on RBCs or platelets [
         <a href="#rid125">
          125
         </a>
         ] by providing repeated donations of specific components for a single recipient, thereby reducing or obviating the need for that patient to receive components from multiple donors. This latter use of directed donations was more prominent in the 1980s and 1990s than in the 2000s.
        </p>
        <p>
         Each institution offering directed donations should be able to perform RBC typing of potential directed donors to determine if the blood is compatible with the recipient. The recipient's clinicians should be responsible for requesting directed donations and should be kept informed as to the status of all blood collected. Community blood centers may not provide directed donation capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
         For standard allogenic donations, recipients cannot specify any donor characteristics (age, sex, skin color, medical conditions, or vaccination status) [
         <a href="#rid50">

         A discussion of autologous donation is presented separately. (See

         The directed donor and intended recipient should be informed about the details of the directed donor program including considerations of confidentiality and potential risks and benefits. Informed consent should be obtained, preferably from both donor and recipient. In addition to being informed about infectious disease screening, directed donors should also be aware that blood not used by the intended recipient may be made available to others. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Infectious diseases (comparable to standard allogeneic blood)'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Directed donors must meet all the criteria for protection of the recipient that are used for community volunteer donors. They must undergo the same medical history screening, and they must be aware that their blood will be subjected to the same infectious disease tests used to screen volunteer blood. With exceedingly rare exceptions (perhaps when a parent is donating for their child and has a nonsignificant viral marker such as anti-HBc), directed donor blood that has a positive infectious diseases screening test is discarded. Directed donors are also accorded the same patient confidentiality protections as any patient; thus, if screening reveals an infectious or other risk, the recipient will not be notified. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7950.html" rel="external">
          "Blood donor screening: Medical history"

        </p>
        <p>
         The aggregate data suggest that blood from directed donors is neither safer nor measurably less safe than blood from volunteer donors in the community, and the thorough screening of the donor and donated blood allows blood not used by the intended recipient to be made available for others. Crossover of directed donor blood is common practice, although some collection facilities and hospital transfusion services discard unused directed donor blood. This differs from autologous blood donations, which generally are not released to other recipients. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7930.html" rel="external">
          "Surgical blood conservation: Preoperative autologous blood donation", section on 'Crossover (release to other recipients) is no longer used'

         The rate of positive infectious disease screening tests (and hence the risk of infectious disease transmission) with directed donations is considered comparable to the general allogeneic pool when adjusted for the greater percentage of first time or parental donors in the directed donor population.

         <a href="#rid123">
          123

         ]. Directed donors were more likely to be making a first-time (rather than repeat) donation and to be older than volunteer donors. By multivariable regression analysis, the likelihood of positive testing was only slightly but not statistically significantly greater in directed donors for HIV (odds ratio [OR] 1.1; 95% CI 0.41-3.0), HBV (OR 1.1; 95% CI 0.7-1.7), and HTLV (OR 1.7; 95% CI 0.9-3.3).

For community donors, screening was positive in 3 percent of first-time donors and 0.5 percent of repeat donors. The authors concluded that first-time parental blood donation should be discouraged.

         It is prudent to avoid blood from an individual for a partner who may become pregnant. This is because the donor's red blood cells (RBCs) may contain antigens to which the recipient has not been exposed but which may be present on RBCs of a future fetus. As an example, if a female who is Kell (K)-negative receives a transfusion from a partner who is K-positive, she may develop alloantibodies to K; if she then conceives a child with the K-positive individual and the fetus also expresses K, her alloantibodies can cross the placenta and cause severe immune-mediated hemolytic anemia in the fetus.

         Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (ta-GVHD) is a life-threatening complication of transfusion in which donor leukocytes recognize the recipient as foreign and mount an immune response that destroys the recipient's bone marrow and attacks other recipient tissues (skin, gastrointestinal tract); it is usually fatal. There is essentially no effective treatment except immediate hematopoietic stem cell transplant. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7928.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Fully immunocompetent individuals can develop ta-GVHD. Risk factors include partial human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching, which is especially common with related donors. Any transfusion from a related donor must be irradiated to prevent ta-GVHD. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5935.html" rel="external">

         As with allogeneic donors, directed donors should be restricted to donation schedules that meet US Food and Drug Administration and Association for the Advancement of Blood &amp; Biotherapies (AABB) standards for safety to the donor. Compressed schedules, appropriate for autologous donors, are generally not applicable to directed donors. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Donation frequency'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         One potential exception occurs when, in the opinion of the medical director, a component of truly enhanced safety can be provided by the directed donor (as with parent to infant or HLA-matched sibling to sibling). With repeated transfusion from a parent to an infant, for example, small quantities of relatively fresh blood are required at stable intervals. In this setting, it may be prudent to draw less than full units at shorter intervals than the established standard. This approach protects the donor from iron depletion and the recipient from exposure to multiple donors.
        </p>
        <p>
         With the establishment of apheresis technologies, directed donors can, if eligible, donate double red blood cell units, thereby doubling the contribution from a donor without the need for a compressed donation schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
         Directed donor blood cannot be used for emergency transfusion, given the need to collect and test the blood. Since complete testing usually takes approximately 48 hours (plus time for administrative paperwork, delivery to the hospital, and perhaps time to seek a replacement donor should the first donor be disqualified for any reason), it would make sense to have a directed donor's blood drawn approximately one week prior to a scheduled elective surgical procedure. The shortest time frame in which this could occur would be 48 to 72 hours, as long as there are no unexpected delays.

          Overview

         – There are several approaches to maximizing safety of the blood supply and blood donation, including avoidance of financial incentives, screening donors for potential infectious risks, deferring certain donors, and providing support and hydration during donation. (See

          Recipient protections
         </strong>
         – Recipient protections include incentivizing altruistic motivations for blood donation, conducting a donor medical history interview, maintaining donor deferral registries, allowing donors to provide additional medical history after the donation, infectious disease testing of donated blood, and using leukoreduction and/or pathogen inactivation procedures after collection.

         <strong>
          Hereditary hemochromatosis
         </strong>
         – Blood from individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is considered safe provided the donor and the donated blood components undergo all the same screening procedures as community donations. In the United States, the blood center must perform therapeutic phlebotomies for HH at no charge, removing the financial incentive for donation. (See

          Donor protections
         </strong>
         – Donors are excluded if they are &lt;16 years or &lt;17 years depending on the state, &lt;50 kg, or have an estimated blood volume &lt;3500 mL. Donation frequency is limited to allow sufficient time for the hemoglobin to return to baseline. Certain medical conditions preclude donation (heart or lung disease, pregnancy, recent surgery), as do vital signs outside of normal ranges. (See

         <strong>
          Complications of whole blood donation
         </strong>
         – Two main complications of whole blood donation are volume-related or vasovagal reactions and anemia. Measures to reduce vasovagal reactions include providing water, ensuring the donor feels well before walking to the refreshment table, and encouraging them to stay at the table for 10 to 15 minutes. Measures to reduce anemia and iron deficiency include hemoglobin testing prior to donation and limiting donation frequency. Routine iron supplementation is not used but may be appropriate for premenopausal females, teenage donors, and/or repeat donors. Routine iron stores monitoring is not consistently performed, but many United States blood centers obtain a post-donation ferritin level for repeat and teenage donors. (See

          Complications of apheresis donation
         </strong>
         – Apheresis platelet donation can cause thrombocytopenia and is limited to 24 donations over a one-year period. Apheresis can cause hypocalcemia due to citrate exposure, which is treated by lowering the rate of citrate infusion and/or administering calcium-containing agents. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Directed donations
         </strong>
         – Directed donations increased dramatically during the early AIDS epidemic but have since declined to &lt;0.2 percent. Directed donations generally do not provide a benefit for recipients, and they carry increased administrative burdens. However, they may be appropriate in select circumstances (when a recipient has antibodies to high-frequency antigens or when there is a need to reduce recipient exposure to certain antigens on red blood cells or platelets). Donations from a male should not be used for a female who may become pregnant with his child due to the increased risk of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). Any directed donation from a related individual must be irradiated to prevent transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (ta-GVHD), an almost universally fatal complication. (See
