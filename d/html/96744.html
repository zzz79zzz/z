Such athletes are susceptible to a number of shoulder and elbow injuries due to the stresses involved in throwing.</p><p>The treatment and prevention of throwing-related upper extremity injuries in adults and older adolescents is reviewed here. The presentation and diagnosis of such injuries and the assessment of children with elbow or shoulder injuries are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94703.html" rel="external">"Throwing injuries of the upper extremity: Clinical presentation and diagnostic approach"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95726.html" rel="external">"Throwing injuries: Biomechanics and mechanism of injury"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6524.html" rel="external">"Elbow injuries in active children or skeletally immature adolescents: Approach"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95846.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of acute traumatic shoulder injury in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H179374576"><span class="h1">INITIAL TREATMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial treatment for most throwing injuries is relative rest. This involves significantly decreasing the number of throws performed by an athlete or eliminating throwing altogether for a period. For a baseball pitcher or catcher, this may be as simple as changing positions, ideally to first base or designated hitter. For position players who do not throw as often, depending on the severity of the injury, a position change or elimination of throwing during practice may be required. Complete cessation of throwing is often necessary if an injury is severe.</p><p>Immobilization is rarely needed and may be detrimental. Pain can generally be managed with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/z/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a> or a short course of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The possible effects of NSAIDs on soft tissue healing are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7991.html" rel="external">"Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects", section on 'Healing of musculoskeletal injury'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H179374582"><span class="h1">TREATMENT OF SPECIFIC INJURIES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H75984445"><span class="h2">Shoulder conditions</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H179374595"><span class="h3">Rotator cuff injuries</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The majority of rotator cuff injuries may be treated with relative rest followed by physical therapy. Important elements of treatment typically include strengthening the rotator cuff and scapular stabilizers and stretching the posterior shoulder capsule. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/239.html" rel="external">"Rotator cuff tendinopathy", section on 'Treatments'</a>.)</p><p>Surgical referral should be obtained expeditiously for acute full-thickness tears associated with weakness and for cases where the patient fails to improve with physical therapy. Significant retraction identified by diagnostic imaging also indicates a need for surgical referral. Physical therapy for patients with rotator cuff injuries but no surgical indications and the management of rotator cuff tears are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/82958.html" rel="external">"Rehabilitation principles and practice for shoulder impingement and related problems"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/235.html" rel="external">"Management of rotator cuff tears"</a>.)</p><p>Subacromial glucocorticoid injections have been used to reduce symptoms acutely [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. After such injections, the athlete must refrain from throwing for five days [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. However, the use of glucocorticoid injections to treat musculotendinous injury remains controversial. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/230.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of overuse (persistent) tendinopathy", section on 'Glucocorticoids'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H179374601"><span class="h3">Labral tears</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment of labral tears may be nonoperative with physical therapy, including strengthening of the rotator cuff, biceps, and scapular stabilizers, and stretching of the posterior shoulder capsule. However, many throwing athletes ultimately need surgical debridement or repair in order to return to sport. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13815.html" rel="external">"Superior labrum anterior to posterior (SLAP) tears", section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H179374607"><span class="h3">Glenohumeral internal rotation deficiency</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with glenohumeral internal rotation deficiency (GIRD) are managed nonoperatively. Surgery should be reserved for the rare symptomatic patient who does not respond to nonoperative treatment [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Nonoperative treatment consists of rest from throwing, stretching the posterior shoulder capsule and pectoralis minor muscle, strengthening the posterior shoulder musculature (especially the subscapularis and serratus anterior), and glenohumeral joint mobilization. Useful stretches include the sleeper stretch and the cross-body adduction stretch  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103152" href="/z/d/graphic/103152.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94703.html" rel="external">"Throwing injuries of the upper extremity: Clinical presentation and diagnostic approach", section on 'Shoulder injuries'</a> and <a class="local">'Stretching exercises'</a> below and <a class="local">'Strength, balance, and plyometric exercises for throwers'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4065966317"><span class="h3">SICK scapula syndrome and scapular dyskinesis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment of scapular dyskinesis and <strong>s</strong>capular malposition, <strong>i</strong>nferior medial border prominence, <strong>c</strong>oracoid pain and malposition, and dys<strong>k</strong>inesis (SICK scapular syndrome) begins with relative rest by limiting throwing. Treatment to address underlying dysfunction includes stretching of the pectoralis minor muscle and posteroinferior shoulder capsule as well as strengthening of the rotator cuff and scapular stabilizing muscles. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/82958.html" rel="external">"Rehabilitation principles and practice for shoulder impingement and related problems", section on 'Rehabilitation program'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94703.html" rel="external">"Throwing injuries of the upper extremity: Clinical presentation and diagnostic approach", section on 'Shoulder injuries'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H179374619"><span class="h3">Proximal humeral epiphysiolysis ("Little League shoulder")</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Little League shoulder is treated with rest and activity modification. Typically, symptoms resolve with two to three months of relative rest. During this period, clinicians should educate the patient, the parents/caregivers, and (ideally) the coaches about appropriate rest between pitching episodes; the Pitch Smart guidelines and other prevention measures are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Prevention'</a> below.) </p><p>The patient should participate in a strength program that includes both the core and lower extremities. A stretching program is especially important for athletes with motion limitations consistent with GIRD, as these athletes appear to be at increased risk for recurrence [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Prior to resuming pitching, the athlete should complete a return-to-throwing program. Often, a review of the athlete's biomechanics is useful, as many young throwers have a tendency to throw using primarily their arm and shoulder rather than generating power with their lower body. (See <a class="local">'Follow-up care and return-to-throwing program'</a> below and <a class="local">'Exercise and throwing programs for treatment and injury prevention'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94703.html" rel="external">"Throwing injuries of the upper extremity: Clinical presentation and diagnostic approach", section on 'Shoulder injuries'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3468603012"><span class="h3">Transient subluxation ("dead arm syndrome")</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Management of dead arm syndrome primarily involves treatment of the underlying pathology. Patients with isolated rotator cuff pathology often respond well to physical therapy, including strengthening of the rotator cuff. Such exercises are described below. (See <a class="local">'Upper extremity strength exercises'</a> below.)</p><p>Throwers with labral pathology often require surgical treatment [<a href="#rid3">3,5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13815.html" rel="external">"Superior labrum anterior to posterior (SLAP) tears", section on 'Management'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94703.html" rel="external">"Throwing injuries of the upper extremity: Clinical presentation and diagnostic approach", section on 'Shoulder injuries'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1348205857"><span class="h3">Bennett lesion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A Bennett lesion is a mineralization that develops at the posteroinferior glenoid in throwing athletes. Bennett lesions are often asymptomatic, and treatment is controversial. Some surgeons excise such lesions while others concentrate on correcting strength or biomechanical deficits around the shoulder. There is little published evidence to guide decision-making, and no study has compared operative and nonoperative treatment. In one surgical case series, 11 of 16 patients returned to baseball following arthroscopic resection [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. While Bennett lesions are often asymptomatic, their presence suggests chronic loading of the posterior capsule. Thus, while athletes who are asymptomatic do not need to stop throwing, it would behoove them to start a prevention program similar to the one used to manage GIRD to protect the shoulder complex. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94703.html" rel="external">"Throwing injuries of the upper extremity: Clinical presentation and diagnostic approach", section on 'Shoulder injuries'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H75984452"><span class="h2">Elbow conditions</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H179374631"><span class="h3">Ulnar collateral ligament sprain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Partial ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) tears are generally treated with six weeks of relative rest and physical therapy with an emphasis on strengthening the common flexor muscles [<a href="#rid2">2,7,8</a>]. Although non-throwing athletes rarely require surgery for complete UCL tears, throwing athletes typically do and should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon with experience managing such injuries. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94703.html" rel="external">"Throwing injuries of the upper extremity: Clinical presentation and diagnostic approach", section on 'Elbow injuries'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H179374637"><span class="h3">Valgus extension overload syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment of valgus extension overload (VEO) syndrome begins with relative rest for two to six weeks followed by a return-to-throwing program.

For symptomatic relief, acute exacerbations of ulnar neuropathy may be treated with analgesics, such as antiinflammatory medications. Other medications are not typically used.  </p><p>Local injection of a glucocorticoid is no longer routinely done. However, small randomized trials report that it may provide short-term relief and thus may be considered in select cases (eg, player near retirement who only has symptoms while throwing) [<a href="#rid13">13-15</a>]. For permanent relief, cessation of the inciting activity or surgical release or transfer of the nerve may be needed.

Possible injuries include low back muscle strain, spondylolysis, oblique muscle strain, hip labral tears, and hamstring injuries. In addition to the primary injury, trunk and lower extremity deficits may predispose throwers to upper extremity injury. As part of their management, clinicians should evaluate for trunk and lower extremity injuries (including history, motion restrictions, and neuromuscular control) and include appropriate corrective exercises as indicated. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14490.html" rel="external">"Spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis in child and adolescent athletes: Clinical presentation, imaging, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13810.html" rel="external">"Hamstring muscle and tendon injuries"</a>.)</p><p>According to a systematic review of 14 studies, decreased hip internal rotation, altered foot arch position, and decreased lower extremity balance and neuromuscular control were associated with an increased risk of elbow injuries among baseball players [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. A small cohort study of professional baseball pitchers reported that those with decreased lumbopelvic control had a higher incidence of upper extremity injury [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H179374673"><span class="h1">FOLLOW-UP CARE AND RETURN-TO-THROWING PROGRAM</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Physical therapy to address both injuries and dysfunction that may have predisposed to injury is the mainstay of treatment for many upper extremity, throwing-related conditions. Prior to embarking upon a rehabilitation program, an assessment of the athlete should be performed to identify possible sources of dysfunction.</p><p>An appropriate physical therapy program includes progressive mobility and strength exercises of uninjured structures (eg, lower extremity and trunk) based on identified needs. Gradually, exercises involving the injured extremity are introduced as symptoms abate and the primary injury heals. This is followed by the addition of a plyometric program that involves exercises such as throwing a weighted ball against a trampoline or with a partner to develop proprioception and strength. When the athlete manifests no tenderness, no pain to resisted motion or passive stretch, and no pain during or after performance of plyometric exercises, a progressive throwing program may be initiated. The exercises programs used in rehabilitation are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Exercise programs for rehabilitation and injury prevention in throwers'</a> below and <a class="local">'Stretching exercises'</a> below and <a class="local">'Strength, balance, and plyometric exercises for throwers'</a> below.)</p><p>Throwing programs for rehabilitation and injury prevention vary greatly, and such components as maximum throwing distance, number of throws, and intensity of throwing are the source of ongoing debate. Biomechanical studies show that throwing mechanics and the stresses placed on the elbow and shoulder change as distance increases [<a href="#rid2">2,18</a>]. At 120 feet (37 meters), players no longer throw with a "downhill" trajectory, and mechanics begin to change. At 180 feet (55 meters), shoulder and elbow stresses begin to rise to potentially dangerous levels. Based on this data, we generally recommend that pitchers gradually move to a maximum distance of 120 feet (37 meters) and position players to a maximum 150 to 180 feet (46 to 55 meters) in long toss programs. A sample progressive throwing program for throwers who have recovered from an injury or are returning to sport after a layoff (eg, season playing a non-throwing sport) and are working towards a return to play is provided in the following table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef103155" href="/z/d/graphic/103155.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H179374679"><span class="h1">COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H75985023"><span class="h2">Musculoskeletal injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In general, complications from throwing injuries primarily relate to the inability to return successfully to throwing activity and to early degenerative changes, in particular shoulder and elbow osteoarthritis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H179374685"><span class="h2">Effort thrombosis/Paget-Schroetter syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Complications of thrombosis include post-thrombotic syndrome, which is characterized by persistent pain, heaviness of the limb, and chronic swelling [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H179374691"><span class="h1">RETURN TO SPORT OR WORK</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In general, an athlete may return to throwing when they are asymptomatic, have regained full strength, and have successfully completed a well-designed return-to-throwing program. The athlete may return to sport sooner if they can be moved to a position that does not require significant throwing (eg, first base or designated hitter in baseball).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H179374697"><span class="h1">PREVENTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many throwing injuries are related to overuse, high velocity, and poor mechanics [<a href="#rid20">20-23</a>]. Other risk factors for shoulder and elbow injuries include older age, greater height, participation on multiple teams, throwing with arm fatigue, and possibly mound height. Strategies for preventing throwing-related injuries of the upper extremity include avoiding overuse, correcting mechanical flaws, increasing strength, maintaining mobility, and completing proper warm-up and cool-down exercises.</p><p>Studies suggest that limiting the number of pitches thrown and the percentage of the year that an athlete is involved in throwing sports may decrease injury risk [<a href="#rid24">24-27</a>]. USA Baseball and Major League Baseball have promoted recommendations for limiting pitching volumes and types based on these and other studies, which can be found at the website in the following reference [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p>Clinicians should be aware that baseball pitch counts often underestimate an athlete's actual throwing volume, as warm-up pitches and bullpen activity may not be recorded and may increase throwing volume by more than 40 percent [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Young athletes often play multiple positions throughout a season. Thus, total throwing volume can be up to 10 times greater than pitch count totals [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. In addition, youth softball typically has no pitch count limits, and softball pitchers frequently throw in consecutive games during tournaments. An observational study of 14 youth softball pitchers reported that incomplete recovery following pitching consecutive games during a tournament produced a progressive loss of strength, increased fatigue, and shoulder pain, which are factors associated with an increased risk of injury [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p>In addition to workload, increased throwing velocity is a risk factor for elbow and shoulder injuries at both the youth and professional levels [<a href="#rid20">20-23,32</a>]. Furthermore, athletes who mature relatively early and are able to throw harder are often asked to pitch at a younger age, recruited to play on multiple teams, and sometimes pressured into specializing in baseball [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. In an observational study of 746 major league baseball players over eight years, early sports specialization was associated with an increased risk of overuse, upper extremity injury, and decreased career longevity compared with participation in multiple sports during high school [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p>A number of biomechanical risk factors for elbow and shoulder injuries have been identified [<a href="#rid3">3,34</a>]. By using motion analysis to evaluate a pitcher's throwing motions, clinicians can determine whether such factors are present and recommend modifications that may decrease the risk of injury. However, some pitchers may find that suggested changes in biomechanics cause changes in ball motion or velocity that reduce their effectiveness. Some of the more common biomechanical throwing errors that can place undue stress on the shoulder and elbow include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hooking the ball (early shoulder and elbow extension with wrist flexion) during arm cocking phase  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103683" href="/z/d/graphic/103683.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Low shoulder abduction (dropped elbow) at time of foot contact  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103686" href="/z/d/graphic/103686.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Excessive horizontal shoulder abduction at foot contact and through early acceleration  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103684" href="/z/d/graphic/103684.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Premature trunk rotation during initiation of acceleration  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103687" href="/z/d/graphic/103687.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Excessive elbow flexion at foot contact, moving to excessive elbow extension at ball release  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103688" href="/z/d/graphic/103688.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Inadequate follow-through  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103689" href="/z/d/graphic/103689.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>)</p><p></p><p>While these flaws can often be spotted by trained professionals in "real time," video analysis often involving slow motion replay is necessary for a thorough assessment of throwing biomechanics.</p><p>In addition to avoiding overuse and biomechanical flaws, exercise programs designed to improve strength and maintain mobility are important for preventing throwing-related upper extremity injuries. While the importance of shoulder and arm strength is obvious to most throwing athletes, the importance of strong scapular stabilizers, trunk, and lower extremity muscles may not be. Thus, it is important to educate throwing athletes about the importance of these muscles and to provide appropriate strength and conditioning programs.</p><p>Most scapular and rotator cuff exercise programs for pitchers are modeled on the "Thrower's 10 Program" designed by James Andrews, MD and physical therapists Kevin Wilk and Michael Reinhold [<a href="#rid35">35-37</a>]. This program is designed to be one part of a year-round program of strength and mobility that targets the main muscles involved in throwing. An Advanced Thrower's 10 Program published in 2011 builds upon the original with the goal of coordinating the upper extremity with the core and lower extremity. This program incorporates exercises to develop single-leg balance, trunk and abdominal strength, and ipsilateral musculature.</p><p>Suggested exercise programs for throwers, including descriptions of the specific exercises used in these programs, are described below. Continual work to prevent dysfunction in the shoulder capsule remains an important element of all programs. According to a 2018 systematic review of studies of exercises for overhead athletes with shoulder conditions, evidence is generally of low quality, but the best available evidence supports the use of single-plane, open-chain upper extremity exercises and closed-chain upper extremity exercises, similar to those included in our recommendations below [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Exercise programs for rehabilitation and injury prevention in throwers'</a> below and <a class="local">'Strength, balance, and plyometric exercises for throwers'</a> below and <a class="local">'Stretching exercises'</a> below.).</p><p>The idiosyncratic biomechanical demands of pitching require specific adaptations that must be accounted for when designing training programs for throwers. As an example, while the ratio of shoulder internal rotation to external rotation is generally 3:2 in normal individuals and in many overhead athletes, healthy pitchers may reach a 4:3 ratio while developing a "posterior dominant" shoulder (ie, one with greater external rotation) that may be more resistant to injury. Thus, strength exercises for the shoulder should be performed in a controlled manner and include some emphasis on the eccentric movement in order to mimic the demands of deceleration that occur following release of the ball when pitching.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H63504392"><span class="h1">EXERCISE AND THROWING PROGRAMS FOR TREATMENT AND INJURY PREVENTION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H63504535"><span class="h2">Key principles for training and rehabilitation programs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Sample programs that may be used for treating throwing-related injuries of the upper extremity or for preventing such injuries are illustrated in the following section and in the accompanying tables [<a href="#rid35">35-37,39,40</a>].

Common terms used to describe the different intensities of throwing include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lob toss – Throwing at short distance with minimal effort.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Soft toss – Throwing with a substantial arc to the ball's trajectory at approximately 50 to 60 percent of maximal effort or velocity.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Firm toss – Throwing with a slight arc at approximately 80 to 85 percent of maximal effort or velocity.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>On-line throwing – Throwing with virtually no arc at approximately 90 to 95 percent of maximal effort.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Game-intensity throwing – Throwing with 95 percent effort or greater, as if in a game situation.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H71737336"><span class="h3">Active warm-up program for shoulder, arm, and forearm</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A number of approaches are used for warming up throwers prior to competition. Although evidence is limited, and many warm-up programs are based on tradition rather than evidence, a few studies have reported favorable results for warm-ups that included flexibility exercises along with lower extremity, upper extremity, and core activation exercises. Although not performed in baseball players, a well-designed, cluster-randomized trial involving 660 elite team handball players (a population of overhead throwing athletes with a shoulder injury profile similar to baseball pitchers) found that a preparticipation exercise program was effective in reducing shoulder injuries over the course of the seven-month season (average prevalence 17 percent [95% CI 16-19] in the intervention group versus 23 percent [95% CI 21-26] in the control group) [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. Another research group has reported similar results using a comparable program for Little League baseball players [<a href="#rid45">45,46</a>].</p><p>The following figure describes a warm-up program that includes many of the exercises used in the team handball study and Little League injury reduction programs that can be used by any pitcher or throwing athlete prior to competition or intensive throwing  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103153" href="/z/d/graphic/103153.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>) [<a href="#rid44">44,45</a>]. Athletes should first perform a light five-minute general cardiovascular warm-up (eg, jogging, stationary cycling) followed by posterior shoulder, chest, and forearm stretches  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103152" href="/z/d/graphic/103152.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103159" href="/z/d/graphic/103159.html" rel="external">picture 33</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103693" href="/z/d/graphic/103693.html" rel="external">picture 34</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81293" href="/z/d/graphic/81293.html" rel="external">picture 35</a>) prior to the throwing-specific warm-up.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2174063435"><span class="h3">Active cool-down program for shoulder, arm, and forearm</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are no consensus recommendations for post-throwing care and little high-quality evidence to guide such recommendations. According to an observational study of a convenience sample of 20 professional baseball pitchers, a simple one-minute mobility routine is effective for maintaining shoulder and elbow mobility following intensive throwing [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. On the basis of these results and our clinical experience, we suggest the following approach to cooling down following intensive throwing (eg, game pitching):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Perform light cardiovascular activity</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Repeat warm-up exercises  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103153" href="/z/d/graphic/103153.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Perform the "two-out" stretching program  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114666" href="/z/d/graphic/114666.html" rel="external">picture 46</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H61393435"><span class="h3">Return-to-throwing program</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The progressive throwing program contained in the following table is primarily designed for pitchers and other throwers who have recovered from an injury or are returning to sport after a layoff (eg, season plying a non-throwing sport) and are working towards a return to play  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef103155" href="/z/d/graphic/103155.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Gradually, throwing distance and intensity are increased. As distances increase beyond 60 feet (18 meters), a step-through (or "crow-hop") is encouraged to help increase the contributions from the lower extremity and trunk.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H54780431"><span class="h3">In-season throwing programs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In-season throwing programs are designed to help pitchers and other throwers maintain endurance and strength while reducing the risk of injury during the competitive season. In-season programs for throwers are provided in the following table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef138788" href="/z/d/graphic/138788.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H79028954"><span class="h3">Off-season throwing program</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Off-season throwing programs are designed to help pitchers prepare for the beginning of the season. Pitchers usually begin such a program about six weeks prior to the start of organized team practices. A sample program is provided in the accompanying table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef103173" href="/z/d/graphic/103173.html" rel="external">table 4</a>).</p><p>Off-season throwing sessions begin with approximately five minutes of light jogging or stationary cycling, easy sets of selected shoulder and upper extremity warm-up exercises, and five minutes of easy, lob tossing from 10 to 20 feet (3 to 6 meters) before moving to the first prescribed distance of the day's program.</p><p>All prescribed throws should be firm but not overthrown. Over the course of a session, throwers should strive to make more precise on-line throws to the target. If the thrower cannot make firm throws at the set distance, the distance should be shortened. Throwers should not advance to the next distance until they are strong enough to complete their present level.</p><p>Pitchers should not throw off a mound until they are able to on-line throw 120 feet for the designated time. Their goal is to be able to throw 25 to 30 pitches or five minutes of batting practice off the mound by the time they report for the start of organized practice. The goal for position players is to on-line throw 120 feet for the designated time without discomfort. If at any time during the off-season program an athlete experiences pain, significant discomfort, or other arm problems, they should contact their coach or trainer.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H55886137"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management</strong> – The initial treatment for most throwing injuries is relative or absolute rest.
