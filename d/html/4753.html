         Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection results in impaired cellular immunity, a condition known to predispose persons to develop neoplasms. As the lifespan of people living with HIV has increased, malignancies have become a known cause of morbidity and mortality in this population. Certain non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL; systemic high-grade B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, primary central nervous system [CNS] lymphoma), along with Kaposi sarcoma and invasive cervical carcinoma constitute acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining malignancies. Other types of lymphoma (eg, Hodgkin lymphoma, follicular lymphoma) and other cancers in people living with HIV are not considered AIDS-defining. HIV-related NHL can be divided into three general categories, based on location:

        </p>
        <p>
         Systemic NHL accounts for the great majority of HIV-related lymphomas. In contrast, primary CNS lymphoma, in which disease is limited to the CNS, comprises approximately 10 percent of HIV-related lymphomas, while primary effusion lymphoma is much less common. The latter disorder is characterized by its predilection for body cavities such as the peritoneal, pleural, and pericardial spaces without an identifiable tumor mass.
        </p>
        <p>
         The treatment of systemic NHL in the setting of HIV infection may be complicated by the patient's immunocompromised state and the need to treat HIV concurrently. The treatment of HIV-related systemic aggressive B cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma will be reviewed here. The treatment of aggressive and highly aggressive NHL in the absence of HIV is presented separately, as are:

         The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased the complexity of cancer care. Important issues include balancing the risk from treatment delay versus harm from COVID-19, ways to minimize negative impacts of social distancing during care delivery, and appropriately and fairly allocating limited health care resources. These issues and recommendations for cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed separately.

         Approximately 70 to 90 percent of the lymphomas encountered in people living with HIV infection are clinically aggressive diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) or highly aggressive Burkitt-like lymphomas [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. At least 80 percent of these patients with systemic lymphoma have stage IV disease at the time of presentation  (

         ], with the common extranodal sites of involvement being the gastrointestinal tract, liver, lung, bone marrow, and the central nervous system. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4726.html" rel="external">

         Although few patients diagnosed early in the HIV epidemic were cured of their lymphoma, the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the late 1990s resulted in a marked improvement in the ability of these patients to tolerate standard chemotherapy regimens and in their clinical outcomes that now approach those in the general population.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are factors associated with HIV infection that make the management of people living with HIV and lymphoma considerably more complex:

         Historically, doses of chemotherapy were restricted by the baseline cellular immunodeficiency and limited bone marrow reserve of patients with advanced HIV infection [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. However, the standard concomitant administration of ART may improve bone marrow function by decreasing the adverse effects of the HIV infection on hematopoiesis, thereby allowing for full dosing of chemotherapy [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4

         Chemotherapy produces a significant and sustained reduction in CD4 cell counts and an increased risk (twofold in one study) of opportunistic infection [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ]. The immunosuppression induced by chemotherapy exceeds the duration of exposure to these drugs by many months [

         ].

         Medications taken to control the HIV infection may have side effects that overlap with chemotherapy side effects (eg, myelosuppression). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3773.html" rel="external">
          "Selecting antiretroviral regimens for treatment-naïve persons with HIV-1: General approach"

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         A key component of the treatment of all people living with HIV with an HIV-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the administration of an effective ART regimen. Recent experience in the ART era strongly suggests that HIV-associated aggressive lymphomas can be treated successfully with standard chemotherapy regimens without unusually severe toxicities [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-9
         </a>
         ]. Even high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support (hematopoietic cell transplantation) has been well tolerated in this patient population and is becoming more widely used. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Autologous HCT'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to the advent of ART, randomized studies did not show any advantage in those treated with more intensive chemotherapy versus standard or reduced-dose regimens, in terms of response rates, time to progression, and median survival among people living with HIV [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. However, a potential benefit from intensive chemotherapy may have been masked by an increase in opportunistic infections in those receiving intensive therapy. Opportunistic infections are less common in this setting now that the underlying HIV infection can be better controlled with ART. (See
         <a class="local">

         To best treat patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), the initial evaluation must establish the precise histologic subtype, the extent and sites of disease, and the performance status of the patient. General approaches to the diagnostic work-up and staging of NHL are presented separately. (See

        <p>
         The pretreatment evaluation both determines the extent of the disease and provides information about the individual's comorbidities that are likely to have an impact on treatment options. In addition to a history and physical examination, it is our practice to perform the following pretreatment studies in people with HIV-related systemic NHL:

         The optimal initial therapy for HIV-related lymphomas has yet to be defined. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is started or modified (if already begun) to control the HIV infection and allow for the administration of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. As in the HIV-seronegative population, the choice of therapy is principally determined by the subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and the stage of disease. Modifications are made based on the degree of immunosuppression from HIV, as measured by the CD4 count.
        </p>
        <p>
         As in the HIV-seronegative population, attention needs to be given to serum uric acid levels and other potential complications of the tumor lysis syndrome at the time of diagnosis and with the first cycle of cytotoxic chemotherapy [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14

         </span>
         The reduction in HIV viral load and improvement in immune function associated with ART is expected to result in better tolerance of chemotherapy, fewer opportunistic infections, and improvement in overall treatment outcome. These expectations have largely been borne out in retrospective and prospective clinical data collected since the advent of ART. ART is an essential component to the treatment of people with HIV-related lymphoma. ART should be continued during chemotherapy, with an undetectable blood viral load being the targeted goal [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Since the incorporation of ART, there has been a decrease in the number of AIDS-defining opportunistic infections that develop during or shortly after completing chemotherapy. As an example, approximately 20 percent of patients treated with chemotherapy for HIV-related NHL in a large prospective trial conducted in the pre-ART era developed AIDS-defining opportunistic infections [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. In contrast, opportunistic infections have been infrequently reported in more recent clinical trials in which ART has been administered with chemotherapy [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,16-20

         A German study demonstrated treatment outcomes using CHOP and concurrent ART that were similar to those with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in the general population, with a complete response rate of 79 percent and median survival not reached after a median of 47 months follow-up [

         The response to ART has been shown to be an independent risk factor for survival in patients with HIV-related NHL [

         ]. One-year OS for the entire group was 49 percent, increasing to 78 percent for virologic responders, and 84 percent among those who achieved immunologic restoration.

         Studies that have evaluated interactions between protease inhibitors and chemotherapy have had mixed results. One study has shown no statistically significant difference between ART regimens containing protease inhibitors versus those not containing protease inhibitors with respect to response rates or survival [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. However, protease inhibitor containing regimens may potentiate the myelotoxicity of the chemotherapy regimen compared with antiretroviral regimens that do not contain a protease inhibitor. This is likely due to CYP3A inhibition by specific protease inhibitors. Even at lower doses,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9871" href="/z/d/drug information/9871.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         is a potent CYP3A inhibitor that can be used to "boost" levels of other protease inhibitors. Although use of these agents concomitantly with conventional dose chemotherapy is not contraindicated, alternatives might be considered, especially if more aggressive or high-dose chemotherapy regimens are to be utilized. The use of integrase inhibitor-based regimens (eg,

         The treatment of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in the HIV-seronegative population is based on the stage of disease at diagnosis. Limited stage disease is often treated with the combination of chemotherapy (eg, CHOP), immunotherapy (eg, directed at CD20), and involved-field radiation therapy, while advanced stage disease is commonly treated with chemotherapy plus immunotherapy. In people living with HIV, the majority of cases are of advanced stage. In this setting, the best choice of chemotherapy regimen and the role of immunotherapy are less clear. (See

         Two prospective clinical trials demonstrated that outcomes of DLBCL in people living with HIV in the ART era do not differ from the HIV-negative counterparts. Moreover, the risk of relapse is associated with an unclassifiable histology, stage III or IV, and no concomitant ART during chemotherapy [

At a median follow-up of 53 months, estimated rates of progression-free survival (PFS) and OS at five years were 73 and 60 percent, respectively. Five-year OS rates for patients with CD4 counts &gt;100/microL and ≤100/micro were 87 and 16 percent, respectively.

          rituximab
         </a>
         has revolutionized the treatment of CD20-positive lymphomas in the HIV-negative population. However, the role of rituximab in HIV-related lymphoma is not as clearly defined, given the profound cellular and humoral immunodeficiency that this agent can cause. The combination of rituximab with chemotherapy may cause a temporary decrease the CD4, CD8, and CD19 (B cell) cell populations but does not appear to change the natural killer cell population [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51,52
         </a>
         ]. In addition, panhypogammaglobulinemia of varying magnitude and duration typically follows the use of R-CHOP chemotherapy, leading to a decrease in humoral immunity [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53
         </a>
         ]. The loss of humoral immunity in addition to the underlying destruction of the cellular immune system by HIV may increase the risk of infection above that which is normally seen with either HIV infection or rituximab therapy alone. (See

         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">
          rituximab
         </a>
         for patients with HIV-related CD20-positive lymphoma (eg, DLBCL, Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia) depends on the extent to which the underlying HIV is controlled, as manifest by the CD4 count. For most patients with HIV-related CD20-positive lymphoma, we suggest the addition of rituximab to the treatment regimen if the CD4 count is over 50/microL. This preference places some emphasis on the known benefit of rituximab in the HIV-negative population despite recognizing the more profound cellular and humoral immunodeficiency that this agent can cause.

         The decision whether to use
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">
          rituximab
         </a>
         in a patient with a CD20-positive disease and a CD4 count &lt;50 cells/microL must be individualized. For patients who have not been treated with ART previously, it is reasonable to begin chemotherapy with rituximab and ART with the expectation that viral load will be controlled. Such patients should be followed closely and given enteric antibiotic prophylaxis. On the other hand, for a patient on ART who has end-stage AIDS, who is unlikely to have an increase in the CD4 count during subsequent therapy, we favor chemotherapy alone.
        </p>
        <p>
         This approach is supported by a pooled analysis of individual patient data from 1546 patients in 19 prospective clinical trials that were performed between 1989 and 2010 that reported that treatment with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">
          rituximab
         </a>
         was associated with superior complete remission rates (odds ratio 2.89; 95% CI 1.64-5.08), PFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.50; 95% CI 0.34-0.72), and OS (HR 0.51; 95% CI 0.38-0.71) [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. Use of rituximab was associated with significantly improved outcomes in patients with CD4 ≥50 cells/microL, but not in patients with CD4 &lt;50 cells/microL, despite the fact that patients who received rituximab had a lower median CD4 count (179 versus 334 cells/microL) than those not receiving rituximab; however, the number of patients with a CD4 count &lt;50 cells/microL overall was 14 percent.

          rituximab
         </a>
         . The studies that have used rituximab with chemotherapy in the HIV-positive and HIV-negative populations have generally supported its addition to chemotherapy regimens for aggressive B cell lymphoma. However, this decision must take into consideration the patient's CD4 count. We use R-CHOP  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef63586" href="/z/d/graphic/63586.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ) in average-risk patients with CD20-positive HIV-related DLBCL. In contrast, we prefer dose-adjusted EPOCH plus concurrent rituximab in patients with higher risk DLBCL, such as those with high growth fraction (&gt;80 percent) or non-germinal center DLBCL. For patients with Burkitt histology, we favor the CODOX-M/IVAC (Magrath) regimen with the addition of rituximab. EPOCH plus concurrent rituximab is a possible alternative  (

         ], but also in the HIV-seronegative population. HIV-seronegative patients with Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia are typically treated with intensive, short-duration combination chemotherapy with central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis. The most commonly used regimens in the HIV-seronegative population are CODOX-M/IVAC (Magrath)  (

         ]. Alternatively, infusional chemotherapy with dose-adjusted EPOCH plus

          rituximab

         may be considered for patients with HIV and Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia and older, less fit patients without HIV provided that there is no evidence of CNS involvement. (See

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         There are limited data regarding the use of these regimens in the setting of HIV infection. A retrospective study of the CODOX-M/IVAC (Magrath) regimen in 14 adults with HIV-related Burkitt lymphoma reported a complete response rate of 63 percent [
         <a href="#rid69">
          69

         <a href="#rid73">
          73
         </a>
         ]. The modifications intensified the treatment of leptomeningeal disease if present at diagnosis and included measures to reduce mucositis and hematologic and neurologic toxicity. Most patients were able to receive the intended treatment and 12 percent discontinued therapy early due to toxicity. Severe (grade 3/4) neurotoxicity and hematologic toxicity occurred in 21 and 59 percent, respectively. One-quarter developed neutropenic fever and there was one treatment-related death. Estimated PFS at one year was 69 percent and OS at one and two years was 72 and 69 percent, respectively. Similar rates were seen in the 19 patients whose Burkitt lymphoma was confirmed on central pathologic review. The addition of

          rituximab

         A randomized phase II trial of dose-adjusted infusional chemotherapy with the EPOCH regimen plus

          50
         </a>
         ]. These patients did well with this regimen in conjunction with concurrent rituximab. However, further study of this regimen is required before definitive recommendations regarding its use in Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia can be made. One concern is the lack of CNS-penetrating systemic chemotherapy in the daEPOCH regimen given the high risk of leptomeningeal involvement in HIV patients with Burkitt lymphoma. (See
         <a class="local">

         A multicenter trial of daEPOCH-R included 28 previously untreated patients with Burkitt lymphoma who were HIV-positive [
         <a href="#rid74">
          74
         </a>
         ]. Low-risk patients (ie, normal LDH, ECOG performance status 0 to 1, stage I or II disease, maximum tumor size &lt;7 cm) received three cycles of daEPOCH-R (with no intrathecal prophylaxis, unless PET-CT after two cycles was positive) and all other patients (ie, high risk) received six cycles, plus intrathecal (IT) prophylaxis on days 1 and 5 of cycles 3 to 6. With median follow-up of five years, EFS and OS were 85 percent and 87 percent, respectively. EFS and OS were not significantly different for high-risk versus low-risk disease, HIV-positive versus negative, and age &gt;40 years versus ≤40 years. Compared with R-CODOX-M/IVAC, daEPOCH-R is associated with less toxicity, but it is concerning that daEPOCH-R does not contain any CNS-penetrating systemic agents (notably, only 10 percent of patients in this study had CNS disease at presentation).
        </p>
        <p>
         CNS prophylaxis is a key component to the treatment of patients with Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia. In the absence of CNS prophylaxis, up to 30 percent of patients with Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia will develop leptomeningeal involvement/recurrence regardless of HIV status [
         <a href="#rid67">
          67
         </a>
         ]. The more successful treatment regimens, like CODOX-M/IVAC, include the use of systemic CNS-penetrating chemotherapeutic agents and IT chemotherapy administration as an integral part of treatment. (See
         <a class="local">
          'CNS-directed therapy in aggressive B cell lymphoma'

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The CODOX-M/IVAC and CALGB-9251 protocols are complex to administer and there are possible interactions between the antineoplastic agents and the components of the ART regimen. In particular, it is recommended that ART be interrupted during the administration of high-dose
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/z/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">
          methotrexate
         </a>
         . This decision should be individualized based on the specific ART combination used. During treatment, ART should be continued if tolerated, however, if significant gastrointestinal toxicity is observed and results in the inconsistent use of antivirals, ART therapy may be discontinued for the duration of chemotherapy and restarted once chemotherapy is completed.

All patients Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia and a subset of patients with DLBCL (defined below) should undergo lumbar puncture with studies to rule out occult CNS spread at the time of diagnosis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should be evaluated with flow cytometric studies in addition to CSF cytology [

         In one study of 176 patients with systemic, HIV-related NHL, 10 percent had meningeal involvement at presentation; this is likely due to the high frequency of lymphomatous involvement of multiple extranodal sites of disease in patients with HIV-related lymphoma [
         <a href="#rid91">
          91
         </a>
         ]. For patients with DLBCL, it is not clear if HIV infection is an independent risk factor for CNS involvement, but we use the same criteria for CNS prophylaxis as in the non-HIV-associated DLBCL. As such, lumbar puncture at diagnosis and CNS prophylaxis should be performed in the setting of a high CNS IPI score (4-5), specific high-risk sites (eg, paranasal sinuses, testes, epidural space, adrenal glands, kidneys, bone marrow), or double hit lymphomas. A common practice is four treatments with intrathecal

The 14 patients with early stage, unfavorable HL were managed with either the more intensive BEACOPP regimen or with four cycles of ABVD plus RT. The 71 patients with advanced stage HL were managed with six to eight cycles of BEACOPP. Overall, 102 of the 108 patients (94 percent) were maintained on ART during treatment for HL.

         Similar conclusions were drawn from a retrospective study of 224 HL patients who were consecutively treated with ABVD between 1997 and 2010, in a series that included 93 people living with HIV [

         One month following the completion of planned therapy (or sooner if the outcome is unfavorable), the response to treatment should be documented by history, physical examination, and laboratory studies (complete blood count, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], and biochemical profile). The post-treatment imaging study of choice is a combined positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET/CT) scan, which provides information on the size and activity of residual masses and allows for the distinction between active disease and fibrosis. PET/CT should be obtained six to eight weeks after completion of chemotherapy and 12 weeks after the completion of radiation therapy [

          101

         Following the completion of therapy, restaging, and documentation of complete remission, patients are seen at periodic intervals to monitor for treatment complications and assess for possible relapse. The frequency and extent of these visits depends on the comfort of both the patient and physician. There have been no prospective, randomized trials comparing various schedules of follow-up.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our approach to patient surveillance is to schedule patient visits every one to two months during the first year, every two to three months during the second year, and every four to six months starting two years after complete response. At these visits we perform a history and physical examination, complete blood count, chemistries, and LDH.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is no role for routine PET or PET/CT imaging in the longitudinal follow-up of asymptomatic patients after response assessment. For those patients who achieve complete remission, follow-up CT scanning should be considered at 6 and 12 months post-treatment. Beyond one-year risk of recurrence is low, and scanning should be performed only as clinically indicated. Clinical follow-up is recommended every three to six months for five years.

        <p>
         Relapsed disease can be suggested by changes on imaging studies but can only be confirmed by biopsy. As such, a biopsy should always be obtained to document relapsed disease before proceeding to salvage therapy.

Many of these regimens have been utilized in for salvage therapy in the autologous transplant studies [

With median follow-up of 88 weeks, estimated one- and two-year OS were 42 and 35 percent, respectively. The best outcomes were seen in patients with HL, those with relapsed rather than refractory disease, those with CR or partial response (PR) to second-line therapy, and those who underwent autologous HCT.

         Autologous HCT is effective in patients with relapsed or refractory disease HIV-associated lymphomas. Patients should have a demonstrated response to antiretroviral therapy (ART), adequate organ function, chemosensitive disease, and no active cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection or other opportunistic infections.
        </p>
        <p>
         Autologous HCT has been successfully used for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory HIV-associated lymphoma receiving ART in both prospective and retrospective studies [

          102,103,106,115-121
         </a>
         ]. In general, the incidence of bacteremia and neutropenic fever has been similar to that seen in the HIV-negative transplant setting. Regimen-related toxicity is not significantly increased when ART is combined with the high-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy required for HCT.

         The following trials illustrate the feasibility and efficacy of autologous HCT in this population:

         In a multicenter prospective, single arm trial, 40 patients with relapsed or refractory HIV-associated aggressive systemic lymphoma (including DLBCL, plasmablastic lymphoma, Burkitt or Burkitt-like lymphoma or classic Hodgkin lymphoma) underwent autologous HCT after conditioning with BEAM [
         <a href="#rid121">
          121

         ]. ART was held from the beginning of the preparative regimen until at least seven days after completion of BEAM or resolution of gastrointestinal toxicity. At a median follow-up of 25 months, the estimated rates of overall and progression-free survival at two years were 82 and 80 percent, respectively. Importantly, when compared with an HIV-negative matched control population, HIV infection did not appear to impact mortality, lymphoma relapse, or other negative outcomes.

         Although few patients diagnosed early in the HIV epidemic were cured of their lymphoma, the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the late 1990s resulted in a marked improvement in the ability of these patients to tolerate standard chemotherapy regimens and clinical outcomes that now approach those in the general population. As described above, outcomes with full-dose chemotherapy for aggressive B cell lymphomas appear to be similar in HIV-positive and HIV-negative populations treated with similar regimens [

        <p>
         While some prospective therapeutic trials discussed elsewhere in this section have demonstrated better outcomes than these data would suggest, the patient population represented in this analysis is a heterogeneous one in which presentations, treatment strategies (if any), and comorbidities may vary greatly. It should serve only as a general overview of outcomes for these different histologic groups.
        </p>
        <p>
         In HIV-negative patients with DLBCL, the immunophenotype has been shown to be of prognostic importance. As is the case for non-immunocompromised patients with DLBCL, immunophenotypic analysis reveals a post-germinal center phenotype (non-GC) to be associated with significantly worse outcome when compared with a GC phenotype [
         <a href="#rid60">
          60,139,143

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Features associated with the plasmablastic and primary effusion subtypes of DLBCL, including negativity for CD20, negativity for CD10, and positivity for CD138/Syn-1, are associated with a worse prognosis [

         Finally, as noted above, there is retrospective evidence to support a survival benefit from the addition of ART to chemotherapy. Treatment outcomes in prospective trials conducted since the introduction of ART show markedly improved survival times when compared with studies from the pre-ART era. (See

         As an example, in a large French study in 485 patients treated with a risk-adapted approach to chemotherapy, ART use, immune status, and IPI score were independently associated with prognosis [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. In another study, the two-year OS of HIV-positive patients with low, low-intermediate, or high-intermediate risk disease as defined by the IPI  (

         ) who were treated with chemotherapy plus ART was not significantly different from that of HIV-negative patients [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. These authors suggested that a weighted prognostic score combining the IPI with the CD4 cell count (&lt;100 versus &gt;100 cells/microL) provided further independent prognostic information for people with HIV-related systemic lymphoma treated in the ART era.

         </span>
         Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are at increased risk for systemic non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The treatment of systemic NHL in the setting of HIV is complicated by the patient's immunocompromised state and also requires specific treatment for the HIV. The following represents our general approach to the management of systemic non-central nervous system (CNS), non-effusion lymphomas in people living with HIV. Treatment of CNS and primary effusion lymphoma is addressed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4751.html" rel="external">
          "HIV-related lymphomas: Primary central nervous system lymphoma"
         </a>
         and
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4752.html" rel="external">
          "Primary effusion lymphoma"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The optimal initial therapy for lymphomas in the setting of HIV has yet to be defined. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is started or modified (if already begun) to control the HIV infection and allow for the administration of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. As in the HIV-seronegative population, the choice of therapy is principally determined by the subtype of NHL and the stage of disease. Modifications are made based on the degree of immunosuppression from HIV as measured by the CD4 count.
        </p>
        <p>
         The following represents our approach for patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). A similar approach may be taken for other types of clinically aggressive NHL, although

         During treatment, ART should be continued, if tolerated, along with PCP prophylaxis, and antibiotic prophylaxis for enteric organisms.

         Although few patients diagnosed early in the HIV epidemic were cured of their lymphoma, the introduction of ART in the late 1990s resulted in a marked improvement in the ability of these patients to tolerate standard chemotherapy regimens and clinical outcomes that now approach those in the general population.

         Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a treatment option for selected patients with relapsed HIV-related non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphoma demonstrating sensitivity to second-line chemotherapy. The role of allogeneic HCT in HIV-related lymphoma is less clear given the paucity of published data. Otherwise, chemotherapy protocols that contain agents that are not cross-resistant with those previously administered can be considered. Ideally, if available, the patient should be referred for an investigational treatment protocol. (See
         <a class="local">
