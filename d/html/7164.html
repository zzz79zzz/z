The binding of oxygen to hemoglobin is cooperative, which means that binding of the first molecule(s) of oxygen increases the affinity for binding of subsequent molecule(s). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7072.html" rel="external">"Structure and function of normal hemoglobins", section on 'Cooperativity'</a>.)</p><p>Deoxygenated hemoglobin (referred to as the "tense" [T] form) has a lower affinity for ligands such as oxygen gas than oxygenated hemoglobin (referred to as the "relaxed" [R] form). Cooperative binding and oxygen affinity are discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7072.html" rel="external">"Structure and function of normal hemoglobins", section on 'Oxygen affinity'</a>.)</p><p>Cooperative binding enables the hemoglobin molecule to bind oxygen tightly in the high-oxygen environment of the lungs and release it in the tissues, where the oxygen content is lower. This is illustrated by the sigmoidal curve of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81216" href="/d/graphic/81216.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). </p><p>The p50 is the partial pressure of oxygen at which the hemoglobin molecule is half-saturated with oxygen.

Binding to hemoglobin takes place in the central cavity between the two beta chains where the negative charges of 2,3-BPG are neutralized by the beta globin chain amino terminus, beta2 histidine, beta82 lysine, and beta143 histidine.

Family studies revealed 15 additional affected family members. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Arg92 is a conserved amino acid that stabilizes the R state (relaxed, high affinity state) at the alpha1beta2 area of contact, making T (tense state) contacts less favored. Oxygen affinity studies revealed a whole blood p50 of 19 mmHg (normal: 26 mmHg) with a normal Bohr effect (increase in oxygen affinity with elevations in pH) and normal 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) binding. The variant produces mild erythrocytosis. On alkaline hemoglobin electrophoresis, it represents approximately 20 percent of the hemolysate and migrates rapidly on the gel.

Oxygen binding studies have revealed a decrease in p50, normal binding to 2,3-BPG, and decreased cooperativity. Functional studies suggest a destabilized T state that switches to R upon ligand binding. The hemoglobin represents 20 percent of the hemolysate and migrates close to HbF (at pH 8.6) on alkaline electrophoresis. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Hb Tarrant and Hb Fukutomi</strong> – Two other high oxygen affinity alpha globin variants, Hb Tarrant (<em>HBA</em> asp126asn) and Hb Fukutomi (<em>HBA</em> asp126val), affect the same amino acid residue. Hb Tarrant was described in a homozygote from a family in which both parents were heterozygotes. The homozygote had 50 percent Hb Tarrant, a p50 of 9 mmHg, and a hemoglobin concentration of almost 19 g/dL. The heterozygous father with 25 percent Hb Tarrant and a p50 of 14 mmHg had a similar hemoglobin level, whereas other heterozygotes have had more modest erythrocytosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong><em>HBB</em></strong><strong> variants </strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Hb Crete</strong> – Hb Crete (<em>HBB</em> ala129pro) alters the alpha1beta1 area of contact and disrupts the overall conformation of hemoglobin, favoring the R state. Proline, the new amino acid formed in this mutation, is not accommodated in the helix and disturbs the H helix while also having a longer range effect on nearby residues in the alpha1beta1 interface, perturbing this area of subunit contact. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The initial case report described an individual with a syndrome of erythrocytosis, hemolysis, splenomegaly, abnormal red cell morphology and marked erythroid hyperplasia [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. The individual was found to be a compound heterozygote for Hb Crete and delta-beta-thalassemia, with 67 percent Hb Crete and 30 percent fetal hemoglobin (HbF; the delta-beta thalassemia deletion prevents the synthesis of any normal adult hemoglobin [HbA]). The red cells had a low p50, moderately decreased cooperativity, and a normal Bohr effect. Hb Crete is also mildly unstable, which likely accounts for hemolysis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7086.html" rel="external">"Unstable hemoglobin variants", section on 'Hemolytic anemia'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Coincident thalassemia and the resulting increase in HbF likely accentuated erythrocytosis; a family member who was heterozygous for Hb Crete and did not have thalassemia had a relatively more normal p50 and did not have significant erythrocytosis.

Hb Heathrow (<em>HBB</em> phe103leu) is an electrophoretically silent variant with moderately high oxygen affinity and erythrocytosis [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]. This variant affects a conserved residue that guards the entrance to the heme pocket.

(See <a class="local">'Hemoglobin variants that can affect oxygen affinity'</a> above.)</p><p>Alterations in critical molecular regions involved in the R—&gt;T state transition can produce low oxygen affinity by favoring T state stabilization or R state destabilization. Asparagine 102 is a highly conserved residue that participates in the only hydrogen bond between asn102 and asp94 across the alpha1beta2 interface in oxyhemoglobin; this bond is broken when the hemoglobin molecule assumes the T state. Three low oxygen affinity beta globin variants have been described at this position, all of which cause cyanosis:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hb Beth Israel</strong> – Hb Beth Israel (<em>HBB</em> asn102ser) has the greatest decrease in oxygen affinity and the most intense cyanosis of the asparagine 102 variants [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Hb Beth Israel was found in a patient with cyanosis of the lips, fingers, and nail beds [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. He had been severely disciplined early in life for constantly having "dirty hands," although the abnormal skin color was not noticeable to the patient or his parents. Cyanosis was detected by an observant surgeon about to perform a hernia repair. The whole blood p50 was markedly elevated at 88 mmHg, and arterial blood was only 63 percent saturated at a normal pO<sub>2</sub> of 97 mmHg. The hemolysate also had a low oxygen affinity, a normal Bohr effect, and elevated erythrocyte 2,3-BPG.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hb Kansas</strong> – Hb Kansas (<em>HBB</em> asn102thr) has an intermediate oxygen affinity and intermediate cyanosis [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>]. It was the first low affinity hemoglobin described and is the best studied; it causes a whole blood p50 of approximately 70 mmHg (normal 27 mmHg), decreased cooperativity, and a normal Bohr effect. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Examination of deoxygenated Hb Kansas by difference Fourier X-ray diffraction analysis at 5.5 Å resolution has shown that the new threonine residue is incapable of forming this bond. Thus, low oxygen affinity results from destabilization of the R conformer. In addition, other structural changes, which occur at the alpha1beta2 interface, account for the increased tendency of Hb Kansas to dissociate into dimers. This variant is the mirror image, pathogenetically, of Hb Chesapeake.

The hemoglobin accounted for 38 percent of the hemolysate and migrates similar to HbF on electrophoresis. The p50 was 52 mmHg and the oxygen saturation of arterial blood was 81 percent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy demonstrated that the quaternary structure of the liganded conformer was different from the R state but also different from the T state. This special quaternary structure also differed from Hb Kansas, which had an NMR spectrum similar to the T state quaternary structure in the liganded molecule. The tertiary conformation around the heme of both globin chains was altered, suggesting a long range interaction involving leucine 141.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hb Bruxelles</strong> – Hb Bruxelles (<em>HBB</em> phe42del) was first described in an individual with cyanosis and severe hemolytic anemia from the age of four years, requiring transfusion one time. Later in life, her hemoglobin concentration stabilized at 10 g/dL; the reasons for the change in phenotype were not well understood. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The variant involves a deletion of the most conserved amino acid residue of hemoglobin.
