         In the majority of normal children, the appendix is located in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, where it arises from the posteromedial aspect of the cecum and inferior to ileocecal junction. The tip of the appendix has a variable location but is retrocecal in over 60 percent of patients [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. It is typically 6 to 10 cm in length.
        </p>
        <p>
         The appendix may lie in the upper abdomen or on the left side in children with congenital abnormalities of intestinal position (eg, uncorrected malrotation), situs inversus totalis, and after repair of diaphragmatic hernia, gastroschisis, and omphalocele [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Some anatomic features of the appendix may play a role in the incidence and presentation of appendicitis throughout childhood. These include the following [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]:

         In the first year of life, the appendix is funnel-shaped, perhaps making it less likely to become obstructed.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         Lymphoid follicles are interspersed in the colonic epithelium that lines the appendix and may obstruct it. These follicles reach their maximal size during adolescence, the age group in which the peak incidence of appendicitis occurs.

         The omentum is very thin and underdeveloped in young children and often cannot contain purulent material, perhaps accounting, in part, for the diffuse peritonitis that typically follows perforation in young children.

          PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
         </span>
         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Most commonly, appendicitis is caused by nonspecific obstruction of the appendiceal lumen [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. Fecal material, undigested food, other foreign material, an enlarged lymphoid follicle in the epithelial lining, parasites, or a bend or twist of the organ itself may all be responsible. The obstruction causes colic, which in turn produces the poorly localized periumbilical abdominal pain typical of early appendicitis. It also causes the appendiceal lumen to dilate and its wall to thicken.
        </p>
        <p>
         Intraluminal bacterial overgrowth follows appendiceal obstruction with breakdown of the mucosal barrier, bacterial invasion of the wall, inflammation, ischemia, and gangrene, eventually leading to perforation [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. The bacteria include the usual fecal flora, mainly aerobic and anaerobic Gram negative rods. The most common are
         <em>
          Escherichia coli
         </em>
         , Peptostreptococcus species,
         <em>
          Bacteroides fragilis
         </em>
         , and Pseudomonas species [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Inflammation of the wall of the appendix causes peritonitis, which produces localized abdominal pain and tenderness, the cardinal clinical signs of acute appendicitis [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Perforation releases bacteria into the peritoneal cavity. Perforation occurs rarely in the first 12 hours of symptoms but is more likely with time thereafter, becoming common after 72 hours. Generalized peritonitis develops if the infection is not contained by bowel loops and omentum.
        </p>
        <p>
         Less commonly, enteric pathogens may directly infect the appendix or cause localized appendiceal lymphoid hyperplasia with obstruction [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Specific organisms include adenovirus (in combination with intussusception) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ], rubeola virus (measles) [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ], Epstein-Barr virus [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ],
         <em>
          Actinomyces israeli
         </em>
         (Actinomycosis) [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ],
         <em>
          Enterobius vermicularis
         </em>
         (pinworms) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ], and
         <em>
          Ascaris lumbricoides
         </em>
         (roundworms) [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Rarely, pediatric appendicitis arises from other conditions such as Crohn disease (granulomatous inflammation of the appendix) [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ], appendiceal carcinoid tumor [

         <a href="#rid15">
          15

         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ], or cystic fibrosis (inspissated mucous obstruction of the appendiceal lumen). (See

         Appendicitis is the most common indication for emergency abdominal surgery in childhood and is diagnosed in 1 to 8 percent of children evaluated urgently for abdominal pain [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,18
         </a>
         ]. The incidence increases from an annual rate of one to six per 10,000 children between birth and four years of age to 19 to 28 per 10,000 children younger than 14 years [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19-21
         </a>
         ]. It presents most frequently in the second decade of life. Fewer than 5 percent of patients diagnosed with appendicitis are five years of age or less [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. Boys are more commonly affected than girls (lifetime risk 9 and 7 percent, respectively).
        </p>
        <p>
         Advanced disease is common in children younger than six years of age, occurring in up to 57 percent of cases [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. This finding is explained, at least in part, by the frequency of nonspecific symptoms in young children with appendicitis, which leads to a delay in the diagnosis. It is also likely that the disease progresses more rapidly in young children. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical manifestations'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Traditionally, success in achieving the goal of timely and accurate diagnosis for appendicitis has been reflected, in part, by the balance between perforation rates and rates of negative appendectomy. Perforation correlates strongly with duration of symptoms [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. The reported rates of perforation vary significantly by age as follows:

         ]

         </a>
         ]

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Adolescents (&gt;12 years) – 10 to 20 percent [

         </a>
         ]
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Similarly, negative appendectomy rates vary by age but are also impacted by sex. The highest rates are associated with age &lt;5 years and female sex [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34,35
         </a>
         ]. A normal white blood cell count is also associated with an increased negative appendectomy rate [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. Thus, the accurate diagnosis of appendicitis is particularly challenging in children less than five years of age and adolescent females.

Percussion tenderness can also effectively reveal underlying peritonitis. It is elicited in a gentler manner compared with rebound tenderness by tapping or percussing over an area of tenderness. Should this very superficial stimulus produce pain, then peritonitis should be suspected.

          3,36
         </a>
         ]. The absence of the classic signs of appendicitis should not cause the clinician to exclude the diagnosis of appendicitis. However, when present in children 3 to 12 years of age, these signs have high specificity for acute appendicitis (86 to 98 percent, depending upon age) [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Although this classic pattern of clinical findings does occur in school-age children and adolescents, it is less common overall in pediatric patients with appendicitis than in adults. (See
         <a class="local">
          'School-age (5 to 12 years)'
         </a>
         below and

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In infants and young children, this pattern may not occur at all, perhaps because of differences in the pathophysiology of the disease and in the child's ability to relate information regarding signs and symptoms. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Neonates (0 to 30 days)'
         </a>

        <p>
         Furthermore, among children, the absence of classic clinical features of appendicitis (such as fever, anorexia, migration of pain to the right lower quadrant, and rebound tenderness) are neither sensitive nor specific for excluding appendicitis, especially in younger patients [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. This was demonstrated in a prospective series describing children evaluated in an emergency department (ED) for suspected appendicitis in whom the following features were noted among the patients with appendicitis [

         Appendicitis is uncommon in infants and pre-school children. Fever and diffuse abdominal tenderness with rebound or guarding are the predominant physical findings although irritability, grunting respirations, difficulty with or refusal to ambulate, and right hip complaints may also be present. Localized right lower quadrant tenderness occurs in less than 50 percent of patients. The high frequency of rebound or diffuse tenderness and guarding reflects the high prevalence of perforation and peritonitis in this age group.
        </p>
        <p>
         Typical findings on history are nonspecific such as fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain, all of which can also occur with other surgical diagnoses, such as intussusception. Diarrhea is also relatively common making appendicitis difficult to differentiate from acute gastroenteritis, a much more common condition in these patients [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27,28,30
         </a>
         ]. It is thought that extensive inflammatory changes on the rectosigmoid or pressure from surrounding pelvic infection may explain diarrhea as part of the presenting symptoms in perforated disease. (See

         Appendicitis is more frequent in this age group when compared with younger children. Abdominal pain and vomiting are commonly present, although the typical migration of periumbilical pain to the right lower quadrant may not occur. On physical examination, right lower quadrant tenderness is noted in the majority of patients. Involuntary guarding and rebound tenderness indicate perforation. Other prominent symptoms include fever, anorexia, and pain with movement [

         The clinical features of appendicitis in this age group are similar to those in adults and often include the classic findings of fever, anorexia, periumbilical abdominal pain that migrates to the right lower quadrant, and vomiting. Involuntary guarding and rebound tenderness are present more often with perforation. The onset of pain typically occurs before vomiting, and is a sensitive indicator of appendicitis. (See

         Despite its limitations, a careful abdominal examination is key to the diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis. A reliable examination requires that the child be quiet and cooperative. To accomplish this, the clinician needs to gain the trust of the child, which often requires significant patience. It is also helpful to spend time taking the history, sitting down if possible, and to examine the abdomen before more invasive portions of the examination, such as looking in the ears or pharynx [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Similarly, the child can be initially examined in the position in which they are most comfortable, such as a caretaker's lap, prior to a standard evaluation.
        </p>
        <p>
         In some patients, the degree of pain makes physical examination of the abdomen challenging. We recommend that children with suspected appendicitis receive analgesia commensurate with the degree of pain, including intravenous opioid medications if necessary. In the past, analgesia for patients with appendicitis was discouraged in the mistaken belief that pain control would mask symptoms and cause clinicians to miss definitive signs of disease. However, trials in children indicate that diagnosis of appendicitis is not significantly impacted when they receive intravenous opioid medications for pain control as follows:

         decrease pain more than placebo in this study.

        <p>
         Although both of these studies may not have had enough patients to truly identify significant differences in the impact of analgesia on the diagnosis of appendicitis, neither trial detected significant adverse effects on surgical management of these patients [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. Thus, they support prompt treatment of abdominal pain in school-aged children and older with suspected appendicitis.
        </p>
        <p>
         No studies have evaluated the use of analgesia in patients younger than five years of age undergoing examination for appendicitis. However, our experience suggests that infants and young children with significant abdominal pain warrant appropriate analgesia.
        </p>
        <p>
         The American Academy of Pediatrics has endorsed and subsequently reaffirmed a statement in favor of the use of early analgesics in patients presenting with suspected acute appendicitis to emergency medical systems [
         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>
         ]. Analgesics make the physical exam and diagnostic imaging more comfortable for children, which facilitates a prompt diagnosis.

         Local tenderness with some rigidity of the abdominal wall at or near McBurney's point (located approximately one-third of the distance along a line from the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus) is the most reliable clinical sign of acute appendicitis. This finding may be less obvious when the appendix is in the retrocecal, retroileal, or pelvic position.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, abdominal examination findings of appendicitis in children vary significantly by age and frequently fall outside of the classic disease presentation. (See

         Abdominal pain can also be elicited by asking the child to cough or to hop on one foot. Patients whose appendix is in the retrocecal, retroileal, or pelvic position may have less obvious discomfort with these maneuvers.

         Although rebound tenderness is also a reliable sign of peritoneal irritation, many pediatric surgeons feel that testing for it is often unnecessary, since it is painful in children who have appendicitis and may be falsely positive in those who do not.

         Based upon a systematic review of five articles, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing acute appendicitis using digital rectal examination are low in both adults and children (44 to 55 percent and 44 to 75 percent, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46

         <a href="#rid47">
          47

         The clinician should also obtain a pregnancy test (urine beta-human chorionic gonadotropin) in postmenarchal females to aid in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy and to guide imaging decisions in patients who have a moderate to high risk of appendicitis.

        <p>
         Although not widely available, addition of procalcitonin (PCT) and calprotectin (CP) to the above studies may significantly improve diagnostic discrimination. As an example, in a single-center, prospective observational study of 185 children presenting to the ED with abdominal pain (prevalence of appendicitis 48 percent), a PCT &lt;0.1 ng/mL and CP &lt;0.5 ng/mL (expressed as a negative commercial fluoroimmunoassay result), when combined with ANC &lt;7500 was able to identify children without appendicitis with 100 percent sensitivity (95% CI 96 to 100 percent) and a negative predictive value of 100 percent (95% CI 90 to 100 percent) [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. However, further study in larger and more diverse populations is needed before PCT and CP can be routinely recommended in the laboratory evaluation of pediatric appendicitis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Laboratory tests should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be used in isolation to make or exclude the diagnosis of appendicitis. However, in some children, a combination of characteristic clinical findings and elevations in WBC, ANC, or CRP is sufficient to diagnose appendicitis [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49
         </a>
         ]. Based upon observational studies, up to 50 percent of children with appendicitis can undergo surgery using clinical and laboratory findings and can safely avoid diagnostic imaging [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50-52
         </a>
         ]. Negative appendectomy rates of 5 to 6 percent have been reported with this approach.
        </p>
        <p>
         Similarly, normal values for WBC or ANC in children undergoing evaluation for appendicitis have been used to predict a low risk of appendicitis as a component of validated clinical scoring systems [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53-56
         </a>
         ]. (See

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Elevations in the peripheral WBC count, ANC, and CRP levels have been noted in children with appendicitis. However, these findings are variable and nonspecific as indicated by the following evidence:

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">

         <strong>
          WBC and ANC
         </strong>
         – Either the WBC or the ANC is elevated in up to 96 percent of children with appendicitis [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. This finding, however, is nonspecific because many other diseases that mimic appendicitis (eg, streptococcal pharyngitis, pneumonia, pelvic inflammatory disease, or gastroenteritis) also cause such elevations [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,41,57,58
         </a>
         ]. Thus, the ability of these tests to discriminate appendicitis from other causes is limited. As an example, in an observational study of 280 children (age 3 to 18 years) evaluated for appendicitis who had symptoms less than 24 hours, a WBC &gt;14,600/mm
         <sup>
          3
         </sup>
         and an ANC &gt;11,000/mm
         <sup>
          3
         </sup>
         had sensitivities of 68 and 69 percent, respectively and specificities of 96 and 75 percent, respectively [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59
         </a>
         ]. In another observational report describing 772 children (1 to 19 years of age) with nontraumatic abdominal pain who were evaluated in an ED, those patients with either increased WBC (greater than upper limit of normal for age) or elevated neutrophil count (&gt;80 percent mature or immature neutrophils), had an overall sensitivity of 79 percent and specificity of 80 percent [

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         By contrast, in children undergoing appendectomy, a normal WBC or ANC prior to surgery is associated with a negative appendectomy.

         <a href="#rid3">
          3,41,59
         </a>

         <a href="#rid59">
          59,62
         </a>
         ]. Small observational studies also suggest that an elevated CRP may be more helpful in identifying both a gangrenous appendix (&gt;1 mg/dL [10 mg/L] in 83 percent of patients) and appendiceal perforation (sensitivity and specificity for perforation 76 and 82 percent, respectively at a CRP &gt;5 mg/dL [50 mg/L]) [

          62,63

          64

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Among patients with appendicitis, elevation in PCT does suggest perforation.

         A urinalysis is usually performed in children with suspected appendicitis to identify alternative conditions such as a UTI or nephrolithiasis. However, between 7 and 25 percent of patients with appendicitis may have pyuria [

         Acute appendicitis is a clinical diagnosis and should be considered in all children with a history of abdominal pain and abdominal tenderness on physical examination. The diagnosis may be straightforward when the classic findings associated with appendicitis are present. However, the variations in presentation by age and sex can pose a significant challenge. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical manifestations'

        </p>
        <p>
         In some children with abdominal pain a clear alternative diagnosis is present (eg, streptococcal pharyngitis, pneumonia, pelvic inflammatory disease). These patients should receive specific treatment for the underlying condition rather than undergoing a diagnostic evaluation for appendicitis. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         For patients without a clear etiology for their abdominal pain in whom appendicitis is suspected, we suggest a diagnostic approach guided by the clinical impression of risk (low, moderate, or high) derived from history, physical examination, and selected laboratory studies as follows  (

         <strong>
          Low risk
         </strong>
         – These patients have few signs or symptoms of appendicitis (eg, afebrile, no history of vomiting or anorexia, minimal diffuse abdominal tenderness with a soft abdomen on palpation, or no right lower quadrant tenderness). If obtained, white blood cell (WBC) count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and C-reactive protein (CRP) are typically normal.

         Patients without an obvious alternative diagnosis may still have appendicitis, especially if signs or symptoms are of a short duration (&lt;24 hours). For example, up to 2 percent of patients categorized as low risk by the PAS and up to 7 percent of patients identified as low risk by the refined Low-Risk Appendicitis Rule ultimately have appendicitis [

         Several clinical scoring systems have been devised for the diagnosis of appendicitis [

         ]. Among these, the Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS)  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ), the refined Low-Risk Appendicitis Score, the Alvarado (or MANTRELS) score, and the Pediatric Appendicitis Risk Calculator (pARC) have been prospectively studied in children [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,71-75
         </a>
         ]. The utility of these scores lies in their ability to categorize patients into groups that are at low, moderate, and high risk of appendicitis. However, they have limited ability to identify patients who warrant appendectomy. Furthermore, no studies have evaluated the ability of such scoring systems to improve diagnostic outcomes (ie, reduction in perforation and/or negative appendectomy rate) when compared with assessment by experienced clinicians. Nevertheless, these scores may have utility in identifying children who may benefit from diagnostic imaging and/or surgical consultation by providing a standard approach. The specific components of these scores are provided below.
        </p>
        <p>
         Interobserver reliability of historical and physical examination findings commonly used in these scores shows significant variation. As an example, in a prospective multicenter study of 811 children (age 3 to 18 years) with possible appendicitis who underwent independent evaluations by clinicians with variable experience and training, agreement beyond chance for items commonly used in clinical scores was high only for the history of emesis and was moderate for the following clinical features [

By contrast, a systematic review of six prospective studies with a total of 2170 patients found that a cutoff of &lt;4 for low risk of disease was not sufficiently accurate for excluding appendicitis although the analysis showed significant heterogeneity among the pooled studies and, for most studies, a relatively high prevalence of appendicitis [

In a systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of the Alvarado score, which included 1075 children, a score of ≥5 for admission and ≥7 for surgery had pooled sensitivities of 99 percent and 76 percent among pediatric patients, respectively [
         <a href="#rid81">
          81
         </a>
         ]. However, the Alvarado score had a significant tendency to exaggerate the probability of appendicitis in intermediate (score 5 or 6) and high (score 7 to 10) risk children. Furthermore, analysis suggested that the diagnostic accuracy of the score was inconsistent in children. In a separate systematic review of six prospective studies (1589 patients), no Alvarado score had an acceptable performance for ruling in appendicitis [
         <a href="#rid77">
          77
         </a>
         ]. For example, using a score of ≥9 for the performance of surgery in children with a 40 percent pretest probability of appendicitis would have resulted in a 19 percent frequency of negative appendectomy [
         <a href="#rid78">
          78
         </a>
         ]. On the other hand, this review also found that an Alvarado score &lt;5 in children with a pretest probability for appendicitis up to 40 percent reduced the likelihood of appendicitis to &lt;3 percent and which for some clinicians would permit the safe discharge of such patients to home observation. However, this risk of appendicitis is still greater than what is found for a Pediatric Appendicitis Score of 2 to 3. (See

         The pARC has been derived and validated using prospectively collected clinical findings from almost 4,000 children evaluated for abdominal pain at a single children’s hospital emergency department during three different time periods [

Using a risk score based upon patient age, sex, duration of pain, migration of pain to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), maximal tenderness in the RLQ, abdominal guarding, and absolute neutrophil count, the pARC predicted the risk for appendicitis with high discrimination (AUC 0.85) and outperformed the PAS in a validation cohort of almost 1500 children. During validation in over 2000 children with abdominal pain evaluated in 11 community emergency departments, the pARC score had higher discrimination for appendicitis than the PAS (AUC 0.89 versus 0.80, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid82">

         Use of the pARC requires sophisticated calculations that must be programmed and integrated into an electronic health record, which may be a barrier to implementation in some settings. Furthermore, it is not clear that the pARC score reduces resource utilization (eg, imaging or surgical consultation) when compared with the PAS.

         For children who do not have a typical presentation for appendicitis or in whom appendicitis cannot be excluded clinically, imaging can be helpful to establish or exclude the diagnosis. Ultrasonography and CT, separately or in combination, are the modalities used most frequently; although evidence suggests that MRI instead of CT can provide similar diagnostic accuracy in a timely manner without radiation exposure.

         Chronic appendicitis refers to the pathologic finding of chronic inflammation or fibrosis of the appendix found in a subset of patients undergoing appendectomy. Chronic appendicitis is a rare finding in children. These patients are clinically characterized by prolonged (&gt;7 days) right lower quadrant pain that may be intermittent and a normal WBC count. Most patients have resolution of pain with appendectomy. Crohn disease is a consideration in patients who have persistent pain after surgery.

         Recurrent appendicitis can occur but is also rare in children; such cases may be caused by a retained foreign body (eg, fecalith) in the lumen of the appendix. Stump appendicitis is a form of recurrent appendicitis that is related to incomplete appendectomy that leaves an excessively long stump after open or laparoscopic surgery. (See

The character of the pain may be sharp, stabbing, colicky, or crampy, and may radiate to the flank, back, or groin. Infants with ovarian torsion present with feeding intolerance, vomiting, abdominal distension, and fussiness or irritability. Most infants have previously diagnosed ovarian cysts on prenatal ultrasounds. Salvage of the ovary is often not possible but is maximized by expeditious surgery.

          Immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgAV; Henoch-Schönlein purpura [HSP])

          Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)

         – Although PID usually causes diffuse lower abdominal pain, focal right lower quadrant abdominal pain does occur. Patients may often be febrile. Findings on pelvic bimanual examination of a purulent endocervical discharge and/or acute cervical motion and adnexal tenderness distinguish PID from appendicitis. (See

         – Ovarian cysts commonly occur in postmenarchal adolescent females and may cause right lower quadrant pain, which can be severe if the cyst has ruptured. Findings of anorexia and vomiting are less common unless ovarian torsion has occurred. Plain and Doppler ultrasounds of the pelvis and abdomen that demonstrate an ovarian cyst and a normal appendix are diagnostic. (See

          Mittelschmerz

         – This ovulatory event causes recurrent midcycle pain in females with regular ovulatory cycles. This pain is caused by normal follicular enlargement just prior to ovulation or to normal follicular bleeding at ovulation. The pain is typically mild and unilateral; it occurs midway between menstrual periods and lasts for a few hours to a couple of days. The onset of pain midcycle and a history of recurrence help to differentiate mittelschmerz from appendicitis. (See

          Pneumonia
         </strong>
         – An infiltrate in the lower lobes of the lungs may irritate the diaphragm and cause abdominal pain that can mimic findings of appendicitis in children. Cough, fever, tachypnea, rales on auscultation, and/or decreased oxygen saturation help to distinguish pneumonia from appendicitis. In many children, pneumonia can be diagnosed based upon clinical findings alone. The presence of infiltrates on chest radiograph, which may be subtle on presentation, confirms the diagnosis of pneumonia in children with compatible clinical findings. However, pneumonia can be difficult to identify when respiratory signs and symptoms are subtle [
         <a href="#rid88">
          88

         ]. Because of the overlap in clinical presentation, some children with suspected appendicitis may warrant chest radiographs and abdominal imaging. (See

          Gastroenteritis

         – Gastroenteritis occurs commonly in children younger than two years. In resource-rich countries, a viral etiology is most common, and the presence and quantity of diarrhea can be variable. Diarrhea may also occur in children with appendicitis, especially patients younger than five years of age. In most instances, children with gastroenteritis have diffuse abdominal tenderness without guarding or rebound tenderness. The diagnosis of gastroenteritis should be made cautiously in children with abdominal pain and vomiting who do not have diarrhea. In one retrospective review of cases of missed appendicitis, 42 percent of children were initially diagnosed with gastroenteritis [

          89,90

         Children who have a low risk for appendicitis based upon the clinical examination and, when indicated, laboratory studies may be managed without imaging at the initial evaluation. These patients warrant clear instructions regarding signs of appendicitis that should prompt reevaluation, or, if right lower quadrant pain or tenderness is present, assured reevaluation within 12 to 24 hours.

         Children with atypical or equivocal clinical findings of appendicitis suggesting a moderate likelihood for appendicitis warrant diagnostic imaging. Ultrasonography is the recommended initial imaging test.
