         Worries and fears are a natural and adaptive part of childhood development and important for good coping and survival. Symptoms meet the criteria for a clinical anxiety disorder when the concerns are unexpected given the child’s developmental level, persistent in the face of reassurance and support, and thus considered excessive. Triggers for anxiety disorders are typically normal development tasks or activities (eg, normative separation tasks such as going to bed alone or going to school; normative social interactions such as raising ones hand in class or ordering food in a restaurant; dealing with everyday uncertainties such as worrying about getting sick if another child is ill). All of these can cause notable distress or impairment in day-to-day functioning.
        </p>
        <p>
         Anxiety disorders are the most common childhood-onset psychiatric disorders. Anxiety disorders in children (up to 12 years old) and adolescents (13 to 18 years old) are associated with educational underachievement and co-occurring psychiatric conditions, as well as functional impairments that can extend into adulthood.
        </p>

         This topic describes the assessment and diagnosis of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and course of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents are discussed separately. Pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents are discussed separately. (See

         We agree with the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation for screening all children and adolescents (age 8 to 18 years) for the presence of an anxiety disorder [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Our preference is to use the Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Instruments for screening or assessment'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Given the high rates of anxiety in youth, screening for anxiety whether or not the individual is manifesting signs or has symptoms of an anxiety disorder may have value in identification, early intervention, and the prevention of anxiety-related morbidity. Prevalence estimates are reported separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15926.html" rel="external">
          "Anxiety disorders in children and adolescents: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and course", section on 'Epidemiology'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         While no direct evidence reports benefits or harms of screening for anxiety on health outcomes, screening and early treatment may lead to a benefit on treatment outcomes such as response and disease remission [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. For example, in the USPSTF review, psychotherapy was associated with improvement in anxiety outcomes, including treatment response (Clinical Global Impression-Improvement score 1 or 2; relative risk 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-3.1) as compared with usual care or waitlist; pharmacotherapy was associated similar benefit. However, the reported sensitivity and specificity of current screening tools are somewhat variable [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Instruments for screening or assessment'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Further discussion of the benefits of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for specific anxiety disorders is discussed elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15928.html" rel="external">
          "Pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         After a child screens positive for an anxiety disorder, a full diagnostic assessment is necessary. For screening completed in the primary care or school setting, further assessment may be done by the pediatric or school-based mental health provider or via referral to a mental health provider. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Instruments for screening or assessment'
         </a>

         Psychiatric assessment for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents is performed through a face-to-face or virtual (via telehealth platform) diagnostic interview with the child and parent/caregiver.

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         </span>
         During the interview, information about the child’s symptoms, their frequency, duration, severity, and degree of distress or interference is collected. It is important to ask about the child’s specific thoughts and triggers underlying a particular anxiety disorder or avoidance behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
         A traditional evaluation includes questions pertaining to developmental history, medical history, and family psychiatric history as part of the diagnostic interview. We also include a social history including questions about the family and peer relationships, school functioning, preferred recreational activities, substance use and sexual history if age appropriate. For pediatric providers, a HEADSS (

         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Collateral information from school personnel may be valuable, particularly for presentations that pose difficult differential diagnostic questions (eg, is anxiety causing inattention or is inattention causing predictable school performance worry). Teachers can describe how children respond to separation, interact with their peers, and perform under academic pressures.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some children (eg, those with social anxiety disorder and separation anxiety disorder) may have difficulty participating in the psychiatric assessment. It may be helpful to spend some time working with the parent to identify strategies to engage the child.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is not uncommon for parents/caregivers and children to differ in their reports on anxiety and other psychiatric symptoms [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. Parents/caregivers may not be fully aware of what their child is experiencing or have accommodated anxiety symptoms and thus under report. Parents/caregivers may also overstate their child’s symptoms [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Children may not endorse symptoms due to embarrassment, oppositionality, or a wish to give a desirable response. Some children or adolescents may feel more comfortable endorsing symptoms of anxiety and related impairment in a questionnaire rather than in an interview. Anxiety disorder symptoms are triggered so children may also display symptoms in some contexts but not others, contributing to differing reports from informants [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. A multi-informant approach may be useful when there are differences in perspectives and reporting.

         We use clinician-assessment instruments and child/caregiver self-report instruments to screen for the presence, type, and severity of anxiety symptoms. Although each of these measures has their merits, we prefer the SCARED for clinical practice because it provides subscales related to different anxiety disorders, shows sensitivity to treatment effects, has a short five-item screening form, and is in the public domain. While these tools cannot be used alone to diagnose an anxiety disorder, they can be useful for screening and for monitoring the severity of symptoms over time. The SCARED is

         The SCARED is a parent/caregiver and child self-report instrument that assesses clinical symptoms of anxiety in children. Advantages to the SCARED for clinical practice include no cost for use and short (five-item) version for screening purposes. The SCARED discriminates anxiety from other conditions, including depression, and is sensitive to treatment effects. Clinical cut-offs on the SCARED have been established as a tool for clinicians or researchers to determine treatment response and symptom remission [

         The relationship between somatic symptoms and anxiety disorders is complex. Some medical illnesses are often comorbid with anxiety (eg, migraines, gastrointestinal distress, and some thyroid diseases). Other conditions, such as irritable bowel disease or other thyroid conditions may appear to be related to anxiety, when in fact there is a specific physical cause that can be addressed to improve symptoms. Anxiety disorders can also cause significant physical symptoms and discomfort, which will resolve with appropriate treatment of the anxiety disorder.
