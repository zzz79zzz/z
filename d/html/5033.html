         Complications of prematurity are the underlying reasons for the higher rate of infant mortality and morbidity in preterm infants compared with full-term infants. The risk of complications increases with decreasing gestational age. In preterm survivors, there is a high rate of long-term neurodevelopment impairment (NDI) and chronic health problems. These chronic medical and neurodevelopmental complications often require additional healthcare and educational services, which add to the overall economic cost of caring for the preterm infant.

         As discussed above, preterm survivors are at increased risk for chronic medical and neurodevelopmental complications, which often require additional healthcare and educational services. As the number of survivors of preterm birth increase and reach school age, it is imperative that their health and educational needs are identified and resources are committed to address their needs.

         – Although growth impairment is most often observed in children who were EPT, a subset of survivors by school age become overweight or obese. In a report from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Network SUPPORT Neuroimaging and Neurodevelopmental Outcomes study, 22 percent of 388 children by six and seven years of age had a body mass index (BMI) of ≥85

In addition, preterm women, but not men, were at increased risk of having preterm offspring.

          Importance

         – Individuals who were born preterm are at increased risk of experiencing long-term health problems compared with those born at term. These health problems contribute to the increased mortality risk in this population. The risk of complications increases with decreasing gestational age (GA). Infants who are extremely preterm (EPT, GA &lt;28 weeks) are at highest risk for long-term morbidity.

          Impact on adult health
         </strong>
         – Prematurity appears to have long-term effects upon adult health. Preterm adults compared with those born at term appear to have increased risk of insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease (hypertension, heart failure), infertility, and CKD. (See
