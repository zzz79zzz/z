Immunologic abnormalities, especially the production of a number of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), are a prominent feature of the disease.</p><p>Patients present with variable clinical features ranging from mild joint and skin involvement to life-threatening kidney, hematologic, or central nervous system involvement. The clinical heterogeneity of SLE and the lack of pathognomonic features or tests pose a diagnostic challenge for the clinician. To complicate matters, patients may present with only a few clinical features of SLE, which can resemble other autoimmune, infectious, or hematologic diseases.</p><p>The diagnosis of SLE is generally based on clinical and laboratory findings after excluding alternative diagnoses. In the absence of SLE diagnostic criteria, SLE classification criteria are often used by clinicians as guidance to help identify some of the salient clinical features when making the diagnosis. Serologic findings are important in suggesting the possibility of SLE, with some antibodies (eg, anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid [anti-dsDNA] and anti-Smith [anti-Sm]) highly associated with this condition.</p><p>The clinical manifestations and an approach to the diagnosis of SLE will be reviewed here. Separate topic reviews related to SLE in adults include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4675.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management and prognosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4669.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4666.html" rel="external">"Overview of cutaneous lupus erythematosus"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4673.html" rel="external">"Arthritis and other musculoskeletal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3056.html" rel="external">"Lupus nephritis: Diagnosis and classification"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3093.html" rel="external">"Lupus nephritis: Therapy of lupus membranous nephropathy"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3059.html" rel="external">"Lupus nephritis: Initial and subsequent therapy for focal or diffuse lupus nephritis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4670.html" rel="external">"Hematologic manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4672.html" rel="external">"Gastrointestinal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4683.html" rel="external">"Coronary artery disease in systemic lupus erythematosus"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4680.html" rel="external">"Non-coronary cardiac manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4863.html" rel="external">"Neurologic and neuropsychiatric manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4665.html" rel="external">"Manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus affecting the peripheral nervous system"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/95507.html" rel="external">"Approach to contraception in women with systemic lupus erythematosus"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4679.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy in women with systemic lupus erythematosus"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4677.html" rel="external">"Drug-induced lupus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2215760526"><span class="h1">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3990428844"><span class="h2">Major clinical features and organ involvement</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3998515455"><span class="h3">Constitutional symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, fever, and weight loss are present in most patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) at some point during the course of the disease.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fatigue</strong> – Fatigue is the most common complaint, occurring in 80 to 100 percent of patients, and can sometimes be disabling. Its presence is not clearly correlated with other measures of disease activity and is more frequently associated with depression, sleep disturbances, and concomitant fibromyalgia [<a href="#rid1">1-5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fever</strong> – Fever can be a manifestation of active disease and is seen in over 50 percent of patients with SLE [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. However, in clinical practice, distinguishing fever associated with a lupus flare from other causes of fever, such as infection, a drug reaction, or malignancy, can be difficult. Clinically, there are no specific features that definitively distinguish fever due to SLE from fever due to other causes. The history may be helpful in determining the cause of the fever. As an example, fever in the setting of moderate or high doses of glucocorticoids should lead one to strongly suspect new infection, particularly if other signs of active disease are not present. Fever that does not respond to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9242" href="/d/drug information/9242.html" rel="external">acetaminophen</a>, and/or low to moderate doses of glucocorticoids should raise the suspicion of an infectious or drug-related etiology, since most fevers due to active SLE will remit with use of these agents [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. In addition, a low white blood cell (WBC) count in the setting of fever would be more consistent with lupus activity rather than infection. Infection should clearly be ruled out in a patient with SLE presenting with fever.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Serious infections are a major cause of morbidity among patients and should be considered in all immunocompromised SLE patients with fever. (See <a class="local">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Myalgia</strong> – Myalgia is also common among patients with SLE, whereas severe muscle weakness or myositis is relatively uncommon. Myalgia and muscle weakness are discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4673.html" rel="external">"Arthritis and other musculoskeletal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus", section on 'Muscle involvement'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Weight change</strong> – Weight changes are frequent in patients with SLE and may be related to the disease or to its treatment. Weight loss often occurs prior to the diagnosis of SLE. Unintentional weight loss may be due to decreased appetite, side effects of medications (particularly diuretics and occasionally <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8541" href="/d/drug information/8541.html" rel="external">hydroxychloroquine</a>), and gastrointestinal disease (eg, gastroesophageal reflux, abdominal pain, peptic ulcer disease, or pancreatitis) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4672.html" rel="external">"Gastrointestinal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus"</a>). Weight gain in SLE may be due to salt and water retention associated with hypoalbuminemia (eg, due to nephrotic syndrome or protein-losing enteropathy) or, alternatively, due to increased appetite associated with the use of glucocorticoids. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3084.html" rel="external">"Overview of heavy proteinuria and the nephrotic syndrome"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4672.html" rel="external">"Gastrointestinal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus", section on 'Protein-losing enteropathy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3603978309"><span class="h3">Arthritis and arthralgias</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Arthritis and arthralgias occur in over 90 percent of patients with SLE and are often one of the earliest manifestations [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Arthritis, with demonstrable inflammation, occurs in 65 to 70 percent of patients and tends to be migratory, polyarticular, and symmetrical. The arthritis is moderately painful, usually does not cause erosion, and is rarely deforming  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78325 graphicRef65248" href="/d/graphic/78325.html" rel="external">picture 1A-B</a>). However, occasionally patients with SLE also develop a deforming erosive arthritis, which is similar to that of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. The clinical characteristics and management of arthritis and arthralgias in SLE are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4673.html" rel="external">"Arthritis and other musculoskeletal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus", section on 'Joint involvement'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H429783504"><span class="h3">Mucocutaneous involvement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most patients develop skin and mucous membrane lesions at some point during the course of their disease. There is tremendous variability in the type of skin involvement in SLE. The most common lesion is a facial eruption that characterizes acute cutaneous lupus erythema (also known as "the butterfly rash") that presents as erythema in a malar distribution over the cheeks and nose (but sparing the nasolabial folds) that appears after sun exposure  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75781 graphicRef55875" href="/d/graphic/75781.html" rel="external">picture 2A-B</a>). Some patients may develop discoid lesions, which are more inflammatory and which have a tendency to scar  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75833 graphicRef64844" href="/d/graphic/75833.html" rel="external">picture 3A-B</a>). Photosensitivity is also a common theme for skin lesions associated with SLE. The various cutaneous manifestations of SLE are presented in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4666.html" rel="external">"Overview of cutaneous lupus erythematosus"</a>.)</p><p>Many patients develop oral and/or nasal ulcers, which are usually painless in contrast to herpetic chancre blisters. Nasal ulcers may lead to nasal septal perforation. Nonscarring alopecia is also observed in many SLE patients at some point during the course of their disease. Scarring alopecia can occur in patients with discoid lupus erythematosus. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4666.html" rel="external">"Overview of cutaneous lupus erythematosus", section on 'Discoid lupus erythematosus'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2618101329"><span class="h3">Cardiac involvement and vascular manifestations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A variety of cardiac and vascular abnormalities can occur in patients with SLE.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cardiac disease among patients with SLE is common and can involve the pericardium, myocardium, valves, conduction system, and coronary arteries. Pericarditis, with or without an effusion, is the most common cardiac manifestation of SLE, occurring in approximately 25 percent of patients at some point during their disease course [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Verrucous (Libman-Sacks) endocarditis is usually clinically silent, but it can produce valvular insufficiency and can serve as a source of emboli  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79709" href="/d/graphic/79709.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>). Myocarditis is uncommon but may be severe. Patients with SLE also have an increased risk of coronary artery disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4680.html" rel="external">"Non-coronary cardiac manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4683.html" rel="external">"Coronary artery disease in systemic lupus erythematosus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Neonatal lupus, which can occur in babies of women with SLE expressing anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB, can cause heart block of varying degrees that may be noted in utero and/or that may present as congenital heart block and is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6402.html" rel="external">"Neonatal lupus: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Raynaud phenomenon</strong> – Raynaud phenomenon in SLE is a vasospastic process induced by cold that occurs in up to 50 percent of patients with SLE  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66438" href="/d/graphic/66438.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Raynaud phenomenon is characterized by intermittent acral pallor followed by cyanosis and erythroderma [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Raynaud phenomenon is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7543.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Raynaud phenomenon"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Vasculitis</strong> – Estimates of the prevalence of vasculitis among SLE patients from large cohorts range from 11 to 36 percent [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. The clinical spectrum of vasculitis in the setting of SLE is broad due to the potential for inflammatory involvement of vessels of all sizes. Small vessel involvement is the most common, often manifesting as cutaneous lesions; however, medium- and large-vessel involvement have also been observed. Cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis can manifest as palpable purpura, petechiae, papulonodular lesions, livedo reticularis, panniculitis, splinter hemorrhages, and superficial ulcerations (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13769.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of adults with cutaneous lesions of vasculitis"</a>). As an example, a large series of 670 SLE patients identified vasculitis among 11 percent of patients [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Cutaneous lesions were the main clinical presentation of vasculitis, present in 89 percent of patients. The remaining 11 percent of patients with vasculitis had visceral involvement (eg, peripheral nerves, lung, pancreas, and kidney).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Other specific types of vasculitic involvement in SLE include mesenteric vasculitis, hepatic vasculitis, pancreatic vasculitis, coronary vasculitis, pulmonary vasculitis, and retinal vasculitis, as well as vasculitis of the peripheral or central nervous system. A few cases of aortitis, similar to that seen in Takayasu arteritis, have been reported [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4666.html" rel="external">"Overview of cutaneous lupus erythematosus"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4672.html" rel="external">"Gastrointestinal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus", section on 'Autoimmune hepatitis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4672.html" rel="external">"Gastrointestinal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus", section on 'Acute pancreatitis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4672.html" rel="external">"Gastrointestinal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus", section on 'Mesenteric vasculitis/ischemia'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4665.html" rel="external">"Manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus affecting the peripheral nervous system"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8232.html" rel="external">"Retinal vasculitis associated with systemic disorders and infections", section on 'Systemic immune-mediated causes'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thromboembolic disease</strong> – Thromboembolic disease can complicate SLE, particularly in the context of antiphospholipid antibodies. Although the precise mechanism is unknown, thromboembolic disease can affect both the venous and arterial circulations [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. As an example, in a large observational cohort of 554 newly diagnosed SLE patients followed for a median of 6.3 years, an arterial thrombotic event (ATE) occurred in 11 percent, a venous thrombotic event (VTE) occurred in 5 percent, and the estimated 10-year risks were 10 percent for VTE, 26 percent for ATE, and 33 percent for any thrombotic event [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Antimalarials may be protective for the development of thromboembolic disease in SLE [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2024282285"><span class="h3">Kidney involvement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Kidney involvement is clinically apparent in approximately 50 percent of SLE patients and is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Thus, periodic screening for the presence of lupus nephritis with urinalyses, quantitation of proteinuria, and estimation of the glomerular filtration rate is an important component of the ongoing management of SLE patients. Several forms of glomerulonephritis can occur, and kidney biopsy is useful to define the type and extent of kidney involvement. The clinical presentation of lupus nephritis is highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic hematuria and/or proteinuria to nephrotic syndrome and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with loss of kidney function. Some patients with lupus nephritis also have hypertension. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3056.html" rel="external">"Lupus nephritis: Diagnosis and classification"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1993754634"><span class="h3">Gastrointestinal involvement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in SLE patients, occurring in up to 40 percent of patients. The majority of gastrointestinal symptoms are caused by adverse medication reactions and viral or bacterial infections [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. SLE-related gastrointestinal abnormalities can involve almost any organ along the gastrointestinal tract and include esophagitis, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, protein-losing enteropathy, lupus hepatitis, acute pancreatitis, mesenteric vasculitis or ischemia, and peritonitis. The gastrointestinal manifestations of SLE are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4672.html" rel="external">"Gastrointestinal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1798649087"><span class="h3">Pulmonary involvement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>During the course of their disease, many patients develop symptoms secondary to pulmonary involvement of SLE. Pulmonary manifestations of SLE include pleuritis (with or without effusion), pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, shrinking lung syndrome, and alveolar hemorrhage.

At that time, it was estimated that about 5 percent of patients with SLE were ANA-negative by indirect immunofluorescence [<a href="#rid74">74</a>]. However, this negative finding occurred because sera were tested using rodent, not human, tissues as the substrate for the indirect immunofluorescence test for ANA [<a href="#rid75">75</a>]. By comparison, anti-Ro/SSA antibodies were found in many of these patients when a human cell line extract was used as the substrate for anti-Ro/SSA antibody testing.</p><p>The subsequent substitution of human epithelial type 2 (Hep-2) cells (a human cell line) for rodent tissue sections in the indirect immunofluorescence ANA assay has resulted in even fewer SLE patients with negative ANA by indirect immunofluorescence. Nevertheless, on rare occasions, the presence of anti-Ro/SSA antibodies may suggest a systemic autoimmune disease despite the presence of a negative ANA indirect immunofluorescence. As an example, in one study in Sweden, among 4025 sera tested for ANA, 64 patients with negative ANA by indirect immunofluorescence had anti-Ro/SSA antibodies [<a href="#rid76">76</a>]. Of these 64 patients, 12 had SLE and 5 had cutaneous lupus erythematosus.</p><p>The clinician should understand the technique used to detect the ANA, since this can influence the result. As an example, a negative ANA by indirect immunofluorescence is clinically useful as it dramatically decreases the likelihood of SLE. On the other hand, in a patient with a strong clinical suspicion for SLE and a negative ANA result by a solid-phase assay, the test should be repeated using indirect immunofluorescence method with Hep-2 cells, given the increased risk of a false-negative result for the initial ANA test by solid-phase assay. A detailed discussion of the methods used to detect ANA is presented separately.

Features such as swan neck deformities, ulnar deviation, and soft tissue laxity, which are observed in later stages of RA in patients with more destructive disease, can also be seen in some patients with SLE. However, an important distinguishing features is that the joint deformities in SLE are often reducible and infrequently erosive on plain radiographs. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Some extraarticular RA manifestations, including serositis, sicca symptoms, subcutaneous nodules, anemia, and fatigue, are other features that may also be observed in SLE. These features are more common in RA patients with more severe or advanced disease. Serologic abnormalities, such as the presence of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP), are more supportive of the diagnosis of RA and can help distinguish the diseases. It should be recognized that the antinuclear antibodies (ANA) may be positive in up to one-half of patients with RA. Conversely, rheumatoid factor (RF) may be present in approximately one-third of SLE patients. Also, anti-CCP can be present in 5 to 10 percent of patients with SLE [<a href="#rid78">78</a>].

Whether rhupus is clinically and immunologically a distinct entity, a true overlap of SLE and RA, or a subset of patients with SLE remains a matter of debate. In addition to having serologies consistent with both SLE and RA, some patients classified as rhupus may have an erosive arthropathy that is atypical for SLE.

However, the diagnosis of MCTD is often complicated, since many of its characteristic features occur sequentially, often over a period of years. In addition, some patients with MCTD may evolve into another connective tissue disease, including SLE, during the clinical course [<a href="#rid79">79</a>].

By contrast, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia, calcinosis, and malignant hypertension with acute kidney failure are more consistent with SSc rather than SLE. Further, a positive ANA is present in most patients with SSc, while other serologies, such as anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) and anti-Smith (anti-Sm) antibodies that are more specific for SLE, are not commonly observed in SSc. Correspondingly, patients with SSc commonly express antibodies to an antigen called Scl-70 (topoisomerase I) or antibodies to centromere proteins. Distinguishing SSc from SLE can be particularly difficult in cases in which there is overlap of these diseases, such as in MCTD.

Patients with DM may have characteristic skin findings, including Gottron's papules, a heliotrope eruption, and photodistributed poikiloderma (including the shawl and V signs). Clinical findings characteristic of SLE, such as oral ulcers, arthritis, nephritis, and hematologic abnormalities, are absent in DM and PM. Patients with DM or PM may also express myositis-specific antibodies, such as anti-Jo-1.

Clinical features at presentation include lymphadenopathy, fever, myalgias, arthralgias, and, less commonly, hepatosplenomegaly. Associations with SLE have been reported, but the clinical course is usually favorable, with spontaneous remission often occurring within four months. The diagnosis of Kikuchi disease is based on a lymph node biopsy, which reveals a histiocytic cellular infiltrate.

However, other characteristic features of SLE, such as a photosensitive rash, arthritis, and multisystem organ involvement, are absent.

In addition, Epstein-Barr virus infection may lead to a positive ANA [<a href="#rid82">82,83</a>]. Human parvovirus B19 can cause flu-like symptoms and hematologic abnormalities such as leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, which can be observed in SLE, and patients may present with arthralgias or arthritis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Other viral infections that may present with multisystem involvement include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus.

However, monoclonal expansion of B and T cells (as assessed by immunophenotyping), monocytosis, or macrocytosis can distinguish these malignancies from SLE. Patients with lymphoma also typically have additional findings such as splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, or increased lactate dehydrogenase levels. Patients with angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma may be distinguished by findings on an excisional tissue biopsy, most commonly a lymph node.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura</strong> – Although both patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and SLE may have fever and thrombocytopenia, patients with TTP also have microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, acute kidney insufficiency, fluctuating neurologic manifestations, and/or low levels of ADAMSTS13.
