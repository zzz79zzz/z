The prognosis of ARDS is reviewed here. Other issues related to ARDS are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1637.html" rel="external">"Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Clinical features, diagnosis, and complications in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1609.html" rel="external">"Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, pathology, and etiology in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1653.html" rel="external">"Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Ventilator management strategies for adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1641.html" rel="external">"Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Fluid management, pharmacotherapy, and supportive care in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1618.html" rel="external">"Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Investigational or ineffective therapies in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">MORTALITY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ARDS is associated with appreciable mortality, with the best estimates from a multicenter, international cohort study of 3022 patients with ARDS, suggesting an overall rate of death in the hospital of approximately 40 percent [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/1-4">1-4</a>]. Mortality increases with disease severity; unadjusted hospital mortality was reported to be 35 percent among those with mild ARDS, 40 percent for those with moderate disease, and 46 percent for patients with severe ARDS [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/4">4</a>]. Similar to other studies, mortality directly correlated with driving pressure (ie, the difference between plateau [ie, end inspiratory] and positive end expiratory pressures) [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/5">5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1653.html" rel="external">"Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Ventilator management strategies for adults", section on 'Further titration/increase in PEEP (high PEEP)'</a>.) </p><p>The underlying cause of the ARDS is the most common cause of death among patients who die early [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/6-9">6-9</a>]. In contrast, nosocomial pneumonia and sepsis are the most common causes of death among patients who die later in their clinical course [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/8">8</a>]. Patients uncommonly die from respiratory failure [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/7">7</a>].</p><p>Numerous studies suggest that survival has improved over time [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/2,9-11">2,9-11</a>]. As an example, an observational study of 2451 patients who had enrolled in ARDSNet randomized trials found a fall in mortality from 35 to 26 percent between 1996 and 2005 [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/10">10</a>]. To the extent that mortality may be decreasing with time, several issues should be considered:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>It is not known if mortality has decreased among patients who received their care outside of a specialized center or a clinical trial.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The improved mortality may be attributable to patients who have ARDS related to risk factors other than sepsis, such as trauma [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>To the extent that mortality has decreased, the reasons are uncertain. Likely causes include better supportive care and improved ventilatory strategies, such as low tidal volume ventilation [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/10,12,13">10,12,13</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1653.html" rel="external">"Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Ventilator management strategies for adults", section on 'Low tidal volume ventilation: Initial settings'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Predictors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many studies have sought to identify factors during the acute illness that predict mortality. Such factors can be categorized as patient-, disease-, or treatment-related. No single factor has proven to be superior to the others.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Patient-related</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Older patients appear to be at an increased risk for death [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/14-16">14-16</a>]. This was illustrated by a multicenter cohort study that followed 1113 patients with ARDS for 15 months [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/14">14</a>]. The mortality rate increased progressively with age, ranging from 24 percent among patients 15 to 19 years of age to 60 percent among patients 85 years of age or older. The overall mortality rate was 41 percent. Although it has been suggested that obesity may impact the mortality of critically ill patients with or without ARDS, evidence is conflicting, although poorly controlled meta-analyses suggested lower mortality in association with obesity [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/17-25">17-25</a>]. Underlying comorbidities, such as cancer, immunosuppression, and chronic liver failure, are also associated with increased hospital mortality [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/16">16</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Disease-related</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Disease-related predictors of mortality include severe hypoxemia, failure of oxygenation to improve, pulmonary vascular dysfunction, increased dead space, infection, a high severity of illness score, a non-traumatic cause of the ARDS, and certain biomarkers and gene polymorphisms.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Gas exchange – The severity of hypoxemia determines whether the patient has mild ARDS (arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>] &gt;200 but ≤300 mmHg), moderate ARDS (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> &gt;100 but ≤200 mmHg), or severe ARDS (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ≤100 mmHg). Mortality appears to increase as ARDS becomes more severe, according to an observational study of 3670 patients with ARDS that found that patients with mild, moderate, and severe ARDS had mortality rates of 27, 32, and 45 percent, respectively [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/26">26</a>]. Preliminary data suggest that the oxygen saturation index (OSI), calculated as FiO<sub>2</sub> x mean airway pressure [MAP] x 100) / peripheral oxygen saturation [SpO<sub>2</sub>], may be a superior predictor of mortality because it takes MAP into account; in that study higher OSI correlated with increased mortality [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/27">27</a>]. Similarly, there is general agreement that improvement of oxygenation during the early intensive care unit (ICU) course correlates with survival [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/28">28</a>] and that deterioration in oxygenation correlates with mortality as shown in a recent analysis of patients with mild ARDS [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/29">29</a>]. Severe hypercapnia (partial arterial pressure of carbon dioxide [PaCO<sub>2 </sub>] ≥50 mmHg) may also indicate increased mortality, higher complication rates, and more organ failures [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/30">30</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pulmonary vascular dysfunction – Pulmonary vascular dysfunction is indicated by an elevated transpulmonary gradient (ie, ≥12 mmHg) or pulmonary vascular resistance index (ie, &gt;285 dyne s/cm). The transpulmonary gradient is the difference between the mean pulmonary artery pressure and the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, while the pulmonary vascular resistance index is the transpulmonary gradient divided by the cardiac index. Pulmonary vascular dysfunction appears to be an independent risk factor for 60-day mortality and fewer ventilator-free, ICU-free, and hypotension- or vasopressor-free days [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/31">31</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Higher extravascular lung water and pulmonary vascular permeability indices correlate independently with 28 day mortality [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/32">32</a>]. As an example, the Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (RALE) score, which measures the extent and density of alveolar opacities chest radiographs, was shown to correlate with overall survival, 28-day, and 90-day mortality rates and warrants further study [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/33">33</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dead space – Dead space ventilation early in the course of ARDS appears to correlate with mortality. This was illustrated by a series of 179 patients with early ARDS who had their ratio of dead space to tidal volume (ie, the dead space fraction or Vd/Vt) determined by measuring exhaled carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/34">34</a>]. The dead space fraction was markedly elevated (mean 0.58, normal &lt;0.30) and there was a linear correlation between the degree of dead space ventilation and mortality. For every 0.05 increase in dead space fraction, the odds of death increased by 45 percent. A bedside variable, the ventilatory ratio (VR), defined as (minute ventilation (mL/min) x PaCO<sub>2</sub> (mmHg)]/(predicted body weight x 100 x 37.5), was shown to correlate with Vd/Vt as well as increased mortality, even after adjusting for other factors such as PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio and severity of illness [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/35">35</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Infection – Infection and/or multiorgan dysfunction are better predictors of mortality than respiratory parameters [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/9,36-41">9,36-41</a>]. This is probably because they predict death from a nonrespiratory cause, which is more common than death due to respiratory failure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Severity of illness score – Severity of illness scores appear to correlate with mortality. As an example, patients with a higher APACHE III score have an increased likelihood of death (odds ratio 1.78 per 25-point increase, 95% CI 1.16-2.73) [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/15">15</a>]. Among those who present with mild ARDS, approximately half worsen within the first week, while one third remain mild and the remainder (&lt;20 percent) improve [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/29">29</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1655.html" rel="external">"Predictive scoring systems in the intensive care unit", section on 'Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Underlying cause of the ARDS – Patients with trauma-related ARDS appear to have a lower likelihood of death at 90 days than patients with ARDS that is unrelated to trauma [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/42">42</a>]. Severe but not mild or moderate alcohol misuse, in patients with acute lung injury, is associated with an increased risk of death or persistent hospitalization at 90 days (adjusted odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.87) [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/43">43</a>]. The presence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) on lung biopsy is also associated with a worse prognosis compared with those who had non DAD-associated ARDS [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/44">44</a>]</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Laboratory – Routine laboratory parameters are not helpful for predicting the outcome of ARDS. However, a large body of emerging evidence suggests that many biomarkers and gene polymorphisms are associated with both susceptibility to ARDS and outcome from ARDS [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/45">45</a>]. The practical utility of these observations is uncertain, but the research may lead to new preventative and therapeutic strategies in the future. Other analyses have suggested the existence of two biologically and clinically distinct subphenotypes of ARDS, hypo-and hyper-inflammatory subtypes (Type 1 and Type 2 respectively), with increased mortality associated with the hyper-inflammatory subtype [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/46,47">46,47</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Treatment-related</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Treatment-related predictors of mortality include a positive fluid balance, glucocorticoid therapy prior to the onset of ARDS, packed red blood cell transfusions, and being in an ICU that does not mandate care by an intensivist.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fluid balance – A positive fluid balance may be associated with higher mortality [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/48,49">48,49</a>]. This was demonstrated by the ARDSNet low tidal volume trial, which found that a negative fluid balance at day 4 was associated with decreased mortality compared to a positive fluid balance, after adjustment for factors such as age, severity of illness, and ventilator strategy (adjusted odds ratio 0.50, 95% CI 0.28-0.89) [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/49">49</a>].

Although unproven, it suggests that initial strategies (eg, noninvasive ventilation and high flow oxygen) may impact the timing of intubation, to ultimately affect mortality.</p><p></p><p>Predictors of improved survival include lung protective ventilation strategies, which are discussed separately.

Similar to that observed in survivors of any critical illness, morbidities are usually evident upon discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU). Many of the cognitive, psychiatric, and physical manifestations are present for at least five years and they tend to resolve slowly. The occurrence and resolution of symptoms are frequently co-dependent. Neuropsychologic and physical impairments after ARDS are discussed in this section. The epidemiology, diagnosis, clinical manifestations, outcome, and treatment of post-intensive care syndrome, much of which overlaps with ARDS, and long-term symptoms in critically ill patients with COVID-19 are discussed separately.

In two observational studies of a total of 310 ARDS survivors, impaired neurocognitive function was reported in 30 percent and 49 percent of patients at 12 months following the acute illness [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/54,55">54,55</a>]. These rates are similar to that reported in the largest study of survivors of critical illness where 40 percent had neurocognitive deficits at three months; these persisted at 12 months in the vast majority [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/56">56</a>]. Severity of hypoxemia may be associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment following ARDS [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/56">56</a>]. Factors which may be associated with long-term cognitive impairment include pre-existing impairment, neurological injury, delirium, mechanical ventilation, duration of sedative use, and systemic inflammation [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/57">57</a>].

The absolute risk varies between studies. One prospective cohort study of ARDS survivors estimated that the incidence of depressive symptoms was 40 percent during the two years following the acute illness [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/58">58</a>]. In another observational cohort, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anxiety were present in 36, 39, and 62 percent of survivors at one year [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/55">55</a>]. In a study reporting psychiatric symptoms, 66 percent of ARDS survivors had substantial symptoms of depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during one year follow up [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/59">59</a>]. The majority of symptomatic patients experienced morbidity in two or more domains. Risk factors for symptoms included younger age, female sex, unemployment, alcohol misuse, and greater opioid use in the ICU, whereas there was no association between symptoms and severity of illness or ICU length of stay. In a study focusing on ARDS survivors up to five years out from their illness, 52 percent had continuous or recurring symptoms with 38, 21, and 23 percent having prolonged anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms, respectively, with median durations of 33 to 39 months [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/60">60</a>]. Risk factors for long-term psychiatric morbidity included worse pre-ARDS mental health, including previous depression and psychological distress in the period preceding ARDS.

The persistent nature of this abnormality was demonstrated by a prospective cohort study that followed 109 survivors of ARDS for five years [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/63">63</a>]. The six minute walking distance (6MWD) at one, three, and five years was 66, 67, and 76 percent of predicted, respectively. During a two-year follow-up study of 186 ARDS survivors, the cumulative incidence of impaired physical function was as high as 66 percent [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/58">58</a>]. Another prospective cohort study reported that 38 percent of patients with ARDS had muscle weakness at discharge, which was associated with worse five-year survival [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/68">68</a>]. One meta-analysis of 48 studies (over 11,000 patients) survivors of ARDS reported a lower than predicted 6 minute walk distance in 57 percent at three months, 63 percent at six months and 66 percent 12 months [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/53">53</a>]. Risk factors for physical dysfunction were longer ICU stay and prior depressive symptoms. In one meta-analysis of ARDS survivors the 6MWD at three months following discharge was 300 meters, which improved to 410 meters at 12 months [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/69">69</a>]. Female sex and pre-existing comorbidity were associated with lower 6MWD. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1477.html" rel="external">"Cardiac rehabilitation programs"</a>.)</p><p>Data suggest that many ARDS survivors experience additional physical decline after their critical illness. For example, in one prospective cohort study, 69 percent of 193 ARDS survivors experienced decline in &gt;1 physical measure such as muscle strength, exercise capacity, and physical functioning [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/70">70</a>]. Significant risk factors for subsequent physical decline included increased age and pre-ARDS comorbidity. </p><p>A longitudinal prospective cohort study of 156 ARDS survivors showed an association between muscle weakness at hospital discharge and increased five-year mortality [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/68">68</a>]. Thirty-eight percent of patients had demonstrable muscle weakness at discharge, and this was associated with worse five-year survival. Fifty percent experienced either persistent or resolving weakness trajectories during the follow up period, and these were associated with more than a threefold greater hazard of death compared to patients without weakness.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2159643767"><span class="h2">Lung function</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Lung function following ARDS is commonly compromised for as long as five years [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/61,63,71">61,63,71</a>]. However, it is uncertain whether decreased lung function results in physical impairment. The degree of compromise depends on which parameter of lung function is measured (spirometry, lung volumes, diffusing capacity). For example, upon discharge, approximately 80 percent of patients will have a reduction in diffusing capacity and a smaller percentage will have airflow obstruction (20 percent) or restriction (20 percent) on spirometry and lung volumes [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/61">61</a>]. In most patients, lung volumes and spirometry will normalize (ie, measure within 80 percent of predicted values) by six months, and diffusion capacity should normalize by five years [<a class="abstract_t" href="/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/61,63,71">61,63,71</a>].
