         Approximately one-half of patients with glioblastoma are 65 years of age or older at the time of diagnosis. Among clinical factors affecting prognosis, older age and poor performance status have consistently been shown to be associated with shorter survival. The poorer prognosis of older adults and the relative lack of clinical trial data in this age group have led to uncertainty about optimal management. Treatment decisions in older adults can be additionally complicated by factors such as comorbid disease, polypharmacy, increased susceptibility to side effects, and social and economic vulnerability.

         The available evidence and approach to older adults with glioblastoma will be reviewed here. The general approach to surgery, radiation therapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with malignant gliomas is discussed separately. (See

         Older adults with glioblastoma have a worse prognosis compared with younger patients [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In population-based studies, the median survival of patients 65 years of age and older with newly diagnosed glioblastoma is approximately six months [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-5
         </a>
         ]. Older adults also tend to receive less aggressive therapy, which may influence outcomes [
         <a href="#rid5">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The most important prognostic factors affecting survival in patients with malignant glioma are age and performance status  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785" href="/z/d/graphic/58785.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). In a retrospective study that included over 700 patients with glioblastoma diagnosed at 70 years of age or older, the median age at diagnosis was 75 years and the median Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) was 70 [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Recursive partitioning analysis revealed four prognostic groups, with median overall survival stratified according to age and performance status as well as extent of resection:

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Molecular alterations also carry prognostic value in older adults, although certain markers, such as mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and codeletion of 1p and 19q, become increasingly rare with advancing age. The most valuable molecular prognostic factor in older adults is methylation of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (
         <em>
          MGMT
         </em>
         ), which is present in approximately half of glioblastomas in patients over the age of 70 years and is associated with improved survival compared with unmethylated
         <em>
          MGMT

         Observational studies in younger adults support the value of maximal safe resection in patients with malignant glioma for the purposes of preserving neurologic function and improving survival. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5228.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and initial surgical management of high-grade gliomas", section on 'Extent of resection'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In older adults, maximal safe resection is likely beneficial as well, but factors such as medical comorbidities, effects of general anesthesia, and vulnerability to postoperative complications such as delirium weigh more heavily in the decision to operate. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14931.html" rel="external">
          "Anesthesia for the older adult"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Based on the available evidence, we suggest maximal surgical resection consistent with preservation of neurologic function rather than biopsy in older patients with glioblastoma. In appropriately selected patients, the goals of resection are to help relieve mass effect, reduce steroid requirements, delay neurologic decline, and facilitate successful delivery of radiation and/or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9699" href="/z/d/drug information/9699.html" rel="external">
          temozolomide
         </a>
         . Subtotal resection or stereotactic biopsy alone may be preferred, however, depending upon the location and size of the tumor, general health of the patient, and overall goals of care.
        </p>
        <p>
         The evidence supporting surgery in older adults is largely observational. In the only completed trial, conducted in France by the ANOCEF cooperative group, 101 older adults (≥70 years) with a suspected operable glioblastoma were randomly assigned to either resection or biopsy [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Patients enrolled from 2008 to 2017 received postoperative radiation therapy, and those enrolled from 2017 to 2019 received radiation plus
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9699" href="/z/d/drug information/9699.html" rel="external">
          temozolomide
         </a>
         . With median follow-up of 40 months, overall survival was similar between the resection and biopsy groups (9.4 versus 9.0 months, adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.79, 95% CI 0.52-1.21). However, the resection group had modestly improved progression-free survival (5.0 versus 4.0 months, aHR 0.50, 95% CI 0.32-0.78) and slower decline in quality-of-life measures compared with the biopsy group. Wide confidence intervals for the survival outcome indicate that the trial was underpowered, and enrollment was slower than expected, which may limit generalizability.
        </p>
        <p>
         Observational studies in older adults, including a meta-analysis and large population-based analysis using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, have suggested that gross total resection and subtotal resection are associated with improved survival compared with biopsy alone or no surgical intervention [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,12-17
         </a>
         ]. In the SEER database study, gross total resection conferred a two- to three-month survival advantage over subtotal resection, even after adjusting for tumor size, location, and receipt of radiotherapy [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. This effect was present in all age groups examined, although the magnitude of the benefit decreased with advancing age. A major limitation to the interpretation of observational studies, including meta-analyses of observational studies, is that they cannot completely control for factors that influence the decision to pursue surgery in the first place, and many of these factors are strongly associated with survival [
         <a href="#rid18">

         For older adults with glioblastoma, we suggest a treatment approach that depends primarily on the overall functional status of the patient postoperatively and molecular information about O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (
         <em>
          MGMT
         </em>
         ) methylation status, if available in a timely manner after surgery  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93333" href="/z/d/graphic/93333.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). The three major treatment options (concurrent chemoradiation with or without alternating electric field therapy, radiation alone, and
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9699" href="/z/d/drug information/9699.html" rel="external">
          temozolomide
         </a>
         alone) are discussed individually below.
        </p>
        <p>
         Combined-modality therapy is the standard of care for younger patients with glioblastoma, but with advancing age the benefits become more closely balanced with risks of toxicity and side effects. Single-modality therapy is often better tolerated and is a common approach in older patients with a low functional status. In such patients, subgroup analyses from randomized trials support the role of
         <em>
          MGMT

         status in helping to select between radiation and

         ].
         <em>
          MGMT
         </em>
         status is less helpful in patients with a good functional status who are candidates for concurrent chemoradiation, as both methylated and unmethylated patients appear to benefit from the addition of temozolomide to radiation therapy [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20

         Careful assessment of the patient's overall clinical status and comorbidities is essential. A comprehensive geriatric assessment may be useful in this setting. (See

         In patients &gt;70 years of age with a good performance status (eg, Karnofsky Performance Status [KPS] ≥70), we suggest using hypofractionated radiation (eg, 40 Gy in 15 fractions) with concurrent and adjuvant

         . The risks of toxicity with the addition of chemotherapy are more closely balanced with the potential for improved survival in older patients compared with younger patients, however. Patients who are particularly concerned about side effects could reasonably choose single-modality therapy.

        <p>
         Older patients selected for combination therapy are also candidates for use of alternating electric fields in the postradiation setting, which have been shown to improve survival in a randomized trial of adults age 18 years and older with newly diagnosed glioblastoma when used in combination with standard radiation plus concurrent and adjuvant

         The survival benefit of radiation in older adults was demonstrated in a trial in which 85 patients, age ≥70 with either grade III or IV gliomas, were randomly assigned to best supportive care, with or without involved field radiation therapy (50.4 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions) [

         The optimal dose and schedule of radiation for older patients remain uncertain, and many such patients are not able to tolerate the prolonged courses of radiation used in younger patients. While standard (prolonged) courses of radiation therapy are expected to have lower rates of normal tissue toxicity in the long term (ie, years after radiation treatment), this becomes less relevant in patients with a median survival of less than one year.
        </p>
        <p>
         Available data suggest that a shorter course of radiation provides similar efficacy with lower short-term toxicity [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37-41

         ]. These hypofractionated regimens are particularly appropriate for older patients with a poor functional status.
        </p>
        <p>
         This approach was illustrated by a trial in which 100 patients with glioblastoma aged ≥60 years were randomly assigned to treatment with 40 Gy in 15 fractions over three weeks or 60 Gy in 30 fractions over six weeks [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. The shortened schedule of radiation produced a comparable survival (5.6 versus 5.1 months with the six-week radiation therapy course), and fewer patients required an increase in posttreatment corticosteroid dose (23 versus 49 percent).
        </p>
        <p>
         In a subsequent randomized trial by the same group, an even shorter course of radiation therapy (25 Gy in 5 daily fractions) was found to be noninferior to 40 Gy in 15 daily fractions in 98 older (≥65 years) and/or frail (≥50 years and KPS 50 to 70) patients with glioblastoma [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42

Although the study was not powered as an equivalency study, all outcomes were similar in patients assigned to one week versus three weeks of radiation, including median progression-free survival (4.2 months in both groups), median overall survival (7.9 versus 6.4 months), and quality of life at one and two months after completion of treatment.

        <p>
         Taken together, these trials suggest that hypofractionated radiation alone and

         For older adults with glioblastoma, careful assessment of the patient's overall clinical status and comorbidities is essential. A comprehensive geriatric assessment may be useful in this setting. (See

         For older patients with malignant glioma, we suggest maximal surgical resection consistent with preservation of neurologic function rather than biopsy as the initial step in management (

         ). Subtotal resection or stereotactic biopsy may be required, however, depending upon the location and extent of the tumor, the general health of the patient, and the overall goals of care. (See
