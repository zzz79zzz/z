Wounds caused by low-velocity guns or impaling objects tend to cause fewer aerodigestive and vascular injuries [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. High velocity injuries carry a greater likelihood of serious injury and death [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Mortality from PNI during the past decade is reported to be approximately 5 percent in both civilian and war populations.</p><p>PNI has been categorized by anatomic zones  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52642" href="/z/d/graphic/52642.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>), which are described below. Mortality rates for PNIs appear to be highest with zone I injuries (below the cricoid cartilage) due in part to the proximity of mediastinal structures, the severity of the vascular injuries sustained, and surgical challenges. Exsanguination is the most common cause of immediate death, and the carotid artery is the structure most often involved [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. The incidence of carotid artery injury from a PNI ranges from 6 to 17 percent [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. Concomitant injury beyond the neck is common [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Anatomy'</a> below.)</p><p>A review of studies published from 1963 through 1990, which included over 2495 patients with PNI, reported that zone II injuries (between cricoid cartilage and angle of the mandible) are most common, followed by zone I and then zone III (above the angle of the mandible to the base of the skull) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. According to this review, the aerodigestive tract was injured most frequently. Ten percent of such patients had laryngeal or tracheal injury, and 9.6 percent had pharyngeal or esophageal wounds. Vascular injuries were also common: 9 percent of patients sustained internal jugular vein injury, and 6.7 percent sustained carotid artery injury. Spinal cord injury occurred in 3 percent. Less common injuries included the subclavian artery (2.2 percent), vertebral artery (1.3 percent), brachial plexus (1.9 percent), cranial nerves IX and X (0.9 percent), and the thoracic duct (&lt;0.1 percent).</p><p>Mortality from penetrating laryngotracheal trauma is reported to be 20 percent [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Mortality from pharyngoesophageal injuries is as high as 22 percent [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Unstable cervical spinal column injuries are rare [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">ANATOMY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Neck anatomy is complex with aerodigestive and neurovascular structures confined to a small area.

Zone I injuries can involve the mediastinum, where vascular control can be difficult. Zone III vascular injuries, especially those more cephalad, can also pose a significant surgical challenge.</p><p>Penetrating neck injuries (PNIs) can cross zone boundaries based on the implement or projectile and its angle of penetration Thus, an external wound in zone I can be associated with an internal injury in zone II or the mediastinum. Improved imaging using multidetector computed tomography with angiography (MDCT-A) has shown this to be the case [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>The neck can also be thought of in terms of anatomic triangles  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74489" href="/z/d/graphic/74489.html" rel="external">figure 7</a>). The anterior triangle is bordered anteriorly by the midline, posteriorly by the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and superiorly by the lower edge of the mandible. The posterior triangle is located within the boundaries of the sternocleidomastoid muscle anteriorly, the clavicle inferiorly, and the anterior border of the trapezius muscle posteriorly. Most vital structures are located in the anterior triangle. Trauma to the posterior triangle, excluding the spine, carries a much lower likelihood of significant injury.</p><p>The neck has several fascial compartments. These compartments can help to contain bleeding from vascular injuries but can also lead to anatomic distortion in response to brisk bleeding. The most superficial fascia is located just below the skin and superficial to the platysma muscle. The platysma, which originates in the upper chest, extends superiorly over the clavicles and covers the anterolateral neck before attaching to the lower facial muscles. Violation of the platysma defines PNI. When the platysma is violated, a careful search for aerodigestive and neurovascular injury must be performed.</p><p>Deep to the platysma is the deep cervical fascia. This divides into prevertebral, pretracheal, and investing layers. The investing layer lies just deep to the platysma and encircles the entire neck, splitting to encase the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. The prevertebral fascia surrounds both the prevertebral muscles and cervical spine down to the chest. The pretracheal fascia attaches to the cartilaginous structures in the anterior neck (cricoid and larynx) before coursing inferiorly and deep to the sternum, ultimately inserting onto the sternum and pericardium. The location of this fascia allows the contents of a torn esophagus to spill into the mediastinum, which can result in mediastinitis. The carotid sheath is composed of all three layers of the deep cervical fascia. Within this sheath lie the carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and vagus nerve. One carotid sheath lies lateral to each side of the midline trachea. The esophagus is directly posterior to the trachea [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">MECHANISM</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Penetrating neck injuries (PNIs) commonly occur from guns, knives, and other impaling objects. Gunshot wounds are further divided into high- and low-velocity injuries. Bone penetration requires a velocity of approximately 350 feet (107 meters) per second. Because low-velocity weapons (eg, .22-caliber guns, other handguns, air guns) do not typically penetrate bone, they tend to produce a more erratic, unpredictable path through soft tissue, often following tissue planes. Military weapons and hunting rifles can fire at speeds over 2000 to 3000 feet (610 to 910 meters) per second and follow a more direct, predictable course through bone and soft tissue. High-velocity weapons can cause injury beyond the bullet track, a phenomenon called cavitation. This is related to the release of kinetic energy at impact. Entry and exit wounds caused by high-velocity weapons can appear innocuous, leading to an underestimation of the extent of tissue damage [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">PREHOSPITAL CARE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H932869"><span class="h2">General management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Any patient with a penetrating neck injury (PNI) can decompensate rapidly and should be transported immediately to the nearest trauma center. These patients often require airway management and emergency surgical intervention. Impaled objects should <strong>not</strong> be removed in the field. </p><p>Airway management in the patient with PNI can be difficult, and is discussed in detail below (see <a class="local">'Airway management'</a> below). Tracheal intubation is the primary approach to airway control when an immediate definitive airway is required. Bag-mask ventilation (BMV) can be used during transport to the emergency department. BMV can become problematic if an airway injury is present, as it can force air into soft tissue planes leading to anatomical distortion.</p><p>During transport, breath sounds should be auscultated and vital signs assessed frequently. Hypotension, tachypnea, unilaterally diminished breath sounds, and subcutaneous emphysema raise suspicion for a tension pneumothorax. Paramedics should perform needle thoracostomy if the patient is unstable and tension pneumothorax is suspected. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13862.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of penetrating thoracic trauma in adults", section on 'Role of needle/finger chest decompression'</a>.)</p><p>En route to the trauma center, one or two large bore IVs (eg, 14 or 16 gauge) should be placed in the arm opposite the injury if possible. Active bleeding is controlled with direct pressure. Patients with bubbling or sucking neck wounds should ideally be placed in a head-down (ie, Trendelenburg) position on their left side in an attempt to prevent venous air embolism. Gauze impregnated with petroleum jelly should then be applied to the wound. The best position for the patient with a suspected arterial air embolus is less clear. Arterial emboli can cause cerebral edema thus a neutral position might be prudent and is recommended by the author. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8263.html" rel="external">"Air embolism", section on 'Positioning the patient'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H932876"><span class="h2">Cervical spine immobilization</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We agree with the practice guidelines from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST), which state that immobilization of the cervical spine is only necessary when a neurologic deficit is present or a proper physical examination cannot be performed (eg, unconscious patient) and the mechanism is suspicious for a possible spinal cord or column injury [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Cervical spine injuries are uncommon with penetrating neck trauma, particularly stab wounds, and immobilization can hinder management in some cases by impeding visualization of the airway or by obscuring other injuries. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/342.html" rel="external">"Cervical spinal column injuries in adults: Evaluation and initial management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6561.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and acute management of cervical spine injuries in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p>A systematic review performed by the Prehospital Trauma Life Support Program concurs with this approach and goes on to emphasize that spine immobilization must not be performed at the expense of an accurate examination or the treatment of life-threatening conditions in a patient with penetrating trauma [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Patients in need of cervical spine immobilization who have difficulty breathing due to hemorrhage may need their stretcher placed on its side, or may need to sit upright while cervical spine precautions are maintained as best as possible. If a cervical collar is used, those with openings that allow for continuous observation of the neck are preferable.</p><p>In a large, retrospective study, the incidence of cervical spine fracture from gunshot wounds and stab wounds was 1.35 and 0.12 percent, respectively, while the incidence of cervical spinal cord injury from gunshot wounds and stab wounds was 0.94 and 0.11 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Case series and reviews consistently report that any neurologic deficit from PNI was present at the time of emergency department presentation, suggesting that if neurologic deficit is not present on arrival in an evaluable patient, the likelihood of spinal cord injury or significant cervical fracture is remote [<a href="#rid10">10,17-21</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES OF INJURY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H66024389"><span class="h2">General hard and soft signs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When evaluating a patient with a penetrating neck injury (PNI), it is imperative to look for hard and soft signs of injury  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106163" href="/z/d/graphic/106163.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Hard signs reflect the presence of a serious injury that generally requires immediate transfer to the operating room.</p><p>Hard signs of vascular injury can include severe or uncontrolled hemorrhage, rapidly expanding or pulsatile hematoma, thrills and bruits, hypotension unresponsive to aggressive fluid resuscitation, absent or diminished radial pulse, and neurologic deficits consistent with cerebral ischemia (stroke). Hard signs of aerodigestive injury include air bubbling from a wound, massive hemoptysis, and respiratory distress. While there is disagreement about whether a large amount of subcutaneous air should be considered a hard or soft sign of aerodigestive injury, there is no doubt that it requires urgent evaluation.</p><p>Generally agreed upon soft signs of injury include proximity wounds (injury within 1 to 2 cm of a major vessel in the presence of other soft signs of vascular injury), minor hemorrhage, mild hypotension that responds to fluid resuscitation, minor hemoptysis or hematemesis, subcutaneous or mediastinal air, nonexpanding hematoma, dysphonia, and dysphagia.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Laryngotracheal injuries</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Laryngotracheal injuries are predominantly confined to the cervical trachea. Such injuries can result in respiratory distress, stridor, subcutaneous air, hemoptysis, odynophagia, dysphonia, or anterior neck tenderness.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Vascular injuries</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Vascular injuries can involve the carotid artery (common, internal, and external), the subclavian and vertebral arteries, thyroid vessels, and the vertebral, brachiocephalic, and jugular (internal and external) veins. Vascular wounds are not always obvious and, if missed, can lead to delayed complications such as pseudoaneurysm, rupture, and arteriovenous fistula. Look for obvious and subtle signs of injury. Obvious signs include shock, severe bleeding, decreased or absent peripheral pulses, global or focal neurologic deficits (eg, stroke), expanding hematoma, and bruits or thrills. Subtle signs include nonexpansile hematomas, mild bleeding, and transient hypotension that responds to fluid resuscitation. Intact pulses do <strong>not</strong> negate the possibility of vascular injury. Global neurologic deficits (eg, hemiplegia) can be caused by a vascular injury rather than a direct insult to the central nervous system. A patient with a normal physical examination who is otherwise asymptomatic is unlikely to have sustained a vascular lesion requiring surgical repair [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Pharyngoesophageal injuries</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pharyngoesophageal injuries are uncommon but are associated with high morbidity and mortality. They can be difficult to detect clinically and appear to be the leading cause of delayed death from neck trauma [<a href="#rid15">15,23</a>]. Clinicians should aggressively search for pharyngoesophageal injuries in patients with any suggestive signs using appropriate ancillary studies.

Partial cord lesions create variable combinations of motor and sensory deficits depending on the location. The Brown-Sequard syndrome (lateral hemisection of the spinal cord) results in ipsilateral hemiplegia and contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation. Hemiplegia occurs at the level of the injury, while the sensory deficits occur one to two levels inferiorly. Injury to the anterior spinal cord produces bilateral paralysis or motor deficits of variable severity, reflex changes, and bilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation, but proprioception is preserved. Dorsal spinal cord injury produces muscle flaccidity, hyporeflexia, ataxia, and loss of proprioception.

These functions involve the cranial nerves most frequently injured. Cranial nerve VII may be injured with PNI near the angle of the mandible. It is important to assess facial nerve function early. A deficit detected upon arrival implies a nerve transection, while a deficit that develops over the ensuing hour or two suggests neurapraxia from blunt injury or nerve compression from a hematoma or significant soft tissue swelling. A watch-and-wait approach as opposed to urgent surgical repair may be indicated if transection is unlikely, but surgical consultation should be obtained regardless.</p><p>Horner syndrome occurs with injury to the sympathetic chain and produces ipsilateral miosis with ptosis of the upper eyelid and anhidrosis of the ipsilateral side of the face.

In such cases, expeditious transfer to a trauma center is often warranted. For unstable patients, such transfer is acceptable, once the airway is stabilized and basic resuscitation is performed to the extent possible, if life-saving interventions can only be performed at another facility. A paramedic or some other advanced clinician capable of providing care and airway management during transport must accompany the patient. For the hemodynamically stable patient with signs of injury that suggest a possible need for acute surgical intervention, transfer to a level 1 or 2 trauma center should be arranged as soon as a stable airway is assured. In such instances, additional diagnostic studies are best deferred to the receiving hospital so as not to delay transport. It is reasonable for hemodynamically stable patients without hard signs of injury  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106163" href="/z/d/graphic/106163.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and a negative computed tomography (CT) angiogram (assuming this can be performed) to remain at the initial facility for observation and serial re-examination in the event that a trauma center is not available.</p><p>Although careful physical examination identifies most arterial wounds, it may not detect some important injuries, particularly those involving the esophagus.

In-line stabilization of the cervical spine by an assistant is indicated if spinal injury is suspected, although spine injuries are uncommon with PNI. Rescue airway devices can be used if placement of a tracheal tube is unsuccessful as long this does not delay the establishment of a needed surgical airway. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/270.html" rel="external">"Rapid sequence intubation in adults for emergency medicine and critical care"</a> and <a class="local">'Cervical spine immobilization'</a> above.)</p><p>RSI should not be used and a surgical airway is generally recommended when massive facial or neck trauma that distorts anatomic landmarks, hemoptysis, hematemesis, or obstruction above the larynx is present and is likely to make effective ventilation or successful placement of a tracheal tube unlikely.</p><p>Neuromuscular paralysis is often unnecessary when penetrating injury causes partial or complete transection and exposure of the trachea. In these cases, the caudad portion of the exposed trachea can be stabilized with a towel clip or clamp and intubated directly. Frothing or large air bubbles emanating from a neck wound raises concern for this possibility.</p><p>If tracheal intubation is deemed necessary in an initially stable patient based upon the projected clinical course, and the airway is predicted to be difficult because of distorted anatomy, the clinician may elect to use an "awake" technique. This entails the use of topical anesthesia and light sedation to enable direct or flexible endoscopic laryngoscopy and intubation, if conditions are favorable. When direct airway injury is suspected (eg, subcutaneous air is present in the soft tissues of the neck), a flexible endoscopic guided oral intubation may be the best approach, if available, because it enables the clinician to determine the integrity of the interior of the airway above and below the vocal cords [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. The "awake" technique is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/275.html" rel="external">"Approach to the difficult airway in adults for emergency medicine and critical care", section on 'Awake techniques'</a>.)</p><p>We recommend simultaneous preparation for RSI, non-surgical rescue device (eg, an extraglottic device), and a surgical airway (ie, triple setup) if an "awake" technique is used.

Nevertheless, the following concepts generally apply:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoid techniques not performed with visualization, whether direct, endoscopic, video, or some other technique.

Have available and ready for use at least two suction devices, a range of different-sized tracheal tubes, rescue airway devices, and a surgical airway kit.

Although it is appropriate to perform BMV to oxygenate patients when necessary, ventilation should be performed with vigilance, and not overaggressively, to ensure it is not creating more harm than benefit. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/270.html" rel="external">"Rapid sequence intubation in adults for emergency medicine and critical care", section on 'Preoxygenation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Invasive airway management (eg, cricothyroidotomy) represents the standard approach when tracheal intubation, by any method, is unsuccessful or contraindicated. Indications for a surgical airway include massive upper airway distortion, massive midface trauma, and inability to visualize the glottis because of heavy bleeding, edema, or anatomic disruption. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/263.html" rel="external">"Emergency cricothyrotomy (cricothyroidotomy) in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Cricothyrotomy can be difficult in a patient with distorted neck anatomy. The procedure is relatively contraindicated if an anterior neck hematoma exists or a laryngeal injury is suspected but may be the only viable option in some patients with PNI. If the necessary resources and expertise are readily available, patients whose external landmarks are sufficiently distorted to make cricothyrotomy difficult or impossible are generally intubated awake using a flexible intubating scope. If the clinician suspects partial or complete laryngeal transection, a flexible endoscopic approach or a tracheostomy inferior to the injury may be necessary.</p><p>Needle cricothyroidotomy with percutaneous transtracheal ventilation (with bag-valve mask or wall oxygen as the delivery source) can provide oxygen to adult and pediatric patients while arrangements are made to establish a definitive airway. Clinicians must take care to avoid catheter misplacement or dislodgement, which can force air into the tissues and distort normal airway anatomy. Percutaneous transtracheal ventilation should not be performed if laryngeal fracture, tracheal rupture, or tracheal transection are suspected. The technique can be useful in children ≤10 years in whom open surgical cricothyrotomy is contraindicated. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6313.html" rel="external">"Needle cricothyroidotomy with percutaneous transtracheal ventilation"</a>.)</p><p>Blind nasotracheal intubation is generally not considered an appropriate technique in patients with PNI. Blind nasotracheal intubation can exacerbate preexisting airway injury and may cause vomiting and aspiration, turbinate injury, elevated intracranial pressure, bleeding, and (in awake patients) cervical spine motion from discomfort [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. However, some have questioned this proscription. One retrospective study reported on 36 of 40 patients with PNI who were successfully intubated in the field using blind nasotracheal intubation [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h3">Physical examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In addition to the standard primary survey conducted for all patients with significant trauma, the examination of the patient with PNI focuses on identification of any hard or soft signs associated with injury to important structures  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106163" href="/z/d/graphic/106163.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).

In contrast, a second study of 223 patients with PNI concluded that careful examination using a standardized protocol that identified objective signs of injury (eg, large expanding hematomas, severe active bleeding, shock not responding to fluids, diminished radial pulse, bruit) reliably predicted major <strong>vascular</strong> trauma requiring treatment [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].

Given the controversies about the management of PNI, limited evidence base, and variability in resources and experience, decisions about whether to use a selective, zone-based management approach or a no-zone approach will vary by local expertise and resources and are likely to remain institution specific for the time being [<a href="#rid44">44,45</a>]. A brief summary of the history of the management of PNI is provided below. (See <a class="local">'Evolution of the surgical approach to PNI'</a> below.)</p><p>The relatively high rates of negative surgical exploration associated with the algorithmic, zone-based approach coupled with improvements in diagnostic imaging technology, particularly multidetector computed tomography with angiography (MDCT-A), have led many trauma centers to discard anatomic zone-based protocols for the management of PNI in favor of a "no-zone" approach [<a href="#rid46">46,47</a>]. No-zone management algorithms are based on patient stability and the presence of soft versus hard signs of injury, regardless of injury location (ie, the zone of the neck involved  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52642" href="/z/d/graphic/52642.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>)), whereas zone-driven approaches are based on the location of the external wound. Unstable patients are transferred rapidly to the operating room. Those who are stable but symptomatic undergo MDCT-A, the results of which, in combination with examination findings, determine whether further diagnostic studies, surgical intervention, or both are indicated.</p><p>MDCT-A has high sensitivity and specificity for laryngotracheal and vascular injuries, and identifies many pharyngoesophageal injuries, thereby eliminating the need for multiple imaging studies to assess each type of injury [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. In addition, MDCT-A enables clinicians to assess signs of injury situated close to important internal structures (so-called "proximity wounds") and determine whether these are high or low risk, thereby allowing for better informed decisions concerning the need for observation, further diagnostic evaluation, or surgical exploration. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic strategies for specific scenarios and injury types'</a> below.)</p><p>Studies using MDCT-A in the assessment of PNI patients have shown that important discrepancies frequently exist between the location of the entry wound and the structures injured. Cutaneous wounds often do not correlate with deeper injury locations, and entry wounds in one zone may be associated with severe injuries in adjacent zones. As an example, one prospective study found that one in five surface wounds located in zone II extended across zone I or zone III internally [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Furthermore, when multiple neck wounds are present in more than one region, zone-driven protocols become unclear. Perhaps most importantly, use of a zone-based approach in stable, symptomatic patients has led to a high rate of negative surgical exploration in zone II injuries. Concerns with the no-zone approach include limitations of MDCT-A for detecting pharyngoesophageal injuries, which are potentially life threatening if missed.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3043228610"><span class="h2">Evolution of the surgical approach to PNI</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Before World War II, all PNIs were treated expectantly ("watch and wait"), resulting in mortality rates as high as 35 percent [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. In an attempt to reduce the unacceptably high death rates associated with PNIs, a mandatory surgical approach was adopted, and exploratory surgery was performed in all patients with PNI. This approach reduced mortality rates substantially [<a href="#rid4">4</a>] and remained widely accepted until well into the 1990s, when it became clear that despite improved outcomes, mandatory surgery led to unacceptably high negative exploration rates [<a href="#rid38">38</a>].</p><p>High negative exploration rates led to the development of an anatomic zone-based  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52642" href="/z/d/graphic/52642.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>), selective surgical approach for stable patients with PNI that allowed for a range of diagnostic and therapeutic options based on which zone of the neck was injured and the stability of the patient. The zone-driven selective surgical approach was based in part on the relative ease with which surgeons could access zone II (mid-neck) injuries compared with the more technically challenging zone I and III injuries. Early algorithms for stable patients favored mandatory surgery for zone II injuries, while further diagnostic studies preceded operative intervention for zone I and III wounds. Much debate followed as to the best approach for symptomatic, stable patients [<a href="#rid3">3,8,49</a>]. One persistent controversy was whether all zone II PNIs required surgical exploration or whether selected patients could be managed nonoperatively.</p><p>During the 1990s and early 2000s, most research and many trauma surgeons came to favor some form of selective management. One early review concluded that zone II injuries had similar outcomes regardless of whether mandatory surgery or selective management was pursued, and subsequent research supported a selective approach [<a href="#rid27">27,49-52</a>]. Practice guidelines from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) in 2008 concluded that both approaches were justifiable and safe [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>As computed tomography (CT) has become more widely available and its resolution and speed have improved, it has become the study of choice for investigating PNI.

Transfer to a higher level of care is warranted if <strong>any</strong> signs of injury develop or the patient's condition deteriorates in any way.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18"><span class="h2">Laryngotracheal injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is the imaging modality of choice when looking for laryngotracheal injuries in stable patients with PNI. MDCT provides anatomic detail about laryngeal integrity and is useful when cervical spine immobilization is necessary [<a href="#rid60">60</a>]. Studies describing the test characteristics of MDCT for detecting laryngotracheal injuries sustained from penetrating neck trauma are limited, but sensitivity and specificity are thought to be high.</p><p>Thin-slice (1 to 2 mm) MDCT provides better images of mineralized cartilage than plain radiographs, although plain films should be inspected for signs of cartilaginous fracture and extraluminal air if obtained. The most common complaint associated with cartilaginous fractures is hoarseness, but dyspnea, hemoptysis, globus sensation, ecchymosis, hematoma, crepitus, and pain may be present. None of these signs and symptoms is predictive of injury severity.</p><p>MDCT has some limitations. Degloving injury of the cartilage with denuded mucosa can be missed, as can certain types of laryngotracheal separation and mucosal perforation. Pediatric cartilaginous structures are poorly calcified and may be more difficult to visualize than an adult larynx. Streak artifact from metallic foreign bodies can obscure visualization of structures. However, in most cases, injuries missed by MDCT do not require operative repair, including minor edema, hematoma, minor denuded cartilage, and nondisplaced fractures [<a href="#rid60">60</a>].</p><p>Further studies may be necessary in patients with clinical signs of injury or those at high risk for occult injury whose initial imaging, including MDCT, is nondiagnostic. Flexible nasopharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy provide additional methods for assessing laryngotracheal trauma. Endoscopy enables thorough evaluation when scatter artifact from metallic objects obscures computed tomography (CT) images.</p><p>Flexible nasopharyngoscopy allows visualization of the hypopharynx and supralaryngeal structures in an awake or sedated patient, while flexible laryngoscopy allows evaluation of the larynx. Rigid endoscopy allows for evaluation of the distal airway but requires general anesthesia.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19"><span class="h2">Vascular injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Evaluation of suspected vascular injury in patients with PNI will vary based on institutional preferences and resources. Options include MDCT-A, standard angiography, duplex ultrasound, and possibly magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). MDCT-A demonstrates sensitivity and specificity approaching 100 percent for detecting vascular injury and is widely considered the first-line imaging study in stable patients with soft signs of injury [<a href="#rid55">55,61,62</a>]. Conventional angiography may be needed if metallic debris obscures bullet trajectory and anatomic detail on CT. Duplex ultrasound is operator-dependent but has been shown to have high sensitivity and specificity in experienced hands for identifying vascular injuries [<a href="#rid63">63-65</a>]. Studies other than MDCT-A are generally best performed in consultation with the trauma surgeon and radiologist to ensure an appropriate and efficient workup.</p><p>In the past decade, MDCT-A has widely replaced conventional angiography for the initial evaluation of suspected vascular injury in stable patients with PNI. It has been incorporated into many trauma protocols as the initial imaging modality of choice. One prospective study of 453 patients with PNI reported 100 percent sensitivity and 97.5 percent specificity of MDCT-A for identifying clinically significant injuries [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]. Aside from its accuracy detecting vascular injuries, MDCT-A has the added benefits of wide availability (around the clock at most hospitals), speed of performance (the entire neck can be scanned in minutes), and ability to detect nonvascular injuries [<a href="#rid53">53,66,67</a>]. In patients with a history of hypersensitivity to radiocontrast media, alternative methods of diagnostic imaging may be needed, and radiology should be consulted to determine the best approach. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2075.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis and treatment of an acute reaction to a radiologic contrast agent"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113083.html" rel="external">"Patient evaluation prior to oral or iodinated intravenous contrast for computed tomography", section on 'Patients with past reactions to contrast'</a>.)</p><p>Angiography demonstrates sensitivity and specificity of close to 100 percent and has been considered the gold standard in stable patients for decades [<a href="#rid68">68</a>]. It may be the best study to diagnose certain vascular injuries, especially if procedures such as embolization or stent placement are anticipated or when artifacts obscure CT images of the vasculature. Suspected distal carotid artery lesions may be better assessed using angiography as less invasive studies have limitations in that region. Some have argued that arteriography enables better surgical planning, but this concept is largely obsolete [<a href="#rid66">66,68-70</a>].</p><p>Two- or four-vessel angiography is costly and invasive (complications occur in approximately 2 percent of patients) and consumes a great deal of resources. Additionally, angiography may not be available at all hospitals and at all times. These factors, combined with the high number of negative studies and advancements in MDCT-A technology, have led many trauma specialists to use noninvasive tests coupled with careful physical examination for the initial evaluation of possible vascular neck injuries [<a href="#rid1">1,71,72</a>]. If chosen, angiography should include the carotid and vertebral vessels, the intracranial portion of the carotid artery in zone III injuries, and the aortic arch with its branches in zone I injuries.</p><p>Duplex ultrasound is fast, noninvasive, and inexpensive, but highly operator dependent. In combination with a careful physical examination, duplex ultrasound can detect or suggest the presence of vascular injury and may represent an alternative to angiography in select patients [<a href="#rid63">63,64</a>]. In one prospective study of 82 patients with PNI, the combination of careful physical examination using a written protocol and duplex ultrasound detected 10 of the 11 vascular injuries identified by conventional angiography, and both injuries that required surgical repair [<a href="#rid65">65</a>]. Similar results in additional prospective studies suggest that a combination of an unremarkable physical examination performed according to a standard protocol, negative plain chest radiograph, and negative duplex ultrasound can effectively rule out significant vascular injury, defined as a lesion requiring surgical repair [<a href="#rid1">1,46,63</a>].</p><p>Duplex ultrasound has limitations, including an inability to image the distal intracranial portions of the carotid artery and portions of the vertebral artery and the proximal subclavian vessels. In addition, duplex ultrasound may not accurately detect pseudoaneurysms and artifact (eg, from bony fractures, metallic foreign bodies, subcutaneous air), which can obscure vascular structures. Lastly, subcutaneous air in the soft tissues can limit the exam.</p><p>MRA is not a first-line study to detect vascular injury following penetrating neck trauma. There are no large, prospective studies comparing MRA with conventional angiography or to MDCT-A. MRA has several drawbacks, including lack of availability and longer scan time. Monitoring of the patient is also more difficult during the performance of the study.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20"><span class="h2">Pharyngoesophageal injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although relatively uncommon, penetrating esophageal injuries are notoriously insidious, and delays in diagnosis carry mortality rates as high as 20 percent [<a href="#rid8">8,23,25</a>]. Delays over 24 hours further increase the mortality rate. If pharyngoesophageal trauma is suspected, MDCT alone is inadequate for definitively ruling out injury, although it often identifies some sign of injury [<a href="#rid73">73</a>]. In some studies, the sensitivity of MDCT for pharyngoesophageal injury is reported to be as low as 53 percent [<a href="#rid43">43,74</a>]. Direct esophageal studies (eg, contrast swallow and endoscopy) can provide a diagnosis and are reported to have a sensitivity of nearly 100 percent.</p><p>Given potential difficulties in diagnosis and the consequence of delays, many trauma specialists obtain imaging studies to rule out esophageal injury in all cases of PNI associated with soft signs of esophageal injury or wounds close to the pharynx or esophagus (so-called "proximity wounds"). MDCT is typically the initial study performed because it detects laryngotracheal, vascular, and some esophageal injuries simultaneously and rapidly. In addition, if a pharyngoesophageal injury is not directly identified, proximity wounds prompt the treating physician to order definitive studies to exclude violation of the pharynx or esophagus.</p><p>A plain neck or chest radiograph showing retropharyngeal air or pneumomediastinum, respectively, suggests esophageal injury, but neither test is specific. In such cases, immediate surgical consultation should be obtained to determine management or the choice of subsequent imaging should the patient not proceed immediately to the operating suite.</p><p>Practice guidelines from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) suggest that either endoscopy of the esophagus or esophagography can be used to rule out significant esophageal injury in stable patients with PNI [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. If the patient can cooperate, a Gastrografin or thin <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9180" href="/z/d/drug information/9180.html" rel="external">barium</a> swallow can be performed first, and if nondiagnostic, flexible esophagoscopy can be performed, increasing sensitivity to nearly 100 percent [<a href="#rid15">15,59</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21"><span class="h1">DEFINITIVE MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22"><span class="h2">Consultation and disposition</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with a penetrating neck injury (PNI) can be categorized as unstable with signs reflecting severe injury (eg, stroke, airway obstruction, shock), stable with soft signs or symptoms suggesting injury (eg, dysphagia, nonexpanding hematoma, minor bleeding), or asymptomatic.</p><p>Unstable patients and those with hard signs of significant injury are taken immediately to the operating room for definitive treatment [<a href="#rid15">15,56</a>]. Despite essentially all literature on this topic supporting immediate neck exploration in any patient with hard signs of vascular injury, there is a subgroup that might benefit by a slightly different pathway. Some have recommended, in a select group with hard signs of vascular injury (eg, expanding hematoma, bruit, thrill) who are hemodynamically stable, that a multidetector computed tomography with angiography (MDCT-A) may be beneficial prior to neck exploration as treatment may be interventional rather than operative. Asymptomatic patients should be observed and evaluated with serial physical examinations or institution-specific protocols involving ancillary diagnostic studies such as MDCT-A. Multiple observational studies suggest that asymptomatic patients with PNI can be managed nonoperatively with serial examination [<a href="#rid22">22,55</a>]. We recommend immediate surgical consultation for all cases of PNI and placement of the asymptomatic patient in a monitored setting for close observation lasting a minimum of 24 hours.</p><p>Controversy arises with the management of stable PNI patients manifesting soft signs of injury. MDCT-A is a powerful diagnostic tool and the initial study of choice for essentially all of these patients pending contraindications [<a href="#rid54">54,56</a>]. Additional testing is often based upon MDCT-A findings. As an example, a high (zone III) vascular lesion evident on MDCT-A may mandate conventional angiography and stent placement. If the MDCT-A is indeterminate for aerodigestive tract injury (eg, computed tomography [CT] reading: "air bubbles seen; cannot exclude aerodigestive injury"), further evaluation (eg, esophagography, endoscopy) is indicated. Definitive management in such cases will vary according to clinical circumstance, local surgical practice, and hospital resources.

A retrospective review of a large trauma database found the incidence of cervical spine fracture to be 1.35 percent with gunshot wounds and 0.12 percent with stab wounds to the neck. The incidence of spinal cord injury was even lower. All patients with cervical spinal cord injury had a neurologic deficit at initial presentation. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and possibly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are useful for the diagnosis of these injuries [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H782074166"><span class="h2">Pediatric considerations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The incidence of PNI in children is substantially lower than in adults (0.3 versus 5 to 10 percent) [<a href="#rid79">79</a>]. In general, the presentation and management of the pediatric patient with a PNI are the same as in adults [<a href="#rid80">80</a>]. Of note, in infants and younger children, the standard anatomic neck zones do not readily apply. Guidelines for the transport of children with PNI may vary by location and are likely different than those for adults [<a href="#rid81">81</a>]. Transfer to a hospital with expertise managing pediatric trauma is ideal. Prior to transport, airway stabilization should be assured. In addition, careful inspection for both global and focal neurologic deficits should be performed whenever possible, as such injuries may be less apparent in pre-verbal children.</p><p>A number of imaging modalities, including MDCT-A, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and conventional angiography, can be used to exclude vascular injury in both adults and children. At most institutions, MDCT-A is considered the standard test for the initial evaluation of any patient without indications for immediate operative intervention but with soft signs of injury. Because there are so few pediatric patients with PNI, there is little evidence to guide management, and recommendations are based on adult studies [<a href="#rid79">79,82</a>].</p><p>In stable patients being managed at centers experienced with PNI and MRA, this approach to diagnostic imaging may be preferable in order to limit radiation exposure. However, limited availability, length of the procedure, the need for sedation in any uncooperative or frightened child, and difficulty monitoring the airway may make this approach less attractive. MRA may be useful in the child with PNI who is otherwise completely asymptomatic.

These are generally divided into three zones according to location  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52642" href="/z/d/graphic/52642.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Mortality in patients with PNI appears to be highest with zone I injuries (below the cricoid cartilage), which can also involve adjacent intrathoracic structures. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a class="local">'Anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prehospital care</strong> – Any patient with a PNI can decompensate rapidly and should be transported immediately to the nearest trauma center, if possible. Impaled objects should <strong>not</strong> be removed in the field. Bag-mask ventilation (BMV) can become problematic if an airway injury is present and air is forced into soft tissue planes, leading to anatomical distortion. Cervical spine injury from PNI is uncommon, and immobilization is not necessary in many instances. (See <a class="local">'Prehospital care'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial evaluation and intervention</strong> – Initial management follows standard trauma protocols in most institutions. Obtain emergency surgical consultation for all PNIs, aside from obviously superficial injuries. Unstable patients should receive definitive care in the operating suite  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef51111" href="/z/d/graphic/51111.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Do <strong>not</strong> explore neck wounds in the emergency department. Traumatic arrest in the emergency department is an indication for emergency thoracotomy in patients with PNI.
