When asked about the impact of epilepsy on their quality of life, patients list driving as their top concern [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Current regulations and guidelines try to balance these potentially conflicting goals.</p><p>Driving restrictions for patients with epilepsy date back to the first issuance of drivers' licenses, when patients with epilepsy were essentially banned from driving [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. With the development of effective antiseizure medications, and the recognition that many patients with epilepsy were well controlled and therefore at low risk for seizures while driving, laws have been successively revised to relax this total restriction.</p><p>However, the basis for deciding which patients with epilepsy are safe to drive is supported by somewhat limited evidence. As a result, regulations vary considerably in different states and countries, and there is a lack of consensus even among experts. Clinicians must be aware of the regulations in the state or country in which they practice, which may change over time.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">MAGNITUDE OF RISK</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The contribution of epilepsy to the burden of motor vehicle crashes is not entirely certain. From population statistics and survey data, it is estimated that 0.01 to 0.1 percent of all crashes are attributable to seizures [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. Estimates of the relative risk of a motor vehicle crash in a person with epilepsy compared with other drivers range from 1.0 to 2.0 [<a href="#rid6">6-11</a>]. One study, which analyzed death certificate data, determined that seizures caused 0.2 percent of motor vehicle fatalities [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. In this study, the estimated rate of fatal crashes for patients with seizures (8.6 per 100,000) was actually less than that reported in the total population (22 per 100,000). Fatal crash rates were eight times greater for those who abused alcohol than for patients with seizures.</p><p>These and other studies suggest that for persons with epilepsy, the risk of a motor vehicle crash is similar or slightly higher than in patients with other medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes [<a href="#rid9">9,13</a>] and compares favorably with risk of crash in other conditions such as sleep apnea, alcoholism, dementia, cellular telephone use, and drivers under 25 years [<a href="#rid7">7,13-15</a>].</p><p>However, these data do not support a conclusion that driving restrictions for persons with epilepsy are always unfairly discriminatory. One must consider that data on epilepsy and motor vehicle crash risk are collected under current driving restrictions. While adherence is imperfect, driving regulations almost certainly do limit driving by persons with epilepsy and thereby lower crash rates compared with what they might be if all persons with epilepsy drove unrestricted.</p><p>It is also possible that available statistics underestimate the number of seizure-related accidents. It is not always obvious that a seizure has caused a crash. Patients with seizures who are involved in a crash may not report their condition for fear of liability and loss of driving license. Many states do not routinely collect information regarding motor vehicle crashes associated with seizures unless there is personal injury or property damage other than to a motor vehicle [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. In one study of 50 seizure-related crashes, only half were reported to the motor vehicle division by the police, patient, family, or clinician [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. The exact number of licensed drivers with epilepsy is unknown, as not all patients (only 14 to 50 percent) report their condition to the licensing bureau [<a href="#rid3">3,18,19</a>].</p><p>Concern for higher rates of motor vehicle crashes in epilepsy patients is demonstrated by the following studies:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a 10-year Danish cohort study of 159 patients with epilepsy and 559 controls, 10 patients with epilepsy and 5 controls had a motor vehicle crash for which they were referred to an emergency department [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. This represented a seven-fold higher rate of crash per 1,000 person-years in patients with epilepsy compared with controls. It may be that the risk appears higher in this study because individuals with crashes caused by seizures (because of postictal confusion or witnessed convulsion) are more likely to be referred for medical evaluation than individuals with crashes unrelated to seizures. It is also important to note that in most cases, the medical record did not identify that seizure was the cause of the crash.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among 367 patients with medically refractory epilepsy referred for surgical evaluation who completed a survey, 31 percent had driven within the previous year; more than half of these drove daily [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Almost 40 percent had had a seizure while driving at some point in their history, and 27 percent had had a seizure-related motor vehicle crash. However, this is a subset of patients that have more frequent seizures and are therefore at higher risk of seizure-related crashes.</p><p></p><p>It has been suggested that seizure-related motor vehicle crashes are less severe [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. However, one survey of drivers with epilepsy in England found that, while the overall crash rate was similar to people without epilepsy, there was a 40 percent increase in the relative risk of serious injury and a two-fold increase in the relative risk of nondriver fatalities [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. This study did not distinguish between seizure-related crashes and nonseizure-related crashes in the drivers with epilepsy. However, in other population-based studies, seizure-related crashes were less likely to involve another car (32 versus 78 percent) [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. In an Australian study, 71 seizure-related motor vehicle crashes were compared with nonseizure-related crashes as controls; seizure-related crashes more frequently involved a single vehicle (57 versus 29 percent), had a single occupant (95 versus 48 percent), and involved collision with a fixed object (54 versus 17 percent) [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p>Some studies suggest that most seizures that cause a motor vehicle crash are seizures classified as focal with alteration of consciousness (75 percent) [<a href="#rid5">5,23</a>]. Other data suggest that patients with primary generalized and secondary generalized convulsions may also have a higher risk of crash than population controls [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p>Of note, a motor vehicle crash occurring as a result of a first-time seizure is not preventable by driving regulations for epilepsy. Some series estimate these to make up 9 to 18 percent of seizure-related crashes, although not all these data were not systematically collected [<a href="#rid5">5,17</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H374714194"><span class="h1">RISK FACTORS FOR SEIZURE-RELATED CRASHES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Seizure-free interval</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A variety of factors influence an individual patient's risk for seizure recurrence and therefore risk of seizure-related motor vehicle crash. However, the seizure-free interval has been widely adopted by regulatory agencies as a practical measure of driving risk. The seizure-free interval is also used to gauge seizure remission and has demonstrated utility in guiding the decision to discontinue antiseizure medications. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2220.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of epilepsy in adults", section on 'Estimating risk of seizure recurrence'</a>.)</p><p>There is some evidence that the seizure-free interval influences crash risk. In an epilepsy clinic-based case-control study, 50 patients with epilepsy involved in motor vehicle crashes were compared with 50 age- and sex-matched drivers with epilepsy who were not involved in crashes during the same study year [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. The seizure-free interval was the strongest predictor of crash. The duration of seizure-free interval was associated with a reduced odds ratio (OR) of crash: 0.08 for &gt;12 months, 0.15 for &gt;6 months and 0.43 (no longer statistically significant) for &gt;3 months.</p><p>By contrast, a study found no difference in the reported rates of seizure-related crashes before and after a state law reduced the required seizure-free interval from 12 to 3 months [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. A death certificate analysis of fatal seizure-related crashes also did not find significant differences between states with shorter (three month) versus longer (6 to 12 month) requirements for freedom from seizures, but the study had limited power for this analysis [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>Many feel that this experience reflects a trade-off between a potentially safer, longer seizure-free interval requirement, versus the increased adherence with a shorter seizure-free interval requirement. That is, while a longer seizure-free interval decreases the risk that an individual will experience a seizure-related crash, increased adherence to the shorter time requirement results in overall fewer seizure-related crashes, because fewer individuals with uncontrolled seizures are driving.</p><p>A consensus statement from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), American Epilepsy Society (AES), and the Epilepsy Foundation of America (EFA) advocates a three-month seizure-free interval, with allowance for modifiers that may extend or shorten the interval (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71502" href="/z/d/graphic/71502.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. A 2017 outcome study from Maryland, a state that implemented these consensus guideline regulation for drivers with epilepsy, supports such proposed standards [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Other risk factors'</a> below and <a class="local">'Mitigating factors'</a> below.)</p><p>In comparison, a symposium of clinicians and driving regulators from the European Union advocated a one-year seizure-free interval [<a href="#rid26">26</a>], and a symposium in Canada elicited a consensus for a 6- to 12-month seizure-free requirement [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. However, regulations in states and countries may differ substantially from consensus guidelines. One pilot study proposed use of a standardized, rigorous decision tree method to more objectively determine fitness to drive in epilepsy [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Compared with the existing conventional certification system in two Australian states, the decision tree model found that among patients considered fit to drive by their physician, six percent did not meet the national standard to drive [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p>In general, neither guidelines nor regulations should substitute for clinical judgment. As an example, a patient who has regularly had seizures every four or more months for many years, may at times be seizure-free for three months and therefore eligible for licensure in some states; however, such patients probably warrant a longer seizure-free interval before driving would be considered acceptably safe [<a href="#rid3">3,17,24</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H374714297"><span class="h2">Discontinuing medication</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We suggest that clinicians warn patients about the increased risk of seizure occurrence when medications are reduced or stopped. In some cases, frequent driving by a patient may be a reason to continue antiseizure medications despite a long period of seizure remission [<a href="#rid29">29,30</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2220.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of epilepsy in adults", section on 'Discontinuing antiseizure medication therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Because the risk for seizures during medication discontinuation is as high as for some patients with newly diagnosed seizures, some clinicians suggest that patients refrain from driving until they have been seizure-free off antiseizure medications for the same interval of time recommended for the initial seizure-free interval in their state or country. Some states and countries require patients to refrain from driving for a period of time after antiseizure medications are stopped [<a href="#rid16">16,31</a>], while others do not have specific regulations in this regard.</p><p>The MRC Antiepileptic Drug Withdrawal study prospectively followed 406 patients with epilepsy who were in remission for at least two years and had been randomly assigned to slow antiseizure medication withdrawal [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. The recurrence risk for these patients was 30 percent over twelve months following antiseizure medication withdrawal. Among those who were seizure-free for three months following antiseizure medication discontinuation, the 12-month seizure recurrence risk was 15 percent, and for those who were seizure-free for six months, the risk was 9 percent.</p><p>There is limited information regarding seizure or crash risk during and after antiseizure medication withdrawal or change in medication. In a case-control study of seizure-related crashes, switching or tapering antiseizure medications significantly reduced, rather than increased, the odds of a crash [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. One possible explanation for this observation is that patients voluntarily modified or reduced their driving during that time.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Other risk factors</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Aside from seizure-free interval and antiseizure medication discontinuation, other potential risk factors for motor vehicle crash in persons with epilepsy include [<a href="#rid24">24,32</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nonadherence with medication or medical visits, or lack of credibility</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Alcohol or substance misuse</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Structural brain disease</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Uncorrectable brain functional or metabolic disorder</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Frequent seizure recurrences after seizure-free intervals</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prior crashes caused by seizures</p><p></p><p>The presence of any of these risk factors should lead the clinician to consider extending the seizure-free interval requirement for driving, but no specific recommendations for the length of the extension in any of these situations have been made [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Patients may also be advised of an increased driving risk if they miss an antiseizure medication dose or in the setting of other provocative conditions such as sleep deprivation.</p><p>Most of these were identified because they are risk factors for recurrent seizures rather than for motor vehicle crash per se. While one case-control study did not find that antiseizure medication noncompliance was a risk factor for crash, several crashes did occur in temporal approximation with missed antiseizure medication doses [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Clinicians should warn patients about possible driving risks after missing antiseizure medication doses.</p><p>Concerns have been raised about persons with epilepsy who have very brief epileptic events that are unnoticed in daily life, but may be detected on electroencephalogram (EEG); these may affect cognition [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Studies have found that these may correlate with impairment on attention tasks while driving in some patients [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. However, individuals show strikingly different responses between the level of performance and spontaneous EEG discharges. Increased vigilance in driving may actually suppress epileptic discharges in some individuals [<a href="#rid5">5,34</a>]. We are not aware of any regulatory agency or any published guidelines suggesting the use of EEG abnormalities to restrict driving.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Nonseizure-related risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some studies suggest that most motor vehicle crashes in persons with epilepsy are not seizure-related [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. This is difficult to ascertain. However, underlying brain disease and the cognitive effects of antiseizure medications may contribute to accidents in persons with epilepsy [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. The sedating effects of antiseizure medications are of greatest concern when a drug is first started or the dose is increased.</p><p>Clinicians should also consider neurologic deficits other than seizures (eg, cognition, visual field defects) when giving advice or making recommendations for driving. Patients who undergo epilepsy surgery for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy often have a postoperative visual field cut, but this is typically not of sufficient degree to require driving restriction. Decisions regarding the legality to drive are based on prescribed visual criteria, which differ by state and region. The most common acceptable requirement is 102 degrees of horizontal peripheral vision. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5247.html" rel="external">"Homonymous hemianopia", section on 'Driving'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3005.html" rel="external">"Approach to the evaluation of older drivers", section on 'Cognitive function'</a>.)</p><p>Clinicians caring for people with epilepsy may become involved with episodic disorders that mimic epileptic seizures. These may be termed nonepileptic events. Unlike epileptic seizures, these events are not a consequence of abnormal electrical discharges of the brain but are instead due to other physiologic disorders, such as syncope or migraine, or are psychogenic in nature (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2227.html" rel="external">"Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>). When there is a physiologic cause for the events, management should focus on that condition, and rules regarding driving are governed accordingly. When events are not due to physiologic causes, they may be termed functional. Various other terms are used, with the most popular currently being psychogenic nonepileptic seizures. Recommendations about driving for patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures should be individualized (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/131655.html" rel="external">"Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures: Management and prognosis", section on 'Driving safety'</a>). In addition, there is an International League Against Epilepsy guideline regarding driving for individuals with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">MITIGATING FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A consensus statement of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), American Epilepsy Society (AES), and the Epilepsy Foundation of America (EFA) identified specific factors that should be considered to modify the duration of the required seizure-free interval for driving with epilepsy [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. These favorable modifiers may shorten or even negate this interval:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Seizures during medically directed changes in medication</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Focal seizures (only) that do not interfere with consciousness or motor function</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Seizures with consistent and prolonged auras</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Seizures related to acute toxic or metabolic states or illnesses that are not likely to recur or cause epilepsy (acute symptomatic seizures)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An established pattern of pure nocturnal seizures</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Seizures occurring under a clear provocation (sleep deprivation), if that provocation can be avoided</p><p></p><p>It is important to note that some licensing bureaus include mention of such mitigating factors, but most do not [<a href="#rid16">16,26</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Legal requirements'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4146453"><span class="h2">Single unprovoked seizure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some countries, including Canada, shorten the recommended seizure-free interval for single unprovoked seizures [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. In the United Kingdom, individuals who experience a single unprovoked seizure (ie, a seizure of idiopathic or unknown cause or remotely related to a prior brain injury such as a stroke or trauma [a so called remote symptomatic seizure]) are usually allowed to regain ordinary driving privileges after a shorter seizure-free interval (6 months) than individuals with established epilepsy or recurrent seizures (12 months). The United Kingdom guidelines aim to allow driving for individuals with a first unprovoked seizure who have a &lt;20 percent risk of experiencing a recurrent seizure in the next year, and use seizure freedom after a single seizure as a guideline [<a href="#rid38">38,39</a>].</p><p>However, certain clinical factors have been reported to increase the risk of seizure recurrence after a single unprovoked seizure, including having a known brain lesion as the cause of the seizure (a remote symptomatic seizure), an epileptic abnormality on electroencephalography (EEG), a significant abnormality on brain imaging, or a nocturnal seizure [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. Such factors and others must therefore be considered in determining risk of seizure recurrence and reinstatement of the driving privilege for individuals after single unprovoked seizure.</p><p>A prospective study that included nearly 1400 adults with a first-ever seizure found that a non-driving period of eight months was required for the monthly risk of seizure recurrence to fall to 2.5 percent; this time period varied by type of seizure and other factors [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. A monthly seizure risk of 2.5 percent translates into an accident risk ratio of approximately 2.6, which is in the range of what has been considered acceptable by some advisory panels (although this is not a uniformly accepted or agreed upon standard) [<a href="#rid26">26</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4146459"><span class="h2">Acute symptomatic seizure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A seizure that occurs due to a temporary illness or related to an isolated event that is unlikely to recur (acute symptomatic seizure) may not require any driving restriction. State regulatory authorities have the ultimate legal responsibility for determining when a patient may drive after a seizure, but physicians provide input and may offer guidance to patients about risks. It is advisable to inform patients to avoid driving until a full evaluation is completed, and it is determined by the regulatory authority that the risk of seizure recurrence is sufficiently low that the patient may resume driving safely. A distinction should be made for acute symptomatic seizures that occur as a result of acute stroke or head trauma; these may not herald epilepsy, but these patients are at higher risk of recurrent seizures. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2213.html" rel="external">"Posttraumatic seizures and epilepsy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2220.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of epilepsy in adults", section on 'Poststroke seizures'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4146465"><span class="h2">Focal seizures</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The presence of reliable auras before seizures has been associated with a lower risk of motor vehicle accidents due to seizures. In one case-control study, drivers with epilepsy who had consistent, reliable auras were less likely to have a motor vehicle crash than those without consistent auras (odds ratio = 0.08) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Patients with reliable auras who crashed included those with brief auras, those blocked in traffic who were unable to pull over to the side of the road, and those who had frequent auras that were not always followed by seizure. However, a later case-control study found that reliable auras were not associated with lower crash risks [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. Patients should be advised of the potential risk of seizure auras and cautioned to pull off the road and stop driving if they experience a seizure aura.</p><p>While focal seizures that do not affect consciousness are considered low risk for crash, it has been reported that motor activity without loss of consciousness during focal seizures has been responsible for some crashes [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Driving risk should be individually assessed for these patients based on their symptoms.</p><p>While it may be reasonable to modify or negate a seizure-free interval requirement for some individuals who only have focal seizures without alteration of consciousness, pure nocturnal seizures, or seizures with reliable, prolonged auras, the pattern of these seizures must be well established. Some recommend a stable pattern for at least one year [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. As an example, in the United Kingdom, driving is allowed for patients with nocturnal seizures if the pattern includes sleep-only attacks for three years in a patient who has had at least two seizures in the past 10 years [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. However, sleep-only attacks are not without risk. In a systematic review of reports of patients with pure sleep-related epilepsy, the annual risk of an awake seizure was estimated to be as high as 5.7 percent [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. Many of the awake seizures occurred during medication withdrawal. Patients with frontal lobe epilepsy were excluded from the largest of the included papers in this review; it is possible that they are at a different risk of daytime seizure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97852.html" rel="external">"Sleep-related epilepsy syndromes"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h1">LEGAL REQUIREMENTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is not surprising, given the limited available evidence, that regulating authorities have developed quite different laws regarding driving and epilepsy [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. In the United States, these are state specific. Most, but not all specify a seizure-free interval that is required for patients to meet prior to licensure and driving. Some licensing bureaus mention some of the mitigating factors discussed above, but most do not.

Clinicians neither grant nor suspend driving privileges; this is the sole legal prerogative of the state. Nonetheless, physicians should counsel patients regarding the risks associated with driving and epilepsy and the applicable driving laws in their state [<a href="#rid45">45</a>].</p><p>Clinicians are required to report their patients with seizures to driving authorities in some states and countries but not others [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Monetary fines are the most common penalty for failure to report [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. Physicians not reporting when required are potentially open to other legal actions.</p><p>Most consensus statements oppose mandatory clinician reporting [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Mandatory reporting decreases the number of active drivers licenses in persons with epilepsy, but it is not proven that this reduces motor vehicle crash risk [<a href="#rid47">47-49</a>]. The percentages of patients driving with uncontrolled seizures are similar in those Canadian provinces with and without mandatory reporting [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. Mandatory reporting has many other negative consequences, including underreporting of seizures by patients to their clinicians [<a href="#rid3">3,7,47,50-52</a>].</p><p>In most states, clinicians are asked to supply medical reports for patients who have notified their motor vehicle bureau about their seizures. In some, treating doctors actually determine specific driving restrictions for their patients [<a href="#rid3">3,7</a>]. The clinician's role is to inform the patient of risks and laws regarding driving and epilepsy. Some state regulatory authorities may request medical information and may also ask the physician whether the patient should drive. That recommendation should be reasonable and consistent with the prevailing standard of care and published guidelines. In general, clinician liability for certifying that a patient may be licensed to drive is minimal under those conditions [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. It is advised that the clinician document discussions about driving in the patient's medical record [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>In some instances, even in states without mandatory reporting, it may be appropriate for a clinician to report a patient driving with epilepsy to state authorities. As an example, a patient with uncontrolled seizures that causes a crash because of a seizure is at high risk for subsequent crashes. If such a patient refuses to self-report, we strongly consider and often report the patient ourselves. We inform the patient and document in the chart that we advised the patient to stop driving immediately. A letter sent to the state is brief and factual, stating simply that this is my patient, the patient has seizures, and the patient was advised by me not to drive. A copy of that same letter is sent to the patient.</p><p>It is important to note that some states offer legal protection for such reporting while others do not; clinicians should therefore be aware of their professional responsibilities and the legal requirements of the states and countries in which they practice. When determining whether to report a patient’s medical condition that may impair driving, physicians may have to weigh conflicting guidelines: a professional obligation to report and a legal requirement to maintain confidentiality, even in the face of danger to the public [<a href="#rid53">53</a>].</p><p>Because state and country regulations vary widely and may change over time, direct consultation with the department of motor vehicles is recommended to provide the most current information regarding state-specific regulations.

While specific rules and procedures vary among states, potential drivers are usually questioned at the time of licensure application about medical conditions that might affect driving; epilepsy or seizures are usually specifically mentioned [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Some confusion also exists as to reporting requirements for people with legal driving licenses who experience recurrent or new seizures [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Most state motor vehicle administrations may assume that people are required to report seizures immediately, but do not always specifically indicate when a seizure must be reported, or specify when a person is required to stop driving after a seizure. In fact, the wording of some state regulations implies that epilepsy or seizures need only be reported at the time of license renewal, but this is probably not their intent.</p><p>This policy of voluntary reporting is not entirely effective. Many drivers with epilepsy fail to report their condition on license applications [<a href="#rid3">3,5,17,18</a>]. Among 638 patients counseled by their clinician to notify the licensing bureau about a new diagnosis of seizures, only 27 percent complied [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p>Patients fail to report for a variety of reasons. Some simply wish or need to continue driving. Others fear the stigma of a license suspension. Others may be ignorant of their responsibility. Surveys indicate that a minority (14 to 44 percent) of patients with epilepsy is aware of their state's driving regulations regarding epilepsy [<a href="#rid52">52,54</a>]. In one British study of adults with a first seizure, only 21 percent received the correct advice about driving [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]. Among patients who continue to drive despite opposing advice from their physician, employment-related factors are the most common reasons for noncompliance [<a href="#rid52">52,56</a>].</p><p>Failure to report has significant consequences for patients if involved in a motor vehicle crash. Insurance companies may not assume liability if a patient has failed to report. Patients may also be financially and even criminally responsible for damage and injury resulting from seizure-related crash [<a href="#rid46">46</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Commercial drivers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Commercial driving restrictions for people with seizures or epilepsy are stricter than those pertaining to private motor vehicle use. In the United States, regulations regarding commercial vehicles involved in intrastate commerce vary among individual states. They often parallel restrictions for noncommercial driving, but are usually stricter and require a longer seizure-free interval. Individually, states are increasingly implementing standards for intrastate commercial driving that are similar to the federal government standards for interstate commercial driving. Many states have specific regulations concerning school bus or other bus drivers [<a href="#rid3">3,57</a>].</p><p>Federal regulations before April 2014 specifically prohibited interstate commercial driving by any person with epilepsy or taking antiseizure medications [<a href="#rid3">3,24</a>]. These standards remain in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration Medical Examiner Handbook [<a href="#rid58">58</a>] but have effectively been modified to allow exceptions or waiver for individuals who apply, based on the slightly less strict recommendations for restrictions of a 2007 expert panel [<a href="#rid59">59</a>]. However, the process of obtaining these approvals is rather complicated and requires an individual specifically apply for exception from the prior restrictions [<a href="#rid22">22,59,60</a>]. Examples of the recommendations that govern these exemptions include the following [<a href="#rid59">59</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An individual must have been seizure-free for a minimum of eight years on or off antiseizure medications, and:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>if all anti-seizure medications have been stopped, the individual must have been seizure-free for minimum of eight years from the time of medication cessation, or</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>if still using anti-seizure medication, the individual must have been on a stable medication regimen for a minimum of two years.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An individual with a history of epilepsy who has been granted conditional certification to drive a commercial motor vehicle must be recertified on an annual basis.</p><p></p><p>People who experience a seizure caused by a known medical condition, such as an acute infection or metabolic disturbance (acute symptomatic seizure), are deferred from licensure as commercial drivers until they are fully recovered from that condition and have no significant residual complications.
