         The diagnosis of iron deficiency (low iron stores, as measured by iron studies or other testing) is a major public health goal and an important aspect of the care of many adults. This topic will review the causes of iron deficiency in adults and an approach to the diagnostic evaluation. Treatment of iron deficiency in adults is discussed separately. (See

         Iron deficiency, as defined by one of the tests listed below (see
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnosis'
         </a>
         below), affects a large proportion of the world's population, especially females of childbearing age, children, and individuals living in low- and middle-income countries  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef143450" href="/z/d/graphic/143450.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The absolute prevalence of iron deficiency depends on the population studied.
        </p>
        <p>
         In all of the studies evaluating the scope of the problem, iron deficiency is more prevalent than iron deficiency anemia (low hemoglobin or hematocrit caused by iron deficiency), and females are affected more than males.
        </p>
        <p>
         As examples:

         A 2023 analysis of the global burden of anemia from 1990 to 2021 found iron deficiency to be the most common cause of anemia and of years lived with disability worldwide [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. A previous global burden of anemia analysis found iron deficiency to affect approximately one in five females [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. For virtually every population (males, females, different regions of the world), iron deficiency accounts for the largest proportion of cases of anemia. These findings are illustrated in the figure  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef143450" href="/z/d/graphic/143450.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ).

         Data from the United States (US) general population have been collected periodically from various groups such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. The prevalence of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia from one such survey from 2002 is summarized in the figure  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100702" href="/z/d/graphic/100702.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). Subsequent surveys on selected populations suggest that the percentages of individuals with iron deficiency have not declined substantively over time [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. It has been estimated that the proportion of menstruating females in the United States who have minimal or absent iron reserves is at least 20 percent and may be as high as 65 percent [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ].

         A 2020 study from England found higher rates of iron deficiency without anemia, using ferritin levels in 4451 non-anemic individuals over 50 years of age who were enrolled in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Of these, 389 (8.7 percent) were found to be iron-deficient, defined as a ferritin &lt;30 ng/mL (&lt;30 mcg/L). The prevalence of non-anemic iron deficiency was higher in females than males (10.9 versus 6.3 percent). Other features associated with a higher likelihood of non-anemic iron deficiency included alcohol consumption on more than one day per week and elevated C-reactive protein.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Considerations regarding screening are discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Screening (asymptomatic individuals)'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The greater prevalence of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in females of childbearing age is attributed to menstruation and childbirth, as discussed in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115637.html" rel="external">
          "Anemia in pregnancy", section on 'Iron deficiency'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Iron deficiency anemia in older adults is also greater than that seen in the general population. In a series of 190 adults in the community &gt;65 years of age with anemia, 12 percent were due to iron deficiency [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Racial and ethnic disparities in iron deficiency are also present. Analysis of over 60,000 females ≥25 years of age in the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) study in the United States found the following prevalence of iron deficiency (defined as ferritin &lt;15 ng/mL and transferrin saturation (TSAT) &lt;10 percent) [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10

         The prevalence of iron deficiency was 5.2 percent in Native Americans and 3.1 percent in Pacific Islanders, although fewer participants from these groups were included in the study [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Carrier status for a hereditary hemochromatosis variant in the
         <em>
          HFE
         </em>
         gene (C282Y or H63D) did not correlate with the prevalence of iron deficiency in any racial or age group in HEIRS participants. It is likely that this study underestimated the prevalence of iron deficiency because it used very stringent cutoffs for ferritin and TSAT. Higher values (ferritin of &lt;30 ng/mL and/or TSAT of ≤19 percent) have a 98 percent sensitivity and 92 percent specificity for absent bone marrow iron. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnosis'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Blood donors in the general population typically have slightly lower iron stores than non-donors, although this rarely translates to iron deficiency anemia [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Various blood donor series from a number of North American and European countries have estimated the rate of subclinical iron deficiency in the range of 5 to 15 percent [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13
         </a>
         ]. This has led some experts to consider screening for iron deficiency and/or recommending iron supplementation for blood donors, as discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7949.html" rel="external">
          "Blood donor screening: Overview of recipient and donor protections", section on 'Anemia'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         As discussed separately, iron deficiency is very common early in pregnancy (prevalence &gt;50 percent in one series), suggesting that iron deficiency was present prior to the pregnancy [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. (See

         The major causes of iron deficiency are decreased dietary intake, reduced absorption, and blood loss. Details are summarized in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef139069" href="/z/d/graphic/139069.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         In adults in resource-rich countries, dietary intake is almost always adequate, and it is usually reasonable to assume that the cause is blood loss until proven otherwise, with the implied need to search for and identify the cause. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Search for source of blood and iron loss'

         The major cause of iron deficiency in resource-rich countries is blood loss, either overt or occult [

         ]. Gastrointestinal or gynecologic sources are common, depending on the patient population.

         Overt bleeding is obvious and not difficult for the clinician to recognize, often by history alone:

         Typical iron loss during pregnancy has been estimated at approximately 1000 mg for pregnancy, delivery, and nursing. Menstrual blood losses account for approximately 1 mg of iron loss per day. (See

         Typical iron loss during hemodialysis may be as much as 2 g per year, which is highly likely to produce iron deficiency without supplementation. (See

         Iron is absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract; the duodenum is the site of maximal absorption [

        <p>
         However, several factors determine the efficiency of iron absorption, and certain medical conditions may interfere with normal uptake of dietary iron  (

          table 1

         ). The most clinically important are disorders that affect the mucosal cells responsible for iron absorption, such as celiac disease, atrophic (autoimmune) gastritis,
         <em>
          Helicobacter pylori
         </em>
         infection, and bariatric surgery. Inherited disorders that interfere with iron absorption are very rare.

        <p>
         Sources of reduced iron absorption may be considered in individuals with gastrointestinal symptoms or those who do not have an adequate response to oral iron supplementation. Regardless of whether reduced iron absorption is documented, a source of bleeding should be excluded. (See

         Dietary heme iron (iron from meat rather than plant sources) is better absorbed than non-heme iron, but both sources are important. A review of published studies evaluating vegetarians and non-vegetarians found that those who consumed a vegetarian diet were more likely to be iron deficient [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. However, non-heme iron is available from a wide array of vegetables and supplemented grains and cereals, as summarized in the table  (

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         A number of foods may impair iron absorption such as tannates (found in tea), phosphates, phytates (mineral-binding compounds found in whole grains and seeds), and foods high in calcium  (

         Iron needs to be conjugated to vitamin C, amino acids, or sugars in the presence of gastric acid to protect it from the alkaline secretions in the proximal jejunum, which will otherwise convert the iron to ferric hydroxide (rust), which is unabsorbable. Bariatric surgery includes a number of procedures to promote weight loss by limiting gastric reservoir capacity and/or shortening the length of functional small intestine, leading to malabsorption. Procedures that bypass the duodenum such as roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS) have the greatest risk of causing iron deficiency because they reduce the site of maximal absorption and in some cases reduce gastric acid availability.

         An acidic gastric environment facilitates absorption of iron, especially non-heme iron. However, reduced gastric acidity by itself is unlikely to cause clinically significant iron deficiency in an individual with an adequate dietary iron intake and a normally functioning gastrointestinal tract.
        </p>
        <p>
         Medications that reduce gastric acidity, especially proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), have been proposed to reduce iron absorption. This is mainly based on observational studies, which suggest a dose-response relationship between the dose of PPI (or duration of use) and risk of iron deficiency [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34,35
         </a>
         ]. However, these studies indicate association rather than causation; individuals taking a PPI are more likely to have gastrointestinal conditions that lead to bleeding or reduced iron absorption, such as those listed above. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Celiac disease/atrophic gastritis/H. pylori'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         If an individual with iron deficiency is taking a PPI, antacid, or histamine receptor blocker, we do not attribute iron deficiency to the medication without performing an evaluation for bleeding or reduced iron absorption as indicated for the individual. Further, we take the opportunity to re-evaluate whether the PPI is actually indicated, and we review the symptoms that led to PPI use and make sure they are properly evaluated. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5.html" rel="external">
          "Proton pump inhibitors: Overview of use and adverse effects in the treatment of acid related disorders"

        </p>
        <p>
         Medications that increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding may cause iron deficiency (eg, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs],

         A response to treatment with erythropoietin (EPO) for the anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD) often leads to the discovery of absolute or functional iron deficiency (see
         <a class="local">
          'Absolute versus functional deficiency'
         </a>
         below) since the iron requirements generated by this response in the short term can usually not be met by mobilization of the iron stores alone [

         This is a particular problem with maintenance hemodialysis. Individuals undergoing hemodialysis may lose an average of 2 g of iron per year, mainly from repeated blood testing and blood losses within the hemodialysis circuit [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. Iron deficiency will develop in almost all patients undergoing dialysis who are treated with EPO, as well as some individuals with CKD who are not receiving dialysis, unless supplemental iron is administered. This subject is discussed in separate topic reviews. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1943.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         EPO or other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are also used for patients with cancer-associated anemia. The anemia may be multifactorial and include a component of bleeding and iron deficiency. In addition, functional iron deficiency due to hepcidin, the primary mediator of anemia of chronic disease/anemia of inflammation, may limit the availability of iron and the response to erythropoiesis-stimulating agent therapy in these patients, and those with borderline iron stores may rapidly develop more classic features of iron deficiency.

         In published case reports as well as our own experience, patients with IRIDA are not anemic at birth, and the clinical phenotype develops after the neonatal period (eg, after one month of age). Suspicion of IRIDA usually occurs during a pediatric routine evaluation. However, in some patients, the condition is recognized only in adulthood, either because the anemia is mild or because it has been misclassified. Patients present with mild hypochromic, microcytic anemia with very low serum iron levels and low transferrin saturation.

         The normal body iron content in an adult is approximately 3 to 4 grams. The majority of iron is present in circulating red blood cells (RBCs), with additional iron in myoglobin and certain enzymes, as well as iron in storage and transport forms  (

        </p>
        <p>
         Storage iron in males has been estimated as being approximately 10 mg/kg, and is found mostly in the monocyte-macrophage system in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Females have less storage iron, depending upon the extent of menses, pregnancies, deliveries, and iron intake. In one study, 93 percent of United States females 20 to 45 years of age had iron stores of 5.5±3.4 mg/kg, while the other 7 percent had an iron deficit of 3.9±3.2 mg/kg [
         <a href="#rid61">
          61
         </a>
         ]. Diet, previous pregnancies, degree of menstrual blood loss, and socioeconomic circumstances may contribute to variation in iron stores. The storage pool can be looked upon as a reserve of iron that can be utilized when there is increased need for hemoglobin synthesis, as in acute blood loss, growth in children and adolescents, pregnancy, lactation, and response to treatment with erythropoietin.

         Iron deficiency occurs in several stages, as illustrated by progressive changes in laboratory findings  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76236" href="/z/d/graphic/76236.html" rel="external">
          table 4

         <a href="#rid15">
          15,19
         </a>
         ]. These stages are defined by the extent of depletion, first of iron stores and then of iron available for hemoglobin synthesis. Eventually, if negative iron balance continues, production of iron-deficient RBCs and anemia occurs.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the first stage, iron stores can be totally depleted without causing anemia. Once these stores are depleted, there is still enough iron present in the body within the "labile" iron pool from the daily turnover of red cells for normal hemoglobin synthesis, but the individual becomes vulnerable to development of anemia should there be further iron losses. Some individuals with extremely low levels of serum ferritin, but without anemia, may have symptoms of fatigue or show decreased exercise tolerance at this stage.
        </p>
        <p>
         Further loss of iron results in anemia, which is initially normocytic with a normal absolute reticulocyte count  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76236" href="/z/d/graphic/76236.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ). This stage of iron deficiency is common in the United States. As noted above, estimates have suggested that 20 to 65 percent of menstruating females in the United States have absent iron stores [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7,62

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Common laboratory findings at this stage include:

         Increased levels of transferrin (Tf; total iron binding capacity [TIBC]). If only transferrin concentrations are available, they can be converted to the TIBC (in mcg/dL) by multiplying the transferrin concentration (in mg/dL) by 1.389.

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         More profound deficiency results in the classical findings of anemia with RBCs that are hypochromic (low mean corpuscular hemoglobin [MCH]) and microcytic (low mean corpuscular volume [MCV]). Reticulocyte production cannot be increased in the setting of iron deficiency, and the reticulocyte count becomes inappropriately low (despite being in the "normal" range in many cases). It is worth noting, however, that other concomitant causes of anemia such as vitamin B12 deficiency may cause macrocytosis and obscure the microcytosis caused by iron deficiency. (See

         The normal physiologic changes in response to iron deficiency produce a number of compensatory changes, including increased production of erythropoietin and reduced production of hepcidin, provided that renal function is normal and that the individual does not have an inflammatory condition that suppresses hepcidin production. The mechanisms of these changes are discussed in detail separately. (See

         The usual presenting symptoms in adults with iron deficiency are primarily due to anemia. The same symptoms may also be present in those with severely reduced iron stores and extremely low serum ferritin who are not anemic. Typical symptoms include [

         These may be present in varying degrees and may not be appreciated at all until after iron deficiency is identified and treated. Many patients recognize in retrospect that they had fatigue, weakness, exercise intolerance, and/or pica (see
         <a class="local">

         The classic presentation pattern in a patient without comorbidities is a multigravid female who presents with tiredness and fatigue and a complete blood count (CBC) that shows anemia with low MCV (eg, hemoglobin 8 g/dL, MCV 75 fL) and a peripheral blood smear that shows microcytic, hypochromic RBCs  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64267" href="/z/d/graphic/64267.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). Iron studies are likely to show low iron in the range of 10 mcg/dL, low ferritin (below 30 ng/mL), and increased transferrin (around 400 mcg/dL) or high TIBC, with a low calculated transferrin saturation (TSAT; below 20 percent). Such a patient is likely to have a brisk response to iron therapy. It is also important to consider the possibility of gastrointestinal blood loss, even in a menstruating female.

         The specific substances that are craved may depend on what is available and what is considered culturally acceptable [
         <a href="#rid66">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The craving for these non-food substances may be intense. During pregnancy, pica may also be misinterpreted as food cravings unrelated to iron status. However, pica is a symptom of iron deficiency, which is very common in pregnancy. Testing for iron deficiency should include hemoglobin as well as iron studies (at a minimum, ferritin). Individuals may be symptomatic from iron deficiency before becoming anemic; hemoglobin alone is insufficient for testing. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115637.html" rel="external">
          "Anemia in pregnancy", section on 'How to screen for iron deficiency'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Overall, pica may be seen in many clinical settings and is not considered specific for iron deficiency. However, pagophagia (pica for ice) is considered quite specific for iron deficiency [
         <a href="#rid66">
          66,68-70
         </a>
         ]. It may be present in patients who are not anemic and responds rapidly to treatment with iron (disappears during iron infusions), often before any increase is noted in the hemoglobin concentration. In one study of 55 unselected patients with iron deficiency anemia secondary to gastrointestinal blood loss, pica was present in 32 (58 percent), which manifested as pagophagia in 28 (51 percent of the total; 88 percent of those with pica) [
         <a href="#rid68">
          68
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Pica may also contribute to iron deficiency by reducing iron absorption, depending on the substance ingested (see
         <a class="local">
          'Reduced iron absorption'
         </a>
         above). Its mechanism in individuals with iron deficiency is not well understood.

         Beeturia is a phenomenon in which the urine turns red following ingestion of beets. Beeturia is increased in individuals with iron deficiency but the finding is not specific for iron deficiency. It has been noted in approximately 10 to 14 percent of healthy individuals following ingestion of beets and in as much as 49 to 80 percent of individuals with iron deficiency [
         <a href="#rid71">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Beeturia is caused by increased intestinal absorption and subsequent excretion of the reddish pigment betalaine (betanin) present in beets. Betalaine, a redox indicator, is decolorized by ferric ions, which presumably explains the predisposition to beeturia when adequate amounts of iron are not available for decolorization of this pigment.

         Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also called Willis-Ekbom disease, is a disorder in which there is an unpleasant or uncomfortable urge to move the legs during periods of inactivity. The discomfort is relieved by movement, often instantaneously. A number of changes in the central nervous system have been correlated with RLS. Of these, reduced iron in the central nervous system has been a consistent finding, regardless of total body iron stores. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4892.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical features and diagnosis of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in adults", section on 'Pathophysiology'

        </p>
        <p>
         RLS is common in the general population, in some series affecting 5 to 15 percent of adults, especially in white populations. Iron deficiency may be one of the more common causes of RLS, and RLS may be one of the more common clinical manifestations of iron deficiency. As examples:

         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         In a 2023 series of 987 medical records of individuals with laboratory-confirmed iron deficiency, 398 (40 percent) of the records mentioned RLS [
         <a href="#rid70">
          70
         </a>
         ].

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         In a 2013 series of 251 patients with iron deficiency anemia referred to a community-based hematology practice, the prevalence of clinically significant RLS was 24 percent, approximately nine times higher than that seen in the control population [
         <a href="#rid74">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         While overall findings linking RLS to iron deficiency are not conclusive, they warrant the measurement of hemoglobin and iron parameters in individuals who present with this symptom, and administration of iron when stores are low. A 2018 guideline from the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group provides a consensus on intervention with oral or intravenous iron [
         <a href="#rid75">
          75
         </a>
         ]. Some clinicians will give a trial of iron therapy even when iron parameters are normal as some will experience a reduction in symptoms. This subject is discussed in depth separately. (See

In a series of 2516 nonpregnant females age 20 to 44 years, iron deficiency correlated with depressive symptoms even after adjusting for confounders, especially if they had a low-income (prevalence ratio 1.27, 95% CI 1.03-1.58) [

          Kidney disease

         For these patients, it is reasonable to obtain a complete blood count (CBC) and review the hemoglobin and red blood cell (RBC) indices, especially mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and to take a history for possible causes of blood loss. (See

         For those with microcytic or normocytic anemia, a reticulocyte count should be used to determine whether there is decreased RBC production, which is consistent with iron deficiency; increased RBC destruction (hemolysis); or blood loss. (See

          Source of deficiency
         </strong>
         – Even before the diagnosis of iron deficiency is confirmed, patients with suspected iron deficiency should be evaluated for the source of the deficiency. In many developed countries, iron deficiency is more likely to be due to blood loss in menstruating or pregnant females and adults of either sex, and it is more likely to have a dietary component in children and menstruating females, reflecting an imbalance between physiologic demands and intake, and in vegetarians. In the less developed world, parasitic infestations may be a significant contributing issue [
         <a href="#rid83">
          83
         </a>
         ]. The evaluation may include a thorough history and physical examination. Additional testing is discussed below, including colonoscopy if iron deficiency is confirmed. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Search for source of blood and iron loss'

         <strong>
          Bone marrow (usually not required)
         </strong>
         – The gold standard for documenting iron deficiency is an iron stain (Prussian blue stain) of a bone marrow aspirate smear to assess iron stores in bone marrow macrophages and erythroid precursors (sideroblasts) on marrow spicules. Lack of stainable iron in erythroid precursors as well as bone marrow macrophages is consistent with iron deficiency, whereas in anemia of chronic disease, increased stainable iron is seen in marrow macrophages but stainable iron is absent or reduced in erythroid precursors  (

         However, as noted in the following sections, other less-invasive and less-expensive methods are available and effective for confirming or excluding iron deficiency in the vast majority of cases. In some cases where there is an obvious other explanation for anemia and the patient is undergoing bone marrow testing, iron deficiency may be a surprise finding. In these cases, it is important to ensure that proper controls and confirmatory testing is performed. (See

         </span>
         Changes in the CBC occur in proportion to the severity of iron deficiency and tend to lag behind changes in iron studies; reduced storage iron precedes anemia. In turn, a slight decline in hemoglobin (usually 1 to 2 g/dL) precedes microcytosis  (

         The low RBC count is useful for distinguishing iron deficiency from thalassemia in an individual with markedly microcytic anemia and an abnormal blood smear. (See

         The platelet count may be increased in iron deficiency anemia. This is thought to result from stimulation of platelet precursors by erythropoietin. (See

        <p>
         The low MCV and MCH are reflected on the peripheral blood smear by microcytic, hypochromic RBCs  (

         ). As anemia progresses, increasingly abnormal forms (poikilocytosis) may be seen.
        </p>
        <p>
         Automated counting of reticulocytes has also allowed measurement of reticulocyte indices (similar to RBC indices) that include reticulocyte volume, reticulocyte hemoglobin content, and reticulocyte hemoglobin concentration [
         <a href="#rid84">

          85

        <p>
         Ferritin is the most useful test, if low, since there is no other cause of low ferritin besides iron deficiency. Otherwise, patients require iron and total iron binding capacity (TIBC), from which one calculates transferrin saturation (TSAT) [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,20,78
         </a>
         ]. To avoid the inconvenience and cost of an additional office visit, our practice is to order all three tests (serum ferritin, iron, and TIBC) in nearly all patients. It is important to consider the entire clinical picture when deciding which tests to order and when evaluating test results.
        </p>
        <p>
         Expected results of these and other tests in adults with iron deficiency are as follows  (

          Serum iron
         </strong>
         – Iron can be measured in serum (preferred) or plasma. The test measures circulating iron, most of which is bound to the transport protein transferrin. Serum iron is low in iron deficiency as well as in anemia of chronic disease/anemia of inflammation (ACD/AI). This is because levels of serum iron depend on the efficiency of iron recycling by bone marrow and reticuloendothelial macrophages, which is reduced in both conditions. Serum iron can also fluctuate with iron-containing supplements and dietary intake as well as normal diurnal variation. By itself, low serum iron is not diagnostic of any condition but must be evaluated in light of other tests such as transferrin saturation and ferritin. As serum iron may be transiently affected by absorption of dietary or pharmacologic iron, it is recommended that the sample be drawn after an overnight fast. (See

          Transferrin saturation
         </strong>
         – Transferrin saturation (TSAT) is the ratio of serum iron to TIBC: (serum iron  ÷  TIBC  x  100); if not provided directly it can be calculated (

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In iron deficiency, iron is reduced and TIBC is increased, resulting in a lower transferrin saturation. Normal values are in the range of 25 to 45 percent [
         <a href="#rid88">
          88,89
         </a>
         ]. Values below 10 percent are common in individuals with iron deficiency, and a cutoff of ≤19 percent is generally used to screen for iron deficiency, although other thresholds may be used in some settings such as pregnancy (see
         <a class="local">
          'Pregnancy'

          "Anemia in pregnancy"

         ). Because the TSAT is a ratio, in principle, an increase in the serum iron (eg, due to hemolysis or recent ingestion of an iron tablet) can raise the value, even in an individual who has iron deficiency and an increased TIBC.

         ]. The ferritin concentration that predicts the absence of marrow iron is debated. While many sources use a cutoff level of 12 to 15 ng/mL (99 percent specific but only 57 percent sensitive), our practice is to use a cutoff of 30 ng/mL, which is supported by bone marrow correlations and international guidelines [
         <a href="#rid91">
          91,92

          93

          Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and sTfR-ferritin index
         </strong>
         – Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), also called circulating transferrin receptor or serum transferrin receptor, is a circulating protein derived from cleavage of the membrane transferrin receptor on bone marrow erythroid precursor cells. Its concentration in serum is directly proportional to erythropoietic rate and inversely proportional to tissue iron availability, similar to serum transferrin [
         <a href="#rid95">
          95
         </a>
         ]. Thus, iron-deficient patients generally have increased levels of sTfR, with reference ranges determined by the individual laboratory performing the testing. Different laboratories may report sTfR as mg/L or as nmol/L. sTfR is not used in routine practice but can be helpful in complex cases (see
         <a class="local">
          'Patients with inconclusive initial testing or comorbidities'
         </a>
         below). The major advantage of sTfR is that it reflects overall erythropoiesis, which is increased in iron deficiency. Some studies have claimed that it is more useful than ferritin because it is unaffected by inflammation [
         <a href="#rid96">
          96
         </a>
         ]. However, sTfR can be elevated in patients with hemolysis or with administration of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs).

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         sTfR-ferritin index is calculated as the ratio of the sTfR (in mg/L) to the logarithm of the serum ferritin (in mcg/L): (sTfR  ÷  log[ferritin]). The sTfR reflects erythropoiesis, while the ferritin reflects the tissue iron stores; thus, a high sTfR-ferritin index (eg, above 2 to 3) is very likely to be a sign of iron deficiency due to increased erythropoietic drive and low iron stores. This index may be especially useful for population-based studies and for distinguishing between iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease/anemia of inflammation (ACD/AI) (see

          RBC protoporphyrin and RBC zinc protoporphyrin
         </strong>
         – In iron deficiency, intestinal zinc absorption increases, and zinc is incorporated into protoporphyrin in developing RBCs. Thus, elevated erythrocyte (RBC) zinc protoporphyrin (eg, &gt;80 mcg/dL) is consistent with iron deficiency. However, zinc protoporphyrin is not specific for iron deficiency as it may be elevated in inflammatory states, hemodialysis, and lead poisoning. These assays are not widely available or routinely used for diagnosing iron deficiency. Their role in the diagnosis of other disorders (eg, lead poisoning, porphyria) is discussed separately. (See

          Reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr)
         </strong>
         – The reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr, also called Ret-He) is available on some autoanalyzers and has the potential of providing very rapid information about iron status (at same time as CBC), especially in the presence of iron-restricted erythropoiesis [
         <a href="#rid104">
          104
         </a>
         ]. Unlike the serum ferritin, the CHr is not influenced by inflammation. This parameter is used more extensively in individuals with chronic kidney disease; there is less information regarding its role in managing anemia and iron therapy in other adults. A study in 556 unselected anemic individuals (Hb &lt;13 g/dL) indicated that the combination of Hb &lt;10.3 g/dL plus CHr &lt;28.5 pg was 84 percent sensitive and 78 percent specific in predicting response to iron [

         ). One caveat to remember when considering the CHr is that individuals with thalassemia have reduced RBC hemoglobin content due to decreased globin chain synthesis; in these individuals, a low CHr is unreliable for diagnosing iron deficiency, although an elevated CHr can exclude iron deficiency.

          106,107
         </a>

         Intravenous iron also increases serum iron and TSAT, and as a result, may alter the results of iron studies testing, similar to oral iron [
         <a href="#rid108">
          108

        <p>
         The use of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors in individuals with chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease appears to reduce the ferritin level (perhaps to a more accurate representation of iron stores) and increase the TSAT [
         <a href="#rid109">
          109-111
         </a>
         ]. This may reflect the reduction in hepcidin and improved iron availability that these agents produce. In such cases, the serum ferritin is likely to be most representative of the level of iron stores despite its acute phase reactivity. (See

        <p>
         Data evaluating the effects of recent blood transfusion on iron studies are limited. One study showed transient elevation of the serum iron and resultant TSAT within the first 24 hours of a blood transfusion [
         <a href="#rid112">
          112
         </a>
         ]. However, other studies have shown only small, subclinical changes in iron parameters. As an example, a study that measured iron parameters 48 to 72 hours after a transfusion noted that in the individuals with low ferritin and TSAT prior to transfusion, 97 percent remained low after transfusion, and concluded that testing could be performed after transfusion [
         <a href="#rid113">
          113
         </a>
         ]. If there is any doubt about the results of testing, it may be prudent to wait a day after transfusion to order iron studies (if indicated) in a patient who received a transfusion, based on a theoretical concern for test interference from hemolyzed cells [
         <a href="#rid114">

        <p>
         In contrast to transient changes in iron studies related to the effects of a dose of iron on serum iron levels, true improvements in iron stores are expected if an iron-deficient individual receives supplemental iron and/or a blood transfusion. These improvements will be reflected in the iron studies (eg, serum ferritin and TSAT will increase, reflecting increased iron stores).

         Testing can be done using an iron studies panel, which includes serum iron, transferrin or total iron binding capacity (TIBC), calculated transferrin saturation (TSAT), and ferritin  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef138460" href="/z/d/graphic/138460.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). If one or more of the results is consistent with iron deficiency, this is typically sufficient to make the diagnosis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnosis'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Some clinicians prefer to order a single test rather than the entire iron studies panel. This is especially useful in individuals with a classic presentation, such as new onset microcytic anemia in a young female with heavy menstrual bleeding or a multiparous female, and/or when there is a desire to limit testing, provided it would not be overly burdensome to return for additional testing if needed (if the first testing is inconclusive), or if additional testing can be ordered as an "add-on" if needed. In such cases, either the ferritin or the TSAT can be used as the initial test.
        </p>
        <p>
         As noted above, the normal ferritin concentration ranges from 30 to 200 ng/mL (mcg/L) in otherwise healthy, iron-replete individuals (see
         <a class="local">
          'Iron studies (list of available tests)'
         </a>
         above). A ferritin level below 30 ng/mL is considered diagnostic of iron deficiency regardless of the patient's underlying condition or hemoglobin concentration. In individuals with anemia, a ferritin &lt;30 ng/mL is sufficient to diagnose iron deficiency. However, a ferritin in the normal range does not exclude iron deficiency in an individual for whom there is a strong suspicion for iron deficiency. A TSAT ≤19 percent can also be used, as discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnosis'

        <p>
         In contrast to a low ferritin,
         <strong>
          a low serum iron cannot be used to diagnose or exclude iron deficiency
         </strong>
         . Serum iron may be low in anemia of chronic disease/anemia of inflammation (ACD/AI) or increased by recent ingestion of an iron tablet. (See

         Evidence to support the use of serum ferritin alone in appropriate patients includes a several observational studies in anemic adults comparing serum ferritin with the gold standard test (bone marrow stainable iron), as well as a 1992 systematic review [
         <a href="#rid117">
          117

         ]. In this review, serum ferritin radioimmunoassay had the greatest predictive value for iron deficiency  (

         A ferritin level ≤15 ng/mL had a 99 percent specificity for iron deficiency. Ferritin ≤15 ng/mL was highly specific in individuals with inflammatory states.

         A ferritin ≤15 ng/mL had a sensitivity of only 59 percent, meaning that a large proportion of individuals with iron deficiency would be missed.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Using a higher ferritin cutoff may improve sensitivity while maintaining a reasonable specificity. Various observational studies comparing ferritin levels with bone marrow stainable iron have found that a ferritin cutoff of &lt;30 ng/mL provides a sensitivity in the range of 90 to 92 percent and a specificity in the range of 75 to 98 percent [
         <a href="#rid91">
          91,118-120
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The relative performance of these iron studies tests in diagnosing iron deficiency compared with bone marrow iron staining is illustrated in the figure  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66419" href="/z/d/graphic/66419.html" rel="external">

         <a href="#rid19">
          19,121-124
         </a>
         ]. This demonstrates that ferritin has the best performance in individuals without comorbidities; however, ferritin is an acute phase reactant and can increase in the setting of an infection or obesity [
         <a href="#rid121">
          121-123,125,126
         </a>
         ]. In such cases, TSAT may be more useful if low, or additional testing may be required. TSAT is a ratio of iron to TIBC, and it is most reliable when decreased due to an increase in TIBC. TSAT can be falsely elevated by recent intake of iron-containing foods or an iron tablet. (See

         Many individuals with iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia in resource-rich countries do not have the classic presentation of anemia with a markedly decreased ferritin, either because they come to medical attention before severe deficiency develops or because they have multifactorial anemia (eg, iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease). These patients may require additional assessment with a TSAT or other laboratory tests listed above (see
         <a class="local">

         In some patients the clinical situation is more complex, and additional evaluations and/or management considerations may predominate. Individuals with poorly controlled heart failure or diabetes may require a more thorough assessment of the reasons for poor control; individuals with other unexplained findings (eg, weight loss, adenopathy) may require further diagnostic testing for the cause of their symptoms. In such cases, it may be reasonable to defer a more extensive evaluation for iron deficiency and/or a therapeutic trial of iron until after these other issues are resolved.

         A presumptive diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia may be made using a therapeutic trial of iron in a patient with anemia who has an obvious cause of iron deficiency, such as individuals with a history of heavy menstrual periods or pregnancy, particularly in resource-limited settings where it is not possible to obtain iron studies routinely, as long as thalassemia is not a concern. In such cases, patients with iron deficiency anemia are expected to have a rapid and complete response to iron administration that includes resolution of symptoms, reticulocytosis, and normalization of hemoglobin level (typically by three weeks). A trial of iron in pregnant individuals with anemia was recommended in a 2020 United Kingdom Guideline on iron deficiency in pregnancy [
         <a href="#rid92">
          92
         </a>
         ]. (See

        <p>
         However, as noted above, this approach should be reserved for individuals for whom other causes of anemia are unlikely (eg, it should be reserved for young, otherwise healthy individuals who do not have thalassemia) because it does not address other causes of anemia or the source of blood/iron loss, which is a crucial component of management. Further, it may be difficult to determine the reason(s) for a lack of response to iron if iron studies are not available. Additionally, administration of iron to an individual with thalassemia will worsen the existing iron overload commonly seen in this condition. Thus, it may be prudent to obtain iron studies to confirm the diagnosis even in cases where iron deficiency is considered extremely likely. For patients who wish to avoid a return appointment, we find it cost-effective to order iron studies and prescribe iron therapy at the same encounter, with plans to obtain additional testing only if the initial testing was inconclusive.

         Diagnosis should be accompanied by identification for the cause of iron deficiency and a strategy to treat the deficiency, if clinically indicated, as well as management of the underlying cause of the deficiency  (

         ). For individuals with uncomplicated symptomatic iron deficiency or other comorbidities likely to benefit from iron repletion, the decision to treat with iron is straightforward. By contrast, there may be some individuals with significant comorbidities or other findings for whom it may be prudent to defer the correction of iron deficiency and avoid the gastrointestinal side effects of oral iron while addressing the patient's dominant findings.

         We diagnose functional iron deficiency in patients with chronic kidney disease or a malignancy who are candidates for treatment with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) if the serum ferritin is in the range of 100 to 500 ng/mL and the transferrin saturation is less than 20 percent (see
         <a class="local">
          'Absolute versus functional deficiency'
         </a>
         above). The implication is that these individuals would benefit from iron administration (typically, intravenous iron). (See

         Even before the diagnosis of iron deficiency is confirmed, individuals with suspected iron deficiency should be asked to provide information that might identify the source of the deficiency, which is more likely to be dietary in individuals in resource-poor settings and more likely to be due to blood loss in menstruating or pregnant females and adults of either sex  (

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         If iron deficiency is diagnosed and an obvious bleeding source is not identified, additional testing for possible occult gastrointestinal blood loss (eg, with endoscopy) is indicated for adults of all ages for whom a source of bleeding would be treated [
         <a href="#rid129">
          129
         </a>
         ]. A negative history of blood in the stool or negative fecal occult blood testing cannot be used to eliminate the possibility of a gastrointestinal source of bleeding, since bleeding may be intermittent and/or too small of an amount to turn the stool dark. Several of the common causes, such as colonic and uterine cancer, have ominous prognoses unless discovered and treated promptly. Evaluation in premenopausal females requires clinical judgement to determine whether iron deficiency can be attributed to menstrual blood loss and pregnancies or whether further evaluation is warranted.
        </p>
        <p>
         An exception might be an older individual who would prefer not to be treated or evaluated for malignancy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Evaluation for occult gastrointestinal bleeding and an approach to testing for gastrointestinal lesions is presented in detail separately. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         The use of an anticoagulant or the presence of severe thrombocytopenia are important to note as they may contribute to bleeding. However, anticoagulation or thrombocytopenia do not diminish the importance of searching for the site(s) of bleeding such as a gastrointestinal or colonic lesion, as these hemostatic changes are often more likely to unmask a bleeding source (and potentially result in earlier diagnosis) than to cause bleeding from a normal mucosa [
         <a href="#rid130">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Celiac disease is important to identify if present; this can present at any age and symptoms may be absent (or may only be appreciated in retrospect). Celiac disease is also a common cause of a lack of response to iron therapy in patients with known iron deficiency because it interferes with iron absorption. (See
         <a class="local">

        </p>
        <p>
         As mentioned above, the prevalence of autoimmune gastritis may be even higher than that of celiac disease, and testing may be appropriate for anti-parietal cell antibodies as well [

         – Thalassemias are inherited hemoglobin disorders associated with reduced production of alpha globin (alpha thalassemia), and beta globin (beta thalassemia). Like iron deficiency, thalassemia can cause microcytic anemia with hypochromic RBCs and target cells on the peripheral blood smear, the extent of which depends on the thalassemia phenotype  (

Like iron deficiency, some congenital sideroblastic anemias are described as microcytic. However, while cells derived from the sideroblastic clone are microcytic, the overall mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is typically normal or elevated in acquired sideroblastic anemia. Unlike iron deficiency, sideroblastic anemias are often associated with increased iron stores; bone marrow iron is required for the formation of ring sideroblasts. (See

          Anemia of chronic disease/anemia of inflammation (ACD/AI)

         – ACD/AI is characterized by reduced production of RBCs due to an inflammatory block; iron is present in the reticuloendothelial system and bone marrow macrophages but cannot be supplied to developing RBCs due to high levels of hepcidin, which traps iron in storage cells. Like those with iron deficiency, patients with ACD/AI may have microcytic or normocytic anemia with a low serum iron and low transferrin (or TIBC). Unlike those with iron deficiency, individuals with ACD/AI have a chronic inflammatory state, often with increased storage iron  (

          Other anemias
         </strong>
         – Other causes of anemia include renal failure, hypo- or hyperthyroidism, excessive alcohol use, and bone marrow disorders such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Lead poisoning rarely causes anemia unless it is severe. Like iron deficiency, these may develop gradually with nonspecific symptoms. Unlike iron deficiency, these anemias are associated with other laboratory findings rather than (or in addition to) evidence of decreased iron stores; in many cases the anemia is normocytic or macrocytic. MDS can be associated with microcytic or macrocytic anemia. Excess alcohol generally causes macrocytic anemia. (See

         </span>
         In clinical research and guideline panels, a clear distinction is made between evaluation of symptoms by obtaining a complete blood count (CBC) or CBC plus iron studies in a female with heavy menstrual periods and fatigue, versus screening, by obtaining a CBC or iron studies in a truly asymptomatic individual.
        </p>
        <p>
         In practice, these distinctions can blur. Symptoms can be subtle, and some patients may only become aware of symptoms in retrospect (eg, noting that they are no longer fatigued or irritable after iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia has been recognized and treated, even though they did not identify these symptoms at the time the diagnosis was made).
        </p>
        <p>
         For those who are asymptomatic, physicians often need to consider many factors including age, sex, menstrual and pregnancy history, gastrointestinal conditions that could affect absorption of iron, patient concerns, and family history, in determining whether it is appropriate to screen for iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ideally, the recommendation for individuals who are truly asymptomatic would be based on high-quality evidence from randomized trials that answered the question of whether screening improved patient-important outcomes. However, trials that compare screening versus not screening otherwise healthy individuals have not been conducted, and trials in which some individuals are not screened may be challenging to conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the absence of randomized trials, clinicians may benefit from reviewing the prevalence of iron deficiency, availability of resources for screening, and competing needs in their specific patient population.

         – Screening of individuals who are taking antithrombotic medications has not been extensively evaluated. Analysis of a trial that randomly assigned 19,114 older individuals (≥65 years for those identified as Black or Hispanic; ≥70 years for White) to receive daily aspirin (100 mg) or placebo for primary prevention of death or disability (the ASPREE trial) found that those assigned to aspirin had statistically significant increases in prevalence of anemia and iron deficiency [

          131
         </a>
         ]. The risk of anemia, assessed by annual hemoglobin testing, was 51 events per 1000 person-years with aspirin versus 43 events per 1000 person-years with placebo (hazard ratio 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.3). The risk of iron deficiency, defined as ferritin &lt;45 ng/mL and assessed in 7139 participants who underwent ferritin testing at baseline and after three years, was 13 percent with aspirin versus 9.8 percent with placebo. Most of the participants did not have clinically obvious bleeding; major bleeding occurred in 3 percent in the aspirin group and 2.1 percent in the placebo group, and this did not account for the effects on hemoglobin or ferritin.

          Individuals at low risk or who prefer not to be screened

         – In some populations, not screening for iron deficiency is reasonable. This is especially true for males, postmenopausal females, individuals who lack risk factors for iron deficiency, individuals for whom other aspects of medical care are more pressing, and individuals who are not concerned or distressed by the possibility of not being screened. These individuals may still have a CBC for other reasons, and if a CBC is done, the results, including the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), should be reviewed. (See

This may be most reasonable for individuals with a lower risk of iron deficiency and those for whom returning for a second test would not be overly burdensome.

         <strong>
          Causes
         </strong>
         – Major causes of iron deficiency include blood loss (menstrual, gastrointestinal) and reduced absorption (celiac disease,
         <em>
          Helicobacter pylori
         </em>
         , gastritis, bariatric surgery)  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ). Less common causes include erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), urinary or pulmonary hemosiderosis, or rare inherited disorders. (See

          Clinical findings
         </strong>
         – Clinical manifestations may include symptoms of anemia, pica, and restless legs syndrome. The examination may be normal or show pallor, alopecia, dry skin, atrophic glossitis  (

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Any individual with suggestive symptoms should be tested, either with CBC followed by iron studies or CBC and iron studies done simultaneously  (

          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Iron studies can be ordered as a panel (iron, transferrin or total iron binding capacity [TIBC], transferrin saturation [TSAT], and ferritin), or a single test (typically, ferritin) can be ordered, with additional testing if needed  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef143088" href="/z/d/graphic/143088.html" rel="external">

          Evaluation for the cause
         </strong>
         – A thorough history and examination should try to identify the cause. If the cause is not obvious, additional evaluations may include endoscopy and testing for conditions that decrease absorption, especially in individuals age 50 or older and those who do not have a response to iron repletion.
