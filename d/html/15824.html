However, there remain situations in which implantation of an ICD is immediately not feasible (eg, patients with an active infection), may be of uncertain benefit, may not be covered by third-party payers (eg, early post-myocardial infarction, patients with limited life expectancy or new onset systolic heart failure), or when an ICD must be removed (eg, infection).</p><p>In cases where ICD implantation must be deferred, a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD) offers an alternative approach for the prevention of SCD. The WCD (LifeVest [Zoll Medical Corporation] or Assure [Kestra Medical Technologies, Inc]) is an external device capable of automatic detection and defibrillation of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60103" href="/z/d/graphic/60103.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef140856" href="/z/d/graphic/140856.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). While the WCD can be worn for years, typically the device is used for several months as temporary protection against SCD.</p><p>The indications, efficacy, and limitations of the wearable cardioverter-defibrillator will be discussed here. Detailed discussions of the roles of the ICD are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/946.html" rel="external">"Secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91077.html" rel="external">"Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with cardiomyopathy and heart failure with reduced LVEF"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6129231"><span class="h1">DESCRIPTION AND FUNCTIONS OF THE WCD</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The WCD is an external device capable of automatic detection and defibrillation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The approved devices do not have pacing capabilities and therefore are unable to provide therapy for bradycardic events or antitachycardic pacing.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1225629183"><span class="h2">Wearing the WCD</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The WCD is composed of dry, nonadhesive monitoring electrodes, defibrillation electrodes incorporated into a chest strap or vest assembly, and a defibrillation battery and monitor unit  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60103" href="/z/d/graphic/60103.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>). The Assure WCD garment has two styles designed for female and male body habitus and different sizes. The monitoring electrodes are positioned circumferentially around the chest and provide two to four surface electrocardiogram (ECG) leads. The defibrillation electrodes are positioned in a vest assembly for apex-posterior defibrillation. Proper fitting is required to achieve adequate skin contact to avoid noise and frequent alarms.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1225629216"><span class="h2">Detection and delivery of shocks</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Arrhythmia detection by the WCD is programmed using ECG rate and morphology criteria. The system is programmed to define ventricular arrhythmias when the ventricular heart rate exceeds a preprogrammed rate threshold with an ECG morphology that does not match a baseline electrocardiographic template.</p><p>Typical programming is reflected in default device settings:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>VT detection 150 beats per minute (LifeVest) or 170 beats per minute (Assure). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Programmable ranges for LifeVest are 120 to 250 beats per minute, not to exceed the VF detection rate; for Assure they are, 130 to the programmed VF threshold minus 10 beats per minute. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>VF detection ≥200 beats per minute.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Programmable ranges are 120 to 250 beats per minute (LifeVest) or 180 to 220 beats per minute (Assure). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Treatment with 150 joules (LifeVest) or 170 joules (Assure) shocks for up to five shocks. </p><p></p><p>For the Zoll LifeVest WCD, the tachycardia detection rate is programmable for VF between 120 and 250 beats per minute, and the VF shock delay can be programmed from 25 to 55 seconds. The VT detection rate is programmable between 120 bpm to the VF setting with a VT shock delay of 60 to 180 seconds. VT signals can allow synchronized shock delivery on the R wave, but if the R wave cannot be identified, unsynchronized shocks will be delivered.</p><p>For the Kestra Assure WCD, the tachycardia detection rate is programmable for VF between 180 and 220 beats per minute, and for VT detection programmable from 130 beats per minute up to the programmed VF rate: 10 beats per minute. Detection utilizes a segment-based analysis of 4.8-second segments that continuously overlap by 2.4 seconds. VF confirmation requires two out of two segments (approximately 5 seconds), and VT confirmation requires 15 out of 19 segments (approximately 45 seconds). The first and last segments must be in the programmed treatment zone.</p><p>If an arrhythmia is detected, vibration and audible alarms are initiated. A flashing red light and shock icon are activated on the Assure monitor. Although shocks may be transmitted to bystanders in physical contact with the patient being shocked by a WCD, a voice cautions the patient and bystanders to the impending shock. Patients are trained to hold a pair of response buttons on the LifeVest device or press the alert button on the Assure device during these alarms to avoid receiving a shock while awake. A patient's response serves as a test of consciousness; if no response occurs and a shock is indicated, the device charges, extrudes gel from the defibrillation electrodes, and delivers up to five biphasic shocks at preprogrammed energy levels (ranging from 75 to 150 joules for the LifeVest device and 170 joules for the Assure device). The LifeVest device includes a default sleep time from 11 PM to 6 AM, programmable in one-hour increments, which allows additional time for deep sleepers, if they awaken, to abort shocks. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1225630641"><span class="h2">Efficacy in terminating VT/VF</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Shock efficacy with the WCD appears to be similar to that reported with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). However, sudden cardiac death may still occur in those not wearing the device, those with improper positioning of the device, due to bystander interference, due to the inability of the WCD to detect the ECG signal, or due to bradyarrhythmias. These results highlight the importance of patient education and promotion of compliance while using the WCD. </p><p>The efficacy of the WCD has been tested for induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias as well as for spontaneous events during clinical trials and postmarket studies. When worn properly, the WCD appears to be as effective as an ICD for the termination of VT and VF, with successful shocks occurring in up to 100 percent of cases [<a href="#rid1">1-7</a>]. </p><p>In a study of induced VT/VF in the electrophysiology laboratory, the WCD successfully detected and terminated VT/VF with 100 percent first-shock success [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The following large registry studies of patients with WCDs showed high shock success rates:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a US postmarket study of 8453 patients who wore a WCD after myocardial infarction, 146 VT/VF events occurred in 133 patients, and the overall shock success rate for terminating VT/VF was 82 percent, with 91 percent immediate survival [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. In this study, shock success resulting in survival was 95 percent in revascularized and 84 percent in non-revascularized patients, suggesting that lower efficacy rates may be related to ischemic events.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the WEARIT-II registry of 2000 patients who wore a WCD for a median of 90 days, 120 episodes of sustained VT/VF were seen in 41 patients [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. For 90 of the episodes, patients pressed the response buttons to abort shock delivery, with the majority of sustained VT episodes terminating spontaneously following use of the response button. All of the remaining 30 VT/VF episodes in 22 different patients were successfully terminated with a single shock.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among 6043 German patients who wore the device between April 2010 and October 2013, 94 patients were shocked for sustained VT/VF, with the WCD successfully terminating VT/VF in 88 patients (94 percent) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p>The WCD appears equally efficacious among patients with and without myocardial ischemia immediately prior to VT/VF detection and shock (as defined by ≥0.1 mV ST-segment changes on ECG), with first shock termination rates of 96 percent in both groups [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1225630813"><span class="h2">Avoiding inappropriate shocks</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>When electronic noise occurs, which may potentially be interpreted at VT or VF, the WCD emits a noise alarm. This electronic noise can often be minimized or eliminated by changing body position or tightening of the electrode belt, and shocks can be avoided by pushing the response buttons. While a dual-chamber ICD with an atrial lead would seemingly have greater ability to discriminate between supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and VT, the incidence of inappropriate shocks due to atrial fibrillation, sinus tachycardia, or other supraventricular arrhythmias in clinical studies of WCDs has been low. The LifeVest WCD uses a two-channel proprietary vectorcardiogram morphology matching algorithm to prevent shocks during SVT if the QRS is unchanged, and inappropriate shocks can also be averted when the patient presses the response buttons. The Assure WCD uses a four-channel ECG with a single noise-free channel required for analysis and an algorithm that excludes noisy and low amplitude channels  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef140843" href="/z/d/graphic/140843.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Inappropriate shocks'</a> below.)</p><p>In a small study of the 60 patients with a permanent pacemaker, in which a variety of pacing modes (AAI, VVI, DDD) and configurations (unipolar, bipolar) were tested, unipolar DDD pacing triggered VT/VF detection in six patients (10 percent), while no other pacing modes or configurations triggered arrhythmia detection [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. As such, patients whose pacemaker is programmed to unipolar DDD pacing should be evaluated for pacemaker reprogramming to a bipolar mode prior to WCD usage.</p><p>In a study of 130 patients with an ICD and fitted with an ASSURE WCD programmed for detection only and followed for 30 days, of 163 WCD-detected episodes, four were VT/VF and 159 were non-VT/VF with three false-positive shock alarm markers recorded, corresponding to a very low rate of inappropriate detection [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. No ICD-recorded VT/VF episodes meeting WCD programmed criteria were missed. Median daily use was high at 23 hours.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3675210949"><span class="h2">Bradycardia/asystole</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Neither of the approved WCDs deliver antibradycardic pacing, but they do record the ventricular rate when the heart rate decreases or asystole occurs:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For the LifeVest device, asystole recordings are triggered when ventricular heart rates drop below 10 beats per minute or 16 seconds of asystole, and the device automatically records the event with 120 seconds preceding the onset. If using the secure website in conjunction with the WCD, alerts can be configured to prompt the healthcare provider that a patient is experiencing bradycardia or an asystole.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For the Assure device, asystole is detected when there is no detected heart rate for &gt;20 seconds (five of seven segments with heart rate 0 beats per minute or amplitude &lt;100 uV); prolonged heart rates below 30 beats per minute may be detected as bradycardia. When asystole or bradycardia is detected, a loud alarm is triggered to attract bystanders and instruct them to call 911 and begin CPR if the patient is unconscious. The alert can be silenced by pressing the alert button or it resolves when a heart rate &gt;30 bpm is detected for &gt;30 seconds.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6129238"><span class="h2">Storage of ECGs and compliance data</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In addition to delivering therapeutic shocks for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, the WCD stores data regarding tachyarrhythmias, bradycardia/asystole (see <a class="local">'Bradycardia/asystole'</a> above), patient compliance with the device, and noise or interference with its proper functioning. Arrhythmia recordings from the WCD are available for clinician review once stored data are transmitted via a modem to the manufacturer's network. Treatments, patient compliance, ECG records, and system performance can be viewed using a secure website.</p><p>The WCD stores ECGs from arrhythmia detections, usage, and compliance trends:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For the LifeVest system:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The system is programmed to define ventricular arrhythmias when the ventricular heart rate exceeds a preprogrammed rate threshold with an ECG morphology that does not match a baseline ECG template.

Our recommended approach is consistent with that of the 2016 science advisory from the American Heart Association (also endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society) and the 2017 AHA/ACC/HRS guideline [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. Examples of persons who may benefit from the temporary use of a WCD include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with a permanent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) that must be explanted, or those with a delay in implanting a newly indicated ICD (eg, due to systemic infection).

The incidence of appropriate shocks was 5 per 100 persons over three months (1.67 percent per month) with mortality while wearing the device noted to be 0.7 per 100 persons over three months [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1225630269"><span class="h2">Bridge to indicated or interrupted ICD therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In some patients with an indication for ICD placement, implantation of the device may be delayed due to comorbid conditions, including [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Infection</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recovery from surgery</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lack of vascular access</p><p></p><p>In addition, patients with a preexisting ICD who develop device infection or endocarditis usually require system extraction to effectively treat the infection. Unless the patient is pacemaker dependent, reimplantation in many patients is deferred until the infection is completely cleared after an appropriate course of antibiotics. The WCD may provide protection against ventricular tachyarrhythmias during these periods until an ICD can be implanted [<a href="#rid4">4,5,16</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2146.html" rel="external">"Infections involving cardiac implantable electronic devices: Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a review of 8058 patients who were prescribed the WCD after ICD removal because of infection, median time to reimplantation was 50 days, and 334 (4 percent) experienced 406 ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) events, with 348 events treated by the WCD and 54 treatments averted by conscious patients [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].

Following discussion of the potential benefits and risks, use of the WCD within this 40-day window could be considered among motivated patients who have LVEF ≤35 percent and in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II or III, or LVEF &lt;30 percent and in NYHA class I, as these patients would be candidates for ICD implantation after 40 days [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. Patients should be reminded of the importance of compliance with the WCD in order to optimize any potential benefits on prevention of arrhythmic death. Reevaluation of LVEF should occur one to three months after the MI.

Improved compliance and acceptance of the WCD may be seen with newer devices, which are 40 percent smaller in size and weight or which offer multiple sizes and gender-specific fitting.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6129421"><span class="h1">USE OF THE WCD IN CHILDREN</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In December 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the WCD for use in children, although the WCD was used off-label prior to FDA approval [<a href="#rid56">56</a>]. As such, there are relatively few peer-reviewed publications documenting experience with the WCD in children [<a href="#rid57">57-59</a>]. </p><p>In a retrospective review of all patients &lt;18 years of age who were prescribed the WCD between 2009 and 2016 (n = 455 patients), median duration of use was 33 days and wear time 20.6 hours [<a href="#rid59">59</a>]. Eight patients received at least one shock (seven episodes of ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation [VT/VF] in six patients, two inappropriate shocks due to oversensing), with four of the seven episodes of VT/VF terminated with a single shock and all seven episodes successfully terminated by the WCD. There were seven deaths (1.5 percent); none were wearing the WCD at the time of death.</p><p>Children require special attention to assure compliance and correct fitting for optimal use. A variety of device harness sizes are available, but the smallest option may still be too large for smaller children. Additional data on clinical efficacy, compliance, and complications should be collected in children as WCD use increases. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2925598140"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

In cases where the need for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is felt to be temporary or implantation of the ICD must be deferred, a WCD may be an acceptable alternative approach for the prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD). (See <a class="local">'Description and functions of the WCD'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Device functions </strong>– In addition to delivering therapeutic shocks for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, the WCD stores data regarding arrhythmias, patient compliance with the device, and noise or interference with its proper functioning. Arrhythmia recordings from the WCD are available for clinician review once stored data are transmitted to the manufacturer's network. (See <a class="local">'Storage of ECGs and compliance data'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Efficacy </strong>– When worn properly, the WCD appears to be as effective as an ICD for the termination of VT and VF, with successful shocks occurring in nearly 100 percent of cases. In addition, inappropriate shock rates from the WCD appear to be comparable to and in some studies lower than those reported for ICDs. (See <a class="local">'Efficacy in terminating VT/VF'</a> above and <a class="local">'Inappropriate shocks'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Indications </strong>–<strong> </strong>The WCD is an option as temporary therapy for select patients with a high risk for SCD:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Among patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤35 percent who are less than 40 days post-myocardial infarction (MI), we discuss the potential benefits and risks of WCD use and offer it to highly motivated patients with NYHA functional class II or III, or LVEF &lt;30 percent and in NYHA class I, as these patients would be candidates for ICD implantation after 40 days. Reevaluation of LVEF should occur one to three months after the MI. If LVEF remains ≤35 percent on follow-up assessment, despite appropriate medical therapy, ICD implantation is indicated and should be considered. (See <a class="local">'Early post-MI patients with LV dysfunction'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91077.html" rel="external">"Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with cardiomyopathy and heart failure with reduced LVEF"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Among patients with LVEF ≤35 percent who have undergone coronary revascularization with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in the past three months, we offer a WCD to highly motivated patients for primary prevention against SCD. LVEF should be reassessed three months following CABG. If a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia has occurred, or if the LVEF remains ≤35 percent three months after CABG, implantation of an ICD is usually indicated. (See <a class="local">'Patients with LV dysfunction early after coronary revascularization'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/946.html" rel="external">"Secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91077.html" rel="external">"Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with cardiomyopathy and heart failure with reduced LVEF"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In selected patients with severe but potentially reversible cardiomyopathy, such as tachycardia- or myocarditis-associated cardiomyopathy, the WCD may be useful for the prevention of SCD due to ventricular arrhythmias while awaiting improvement in LV function, ICD implantation, or if needed, cardiac transplantation. (See <a class="local">'Newly diagnosed nonischemic cardiomyopathy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients with severe heart failure awaiting heart transplantation represent a group at particularly high risk for SCD in whom ICD implantation is often recommended. The WCD may be a reasonable noninvasive alternative approach, particularly for patients whose anticipated waiting time to transplant is short if an ICD is not already present. (See <a class="local">'Bridge to heart transplant'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Some patients with an indication for an ICD may require a delay in ICD implantation due to comorbid conditions (ie, infection, recovery from surgery, lack of vascular access). Additionally, some patients who have an ICD need it removed due to infection. In such patients, the WCD may provide protection against ventricular tachyarrhythmias until an ICD can be implanted or reimplanted. (See <a class="local">'Bridge to indicated or interrupted ICD therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Device limitations </strong>– Limitations of the WCD (compared with a traditional ICD) include the lack of pacemaker functionality, the requirement for patient interaction and compliance, and potential discomfort due to the size and weight of the device. (See <a class="local">'Limitations and precautions'</a> above.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Sharma PS, Bordachar P, Ellenbogen KA.
