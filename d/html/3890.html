         International travelers are frequently at risk of exposure to infectious pathogens and should seek advice about immunizations and other necessary prophylaxis prior to departure [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In preparation for a trip, individuals should arrange a pretravel consultation with either a specialized travel clinic or a primary care practice with expertise in travel medicine [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The traveler should come to the visits with a record of prior immunizations and an itinerary.
        </p>
        <p>
         Immunization needs are based on the traveler's prior immunizations, health conditions, and likely exposures while traveling  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef82688" href="/z/d/graphic/82688.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Those exposures depend upon the countries and regions to be visited and on the nature of potential exposures to infectious agents. For example, travelers with short-term tourism itineraries may have different requirements from those with longer-term occupational exposures. A pretravel consultation enables updating of routine immunizations to protect against illness due to infections for which there is an increased risk of exposure during travel (such as diphtheria, measles, mumps, and varicella) [

         Information on the indications, dosing, side effects, timing, and contraindications for immunizations in travelers are provided by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in a biennial, Health Information for International Travel [

         A standard immunization form should be part of the patient's medical record; the dedicated immunization history available in electronic medical records should be complete for all patients. Details to be recorded include vaccine type, dose, date of administration, manufacturer, lot number, and site of administration.

         YF is a mosquito-borne viral infection endemic in equatorial Africa and in areas of South America but not in Asia [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8,9
         </a>
         ]. Fatalities due to YF acquired by unvaccinated tourists have occurred [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10-13
         </a>
         ]. YF vaccination is legally required for entrance into specific countries, usually if the traveler is arriving from an endemic country; an intermediate airport transit stop of &lt;12 hours in an endemic country usually does not trigger the requirement in the arrival country. However, many countries that have YF transmission do not have a legal requirement for vaccination, and travelers to those countries need vaccination for their own protection.
        </p>
        <p>
         The YF vaccine is a live virus vaccine grown in chick embryos. Following vaccine administration, a low-level viremia with the vaccine virus often develops within three to seven days and persists for one to three weeks [
         <a href="#rid8">

        </p>
        <p>
         To meet entry requirements (for countries that have them), the YF vaccination certificate is valid beginning 10 days after administration of YF vaccine for primary vaccine recipients; this corresponds to the time at which the majority of vaccine recipients demonstrate immunity. A YF vaccination certificate for international travel is valid for the life of the recipient, no matter when it was issued. Authorized YF vaccination centers in the United States may obtain the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis from the United States Government Printing Office [

         Travelers aged ≥9 months who are traveling to or living in areas at risk for YF transmission in South America and Africa should be vaccinated. In addition, the International Health Regulations allow countries (with or without local disease), if they wish, to require proof of YF vaccination as a condition of entry for travelers arriving from certain countries to prevent importation and indigenous transmission of YF virus.

         Because the YF is a live attenuated vaccine, it should not be given to individuals with primary immunodeficiencies, transplant recipients, patients on immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies, or patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) whose CD4 count is &lt;200/mL. Other contraindications include age &lt;6 months, allergy to a vaccine component, and thymic disorders. There is a precaution against YF vaccination for travelers ≥60 years of age and infants aged 6 to 8 months; for these patients, the risk of severe illness and death due to YF infection should be balanced against the risk of serious vaccine effects [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Pregnancy is also a precaution for YF vaccine administration (in contrast with most other live vaccines that are contraindicated in pregnancy). If travel is unavoidable and the risks for YF virus exposure are felt to outweigh the vaccination risks, a pregnant woman should be vaccinated. If the risks for vaccination are felt to outweigh the risks for YF virus exposure, pregnant women should be issued a medical waiver to fulfill any international health regulation requirement [
         <a href="#rid8">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In some circumstances, patients require proof of YF vaccination for travel, but YF vaccine administration is contraindicated. Official CDC and WHO resources distinguish between countries with International Health Regulation YF vaccine entry requirements and countries where vaccination is recommended because of potential exposure in an area with YF transmission. For circumstances in which YF vaccine documentation must be presented to international customs officials according to International Health Regulations, the traveler can be provided with a Medical Letter of Waiver. For individuals planning travel to an area for which YF vaccine is recommended to avoid risk of infection in the unvaccinated traveler, serious consideration to a change in itinerary should be advised.

        <p>
         Many experts favor Heplisav-B optimal for travelers who require immunization and are not traveling for one month; it is an adjuvant vaccine administered in two doses one month apart and induces a very prominent immune responses.
        </p>
        <p>
         For individuals with more time before travel, alternative vaccines include Recombivax HB and Engerix-B. These are unadjuvanted vaccines administered in three intramuscular doses; the initial dose is followed by repeat doses at one and six months after the first dose. The third dose should be given ≥2 months after the second dose and ≥4 months after the first dose. In infants, the third dose should not be administered before age 24 weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ideally, immunization with Recombivax HB or Engerix-B should begin six months prior to travel. Alternatively, an accelerated regimen (with doses given on days 0, 7, and 21) can be administered to travelers who cannot complete the full series prior to departure. Travelers who receive an accelerated regimen should receive a booster at least six months later to optimize long-term immunity. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         The humoral immune response to unadjuvanted hepatitis B vaccine is diminished in immunocompromised individuals; therefore, adjuvanted Heplisav-B is favored for such individuals by many experts in the absence of specific data. Alternatively, limited data suggest that modified dosing regimens of unadjuvanted vaccine can also increase response rates. A three-dose series of Recombivax HB (40 mcg at zero, one, and six months) or a four-dose series of Engerix-B (40 mcg at zero, one, two, and six months) may be used. (See

         Japanese encephalitis (JE) is an arboviral encephalitis endemic throughout most of Asia and parts of the western Pacific. The highest risk of JE exposure occurs in rural agricultural areas, often associated with rice production and flooding irrigation. (See

         One JE vaccine is available in the United States: an inactivated Vero cell culture-derived vaccine (JE-VC; IXIARO) (licensed in 2009). JE-VC protects against all five JE virus genotypes. An inactivated mouse brain-derived vaccine (JE-MB; JE-VAX) was discontinued in 2009.
        </p>
        <p>
         Outside the United States, a live attenuated YF-JE chimeric viral vaccine (IMOJEV) has been licensed in Australia and in some Asian countries as a single 0.5 mL subcutaneous dose for primary immunization of individuals over 12 months of age. For individuals ages 12 months to 17 years, a booster dose should be given one to two years after the first dose to provide long-term protection. For people over 18 years, there is no need for a booster dose for at least five years after the first vaccination. Since it is a live attenuated vaccine, it should not be used in immunocompromised individuals and its safety in pregnancy has not been evaluated.

         The likelihood of JE transmission to travelers is low, but the outcome is potentially severe. Factors that increase the risk of JE transmission include longer duration of travel, travel during peak JE season, extended time in rural areas, participating in extensive outdoor activities, and accommodations without air conditioning or screens.

         <em>
          V. cholerae
         </em>
         O1 and includes areas with cholera activity within the last year that are prone to recurrence of cholera epidemics; it does not include areas where only rare imported or sporadic cases have been reported.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most people do not travel to areas of active cholera transmission, and most travelers are at extremely low risk for cholera infection. Groups that most warrant vaccination include aid, refugee, and health care workers in endemic and epidemic areas in proximity to displaced populations, especially in crowded camps and urban areas with unsanitary conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Factors that increase the risk of getting cholera or having severe disease include blood type O, low gastric acidity from antacid therapy, partial gastrectomy, and lack of access to medical services; medical conditions associated with poor tolerance of dehydration (such as cardiovascular disease or kidney disease) might also be at increased risk for poor outcomes [

         − Most reported cases of mpox (&gt;1000 per year) have been in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the disease is endemic; sporadic cases have been reported in tropical rainforests in the Congo basin and West Africa. Since 2016, human cases of mpox have also been reported in Cameroon, Central African Republic, Liberia, Nigeria, Republic of the Congo, and Sierra Leone [

          Global spread
         </strong>
         − The number of mpox cases throughout West and Central African countries is increasing; between 2018 and 2021, &gt;10 cases in travelers returning from Nigeria presented in the United Kingdom, Singapore, Israel, and the United States [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46-48
         </a>
         ]. This increase may be attributable to closer contact between humans and animals (due to population movement, civil unrest, deforestation, and climate change) and waning herd immunity from prior routine smallpox vaccination (discontinued in the 1980s). Ingestion of bush meat, exposure to rodents, and contact with infected individuals all appear to be risk factors.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Beginning in May 2022, a global outbreak involving &gt;80,000 cases (West African strain) occurred among individuals in nonendemic areas (Europe, North America, Australia) with no exposure in Africa. Transmission has been mostly from direct person-to-person contact (including sexual contact, especially among men who have sex with men [MSM]). Skin-to-skin contact is thought to be the predominant mode of spread; respiratory transmission is also possible but is considered less likely. Compared with previously reported mpox cases, a low frequency of prodromal symptoms and a low frequency of disseminated skin lesions have been reported; isolated genital lesions have been confused with typical sexually transmitted infections. Risk specific to travelers includes attendees of gay pride events and to venues where MSM activity occurs.

         Vaccination is contraindicated for individuals with vaccine or vaccine-component allergies; however, in an exposure or outbreak situation, the risk for severe mpox likely outweighs the risk for a serious allergic reaction to vaccination. None of the contraindications for replicating vaccinia-based vaccines (such as cardiac disease, eczema, HIV, or immunosuppression) are applicable to MVA-BN. Cardiac toxicity (myocarditis or pericarditis) and other adverse effects observed with replicating vaccinia-based vaccines (eg, eczema vaccinatum, postvaccinial encephalitis, or vaccinia necrosum) have not been reported with MVA-BN.

         The pretravel visit provides an opportunity to ensure that routine immunizations (including influenza, Tdap [tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis], MMR [measles, mumps, and rubella], poliovirus, RSV, and varicella vaccinations) are current. Travelers to resource-limited settings are at increased risk for infection due to these pathogens and, in some cases, additional doses are indicated. (See
