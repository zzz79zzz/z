         Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a sensitive and specific serum marker for prostate tissue. Serial measurements are routinely obtained to detect early disease recurrence in males who have received definitive treatment for localized disease. (See

         Following radical prostatectomy, the serum level of PSA should become undetectable since all normal prostate tissue, as well as the tumor, is removed. Thus, monitoring PSA after definitive treatment of localized prostate cancer leads to the identification of males with a PSA-only (biochemical) recurrence. For males in whom there is a significant likelihood that disease is confined to the prostatic bed, salvage therapy may result in prolonged disease-free survival  (

         For patients with a confirmed serum PSA ≥0.2 ng/mL following radical prostatectomy, careful evaluation is required to rule out the possibility of distant metastases. (See

         The role of biopsy of the prostatic bed in patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy is controversial. The authors do not generally favor biopsy in the presence of normal rectal examination and transrectal ultrasound imaging. (See

         All prostate tissue should be removed during a successful radical prostatectomy. Postoperatively, a detectable and rising serum PSA using standard immunoassays is indicative of residual prostatic tissue, which presumably represents locoregional or systemic cancer [

          2

         Although successful treatment of prostate cancer should remove the sources of PSA from both the cancer and the normal prostate, some patients will have a persistently elevated PSA after surgery, particularly when an ultrasensitive immunoassay is used.
        </p>
        <p>
         A stable serum PSA &lt;0.2 ng/mL could represent "retained normal prostate tissue" rather than persistent or recurrent disease, and the natural history of disease in these patients may not vary from that in those with an undetectable serum PSA following surgery. The optimal management of patients with a low detectable serum PSA that remains stable is controversial. Given the uncertainty about the meaning of these low levels of PSA, our approach is to monitor these patients without specific therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         The natural history of patients with a persistently elevated PSA is illustrated by two large series:

         A retrospective series of 566 males who had undergone radical prostatectomy found that 419 (74 percent) had an undetectable PSA (ie, ≤0.03 ng/mL) following surgery, 93 (16 percent) had a detectable PSA that remained stable but &lt;0.2 ng/mL, and 54 (10 percent) had a detectable PSA that was unstable (two subsequent increases in serum PSA and/or a PSA velocity of ≥0.05 ng/year) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>

         Notably, the definition of a PSA only recurrence was derived in an era where radiographic restaging consisted of radionuclide bone scans and computed tomography (CT) scans. These definitions are evolving with the emergence of positron emission tomography (PET) scanning using more sensitive prostate-specific radiotracers such as F-18 fluciclovine or one targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA; such as Ga-68 PSMA-11 or F-18 DCFPyL) as a replacement for restaging bone scanning and CT scans. At most institutions, virtually all patients with a biochemical recurrence after definitive local therapy get a PET scan and this has resulted in a smaller pool of patients defined as having a truly isolated biochemical recurrence.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nevertheless, the majority of data reported below on the efficacy of salvage radiation therapy represent males who were identified as having an isolated biochemical failure on the basis of conventional imaging alone, with some notable exceptions. (See

          SALVAGE RADIATION THERAPY

          —
         </span>
         For males with a recurrence following radical prostatectomy, salvage external beam radiation therapy (RT) can provide long-term disease control if the recurrence is encompassed within the treatment field and if a sufficient radiation dose can be delivered to eradicate the residual/recurrent cancer. The success of salvage RT depends on the dose and treatment volume (ie, prostate bed with or without pelvis) in addition to the localization of all clonogenic cells to the treatment field.
        </p>
        <p>
         The use of salvage RT in this setting is consistent with guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA) and the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) [

         </span>
         The initial retrospective studies of RT in patients with a biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy relied on biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS) rather than cancer-specific survival or the development of metastatic disease in an effort to define which patients were most likely to benefit from salvage RT [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Factors associated with an improved bRFS after salvage prostate bed RT included a positive surgical margin at prostatectomy, a low PSA level at recurrence, and a long recurrence-free interval following initial surgery. In contrast, a short (eg, &lt;6 months) PSA doubling time, Gleason score ≥8, a history of lymph node or seminal vesicle involvement at original diagnosis, and persistent elevation of PSA following RT were all associated with poorer bRFS in those managed with salvage prostate bed RT.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although these studies have been used to define patients who are more likely to benefit from salvage RT, these analyses were retrospective and did not include a control group that was managed with observation rather than active intervention. Thus, the factors identified in these studies may have been prognostic for the development of a biochemical relapse and not predictive of improved cancer-specific survival in response to treatment with salvage RT [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. The available evidence suggest that biochemical failure is not a surrogate end point for overall survival in recurrent prostate cancer [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Three, large, retrospective, single-institution series provide conflicting data on whether or not salvage RT as a single modality can prolong survival:

         In a series of 2657 males treated at the Mayo Clinic who had a biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy, 856 (32 percent) received salvage RT [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. On multivariate analysis, salvage RT significantly reduced the incidence of a subsequent local recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 0.13, 95% CI 0.06-0.28). However, salvage RT did not significantly decrease mortality compared with those not receiving salvage RT following a biochemical recurrence (5- and 10-year survival rates 92 versus 91 and 70 versus 69 percent, respectively).

          ●
         </span>
         On the other hand, a survival benefit for salvage RT was suggested in a study from Johns Hopkins that analyzed 635 patients who had either a biochemical or a local recurrence following radical prostatectomy [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. At recurrence, patients were managed with observation, salvage prostate bed RT alone, or salvage RT in combination with hormonal therapy in 63, 25, and 12 percent of cases, respectively. Cancer-specific survival was significantly prolonged in patients who received RT, with or without hormonal therapy, compared with observation (96 and 96 versus 88 percent at five years, and 82 and 86 versus 62 percent at 10 years).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In this study, the benefit in survival was limited to those with a short PSA doubling time (&lt;6 months) [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Although this group had a worse prognosis compared with those with a longer PSA doubling time, results suggest that not all of these patients have occult metastases and that significant benefit is still possible in those with a short PSA doubling time [

Salvage RT (predominantly to the prostate bed) was given, either alone or as part of a combined approach that included androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), in 219 of these patients (37 percent). At a median follow-up of 11 years, multivariate analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in all-cause mortality both for those with a PSA doubling time &lt;6 months and in those with a PSA doubling time ≥6 months (adjusted HR 0.53 and 0.52, respectively).

         The development of more sensitive prostate specific radiotracers for positron emission tomography (PET) scanning has significantly altered the landscape of treatment for males with a rising PSA after definitive local therapy by more accurately defining disease extent. Where feasible, we incorporate PET scanning using sensitive prostate cancer specific radiotracers such as F-18 fluciclovine into radiotherapy decision making and planning.

         All of the data described above on the benefits of salvage prostate bed RT were derived from studies that utilized conventional radiographic imaging for diagnostic evaluation of a postprostatectomy rising PSA. Emerging data support the view that outcomes may be improved with the inclusion of PET scanning using sensitive prostate cancer specific radiotracers into radiotherapy decision making and planning [

        <p>
         As an example, in the EMPIRE-1 trial, 165 males with a detectable PSA postprostatectomy and negative conventional imaging (no extrapelvic or other bone findings) were randomly assigned to radiotherapy directed by conventional imaging alone or to conventional imaging plus F-18 fluciclovine PET scanning [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. In the conventional imaging group, RT decisions were based on presurgical disease features, prostatectomy pathologic findings, and on PSA trajectory. RT to the prostate bed only or additionally to the pelvis, was delivered at the discretion of the treating clinician. In the F-18 fluciclovine group, RT decisions were rigidly determined by PET findings, which were categorized as extrapelvic or skeletal uptake (no RT), pelvic nodal uptake (RT to the pelvic and prostate bed), uptake in prostate bed only (RT to prostate bed), or no uptake (RT to the prostate bed only).
        </p>
        <p>
         Serum PSA prior to RT was similar in both the conventional imaging (median 0.34, range 0 to 82) and F-18 fluciclovine groups (median 0.34, range 0 to 92). PET findings resulted in 4 of the 83 patients in the F-18 fluciclovine group having RT aborted, and these patients were not included in the survival analysis. In the modified intention to treat population, three-year event-free survival was significantly higher in the F-18 fluciclovine PET scanning group (63 versus 75.5 percent, difference 12.5 points, 95% CI 4.3-20.8, p = 0.0028). A difference in failure-free survival was also seen between the two groups at four years (51 versus 76 percent).

         While these data are intriguing, the limiting factor, at least in the United States, is insurance coverage for F-18 fluciclovine PET in the setting of a very low but rising PSA level after prostatectomy.

         Other prostate-specific radiotracers are available and approved for PET scanning in males with a rising PSA after initial definitive local therapy, including GA-68 PSMA-11,

Several studies have shown that the inclusion of one of these PET scans in the diagnostic imaging evaluation of a male with a rising PSA after prostatectomy alters management in 50 percent or more, with a greater sensitivity than F-18 fluciclovine at PSA levels &lt;2 ng/mL. However, availability of these radionuclides is limited, and as with F-18 fluciclovine, insurance coverage may be a limiting factor. (See

         For males in whom a PSA recurrence has been documented and who are candidates for salvage therapy, salvage RT should be initiated promptly. Prompt initiation of salvage RT in appropriate candidates once a PSA relapse has been documented appears to be more effective when the serum PSA is lower (ie, &lt;0.5 ng/mL) compared with salvage therapy once the serum PSA is &gt;0.5 ng/mL. Although there are no randomized trials defining the optimal timing, multiple studies provide support for this approach [

         Largely based on results from the RTOG 9601 trial, for patients with a detectable PSA above 0.6 ng/mL after radical prostatectomy, we suggest adding short-term ADT in conjunction with radiation therapy (RT). We use ADT for two months before and during salvage RT (six months total). For individuals with a pre-RT PSA &lt;0.6 ng/mL, there is no consensus on the value of ADT. The presence of high-risk features (Gleason &gt;7, seminal vesicle involvement, and a PSA that never became undetectable) may provide support for use of ADT in such patients.
        </p>
        <p>

Overall survival at 12 years was significantly better with bicalutamide (76 versus 71 percent, HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.59-0.99), and this represented a reduction in 12-year prostate cancer mortality from 13.4 to 5.8 percent (p &lt;0.001). An interaction was observed, however, with the treatment effect only observed in patients with a pretreatment PSA &gt;1.5 ng/mL. Gynecomastia was more common in the bicalutamide group compared with the placebo group (70 versus 11 percent).

         Additional support for the benefits of adding short-term ADT to prostate bed RT is provided by the RTOG 0534 (SPPORT) trial, in which 1792 patients with a biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy were randomly assigned to prostate bed RT (PBRT) alone (64.8 to 70.2 Gy), PBRT plus ADT for four to six months starting two months prior to RT (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] agonist plus

In the final analysis (median follow-up 8.2 years), the addition of short-term ADT to PBRT significantly improved five-year FFP (81 versus 71 percent, adjusted HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.47-0.77), but this did not translate into a significant difference in risk for distant metastases (6.1 versus 8.5 percent, HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.49-1.11) or prostate cancer specific death (0.9 versus 2.9 percent, HR for survival 0.73, 95% CI 0.42-1.28). The mean levels of preradiotherapy baseline PSA were similar in both groups (0.47 [range 0.1-1.96] versus 0.51 ng/mL [range 0.1 to 1.93] for the groups undergoing PBRT without and with ADT, respectively).

         Advances over the last decade have dramatically increased both our understanding of prostate cancer biology and our ability to obtain molecular information from small amounts of prostate tissue. Along with these advances have come newly available and emerging tissue-based prostate cancer biomarker tests, which promise to help determine prostate cancer prognosis as well as guide treatment  (

         ). Several of these, including the Decipher Genomic Classifier (GC) have shown some utility for prognostication following radical prostatectomy, and in some cases, informed treatment of males with biochemically recurrent disease after radical prostatectomy.

         versus placebo, described above, GC scores were generated from 486 of the 760 randomized patients, and 352 that passed microarray quality control comprised the final cohort for analysis [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. On multivariate post-hoc analysis, after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, Gleason score, T-stage, margin status, PSA level at trial entry, and treatment arm, the GC was independently associated with distant metastases and prostate cancer specific mortality. Although the planned original analysis was not powered to detect a significant treatment interaction by GC score, the estimated absolute effect of bicalutamide on 12-year overall survival was less when comparing patients with a lower versus a higher GC score (2.4 versus 8.9 percent), which was especially prominent when the analysis was limited to males receiving early salvage RT at a PSA level &lt;0.7 ng/mL in whom the use of bicalutamide for males with a lower GC values associated with a lower overall survival as compared with those with higher values (-7.8 versus +4.6 percent).
        </p>
        <p>
         Prospective validation is recommended before generalized use of GC score for treatment decision making on the omission of ADT can be endorsed. This should preferably take place in a trial in which males with a high GC are randomly assigned to RT alone or with ADT.

         Whether RT should be limited to the prostate bed or should include pelvic irradiation is controversial. For most males, we consider the standard of care to be prostate bed RT plus short-term ADT. Given the results of the RTOG 0534 trial, we discuss the option of adding pelvic nodal RT to prostate bed RT and short-term ADT with patients for shared decision making, with full disclosure of the uncertainty of benefits and potential harms. Patients who place a high value on optimizing prostate cancer outcomes and a relatively lower value on avoiding treatment-related toxicity might reasonably choose extended lymph node irradiation, despite the uncertainty of long-term benefit.

         The role of more extensive pelvic irradiation has been addressed in two trials in males whose localized prostate cancer was managed with definitive RT. In that setting, both trials (RTOG 9413 and GETUG-01) failed to show an improvement in survival among males who were assigned to treatment with prostate plus pelvic lymph node RT compared with those assigned to treatment limited to the prostate [

         However, additional information is available from the phase III RTOG 0534 trial, which directly tested the benefit of including both the prostate bed and the pelvic lymph nodes in the radiation field (PLNRT) with concurrent short-term ADT versus prostate bed RT (PBRT) alone or with short-term ADT in patients with a PSA-only recurrence after radical prostatectomy [

However, when compared with PBRT plus ADT, there was only a trend toward benefit of PLNRT that was not statistically significant for five-year freedom from progression (87.4 versus 81.3 percent, HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.63-1.07), risk of distant metastases (4.5 versus 6.1 percent, HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.45-1.12) or prostate cancer-specific death (0.7 versus 0.9 percent, HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.37-1.32).

         The routine monitoring of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after treatment of early stage prostate cancer has led to the identification of males with a PSA-only (biochemical) recurrence. In this situation, increases in serum PSA over the pretreatment baseline are not accompanied by symptoms or signs of progressive disease. Biochemical recurrence is defined as a serum PSA ≥0.2 ng/mL, which is confirmed by a second determination with a PSA ≥0.2 ng/mL. (See

         The development of more sensitive prostate specific radiotracers for positron emission tomography (PET) scanning has significantly altered the landscape of treatment for males with a rising PSA after definitive local therapy by more accurately defining disease extent. This can improve outcomes from salvage radiotherapy. Where feasible, we incorporate PET scanning using sensitive prostate cancer specific radiotracers such as F-18 fluciclovine into radiotherapy decision making and planning. (See

          Grade 2C
         </a>

         For patients with a pre-RT PSA of ≥0.6 ng/mL, we suggest adding short-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in conjunction with RT (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">
          Grade 2B
         </a>
         ). We use ADT for two months before and during salvage RT (six months total). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Prostate bed RT plus androgen deprivation therapy'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For patients with a pre-RT PSA &lt;0.6 ng/mL, there is no consensus on the value of ADT. The presence of high-risk features (Gleason &gt;7, seminal vesicle involvement, and a PSA that never became undetectable) can be used to provide support for ADT in patients with a pre-RT PSA &lt;0.6 ng/mL.

         The optimal treatment volume is controversial. For most males, we consider the standard of care to be prostate bed RT only plus short-term ADT. However, given the results of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0534 trial, we discuss the option of adding pelvic nodal RT to prostate bed RT and short-term ADT with patients for shared decision making, with full disclosure of the uncertainty of benefits and potential harms. Patients who place a high value on optimizing prostate cancer outcomes and a relatively lower value on avoiding treatment-related toxicity might reasonably choose extended lymph node irradiation, despite the uncertainty of long-term benefit.

         The management of males with a low but persistently elevated PSA (ie, &lt;0.2 ng/mL) using ultrasensitive immunoassays is controversial. Many of these cases represent retained normal prostate tissue; however, those with progressive increases in serum PSA may be at increased risk for a subsequent biochemical recurrence. We suggest monitoring these patients without specific therapy (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>

          ●
         </span>
         For males who have a rising PSA following radical prostatectomy in whom salvage RT is not appropriate, the standard approach is systemic therapy alone. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Systemic therapy'

         above.)

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For older adult males and those with severe comorbidities, observation in the absence of overt metastases is a reasonable alternative. (See
