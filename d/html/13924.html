These symptoms can result in loss of appetite, reduced oral intake, and ultimately, impaired nutritional status. Dietary management in IBD focuses on maximizing nutritional status, maintaining adequate intake, and avoiding foods that can exacerbate symptoms. Nutritional interventions (eg, enteral nutrition, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10307" href="/z/d/drug information/10307.html" rel="external">parenteral nutrition</a>) historically have been reserved for patients who are undernourished and who cannot eat and absorb nutrients to support nutritional needs. </p><p>It is important to identify patients with IBD who may require nutritional intervention. Optimizing nutritional status is important to prevent long-term health consequences of malnutrition.</p><p>This topic will discuss nutrition and dietary management in adults with inflammatory bowel disease. These principles apply to patients with either Crohn disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis, but where differences exist, they are noted. Specific nutrient deficiencies in IBD, growth failure in children with IBD, and dietary risk factors for IBD are discussed separately. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5887.html" rel="external">"Vitamin and mineral deficiencies in inflammatory bowel disease"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5893.html" rel="external">"Growth failure and pubertal delay in children with inflammatory bowel disease"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4066.html" rel="external">"Definitions, epidemiology, and risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease", section on 'Dietary factors'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Nutritional intervention and management of patients with short bowel syndrome, which can result from surgical resection for CD, is also discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4773.html" rel="external">"Management of short bowel syndrome in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1318540542"><span class="h1">CONSEQUENCES OF MALNUTRITION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Malnutrition in patients with IBD can lead to weight loss, growth failure in children, bone disease, and/or micronutrient deficiencies.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Weight loss and reduced muscle mass – </strong>Patients who have lost between 5 and 10 percent of their lean body mass usually have no clinical sequelae. However, loss of lean body mass beyond this threshold is associated with increased morbidity (eg, poor wound healing and higher rates of infection after surgery) [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The primary mediators of reduced muscle mass are inflammation (excessive catabolism, which accelerates protein breakdown), decreased physical activity, and/or glucocorticoid treatment [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Inadequate protein intake may also affect muscle mass, but this mechanism is unproven, and is not usually relevant in adults unless the deficiency is severe and prolonged (starvation). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bone disease –</strong> Low bone mass is common in patients with IBD, and the cause is multifactorial. Risk factors include glucocorticoid use, disease-related inflammatory activity, malabsorption, and hypogonadism. Prevention, evaluation, and treatment of bone disease in patients with IBD is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2028.html" rel="external">"Metabolic bone disease in inflammatory bowel disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Micronutrient deficiencies – </strong>Micronutrient deficiencies in patients with IBD are discussed in detail elsewhere.

In a study of 102 adults with IBD (including 28 patients with active disease [27 percent]), 7 of 50 patients with Crohn disease (CD) had malnutrition based upon body mass index (BMI) criteria [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Three of 52 patients (6 percent) with ulcerative colitis (UC) had malnutrition based upon BMI. For patients with CD, malnutrition was more common in those with active disease compared with inactive disease (12 versus 2 percent). However, rates of malnutrition did not differ significantly for patients with active UC compared with UC in remission (4 versus 2 percent). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H642204851"><span class="h1">CLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF NUTRITIONAL STATUS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2709523537"><span class="h2">Diagnosis of undernutrition</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In our practice, the diagnosis of undernutrition is based upon our clinical impression after reviewing the following data:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clinical history (eg, asking about altered taste, weight loss, poor appetite, activity level and disease-specific symptoms such as nausea and abdominal pain) </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Physical examination (focusing on loss of subcutaneous fat or muscle mass)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Body mass index (BMI)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patient-reported dietary intake (eg, intake of solids and liquids)</p><p></p><p>Some clinicians also use a screening tool such as the subjective global assessment  (<a class="graphic graphic_form graphicRef63581" href="/z/d/graphic/63581.html" rel="external">form 1</a>).

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5366.html" rel="external">"Dietary assessment in adults"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">As part of the dietary assessment specific to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we focus on disease-specific symptoms (eg, nausea, abdominal pain) that may negatively affect oral intake. We also ask patients about loss of appetite, altered taste, weight loss, and activity level. In addition, we ask patients if they are following any restrictive diets or excluding any major food groups.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Physical assessment – </strong>We measure weight and calculate BMI, which can be estimated from a table or a calculator  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74762" href="/z/d/graphic/74762.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/13478.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>). Patients with a BMI less than the 5th percentile for age or less than 18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> are regarded as markedly underweight. As part of the physical examination, we subjectively assess subcutaneous fat and muscle mass. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">BMI and physical examination are sufficient physical assessment tools for clinical decision-making for most patients, and additional measurements of body composition are not usually necessary. However, BMI is one of several factors informing nutritional status because some patients with normal BMI may have severe protein depletion (sarcopenia). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">While we do not measure skinfold thickness in routine clinical practice, these measurements can be obtained to confirm the clinical assessment. Semi-quantitative techniques for measuring body composition include triceps skin fold thickness measurements, which reflect body fat  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67683" href="/z/d/graphic/67683.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) and mid-arm cross sectional area, which, combined with skinfold thickness, reflects lean body mass. Techniques for measuring skinfold thickness in adults and children are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5363.html" rel="external">"Measurement of body composition in children", section on 'Measures of body composition'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Methods for determining body composition in a research setting are available, including bioelectrical impedance analysis and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Lean body mass (muscle) can also be determined by computed tomography scan using specialized software. These testing methods are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5381.html" rel="external">"Determining body composition in adults", section on 'Research methods'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Subjective global assessment tool – </strong>Global assessment tools can be used as part of nutritional assessment to identify patients at-risk for or with undernutrition. The subjective global assessment (SGA) tool takes into account multiple nutrition-related factors including functional status, dietary factors, multiple gastrointestinal-related symptoms, weight loss, and a brief physical examination  (<a class="graphic graphic_form graphicRef63581" href="/z/d/graphic/63581.html" rel="external">form 1</a>) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The SGA can be applied in conjunction with measuring BMI. However, in one study, patients with IBD who were well-nourished according to nutrition screening using the SGA were found to have a decrease in body cell mass (a measure of metabolically active tissues) as well as reduced handgrip strength compared with controls [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. A separate study documented that patients with CD in remission often had a normal BMI but reduced handgrip muscle strength consistent with loss of protein muscle mass [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Laboratory assessment – </strong>Laboratory monitoring of nutritional status for patients with IBD depends on the patient's disease activity, location, and nutritional status. The approach to selecting laboratory tests for specific patient groups (eg, those with active disease, those in remission) is discussed separately  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66288" href="/z/d/graphic/66288.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5887.html" rel="external">"Vitamin and mineral deficiencies in inflammatory bowel disease", section on 'Laboratory monitoring for nutrient deficiencies'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">While serum albumin and transthyretin (prealbumin) levels have historically been measured as part of nutritional assessment, neither is solely impacted by nutritional intake. These values should be evaluated in the clinical context. For example, low levels are seen in patients with active inflammation [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Similarly, systemic inflammation may lower levels of a specific micronutrient (eg, iron or vitamin D) in the absence of a true deficiency [<a href="#rid5">5,12</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3593887"><span class="h1">NUTRITION AND DIETARY MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Measures to improve nutritional status and avoid food triggers play a role in the treatment of most patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Clinical studies in this area are limited in number, often not randomized or placebo-controlled, and contain small numbers of patients.

Oral ingestion is the preferred method of delivery, although tube feedings (nasogastric or nasoduodenal) are used when oral intake does not meet daily requirements. </p><p>We use enteral nutrition supplements to increase calorie and protein intake for patients who have undernutrition and active disease but not as induction or maintenance therapy for IBD. We also use supplemental enteral nutrition for patients with undernutrition who are in remission but cannot increase caloric intake through a standard diet. </p><p>We select a specific type and quantity of enteral nutrition based on each patient’s calorie and protein requirements. Some clinicians may also consult with a dietician to coordinate individualized nutrition plans for their patients with IBD.</p><p>Liquid nutritional supplementation may take the form of a predigested (elemental or semi-elemental), or polymeric diet.

In the setting of IBD, PN may be indicated for patients with short bowel syndrome, or bowel obstruction, or for patients who are unable to eat or tolerate tube feedings [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. PN may also be used to correct nutritional deficiencies prior to surgery. The use of PN in these settings is discussed elsewhere.

Patients who have symptoms suggestive of lactose intolerance (eg, bloating, abdominal pain and/or diarrhea following lactose ingestion) should undergo a lactose breath hydrogen test to confirm the diagnosis. Management of patients with lactose intolerance is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2542.html" rel="external">"Lactose intolerance and malabsorption: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management"</a>.)</p><p>Enteral nutrition is not a routine component of induction therapy in adults with active IBD, but may be given as an adjunct to induction therapy for patients with active disease who have undernutrition. (See <a class="local">'Patients with undernutrition'</a> above.) </p><p>Enteral nutrition appears less effective than glucocorticoid therapy for inducing remission in adult patients with CD. In a meta-analysis of eight trials including 194 adult patients with active CD, enteral nutrition was 35 percent less effective at inducing remission compared with glucocorticoid therapy (45 versus 73 percent; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.52-0.82) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. </p><p>An American Gastroenterological Association review of six trials including patients with active IBD concluded that <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10307" href="/z/d/drug information/10307.html" rel="external">parenteral nutrition</a> given as induction therapy provided no benefit compared with placebo [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>In an observational study including 49 patients with active Crohn disease who were given exclusive enteral nutrition, 21 patients (43 percent) discontinued nutrition therapy due to intolerance or disease-related factors [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].

While some patients associate certain types and/or quantities of food (eg, high-fiber diet) with development of symptoms (eg, abdominal discomfort, bloating), evidence does not link a particular food group to an increased risk of disease flare in adults. (See <a class="local">'Fiber'</a> below.)</p><p>For general dietary advice, we agree with consensus guidance from the International Organization for the Study of IBD that advises patients with IBD to consume a diet composed of carbohydrates, fats, and protein and to limit intake of processed food (eg, sulfites) and artificial sweeteners while avoiding trans fatty acids [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].

We use elimination diets when patients are convinced that there is a specific food or food group that accounts for their disease-related symptoms.</p><p>In the setting of IBD, an elimination diet may involve removing one particular food from the diet for a period of time and observing whether symptoms resolve during that time. Conversely, an elimination diet may involve introducing one new food at a time to identify foods that precipitate symptoms. Many patients can identify foods that they believe may precipitate or worsen their disease, and it is reasonable for them to avoid such foods.</p><p>One trial compared the use of glucocorticoids versus an elimination diet in 78 patients with IBD who had achieved remission with an elemental diet [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Patients were instructed to introduce one new food group daily and to avoid foods that they knew previously resulted in precipitating their symptoms. Relapse rates at two years were lower in the diet-treated group compared with the glucocorticoid-treated group (62 versus 79 percent, p=0.048). Food intolerances to cereals, lactose, and yeast products were common. In another trial of 44 patients with mild to moderate CD that compared an exclusion diet plus partial enteral nutrition with an exclusion diet alone, there were no differences in remission rates between the groups after six weeks [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].  </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2678300154"><span class="h4">Probiotics</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with ulcerative colitis, some probiotics (eg, <em>E. coli </em>Nissle 1917, VSL #3) show promise, but no preparations have been validated for clinical use. For patients with CD, the available data do not support clinical effectiveness of probiotic therapy for either induction or maintenance of remission. Probiotics are living, nonpathogenic micro-organisms that, when ingested, are believed to have the potential to exert a positive influence on host health and physiology. The use of probiotics in the management of patients with IBD, including those with pouchitis, is discussed separately.

There is no recommendation from any major healthcare society supporting this diet. One study randomized 204 patients with CD in remission to omega-3 fatty acids, a placebo, or a low-carbohydrate diet. In an intent-to-treat analysis, neither the omega-3 fatty acid supplementation nor the low-carbohydrate diet resulted in any improvement in relapse rates compared with placebo [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) is a very restrictive low-carbohydrate diet that has been promoted for multiple chronic and autoimmune diseases, including IBD, autism, and celiac disease [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. The diet is built upon the premise that intestinal microbes that contribute to the development of IBD use carbohydrates as their primary energy source, leading to the production of acids and toxins that can injure the small intestine, further impairing carbohydrate digestion and absorption. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4077.html" rel="external">"Immune and microbial mechanisms in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease", section on 'Role of microbes'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The SCD is grain-free, lactose-free, and sucrose-free [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. It also limits the intake of some legumes and it does not allow for the intake of processed foods due to additives. The diet does allow for the intake of unprocessed meats, poultry, fish, eggs, honey, non-canned vegetables, some legumes, fruits, nuts, homemade yogurt, and some lower-lactose cheeses (eg, cheddar). Many patients find the diet difficult to follow due to its restrictive nature, and some clinicians express concern that it could lead to nutritional deficiencies [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Data on the SCD in adults with Crohn disease are limited [<a href="#rid31">31,32</a>]. In a trial including 194 patients with mild to moderate Crohn disease, there was no significant difference in rates of symptomatic remission after six weeks of adhering to the SCD compared with a Mediterranean diet (47 versus 44 percent) [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. In addition, there was no significant difference in other outcomes such as reduction in fecal calprotectin or C-reactive protein levels.
