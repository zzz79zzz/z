This approach is consistent with treatment guidelines [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], including those from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [<a href="#rid3">3</a>], Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists [<a href="#rid4">4</a>], and International Society for Bipolar Disorders Task Force [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>Psychotherapy can provide support for patients and families, and address disruption of developmental processes (eg, family, social, and academic functioning), comorbidities (eg, substance use disorders) and preexisting behavioral problems, medication adherence, and relapse prevention. A relatively simple form of psychotherapy is psychoeducation, which appears to be efficacious and is a core element of more elaborate and intensive psychotherapies (eg, family therapy).</p><p>This topic reviews the efficacy and core elements of different adjunctive psychotherapies for children and adolescents with bipolar disorder. Choosing a specific psychotherapy is discussed separately in the context of an overview of choosing treatment for mania, comorbid disorders, and maintenance treatment. Other aspects of pediatric bipolar disorder are also discussed separately, including choosing treatment for bipolar major depression; the efficacy, administration, and side effects of second-generation antipsychotics for pediatric mania; the general principles of using pharmacotherapy; assessment and diagnosis; and the epidemiology, clinical features, and course of illness:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15925.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar disorder: Overview of choosing treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/99164.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar major depression: Choosing treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/98719.html" rel="external">"Pediatric mania and second-generation antipsychotics: Efficacy, administration, and side effects"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/98716.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar disorder and pharmacotherapy: General principles"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83083.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar disorder: Assessment and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15924.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar disorder: Clinical manifestations and course of illness"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5071445"><span class="h1">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As with all psychotherapies, patients must have the necessary motivation, interest, and cognitive capacity to participate in treatment and complete assigned tasks. In addition, it is often necessary to defer adjunctive psychotherapy until severe symptoms (eg, psychotic features) are stabilized. It may be possible to improve motivation with motivational interviewing. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14612.html" rel="external">"Overview of psychotherapies", section on 'Motivational interviewing'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5071452"><span class="h1">SPECIFIC THERAPIES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Specific psychotherapies that can be added onto pharmacotherapy for pediatric bipolar patients include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cognitive-behavior therapy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dialectical behavior therapy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Family therapy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Motivational interviewing</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Psychoeducation</p><p></p><p>Choosing a specific psychotherapy is discussed separately.

(See <a class="local">'Family therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition, an observational study of youth with bipolar disorder (n = 8) who received pharmacotherapy suggests that add-on CBT may potentially help improve symptoms and functioning [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The intervention is administered over 12 weekly sessions and emphasizes psychoeducation, medication adherence, mood monitoring, cognitive restructuring, sleep hygiene, and family communication. Homework assignments in between sessions reinforce the skills that are taught.</p><p>The core elements of CBT are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14612.html" rel="external">"Overview of psychotherapies", section on 'Cognitive and behavioral therapies'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5071215"><span class="h2">Dialectical behavior therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Evidence supporting this approach includes a one-year randomized trial (n = 100) that compared adjunctive dialectal behavior therapy with usual psychotherapy (eg, psychoeducation, supportive therapy, CBT, or family therapy), in adolescents with bipolar disorder who all received pharmacotherapy [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Dialectal behavior therapy included 36 sessions devoted to individual skills training (which target problematic behaviors such as nonadherence to medications) and family skills training (psychoeducation, tolerating distress, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In addition, patients monitor mood, sleep, suicidal ideation and behavior, and medication adherence on a daily basis, and can call therapists in between appointments [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. After controlling for baseline suicide attempts, the analyses found that the mean number of suicide attempts was less with dialectical behavior therapy than usual psychotherapy (0.2 versus 1.1) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Also, the rate of attempts (number of attempts per unit time) decreased to a greater extent with dialectical behavior therapy. Improvement of depressive and manic symptoms, and duration of mood episodes, was comparable in both groups.</p><p>In a small, previous trial (n = 20), conducted by the same investigators using similar methods, improvement of suicidal ideation was three times more likely with dialectical behavior therapy than usual psychotherapy [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>Additional information about dialectal behavior therapy is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14612.html" rel="external">"Overview of psychotherapies", section on 'Dialectical behavior therapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1585653991"><span class="h2">Family therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Evidence for the efficacy of family therapy for pediatric bipolar disorder includes randomized trials:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>One type of family therapy integrated the therapy with CBT, and a trial compared this family therapy model with psychotherapy as usual (control) in 69 acutely symptomatic children receiving pharmacotherapy [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Both treatment groups received 12 weekly sessions followed by 6 monthly maintenance sessions. Family therapy included psychoeducation, communication training, family problem-solving skills, developing routines, affect regulation, mindfulness techniques, and improving self-esteem. The control therapy was selected by the therapist and largely avoided the elements of family therapy. Reduction of manic and depressive symptoms, as well as improvement of psychosocial functioning, was greater with family therapy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A second trial compared family therapy with psychoeducation in 58 adolescents with bipolar disorder who were treated with pharmacotherapy and followed for up to two years after study entry [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Family therapy consisted of 21 sessions focused upon psychoeducation, communication, and problem solving. Psychoeducation consisted of three weekly sessions administered to the patient and family. The mean time to recovery from depressive symptoms was faster with family therapy than psychoeducation (10 versus 14 weeks). Time to recovery from mania also favored family therapy (8 versus 14 weeks), but the difference was not statistically significant. Time to recurrence of a mood episode was comparable for the two treatments.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A third trial compared family therapy with an education control condition in 40 youth with acute symptoms of hypomania and/or depression [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Diagnoses at study entry consisted of other specified bipolar and related disorder, cyclothymic disorder, or unipolar depression; patients with bipolar I disorder or bipolar II disorder were not enrolled. Nearly half of the patients were not taking medication at study entry. Family therapy consisted of 12 sessions focused upon psychoeducation, communication, and problem solving; the control consisted of one to two family sessions devoted to reviewing the patient’s diagnosis, daily mood monitoring by the family, and managing symptoms. Both groups were followed for up to one year after study entry. The mean time to recovery from symptoms was faster in the family therapy group than the control group (13 versus 21 weeks), and total time in remission was greater with family therapy (27 versus 20 weeks).</p><p></p><p>A common element of different family therapy models is enhancing communication among family members. Therapists work with the family on active listening, which includes looking at the speaker, concentrating on what is said, and clarifying any uncertainties [<a href="#rid11">11,13,14</a>]. In addition, the family is encouraged to offer each other positive feedback and to criticize specific behaviors or request changes in behavior in a constructive and positive manner (eg, “Would you please play the music more softly?”). The family is also encouraged to reduce “expressed emotion,” which is defined as critical and hostile comments about the patient, as well as emotional over-involvement with the patient [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. Some of the work aimed at improving communication can involve role playing.</p><p>Problem solving is another aspect that is generally addressed in family therapy. Therapists work with the family to identify and define their problems, and for each problem, consider the barriers to its resolution, set an achievable goal, list and evaluate the advantages and disadvantages for all available solutions (brainstorming), choose one option, develop an action plan and implement it, and evaluate the outcome.</p><p>Family therapy can also help the family [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Support the use of pharmacotherapy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Minimize conflict and volatility in the home</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Maintain reasonable expectations for each other</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Maintain routines (eg, meals together)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acquire social services</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5072388"><span class="h2">Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An observational study of adolescents with bipolar disorder (n = 12) who were treated with medications suggests that adjunctive interpersonal and social rhythm therapy may perhaps help improve symptoms and functioning [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. The therapy consists of 16 to 18 sessions (over 20 weeks) that address a relevant interpersonal problem (unresolved grief, interpersonal disputes, role transition, or interpersonal deficits), and also focuses upon psychoeducation, daily routines, and sleep/wake cycles.</p><p>Additional information about interpersonal psychotherapy is discussed separately, in the context of unipolar depression. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14680.html" rel="external">"Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) for depressed adults: Specific interventions and techniques"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5072395"><span class="h2">Motivational interviewing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Motivational interviewing may possibly improve medication adherence in pediatric bipolar disorder. A small, six-month, open-label randomized trial compared pharmacotherapy alone with pharmacotherapy plus motivational interviewing in adolescents with bipolar disorder (n = 43) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Motivational interviewing consisted of three sessions, each lasting 30 minutes, administered over the first three months. The intervention addressed adherence by educating patients about bipolar disorder and medications, eliciting thoughts and feelings about pharmacotherapy, assessing to what extent patients are ready to change their behavior regarding adherence, collaborating with patients to create an action plan for improving adherence, and evaluating the utility of the plan and need for modifications. The average medication adherence in the two groups was comparable, but the average improved in the group that received motivational interviewing and decreased in the control group.</p><p>General information about motivational interviewing is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14612.html" rel="external">"Overview of psychotherapies", section on 'Motivational interviewing'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1840573724"><span class="h2">Psychoeducation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Psychoeducation can be administered to an individual patient and family, or to a group of patients and families. Evidence supporting the psychoeducation for pediatric bipolar disorder includes multiple randomized trials [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>One trial compared psychoeducation (eight weekly sessions administered within a multifamily group setting) plus treatment as usual (eg, pharmacotherapy and/or other psychotherapy) with treatment as usual alone in 165 children aged 8 to 12 years [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Bipolar disorder was the primary diagnosis in approximately 70 percent of the children, and unipolar depression in the remaining children. One year after study entry, improvement of mood symptoms was greater in the group who received psychoeducation than the control group.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A second trial compared psychoeducation with family psychotherapy in adolescents with bipolar disorder who were treated with pharmacotherapy and followed for up to two years after study entry (n = 145) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Psychoeducation consisted of three sessions administered weekly to the patient and family, and focused upon the phenomenology of bipolar disorder, monitoring the patient’s mood symptoms, and relapse prevention. Family psychotherapy consisted of 21 sessions, administered over nine months, focused upon psychoeducation, communication, and problem solving. Time to recovery from either depressive symptoms or manic/hypomanic symptoms was comparable for adjunctive psychoeducation and family therapy. In addition, time to recurrence of either depression or mania/hypomania was comparable for the two groups. The results suggest that psychoeducation may be preferable because it is the less intense intervention [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. However, the lack of a placebo (nonactive) control makes it difficult to interpret the results; one possibility is that neither treatment was effective.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A small, 12-week trial compared individual family psychoeducational psychotherapy (two sessions/week) with active monitoring in a study that randomly assigned youth with either bipolar disorder not otherwise specified or cyclothymic disorder (n = 23) to one of four treatments: psychoeducation plus omega-3 fatty acids, psychoeducation plus placebo, active monitoring plus omega-3 fatty acids, or active monitoring plus placebo [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. In the analysis that compared the two groups receiving psychoeducation with the two groups receiving active monitoring, the clinical benefit of psychoeducation for improving depressive symptoms was moderate to large.

(See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15925.html" rel="external">"Pediatric bipolar disorder: Overview of choosing treatment", section on 'Adjunctive psychotherapy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>General principles</strong> – Patients must have the necessary motivation, interest, and cognitive capacity to participate in psychotherapy and complete assigned tasks. (See <a class="local">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Psychoeducation</strong> – Multiple randomized trials indicate that psychoeducation is efficacious for pediatric bipolar disorder.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Psychoeducation can be administered to an individual patient and family, or to a group of patients and families. The treatment addresses symptoms of mania  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91106" href="/d/graphic/91106.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), hypomania  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91107" href="/d/graphic/91107.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), and major depression  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91398" href="/d/graphic/91398.html" rel="external">table 3</a>); course of illness; medication names, doses, efficacy, side effects, administration, and monitoring; patient and parental attitudes about medications; adherence with pharmacotherapy; managing symptoms; and recognizing prodromal symptoms and preventing relapse. (See <a class="local">'Psychoeducation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Family therapy</strong> – Randomized trials have found that family therapy is efficacious for pediatric bipolar disorder.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Common elements of different family therapy models include problem solving and enhancing communication among family members. Family therapy can also help the family support the use of pharmacotherapy, minimize conflict and volatility in the home, maintain reasonable expectations for each other, maintain routines (eg, meals together), and acquire social services. (See <a class="local">'Family therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other psychotherapies</strong> – Other psychotherapies that can be added onto pharmacotherapy for pediatric bipolar patients include dialectical behavior therapy, cognitive-behavior therapy, interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, and motivational interviewing.
