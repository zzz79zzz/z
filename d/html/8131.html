         Significant valvular heart disease is a clinical predictor for increased cardiac risk for patients undergoing noncardiac surgery [

         The diagnosis of valve disease may have been previously established or a cardiac murmur may be auscultated during the preoperative examination. The quality, intensity, timing, and location of the murmur help distinguish a pathologic from a functional murmur but are of limited utility for evaluation of the severity or functional consequences of valve regurgitation. If valvular heart disease is suspected due to symptoms, a murmur auscultated on physical exam, or incidental findings on chest imaging or non-invasive imaging, then an echocardiogram is appropriate and findings should be correlated clinically with symptoms and evaluation [

         MR arises from abnormalities of one or more parts of the mitral valve apparatus, including the valve leaflets, annulus, chordae tendineae, and papillary muscles. The nature and severity of symptoms associated with chronic MR are related to the severity of the regurgitation, its rate of progression, the pulmonary artery pressure, and associated cardiac disease. In most cases, the patient remains relatively asymptomatic until the left ventricle (LV) begins to fail. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8163.html" rel="external">
          "Pathophysiology and natural history of chronic mitral regurgitation", section on 'Pathophysiology'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The most common symptoms, when present, reflect a decreased forward or effective cardiac output and include weakness, fatigue, and exercise intolerance. Patients with more severe disease and LV enlargement eventually progress to symptomatic heart failure with pulmonary congestion and edema. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8116.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic mitral regurgitation"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The murmur of MR is systolic, but its timing, duration, quality, intensity, location, and radiation are variable and depend upon the etiology and component of the mitral apparatus that is diseased. In most cases, the murmur is holosystolic, commencing with S1 and continuing up to and sometimes beyond and obscuring A2, a result of the persistent pressure gradient between the LV and atrium (
         <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef56783" href="/z/d/graphic/56783.html" rel="external">
          movie 1
         </a>
         ). The murmur is heard best over the apex, radiating to the axilla and when very loud may often radiate to the back. It is most often blowing and high pitched in quality. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1078.html" rel="external">
          "Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         There is a variable correlation between murmur grade and regurgitant severity with primary mitral valve disease. A loud murmur associated with a thrill (Grade 4 or greater) has a specificity of 91 percent for severe regurgitation, but a sensitivity of only 24 percent [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Conversely, severe regurgitation is rarely present with a Grade 1 to 2 murmur. However, there is a wide range of regurgitant severity with a Grade 3 murmur (which is common) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. In contrast, the loudness of the murmur does not necessarily correlate with severity in secondary (functional) MR. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8116.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic mitral regurgitation"

         In addition to history and physical examination, echocardiography is essential for establishing the etiology, severity, and hemodynamic consequences of MR. Echocardiography and other tests are discussed separately (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5334.html" rel="external">

          table 1

          table 2

         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. In staging and managing MR it is important to differentiate between chronic primary or degenerative MR versus chronic secondary or functional MR, with primary MR involving pathology of the mitral valve apparatus (leaflets, chordae tendineae, papillary muscles, and annulus) and secondary MR involving pathology of the ventricle [

         The risk of noncardiac surgery in patients with chronic MR depends upon the etiology and severity of regurgitation and the level of hemodynamic and clinical compensation as well as the risk level of the procedure. Predictors of increased cardiovascular risk in patients with moderate-to-severe or severe MR undergoing noncardiac surgery include depressed LV systolic function, atrial fibrillation, ischemic MR, and comorbidities (ie, diabetes mellitus, history of carotid endarterectomy) [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ]. Patients with good functional status and preserved LV systolic function are generally tolerant of general anesthesia [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,7,8
         </a>
         ]. (See

         Limited data are available on the risk of noncardiac surgery in patients with advanced MR. Perioperative outcomes and predictors of risk were illustrated by the following two observational studies of patients with moderate-to-severe (3+) or severe (4+) MR undergoing noncardiac surgery. Neither study described how many patients were symptomatic at baseline:

         A study of 84 patients (mean age 66 years) with moderate-to-severe or severe MR who underwent noncardiac surgery (28 percent low risk; 56 percent intermediate risk; 12 percent emergency) reported high rates of postoperative morbidity and mortality [

         High rates of major postoperative morbidity (27 percent, mostly pulmonary edema with prolonged tracheal intubation) and mortality (12 percent) were observed.

         Since patients with moderate-to-severe or severe MR are at risk for adverse perioperative outcomes, these patients should be identified, treated, and undergo individualized risk assessment prior to proceeding with noncardiac surgery. In patients with MR, cardiac risk of noncardiac surgery is also impacted by other cardiac conditions that may be present, such as coronary artery disease. LV systolic dysfunction and dilatation may cause as well as result from severe MR and heart failure should be appropriately treated. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6616.html" rel="external">
          "Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although evidence is limited, most asymptomatic patients with severe MR and normal LV systolic function can undergo urgent or elective noncardiac surgery at an acceptable risk with careful intraoperative and postoperative management, including careful attention to afterload control and fluid balance, which can affect the severity of MR (particularly if functional). Thus, elective noncardiac surgery is generally reasonable to perform in adults with asymptomatic severe MR and normal LV systolic function with less than severe pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery systolic pressure &lt;50 mmHg), as noted in major society guidelines [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2,9,10
         </a>
         ]. The risks and benefits of various treatment options should be carefully weighted if urgent noncardiac surgery is contemplated in a patient with symptomatic moderate to severe MR. Standard indications for intervention for chronic MR apply to patients who are planning to undergo noncardiac surgery; if delaying the noncardiac procedure is clinically feasible, then the intervention should be performed before elective noncardiac surgery to optimize perioperative risk [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. (See

         Intraoperative hemodynamic and anesthetic management of patients with MR are discussed separately. Summarized briefly, for patients with primary MR, preload should be maintained or reduced, to maintain intravascular volume while avoiding fluid overload, taking into consideration increased LV volumes and compliance; and excessive systemic afterload should be avoided, as noted in the 2014 ACC/AHA perioperative cardiovascular evaluation and management of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery guideline [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. In patients with MR, marked increases in blood pressure should be avoided since they can increase MR and diminish forward flow [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. Patients with MR and heart failure require careful titration of diuretics and afterload reduction to optimize perioperative hemodynamic status. (See

         AR is caused by inadequate closure of the aortic valve leaflets induced by disease of the aortic valve leaflets and/or distortion or dilatation of the aortic root. The inability of the aortic valve leaflets to remain closed or coapted during diastole results in a portion of the LV stroke volume leaking back from the aorta into the LV. The added volume of regurgitant blood produces an increase in LV end-diastolic volume; as described by Laplace's law, the increase in LV end-diastolic volume causes an elevation in wall stress. The heart responds with compensatory myocardial hypertrophy, which returns wall stress toward normal. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8159.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic aortic regurgitation in adults"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The combination of hypertrophy and chamber enlargement raises the total stroke volume. The net effect is that forward stroke volume and therefore the cardiac output are initially maintained despite the regurgitant lesion. Although LV volume is increased, end-diastolic pressure is normal due to an increase in ventricular compliance. Thus, the heart initially adapts well to chronic AR, functioning as a very efficient and compliant high output pump.
        </p>
        <p>
         As a result of these hemodynamic changes, patients with AR remain asymptomatic for decades, even if there is progressive ventricular dilatation. In contrast, dramatic signs may be detected on physical examination when severe AR is present (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8159.html" rel="external">

         There is a wide pulse pressure, which is manifested on examination as a water hammer or Corrigan's pulse. (See

         The diastolic murmur of AR begins immediately after A2 (

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The intensity of the murmur does not correlate well with the severity of AR. In some patients, the murmur is soft and barely audible, often appreciated only when the patient is sitting up, leaning forward, and holding his or her breath in expiration. However, the timing and duration of the murmur may be helpful. In mild AR, the murmur occurs only in early diastole; as the regurgitation becomes more severe, the murmur extends through more of diastole. (See

         The risk of noncardiac surgery in patients with chronic AR depends upon the severity and etiology of regurgitation and the degree of hemodynamic and clinical compensation as well as the risk level of the procedure. Predictors of increased risk of noncardiac surgery in patients with AR include depressed LVEF, serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL (&gt;177 micromol/L), and lack of perioperative medical management [

         Limited data are available on the risk of noncardiac surgery in patients with advanced chronic AR. Substantial perioperative risk was identified by a report of 167 patients with chronic moderate-to-severe (3+) or severe (4+) AR who were case-matched with 167 patients without significant AR [

         Given the significant risk of noncardiac surgery in patients with moderate-to-severe or severe (3+ or 4+) AR, these patients should identified, treated, and undergo individualized risk assessment prior to proceeding with noncardiac surgery. In patients with AR, cardiac risk of noncardiac surgery is also impacted by other cardiac conditions that may be present, such as coronary artery disease. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6616.html" rel="external">

         Aortic valve replacement or repair is indicated, preferably prior to elective intermediate- or high-risk noncardiac surgery, for symptomatic severe chronic AR
         <strong>
          or
         </strong>
         asymptomatic chronic AR with LVEF &lt;50 percent. In addition, patients with bicuspid aortic valve should be evaluated for aortic root and ascending aorta dilation that may require aortic surgery (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8155.html" rel="external">
          "Bicuspid aortic valve: General management in adults"
         </a>
         ). However, aortic valve surgery prior to noncardiac surgery is not always feasible, as some patients require an urgent noncardiac procedure, in some the risk of aortic valve surgery may not be deemed acceptable, and some may decline aortic valve surgery. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8160.html" rel="external">
          "Natural history and management of chronic aortic regurgitation in adults", section on 'Aortic valve surgery'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although evidence is limited, most asymptomatic patients with severe AR can undergo urgent noncardiac surgery at an acceptable risk with careful intraoperative and postoperative management, including careful attention to afterload control and fluid balance. Thus, elective noncardiac surgery is generally reasonable to perform in adults with asymptomatic moderate or greater degrees of AR with normal LV systolic function, as noted in major society guidelines [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2,9,10
         </a>
         ]. The risks and benefits of various treatment options should be carefully weighted if urgent noncardiac surgery is contemplated in a patient with symptomatic severe AR. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8160.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Intraoperative hemodynamic and anesthetic management of patients with AR are discussed separately. Summarized briefly, heart rate should be maintained since bradycardia-associated increases in total diastolic time may acutely increase AR, which may precipitate decompensated heart failure; afterload should be controlled; and preload should be maintained or reduced as needed to maintain adequate intravascular volume without precipitating fluid overload, taking into consideration increased LV volumes and compliance [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. In patients with advanced AR, marked increases in systemic blood pressure should be avoided since they can diminish forward flow [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. Patients with heart failure and AR require diuretics and afterload reduction to optimize volume status prior to noncardiac surgery. (See

         Although evidence is limited, most asymptomatic patients with severe AR and normal LV systolic function can undergo urgent or elective noncardiac surgery at an acceptable risk with careful intraoperative and postoperative management, including careful attention to afterload control, fluid balance, and heart rate.

         Bradycardia should be avoided in patients with AR since increases in total diastolic time may acutely increase AR, which may precipitate decompensated heart failure. (See
