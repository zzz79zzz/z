It has been used as a general term to refer to any combination of urinary symptoms or as a more specific term to refer to those symptoms primarily associated with overactive bladder (frequency, urgency, and nocturia). An international consensus conference defined LUTS to include symptoms relating to storage and/or voiding disturbances common among aging males [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. This topic will review the symptoms, etiology, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of lower urinary tract dysfunction in males.</p><p>Discussions of incontinence, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and nocturia are presented separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14611.html" rel="external">"Urinary incontinence in men"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6889.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation of benign prostatic hyperplasia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6891.html" rel="external">"Medical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6877.html" rel="external">"Nocturia: Clinical presentation, evaluation, and management in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H376939094"><span class="h1">PREVALENCE AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prevalence of LUTS in males increases with age. A survey of over 5000 community-dwelling males age ≥65 in the United States without history of prostate cancer found that 46 percent reported moderate to severe LUTS [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Another community-based study found that the prevalence of LUTS increases steadily with age, affecting 70 percent of males older than 80 years [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Diabetes mellitus appears to be a risk factor for LUTS, but the presence of urinary symptoms is not explained by the degree of glycemic control [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. This relationship was strongest in younger males (&lt;70 years old) and in those with longstanding (&gt;5 years) disease. Other conditions associated with LUTS include cardiovascular disease [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and erectile dysfunction. Although the pathophysiologic connection of LUTS to erectile dysfunction is not clearly defined, this observation has resulted in new approaches to the evaluation and management of both disorders.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H376939113"><span class="h1">SYMPTOMS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>LUTS are categorized as symptoms related to storage, voiding, or postmicturition [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>]. Males with LUTS may report one or any combination of symptoms that typically fluctuate over time and may remit spontaneously [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. LUTS can be associated with severe sleep disturbance [<a href="#rid10">10</a>], increased depressive symptoms [<a href="#rid11">11</a>], and decreased ability to perform activities of daily living [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Storage</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Storage symptoms, experienced during the bladder filling and storage phase of micturition, include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Urgency – A sudden, compelling desire to pass urine that is difficult to defer</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Daytime frequency – A patient's perception that he voids too often by day</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Nocturia – The need to wake at night one or more times to void</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Incontinence – Involuntary leakage</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Abnormal bladder sensation</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Voiding</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Voiding symptoms are those experienced at the time of urine flow and include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Slow stream – The individual's perception of reduced urine flow, usually compared with previous performance and sometimes compared with observations of other males. Splitting or spraying of the urine stream may be reported.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Intermittent stream or intermittency – Urine flow that stops and starts, on one or more occasions, during micturition.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hesitancy – Difficulty in initiating micturition, resulting in a delay in the onset of voiding after the individual is ready to pass urine.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Straining to void – An abdominal muscular effort used to initiate, maintain, or improve the urinary stream.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Terminal dribble – Prolongation of the final part of micturition, when the flow has slowed to a trickle/dribble [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dysuria – Pain, burning sensation, or general discomfort at the time of passing urine.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Postmicturition</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Postmicturition symptoms include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A sensation of incomplete emptying after passing urine</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Postmicturition dribble – The involuntary loss of urine shortly following urination, usually after leaving the toilet [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H376939100"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGIES OF LUTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Traditionally, LUTS in males were primarily attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and consequent bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). However, overactive bladder (OAB), characterized by involuntary contraction of the detrusor muscle, may be the principal cause or a contributory cause of LUTS in some patients [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Bladder outlet obstruction from BPH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>LUTS with symptoms of BOO are often attributed to an enlarged prostate or benign prostatic enlargement (BPE). BPH refers to a specific histologic diagnosis; although, the term is commonly used interchangeably with BPE despite the absence of tissue confirmation. We will use BPH here as synonymous with BPE.</p><p>Clinically significant BPH presents as LUTS with a predominance of voiding symptoms. Patients experience progressive symptoms that can range from nocturia to acute urinary retention and may include incomplete emptying, urinary hesitancy, weak stream, frequency, and urgency. Long-term or chronic BOO may eventually lead to bladder/detrusor decompensation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6883.html" rel="external">"Acute urinary retention"</a> and <a class="local">'Combination OAB and BOO'</a> below.)</p><p>Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation for BPH are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6889.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation of benign prostatic hyperplasia"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Other causes of bladder outlet obstruction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Other conditions that may cause BOO include urethral stricture; primary bladder neck obstruction; bladder neck contracture; detrusor sphincter dyssynergia; prostate cancer; and, less likely, meatal stenosis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Overactive bladder</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>OAB is defined by the International Continence Society as a syndrome of urinary urgency, with or without urgency incontinence, usually accompanied by increased frequency during both daytime and nighttime nocturia. Although OAB is typically associated with storage symptoms rather than voiding symptoms, OAB often accounts for symptoms in patients who are thought to have BOO but who fail to respond to therapy.</p><p>The incidence of OAB and LUTS among older adults does not differ by sex [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Urgency, urgency incontinence, and frequency have been reported in 10 to 13 percent of European males 50 to 59 years old and in 18 percent of American males 45 to 54 years old [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. The prevalence of OAB rises with increasing age.</p><p>Typically, the storage symptoms of OAB are more bothersome than the voiding symptoms of BPH. Patients with OAB and urgency incontinence in particular have higher rates of depression and are more likely to alter activities (eg, decrease work hours, change employment, or take early voluntary retirement) compared with those with OAB who do not have incontinence [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>OAB symptoms are often attributed to detrusor overactivity, characterized by involuntary detrusor contractions during bladder filling [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p>OAB may be classified as either neurogenic or non-neurogenic. Although the specific mechanism triggering overactivity is essentially unknown, neurogenic OAB symptoms are thought to be related to decreased suprapontine inhibition of the micturition reflex, leading to enhanced excitatory neurotransmission in the micturition reflex pathway [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Neurogenic causes include cerebrovascular accident, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Non-neurogenic, or idiopathic, causes of OAB include BOO (usually secondary to BPH), postoperative pelvic surgery, and bladder stones or other foreign bodies.</p><p>Treatment modalities for OAB are directed at either blocking the muscarinic receptor, the presumed site of neurogenically mediated detrusor overactivity, or by affecting the beta-3 adrenergic receptor to increase capacity [<a href="#rid19">19-21</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Initial management'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Combination OAB and BOO</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The incidence of detrusor overactivity and overactive bladder (OAB) with bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) has been reported to range from 30 to 60 percent [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Because of the similarities and the overlap in symptoms of clinical BPH and OAB, it can be difficult to separate the two conditions [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p>Animal models suggest that BOO can lead to the development of detrusor dysfunction; however, this has not been established in humans [<a href="#rid19">19,23-26</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h1">PATIENT EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who present with symptoms of LUTS should undergo an initial evaluation including history and physical examination with their primary care clinician or a urologist. It is important to determine the degree to which symptoms impact the quality of life [<a href="#rid1">1,27</a>]. This assessment can be semiquantitative but may be facilitated by use of a structured questionnaire. (See <a class="local">'International Prostate Symptom Score'</a> below.)</p><p>An algorithm for the initial management of LUTS in males has been developed by an international consortium representing multiple urologic societies from Europe, the United States, Latin America, and Asia  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57955" href="/z/d/graphic/57955.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3781438236"><span class="h2">History, physical, and initial testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>History should include the onset, duration, and severity of symptoms. Medications should be reviewed, as antidepressants, diuretics, bronchodilators, and antihistamines are associated with LUTS [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Factors associated with urinary incontinence should be clearly ascertained, and patients should be questioned regarding any previous neurologic symptoms, injury, or disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14611.html" rel="external">"Urinary incontinence in men", section on 'History and examination'</a>.)</p><p>Physical examination should include evaluation of the abdomen, pelvis, perineum, and a focused neurologic examination. A more extensive neurologic examination is indicated for patients with possible neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction. An attempt should be made to recreate activities that typically cause incontinence in the patient. Digital rectal examination should be performed to estimate prostate size and detect any abnormalities suggestive of prostate cancer.</p><p>Urinalysis is performed to evaluate for hematuria, glucosuria, pyuria, and bacteriuria [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Urine cultures are not recommended routinely but should be included if bacteriuria or pyuria are present or if there is otherwise suspicion for a urinary tract infection.</p><p>Initial laboratory studies may also include blood tests for renal function and glucose. The American Urological Association (AUA) recommends against routinely checking creatinine during the initial evaluation of LUTS. However, reasons to consider measuring creatinine include evaluation of possible upper urinary tract deterioration (eg, hydronephrosis) or high postvoid residual volumes due to bladder outlet obstruction.</p><p>The benefits and risks of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing should be discussed with the patient. PSA testing as a screen for prostate cancer should be considered only in patients with life expectancy greater than 10 years. Another indication for measuring PSA is as a proxy for prostate volume. PSA is also needed before treatment with a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, and monitoring for prostate cancer should be done during treatment, with the understanding that these medications effect the PSA levels. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7567.html" rel="external">"Screening for prostate cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6891.html" rel="external">"Medical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia", section on '5-alpha reductase inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h2">International Prostate Symptom Score</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) is a reproducible, validated index designed to determine disease severity and response to therapy. By itself, it is not a reliable diagnostic tool for LUTS suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia but serves as a quantitative measure of LUTS after the diagnosis is established [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p>The IPSS, similar to the AUA Symptom Score, consists of seven questions related to voiding symptoms  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef57680" href="/z/d/graphic/57680.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Scores of 0 to 7, 8 to 19, and 20 to 35 signify mild, moderate, and severe symptoms, respectively.</p><p>In addition, the IPSS includes a quality of life score as a single 7-point scale question asking the patient how he would feel if he were to spend the rest of his life with his current urinary condition. Similarly, the International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire - Male LUTS asks patients to rate, on a scale of 0 to 10, how much leaking urine interferes with everyday life [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2311206156"><span class="h1">INITIAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Our approach to initial management includes lifestyle and behavioral interventions and presumptive therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in most patients. This is consistent with recommendations from an international consortium representing multiple urologic societies from Europe, the United States, Latin America, and Asia  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57955" href="/z/d/graphic/57955.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3399230082"><span class="h2">Lifestyle and behavioral therapy for all patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Lifestyle and behavioral interventions are essential components of care for all patients with bothersome LUTS.</p><p>Lifestyle modifications include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Limiting fluid intake before bedtime or prior to travel</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Limiting intake of mild diuretics (eg, caffeine, alcohol)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Limiting intake of bladder irritants (eg, highly seasoned or irritative foods)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoiding constipation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Increasing activity, including regular strenuous exercise</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Weight control</p><p></p><p>Additional behavioral interventions include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Timed voiding regimens</strong> – In patients who exhibit obstructive complaints (ie, decreased force of stream) or who are noted to carry a high postvoid residual (PVR), instructing them to attempt to empty their bladder based on a time interval rather than by the usual sensations can be effective in reducing LUTS. In our clinical experience, requesting that they urinate "by the clock" (every 90 to 120 minutes during the daytime) seems to be effective.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Double-voiding techniques</strong> – Similarly, men who complain of obstructive symptoms may benefit by following one urination by a second attempt at emptying (the double void) within a minute or two of the initial void, which can be used in combination with timed voiding.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pelvic floor muscle training</strong> – Kegel exercises at time of urinary urgency and pelvic floor muscle training, including the use of biofeedback, may be helpful for patients with urgency symptoms that do not respond to voiding interventions. (See  <a class="medical medical_basics" href="/z/d/html/15929.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Pelvic floor muscle exercises (The Basics)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Data suggest that lifestyle modifications can improve LUTS. In a randomized trial of males with LUTS, an intervention that included education, lifestyle advice, and problem-solving skills resulted in less symptom worsening and less medication requirement compared with watchful waiting [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p>For individuals being treated for overactive bladder (OAB), lifestyle modifications can result in additional benefits [<a href="#rid32">32,33</a>]. As an example, in a trial among 204 males with OAB symptoms, the combination of behavioral (pelvic floor muscle training and bladder diary) and drug therapy (antimuscarinic and an alpha blocker) resulted in greater symptom improvement than drug therapy alone at 12 weeks [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2335943424"><span class="h2">Additional therapy</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3294686702"><span class="h3">Minimal symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with LUTS that are minimally bothersome, we suggest no additional treatment. We reassure patients that LUTS are common and not indicative of chronic disease, and we monitor them for worsening of symptoms that may warrant treatment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1288708617"><span class="h3">Bothersome symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most patients can be presumptively treated without extensive diagnostic testing, especially patients without significant nocturia. If nocturia is present as the predominant complaint or in the absence of the other cardinal LUTS, then frequency/volume charting quantifies the extent of polyuria to determine the approach  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57955" href="/z/d/graphic/57955.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>No significant nocturia</strong> – For patients without predominant nocturia who have ongoing symptoms despite lifestyle modifications, we suggest an initial trial of medication for BPH, since this is the most common cause of LUTS. These patients are often managed in the primary care setting. Patients with severe symptoms, recalcitrant LUTS, aversion to medications or the side effects, or concerning features warrant referral to urology.

Guidelines from the American Urological Association advise that all testing (including uroflowmetry, postvoid residual [PVR], pressure-flow urodynamics, and cystoscopy) be considered optional [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. The 6<sup>th</sup> International Consultation on New Developments in Prostate Cancer and Prostate Diseases recommends urine flow rate measurement (Qmax) and PVR, measured by ultrasonography, prior to initiating active treatment and for subsequent monitoring [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Urine flow rate measurement (Qmax, uroflow) is recommended prior to invasive therapy. Pressure-flow studies are recommended for the evaluation of patients when a precise diagnosis of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) is important. Both panels suggest cystoscopy and imaging of the prostate and upper tracts when indicated for evaluation of possible renal or malignant disease (eg, recurrent urinary infection, hematuria, renal insufficiency).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16"><span class="h2">Noninvasive studies</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Noninvasive studies for LUTS include uroflowmetry to measure Qmax, bladder scan or ultrasound to determine PVR, or transabdominal ultrasound to assess bladder anatomy for evidence of outlet obstruction.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17"><span class="h3">Uroflowmetry</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Uroflowmetry is a simple, noninvasive urodynamic measurement in which a patient urinates into a device that measures the volume/time of urine accumulation. Combined with a measurement of PVR (see <a class="local">'Postvoid residual'</a> below), it is an excellent screening tool for BOO in patients with LUTS but does not provide information regarding the presence of overactive bladder (OAB). Additionally, a diagnosis of BOO cannot be made or excluded based on uroflowmetry alone [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].</p><p>Uroflowmetry measures voided volume, voiding time, average flow rate, and Qmax. It also provides a linear analysis of the flow rate/voiding time so that the voiding pattern can be evaluated  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79658" href="/z/d/graphic/79658.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Qmax is the single best measurement obtained by this study to assess voiding dysfunction. However, a low Qmax does not distinguish between BOO and decreased detrusor contractility, and a normal Qmax does not exclude BOO. Qmax may be normal in the early stages of obstruction due to compensatory increase in detrusor contractility resulting in high voiding pressures.</p><p>Approximately 85 to 90 percent of patients with a Qmax less than 10 mL/s are found to be obstructed on pressure-flow studies. BOO can be accurately diagnosed in men with a Qmax of less than 10 mL/s and an International Prostate Symptom Score greater than 16 [<a href="#rid38">38</a>].</p><p>In addition to Qmax, the flow pattern should be noted; characteristic patterns may have diagnostic relevance. Obstruction generally demonstrates a flattened flow pattern with a low Qmax, a prolonged flow time, and a slow time to maximum flow  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58694" href="/z/d/graphic/58694.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18"><span class="h3">Postvoid residual</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although most urologists perform a PVR as part of their assessment, PVR does not correlate with the severity of LUTS, the presence of BOO, or treatment outcomes [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. An elevated PVR is found with obstruction but may also indicate detrusor decompensation due to various causes, including chronic BOO. PVR does not provide diagnostic information for OAB.</p><p>Measurements from uroflowmetry, and sometimes pressure-flow urodynamics, are necessary to determine the etiology of an elevated PVR [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. As an example, a man with a low Qmax and a high PVR may have either BOO or detrusor decompensation. Urodynamic studies could determine if the etiology of the elevated PVR was due to BOO, requiring treatment with alpha blockers or surgery, or to detrusor decompensation, which might require catheter drainage or close surveillance.</p><p>For patients with an elevated PVR without obstruction, we typically check the PVR once per year. If the initial PVR is &gt;500 mL, then patients should be checked two to three times per year.</p><p>An elevated PVR in some patients may have a secondary effect on the upper tracts. The presence of hydronephrosis and/or renal insufficiency could be evaluated with a renal ultrasound and serum creatinine.

Urodynamics are important in the evaluation of male patients with neurologic disease and in patients who fail treatment for BOO. Urodynamics are often performed before empiric treatment, when a non-BOO etiology is suspected, or when invasive treatment is contemplated. Additionally, men under age 50 should be evaluated with urodynamic studies prior to treatment due to the high incidence of nonobstructive etiology for LUTS in this population [<a href="#rid42">42</a>].</p><p>The urodynamic evaluation involves the concurrent multichannel measurement of bladder and abdominal pressures during the filling/storage and voiding phase of micturition. Detrusor pressure is calculated as the difference between the bladder and abdominal pressures. Urodynamics are the best method to diagnose high-pressure, low-flow voiding that is typical of BOO and differentiate it from low or normal pressure low-flow voiding due to detrusor decompensation.</p><p>Several parameters are measured to assess the relationship between flow and pressure during micturition.

The role of the cystometrogram to evaluate the bladder as a source of male LUTS is often overlooked because of a focus on the prostate as the sole cause of symptoms.</p><p>Storage LUTS may result from detrusor overactivity, obstruction, or other bladder abnormalities. The cystometrogram may demonstrate a normal pattern or some combination of the following abnormalities during filling: reduced maximum cystometric capacity (&lt;150 mL), involuntary detrusor contractions (&gt;10 cm H<sub>2</sub>0), or loss of bladder compliance.

A 2007 systematic review of randomized trials of botulinum, compared with no treatment, nonpharmacologic treatment, and pharmacologic treatment for OAB, found few well-controlled trials [<a href="#rid67">67</a>]. In eight small trials including patients with predominantly neurogenic OAB, botulinum improved incontinence, bladder capacity, and quality of life compared with placebo. However, in a retrospective study of 88 males who initiated botulinum toxin A for OAB and were followed for almost six years, nearly 75 percent discontinued treatment, mostly due to lack of sufficient effect or to side effects including urinary retention, need to self-catheterize, or voiding LUTS [<a href="#rid68">68</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2213913900"><span class="h2">Mixed BOO and OAB</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>BOO and OAB with low PVR</strong> – Symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB) with bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) and low postvoid residual (PVR) are the most common combination of findings in clinical practice. For these patients, alpha blockers can help improve symptoms of OAB and relieve obstruction by relaxing prostatic smooth muscle. On urodynamic testing, patients receiving <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9654" href="/z/d/drug information/9654.html" rel="external">tamsulosin</a> monotherapy showed an increase in the volume at first involuntary contraction [<a href="#rid58">58</a>].

(See <a class="local">'Symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Etiologies</strong> – Traditionally, LUTS in males have been primarily attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and consequent bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). However, overactive bladder (OAB), characterized by involuntary contraction of the detrusor muscle, may be the principal cause or a contributory cause of LUTS in some patients. (See <a class="local">'Etiologies of LUTS'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Bladder outlet obstruction</strong> – LUTS are often attributed to BOO resulting from benign prostatic enlargement or BPH. Voiding symptoms are suggestive of BOO but are not diagnostic. (See <a class="local">'Bladder outlet obstruction from BPH'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Overactive bladder</strong> – OAB is related to detrusor overactivity and is most commonly associated with storage symptoms that are frequently more bothersome than voiding symptoms. The cause of OAB is often unknown. OAB may be neurogenic (eg, secondary to stroke or other neurologic condition) or may be caused by chronic obstruction. (See <a class="local">'Overactive bladder'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – Male patients with LUTS should be evaluated initially with history; physical examination including prostate examination; and laboratory studies, which may include creatinine, glucose, prostate-specific antigen, urinalysis, and urine culture. Determining the International Prostate Symptom Score can be helpful in monitoring treatment response. (See <a class="local">'Patient evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Limited role for diagnostic studies</strong> – The role for urologic studies in evaluating LUTS is controversial. Postvoid residual (PVR) does not correlate with LUTS severity or provide diagnostic information regarding BOO or OAB. However, awareness of an elevated PVR may guide treatment with antimuscarinic medication as well as the need for closer follow-up. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic testing for persistent or complicated symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial management</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Lifestyle modifications</strong> – Lifestyle changes (eg, limiting fluid intake, avoiding bladder irritants, physical activity, weight loss) are the cornerstone of initial management. Data suggest that lifestyle modifications improve LUTS and reduce medication requirements compared with watchful waiting. Lifestyle modifications also have an additive effect when combined with medication therapy. (See <a class="local">'Initial management'</a> above and <a class="local">'Lifestyle and behavioral therapy for all patients'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Presumptive medical therapy</strong> – For patients with persistent, bothersome LUTS despite lifestyle modifications, we suggest presumptive therapy with an alpha blocker rather than other interventions or specialized diagnostic testing (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Alpha blockers improve the symptoms of BPH, the most common cause of LUTS, and can also improve some bladder irritability symptoms. The exception is patients with significant nocturia, for whom additional testing may be useful to determine optimal therapy. (See <a class="local">'Additional therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Indications for urologic referral</strong> – Primary care clinicians can initiate this presumptive therapy in most cases. We refer patients who are less than 45 years old; have a prostate abnormality, hematuria in the absence of infection, incontinence, significant nocturia, or increasing PVR; or who do not respond to empiric therapy. (See <a class="local">'Indications for specialist referral'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management based on LUTS etiology</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Isolated bladder outlet obstruction</strong> – Isolated BOO<strong> </strong>is generally related to BPH. Details on medical and surgical management of BPH are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6891.html" rel="external">"Medical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8093.html" rel="external">"Surgical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Isolated overactive bladder</strong> – For patients with isolated OAB and persistent symptoms despite lifestyle modification, we suggest a beta-3 agonist rather than an antimuscarinic agent (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). Although both are effective options, antimuscarinics are associated with more side effects, including a risk of dementia. Most of these patients will have already been trialed on an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist for general therapy of LUTS; in such cases, the beta-3 agonist or antimuscarinic agent is added. (See <a class="local">'Antimuscarinic agents'</a> above and <a class="local">'Beta-3 adrenergic agonists'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">If the baseline PVR is elevated, additional bladder voiding strategies may be needed for full bladder emptying; ongoing PVR monitoring is also warranted. Beta-3 agonists are also preferred in these patients to avoid exacerbating urinary retention. (See <a class="local">'OAB with high PVR'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Sacral neuromodulation and botulinum therapy are options for refractory OAB symptoms. (See <a class="local">'Isolated overactive bladder'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Mixed OAB with BOO</strong> – This is the most common presentation in clinical practice. Bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) should be managed first, as above, prior to addressing overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms, due to the risk of exacerbating urinary retention.
