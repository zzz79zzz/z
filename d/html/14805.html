         Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder characterized by symptoms of chronic or recurrent psychosis. It is commonly associated with impairments in social and occupational functioning [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. It is among the most disabling and economically catastrophic medical disorders, ranked by the World Health Organization as among the top 10 causes of years lost to disability worldwide for both males and females [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Antipsychotic medications are the first-line medication treatment for schizophrenia. They have been shown in clinical trials to be effective in treating symptoms and behaviors associated with the disorder. However, antipsychotic medications have significant side effects. Assessment and management of these adverse effects are an important part of treatment. Evidence-based psychosocial interventions in conjunction with pharmacotherapy can help patients achieve recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic addresses the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia in the maintenance phase of treatment and the management of side effects of medication. Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis are discussed separately. First-generation antipsychotics, second-generation antipsychotics, long-acting injectable antipsychotics, and psychosocial interventions for schizophrenia are discussed separately.

         The goal of maintenance treatment of schizophrenia is to minimize symptoms and functional impairments, minimize side effects of pharmacotherapy, avoid relapses, and promote recovery that allows self-determination, full integration into society, and pursuit of personal goals. (See

         </span>
         We recommend a multidisciplinary approach to maintenance treatment of patients who have recovered from an acute psychotic episode of schizophrenia. Comprehensive programs provide individualized treatment plans including pharmacotherapy, case management, family intervention, and other community outreach services.
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment programs offering multidisciplinary interventions have been associated with lower rehospitalization rates, lower core illness symptoms, and improved interpersonal and everyday living skills in patients recovering from a first episode of psychosis [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. As an example, a clinical trial randomized 34 community mental health centers in 21 states in the United States to offer people with newly diagnosed, nonaffective psychosis either standard care (181 patients) or a program of intensive treatment (computerized, algorithm-assisted medication management; family psychoeducation; resiliency-focused individual psychotherapy; and supported education/employment; 223 patients) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. After two years, subjects receiving the intensive intervention had greater improvement in quality of life, more involvement in school/work, and less psychopathology than the subjects in the standard care group. In this study, rates of hospitalization did not differ between groups.
        </p>
        <p>
         Limited availability of these programs is the main barrier to broad implementation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Psychosocial treatments'

         Patient education is the first step in effective maintenance treatment of patients with antipsychotic medication. To promote adherence to medication regimens, we recommend educating all patients treated with antipsychotics about their side effects (eg, extrapyramidal symptoms, tardive dyskinesia, sedation, dry mouth) and the increased risk of recurrence of symptoms due to premature discontinuation of medications.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patient education is important because some patients may view side effects as a sign that the medication is not working or is worsening their symptoms. Anticipation of side effects may prevent patients from unilaterally discontinuing their medication.

         If a patient has fully responded (ie, no longer has clinically significant psychosis) to the antipsychotic initiated for an acute psychotic episode, we continue that medication. We use the lowest effective dose. Duration of antipsychotic therapy is discussed elsewhere. (See
         <a class="local">

         Some patients, despite having symptomatic improvement with antipsychotic treatment, have persistent residual symptoms (eg, incomplete or partial response). Other patients have full response to antipsychotic treatment but have intermittent symptom recurrence. If the symptoms are bothersome to the patient or impair functioning, we consider the treatment response suboptimal.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our first step in patients with incomplete response or intermittent symptom recurrence is to assess medication adherence (see
         <a class="local">
          'Nonadherence'
         </a>
         below). For those with confirmed adherence, next steps depend on whether the antipsychotic dose is within therapeutic range.

         In patients who have been treated with subtherapeutic doses, we increase their dose until either the patient responds, therapeutic range is reached, or side effects limit further increases  (

         In patients who have incomplete response or recurrent symptoms despite the medication being in the therapeutic range for an adequate time period (ie, six weeks), data informing the optimal approach are very limited [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. If the symptoms are bothersome to the patient, we generally suggest switching the medication.

         For individuals who have only tried one or two other standard antipsychotic agents (ie, not

          clozapine
         </a>
         ) in the past, we try a different standard antipsychotic. There are no specific agents that are preferred. As with initial selection of antipsychotic therapy, the choice depends on medication side effects, the patient's comorbidities, history of adherence, and patient preferences. Additionally, if the patient has had a good response to a particular agent in the past, that would be a reasonable choice to try again. Selection of antipsychotic therapy and changing medications are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         We generally do not recommend doses above the therapeutic range. Most studies of antipsychotics dosed above the recommended range have found no clear benefit [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. If used, trials of higher doses should be limited to three months unless there is clear evidence of benefit. (See

         We typically do not add a second antipsychotic agent in patients who have suboptimal response because little empirical evidence supports this practice [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. Although a national cohort study of over 62,000 patients with schizophrenia in Finland suggested that combination antipsychotic therapy was associated with a lower risk of hospitalization compared with monotherapy overall, the only specific oral combination therapy that was clearly associated with better outcomes than its separate components was
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9289" href="/z/d/drug information/9289.html" rel="external">

         Patients with schizophrenia who do not benefit adequately from two or more trials of standard antipsychotic medications despite typically therapeutic doses and treatment durations (eg, six weeks) are considered to have treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

         <a href="#rid12">
          12-15

In the United States, clozapine is the only antipsychotic medication approved for this use. The efficacy of interventions for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, including clozapine, is discussed separately. Guidelines for clozapine prescribing, dosing, monitoring, and side effect management are described separately. (See

         In patients with poor response to medication or repeated relapses, nonadherence should be considered. We recommend asking patients about their medication adherence in a nonjudgmental fashion. In many cases, side effects may be the cause of nonadherence and may need to be addressed. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         We suggest using long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics for patients with schizophrenia when nonadherence is problematic or leads to frequent relapse. LAI antipsychotics are administered at intervals from 2 to 12 weeks. As an example,

         LAI can be administered at a starting dose of 25 mg every two weeks up to a maximum of 50 mg every two weeks.

          Paliperidone
         </a>
         12-week LAI is another option that can be administered at 12-week intervals after the patient has been adequately treated for at least four months on the four-week version of LAI paliperidone. (See

         For patients with known or suspected schizophrenia who have recovered from an acute first psychotic episode, we recommend continuing antipsychotics for at least two to three years.

         Whether to continue beyond this interval depends on the course and individual features.

         For those with a first episode of psychosis, we base the decision to continue antipsychotic therapy on the symptom intensity, level of psychiatric disruption, response to medications, and support. For those who had psychosis that was extremely disruptive, difficult to control, or accompanied by violence or suicidal ideation, we favor continuing antipsychotic therapy indefinitely. Otherwise, if it seems that potential relapses can be readily controlled, we explore the possibility of discontinuing medications after two to three years.

         For those who have had multiple episodes of psychosis in the past, we generally recommend continuing antipsychotic therapy indefinitely. However, in patients whose recurrent psychosis has been mild with clear warning signs, a trial of antipsychotic discontinuation may be reasonable. We individualize this decision weighing the potential risks and benefits of indefinite antipsychotic treatment, keeping in mind that antipsychotic treatment may be the reason that recurrences have been mild. We would not consider discontinuing antipsychotic treatment for individuals whose recurrent psychosis has been associated with violence, hospitalization, or other serious disruptions.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         If the decision is to discontinue antipsychotic medication, we recommend a gradual reduction in antipsychotic dose and weekly monitoring. We recommend restarting an antipsychotic medication, typically the same medication they were on previously, at the first signs of symptom recurrence.
        </p>
        <p>
         Discontinuing antipsychotic medications is associated with a higher rate of relapse [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17
         </a>
         ]. A meta-analysis of 9145 patients with schizophrenia in 75 randomized trials of 7 to 12 months duration found that patients who continued on an antipsychotic experienced a lower relapse rate compared with patients who were transitioned to placebo (24 versus 61 percent; number needed to treat = 3; relative risk 0.38, 95% CI 0.32-0.45) [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Systematic reviews and meta-analysis of randomized trials have found that maintenance antipsychotic medication reduces the risk of relapse after a first episode of psychosis in schizophrenia over a period of up to three years [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18-22
         </a>
         ]. Findings are equivocal for longer periods of treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, among those who are able to discontinue or reduce the dose of antipsychotic medication, doing so may be associated with better long-term functioning. In a trial of patients with schizophrenia who were randomly assigned to either dose reduction/discontinuation or maintenance, at two years, twice as many patients relapsed with the dose reduction strategy versus maintenance treatment (43 versus 21 percent) [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. At seven-year follow-up, however, patients in the dose reduction/discontinuation strategy were found to have superior functional remission rates (eg, function across domains including housekeeping, community integration, and vocational functioning) versus those in the maintenance group (40 versus 18 percent) [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Additionally, patients in the dose reduction strategy group had lower mean daily antipsychotic dose over the prior two years than those in maintenance group (2.2 mg versus 3.6 mg,

        </p>
        <p>
         Other trials also demonstrate that a fraction of patients with schizophrenia do not need continuous antipsychotic treatment throughout their lifetimes; however, there are no clear characteristics that can identify these individuals prospectively [

         Akathisia is the most common form of EPS. It usually presents as motor restlessness with a compelling urge to move or an inability to sit still. Individuals with milder akathisia may describe a subjective feeling of restlessness but not show restless motor behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients whose akathisia is intolerable or affects their response to medication we generally suggest cautious reduction of the antipsychotic dose while closely monitoring the patient for exacerbation of psychotic symptoms. In some instances, it may be necessary to address the akathisia pharmacologically rather than lowering the antipsychotic. As examples, when the psychosis was difficult to control or has required several ineffective trials, or when the medications have not yet had time to take effect. The treatment of akathisia in adults receiving antipsychotic medication is in the associated algorithm  (

         Dystonia is an involuntary contraction of major muscle groups that is highly disturbing to the patient. Some types of dystonia, for example laryngospasm, may be life threatening. Antipsychotic-induced dystonia is usually rapid in onset and is characterized by torticollis, retrocollis, oculogyric crisis, and opisthotonos.

         Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a syndrome consisting of characteristic involuntary movements occurring most often after chronic treatment with antipsychotic medications or another dopamine receptor blocking agent. TD syndromes are more common after sustained exposure to antipsychotic medications; however, they may appear as early as one to six months after initiation of these agents. TD may initially worsen or reappear after lowering or discontinuing medication. (See

          Seizures

         – Most antipsychotics cause a dose-related reduction in the seizure threshold. If a patient experiences new-onset seizures, antipsychotic drugs should not be assumed to be the etiology, as these rarely cause seizures in a patient not otherwise prone to epilepsy. Usual procedures for evaluation of new-onset seizures should be followed. (See

         Comorbid depressive disorders and anxiety disorders can lead to increased morbidity, poor functioning, higher relapse rates, and lower quality of life in patients with schizophrenia. Comorbid disorders may be difficult to distinguish from symptoms of schizophrenia or antipsychotic drug side effects. Properly diagnosed, however, these syndromes can respond to antidepressant and anxiolytic medications [

          Duration of antipsychotic treatment
         </strong>
         – We continue antipsychotic therapy for at least two to three years following recovery from an acute psychotic episode. For patients who have recovered from a first psychotic episode, and for those whose psychosis was mild or readily controlled, and was not accompanied by violence or suicidality, we suggest a cautious trial of gradual reduction and antipsychotic discontinuation after that period (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). For individuals with suicidality or with disruptive or severe psychosis, we continue antipsychotic medications indefinitely. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Duration of antipsychotic therapy'

         <strong>
          Monitoring
         </strong>
         – We assess current and interval psychiatric symptoms including hallucinations, paranoia, mood changes, sleep disturbance, suicidality, and homicidality at each visit. We typically have stable individuals follow-up weekly for the first three months of treatment then less frequently thereafter depending on clinical symptoms. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Psychiatric symptoms'
         </a>
         above and

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         We assess all individuals on long-term antipsychotic therapy at regular intervals for side effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms and metabolic derangement  (

         ). Additional monitoring is warranted for specific agents or patients with certain risk factors (eg, evaluation for agranulocytosis for those on
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9289" href="/z/d/drug information/9289.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Side effect management
         </strong>
         – Management of side effects depends on the specific side effect, the response to the medication, and the patient's history of response to prior medications. An example of the treatment of akathisia is in an algorithm  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131157" href="/z/d/graphic/131157.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Psychosocial treatment
         </strong>
         – We recommend comprehensive psychosocial treatment as an adjunct to antipsychotic medications for all patients with schizophrenia. (See
