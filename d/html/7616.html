The surgical management of patients with primary cutaneous melanoma includes wide excision of the primary tumor and selection of an approach to the regional nodal basin(s) at risk for metastatic disease. Accurate staging  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110664 graphicRef110663" href="/z/d/graphic/110664.html" rel="external">table 1A-B</a>) is important to assess prognosis and treatment options. While a consensus has emerged on many major areas of management, optimal management for some issues remains uncertain.</p><p>The initial approach to the regional nodal basin(s) is informed by whether the patient has clinically negative nodes or clinically apparent or suspicious nodal disease at presentation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7621.html" rel="external">"Staging work-up and surveillance of cutaneous melanoma"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7618.html" rel="external">"Tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system and other prognostic factors in cutaneous melanoma"</a>.)</p><p>The evaluation and management of the regional lymph nodes in patients with primary cutaneous melanoma is reviewed. Surgical excision of the primary tumor and adjuvant therapy are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7620.html" rel="external">"Surgical management of primary cutaneous melanoma or melanoma at other unusual sites"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7615.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy for cutaneous melanoma"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H513340479"><span class="h1">CLINICALLY NEGATIVE REGIONAL LYMPH NODES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H183569137"><span class="h2">Approach to the patient</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most patients with primary cutaneous melanoma do not have clinically detectable nodal metastases at the time of diagnosis. In the United States, over 85 percent of patients with melanoma present with clinically localized disease [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Although outcomes in this group are generally quite good, because of the enormous number of patients in this category, most melanoma-related deaths over time occur among such patients. Identification of patients with localized melanoma who benefit from further evaluation and treatment is therefore critical to decreasing melanoma mortality overall. </p><p>The risk of occult nodal involvement can be estimated using characteristics of the primary tumor, and this assessment largely informs the appropriate approach to managing regional lymph nodes. Validated tools including multiple clinical and pathologic variables can help determine the risk of occult nodal metastasis [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Rationale for surgical staging'</a> below and <a class="local">'Patient selection'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Low risk for nodal metastases</strong> – Patients at low risk for nodal metastasis can be managed with wide excision of the primary melanoma and clinical monitoring of the regional nodes.

(See <a class="local">'Lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2181697838"><span class="h2">Rationale for surgical staging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surgical staging of regional lymph nodes is a component of therapy for patients with clinically localized melanoma. In addition to wide excision of the primary melanoma, patients with an increased risk for occult nodal disease generally undergo SLNB to stage the regional nodal basins. Using this approach, most regional nodal metastases can be detected before they become clinically apparent. The rationale for performing the procedure includes the need for accurate staging regional disease control, reducing morbidity, and informing selection of patients for adjuvant therapy. Early identification and resection of nodal metastases is also associated with improved long-term survival, but this rationale is controversial. SLNB was also historically used to identify patients with occult regional metastasis who would be offered and might benefit from regional lymphadenectomy of the tumor-involved regional nodal basin, but this management strategy has almost completely fallen out of favor because of the outcomes of clinical trials [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3850806538"><span class="h3">Accurate staging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Complete staging, including pathologic status of the sentinel lymph node (SLN), when appropriate, provides an accurate determination of prognosis and appropriate selection for further management. </p><p>The landmark Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial-I (MSLT-I) was the largest trial to address the role of lymphatic mapping with SLNB in determining prognosis and its impact on survival [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The MSLT-1 trial demonstrated improved melanoma-specific outcomes for biopsy-positive patients who underwent SLNB to stage nodal disease compared with observation and lymphadenectomy when nodal disease became clinically apparent [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. Ten-year disease-free survival was significantly higher in the biopsy group compared with the observation group (intermediate thickness [1.2 to 3.5 mm]: 71.3 versus 64.7 percent, hazard ratio [HR] 0.76, 95% CI 0.62-0.94; thick melanoma [&gt;3.5 mm]: 50.7 versus 40.5 percent, HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50-0.96).</p><p>For patients deemed to have sufficient risk for nodal involvement to recommend SLNB (see <a class="local">'Patient selection'</a> below), pathologic nodal status is a powerful prognostic indicator [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. This is true for all primary tumor thicknesses and the effect is independent of other variables including ulceration status and mitotic rate. On multivariate analysis of data from MSLT-1, sentinel-node status was the strongest predictor of disease recurrence or death from melanoma [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. Among patients with intermediate thickness melanoma (1.2 to 3.5 mm), 10-year melanoma-specific survival was significantly reduced for those with compared with those without metastases (62 versus 85 percent, HR 3.1, 95% CI 2.12-4.49). Among patients with thick melanomas (&gt;3.5 mm), melanoma-specific survival was 48 versus 65 percent (HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.07-2.87), respectively. Prognostic factors associated with reduced survival included positive SLN status, increasing primary melanoma thickness, presence of ulceration, and melanoma located on the trunk. </p><p>The precision of regional nodal staging allowed by SLNB improves outcome prediction compared with complete lymph node dissection (ie, formal lymphadenectomy in the absence of known clinical or occult regional node basin metastasis) and has resulted in improved accuracy in the current American Joint Commission on Cancer Eighth edition melanoma staging system  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110664" href="/z/d/graphic/110664.html" rel="external">table 1A</a>) [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7621.html" rel="external">"Staging work-up and surveillance of cutaneous melanoma"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7618.html" rel="external">"Tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system and other prognostic factors in cutaneous melanoma"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1444113137"><span class="h3">Regional disease control</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Removal of SLN metastases also provides effective regional disease control for most patients. MSLT-I demonstrated that microscopic involvement of the SLN predicted outcomes for intermediate-thickness primary melanoma (1.2 to 3.5 mm) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Among patients with nodal metastases, five-year survival was improved for those who underwent immediate lymphadenectomy compared with those who had delayed lymphadenectomy. The subsequent Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial-II (MSLT-II) provided additional information on management [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. About 80 percent of patients with a positive SLN who were observed never developed regional nodal recurrence during long-term follow-up, demonstrating that all nodal metastases were removed at the time of the SLNB. (See <a class="local">'Negative sentinel lymph node biopsy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Positive sentinel lymph node biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H560446444"><span class="h3">Reduced morbidity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Complete lymph node dissection (CLND) is associated with significant complications including wound complications (eg, lymphocele, hematoma, infection) and chronic extremity lymphedema, which reduces quality of life [<a href="#rid4">4,5,11-18</a>]. Reducing morbidity by eliminating of the need for CLND in most SLN-positive patients is another strong potential benefit of the procedure. In the MSLT-II trial, the incidence of lymphedema was significantly higher in patients who underwent immediate lymph node dissection (24.1 versus 6.3 percent) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Similarly, in the DeCOG-SLT trial, adverse events occurred in 13 percent of the CLND group, with lymphedema (20 of 32) and delayed wound healing (5 of 32) as the most common complications, underscoring that CLND is not a benign procedure [<a href="#rid4">4,14,15</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2498674393"><span class="h3">Selection for adjuvant therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many patients with nodal metastases identified by SLNB are offered or recommended systemic adjuvant therapy with PD-1 inhibitor or BRAF/MEK targeted therapy. Some patients may not require adjuvant therapy, but complete consideration of its use generally requires knowledge of the pathologic status of the SLN. However, some patients with high-risk node-negative melanomas (Stage IIB/IIC) may be eligible for adjuvant treatment in the absence of sentinel lymph node information. The decision to proceed with treatment may be substantially affected by complete prognostic assessment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7615.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy for cutaneous melanoma"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2304955318"><span class="h2">Lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Lymphatic mapping is based upon the concept that lymphatic channels follow general patterns; however, the specific pathway for a given site on the skin cannot be accurately predicted. Mapping that drainage to identify the sentinel lymph node(s) will identify the mostly likely first site of metastasis within a given lymph node basin  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef121233" href="/z/d/graphic/121233.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). If the sentinel lymph node(s) are not involved with tumor, the entire lymph node basin is likely to be free of tumor [<a href="#rid19">19-21</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4221308930"><span class="h3">Patient selection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Selection of patients for lymphatic mapping and SLNB is based primarily on the risk of nodal metastases, but also the patient’s fitness for surgery, and overall treatment goals [<a href="#rid22">22-29</a>]. The first of these can be assessed based on the pathological characteristics of the primary melanoma and clinical characteristics of the patient. Patients undergo lymphatic mapping and SLNB based on their estimated risk of nodal metastases from either the AJCC stage (ie, tumor thickness  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110664 graphicRef110663" href="/z/d/graphic/110664.html" rel="external">table 1A-B</a>)) or by using a validated prediction tool (eg, AJCC, MSKCC, MIA). In general, SLNB is recommended for patients with a nodal metastasis risk of &gt;10 percent, while it is a consideration for those with risks between 5 and 10 percent, and not recommended for those with risks &lt;5 percent. Methods for quantifying this risk vary among different sources. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3157795448"><span class="h4">Primary tumor characteristics</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Tumor thickness is the most widely used pathological feature for determining which patients may be offered or recommended SLN biopsy. Beyond thickness, however, there is less agreement on what constitutes a high-risk feature.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tumor thickness</strong> – Guidelines recommend lymphatic mapping and SLNB for patients with melanomas more than 1 mm in thickness (T2) [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. For patients with melanomas 0.8 to 1 mm in thickness (T1b), SLNB is suggested, based on a full assessment of the patient and their risks and preferences. For melanomas &lt;0.8 mm in thickness, SLNB is generally not recommended unless other high-risk features are present. In a review of 7568 patients, less than 5 percent of those with a melanoma &lt;0.8 mm thick had a positive SLNB, compared with 5 to 12 percent in those with melanoma 0.8 to 1.0 mm thick [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7621.html" rel="external">"Staging work-up and surveillance of cutaneous melanoma"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7618.html" rel="external">"Tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system and other prognostic factors in cutaneous melanoma", section on 'Tumor thickness'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other pathological features</strong> – Other pathological features have been associated with higher risk for regional nodal metastasis including primary tumor ulceration, a high mitotic rate, and the presence of primary tumor lymphovascular invasion. These features are generally uncommon among truly thin melanomas, and the presence of one or more of these characteristics with a thin tumor thickness measurement confers risk. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Histologic subtype</strong> – Melanoma histologic subtype has also been associated with risk of nodal metastasis with desmoplastic melanomas (particularly "pure" desmoplastic melanomas) having a much <strong>lower</strong> rate of nodal metastasis [<a href="#rid30">30,31</a>]. Lentigo maligna melanomas have also been associated with lower rates of nodal metastasis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gene expression</strong> – Finally, gene expression profiling is an emerging technology for melanoma evaluation and some such assays have been reported to predict nodal metastasis risk, although additional validation of these reports is required to determine where they fit in the overall evaluation. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1512718747"><span class="h4">Patient characteristics</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The main patient characteristic is age, with older patients having a lower risk of SLN tumor involvement when controlling for primary tumor features, despite a worse melanoma-specific prognosis overall [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. Some series have also reported that male patients have a higher risk for regional nodal recurrence compared with female patients, though a similar increase in SLN metastasis rates has generally not been found.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2600904878"><span class="h4">Melanoma risk assessment tool</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several methods have been developed that use a combination of patient and tumor characteristics to help clinicians predict the risk of sentinel lymph node metastasis (eg, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, American Society of Clinical Oncology/Society of Surgical Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center online nomogram [MSKCC] [<a href="#rid33">33,34</a>]).

In a comparison of models, this tool significantly reduced the number of patients undergoing unnecessary SLNB compared with use of the MSKCC nomogram or the NCCN or ASCO/SSO guidelines, without losing sensitivity. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1330018872"><span class="h3">Preoperative lymphatic imaging</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1603138728"><span class="h4">Lymphoscintigraphy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We generally obtain lymphoscintigraphy prior to SLNB for melanoma for all patients. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy can be performed on the same day as planned surgery, or it can be performed in advance. If lymphoscintigraphy is performed in advance of surgery, repeat intradermal injection of radiotracer is performed after the induction of general anesthesia along with the intradermal injection vital blue dye. (See <a class="local">'SLNB timing and technique'</a> below.)</p><p>Injection of the radiotracer enables the use of intraoperatively gamma counting probes to identify and ensure removal of SLNs. Different radiotracers are used in different parts of the world; sulfur colloid and tilmanocept, both conjugated to technetium, are the agents approved for use in the United States. </p><p>The technique for injection of the radiotracer is important for accurate mapping. The goal of the injection is to fill the lymphatic channels available to the primary tumor cells, which requires intradermal infiltration surrounding the primary tumor site. Injection of these agents into the subcutaneous tissue is not effective due to the markedly lower number of lymphatic channels at that depth, as well as the risk of inadvertent intravenous injection that can result in hepatic and/or splenic radiotracer uptake.</p><p>Early dynamic images are obtained as well as later static images to determine the direction of drainage and location of SLNs. In areas of ambiguous drainage such as from melanomas arising on the trunk or head and neck region, imaging all potential basins is important. In addition, ectopic and interval basins should be imaged as well (eg, popliteal, epitrochlear, intermuscular triangular space of the back, etc) [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. </p><p>At most centers, planar images are obtained, but there is evidence that single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT imaging may be beneficial [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. This is most likely to be important in areas where drainage is complex drainage including the head/neck and perineum. The more precise localization provided by SPECT/CT imaging may also facilitate intraoperative identification of the SLN. </p><p>SLN locations demonstrated on imaging can be marked on the skin with the help of a hand-held gamma probe. </p><p>Failure to identify SLNs after injection should be a very uncommon occurrence. Several techniques can be used if no node is seen initially.

Overall, repeat injection is infrequent. However, identification of the SLN may sometimes be facilitated by removal of the primary tumor site (via wide excision) when a site is located closely to the primary injection site, due to the very high counts at that site (so-called radiotracer "shine through"). Using a collimator on the gamma probe may reduce shine through. </p><p>All nodal basins that demonstrate radiotracer uptake should be sequentially approached, and "in-transit" or interval regions between the primary tumor and the draining nodal basin(s) should also be scanned to ensure complete removal of all SLNs.

The capsule of the SLN should not be too firmly grasped, as this may tear and disrupt the most likely location of small metastatic deposits. It is useful to note the activity of the SLN at the time of removal. The basin should be examined again visually and with the gamma probe to identify any residual foci of activity. Any nodes that are blue or radioactive should be considered sentinel nodes and removed for pathologic evaluation.

We recommend that a thorough evaluation of the primary tumor biopsy site for the presence of possible residual primary tumor intact component as well as pathologic assessment by a pathologist trained in the evaluation of melanomas to ensure an accurate description, and for example, to identify transection of the base of the primary tumor, if present, such that the lesion may be thicker than measured from the biopsy alone. As significant changes in the diagnosis, tumor classification, and/or staging may be identified, we recommend histopathological review of cutaneous melanocytic lesions by an expert dermatopathologist [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. </p><p>Frozen section analysis of SLNs is not recommended, as it is substantially less accurate than permanent section with immunohistochemistry, it sacrifices some diagnostic tissue in processing of the sections, and knowledge of the result rarely leads to a change in surgical management (eg, CLND) at the time of SLNB [<a href="#rid46">46</a>].</p><p>Pathological evaluation of the nodes should involve multiple sections. Areas of particular interest in the node include the area with blue staining or greatest radioactivity, which may be marked intraoperatively.

However, the amount of tumor contained in the SLN, so-called SLN tumor burden, which should be noted in the pathology report, is highly correlated with clinical outcomes [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. Although multiple approaches to estimating SLN tumor burden have been proposed, maximum diameter of the largest SLN tumor deposit is most widely used.

A similar rate of relapse was observed in a report from MD Anderson Cancer Center [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. Ten of 243 patients (4.1 percent) with histologically negative sentinel lymph nodes subsequently developed nodal recurrence in the previously mapped basin. Reexamination of the original pathologic material using serial sections and/or immunohistochemical staining identified melanoma in the sentinel nodes in 8 of these 10 patients. Immunohistochemical staining for the melanoma markers S100, HMB45, or Melan-A/Mart-1 further enhances sensitivity, detecting 1 melanoma cell in 100,000 cells compared with 1 in 10,000 cells with routine hematoxylin and eosin stains (H&amp;E). </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1596971478"><span class="h2">Subsequent management</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2354918800"><span class="h3">Negative sentinel lymph node biopsy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Until recently, patients with a negative SLNB (ie, no tumor identified, in the sentinel lymph node) were only followed clinically to identify recurrence.

This should be particularly true for nodal recurrences in the SLN basin, although patient with microsatellites or in-transit melanoma have a risk for additional regional recurrence. Patients at high risk for recurrence (Stage IIB/IIC) may receive adjuvant therapy.

The 10-year distant disease-free survival rate was also significantly improved in this subset of patients (54.8 versus 35.6 percent, HR 0.62 95% CI 0.42-0.91).

The distant disease-free survival rate was also similar (45.3 versus 43.8 percent, HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.56-1.64).

As a result, nodal observation is the standard, preferred option when clinical observation is possible.

In the observation group, CLND was performed if there was evidence of regional lymph node recurrence. Melanoma-specific survival was similar for immediate CLND and observation (86 percent, adjusted HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.88-1.34). Disease-free survival at three years was improved for patients managed with immediate CLND (68 versus 63 percent), reflecting the lower rate of recurrence in regional lymph nodes.

Cross-sectional imaging may include CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and/or positron emission tomography and possibly magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. The clinical utility of such surveillance is not well defined, but the rationale has increased with the advent of more effective systemic therapies.

Some preclinical data suggest systemic checkpoint immunotherapy may be more effective if initiated prior to surgical resection. It also clearly provides an in vivo assessment of response and may decrease the extent of surgery required. At present, neoadjuvant therapy has been largely limited to clinical trials, and enrollment on such trials is strongly supported by the authors. Clinical evidence from the SWOG S1801 trial showed improved relapse-free survival for patients who received preoperative (neoadjuvant) and postoperative (adjuvant) PD-1 blockade compared with those who receive only postoperative anti-PD-1 treatment [<a href="#rid51">51</a>].

While the neoadjuvant approach is not yet available in some places outside of a clinical trial, some guidelines have accepted it as a standard option [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Where guidelines address the issue, dissection after systemic therapy should include the planned extent (ie, complete dissection) rather than a more limited dissection, the latter of which is the subject of ongoing clinical trials.(see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7615.html" rel="external">"Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy for cutaneous melanoma"</a>)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3288996507"><span class="h2">Therapeutic lymph node dissection</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2613544533"><span class="h3">Indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Therapeutic lymphadenectomy is performed for patients with macroscopic regional nodal metastases.

This type of presentation has been associated with similar or more favorable outcomes compared with patients presenting with nodal disease and a synchronous primary skin melanoma [<a href="#rid52">52-54</a>]. In the absence of distant metastases, these are considered stage III. It has been hypothesized that this group may represent patients with primaries that had completely regressed or were treated without biopsy using topical treatments and forgotten, or had primary nodal melanoma based on malignant transformation of nodal nevi. Exome sequencing studies in patients with unknown primaries generally show a mutation pattern consistent with cutaneous melanoma with evidence of characteristic driver mutations and evidence of sun damage-related mutations.

If the sentinel lymph node(s) are not involved with tumor, the entire lymph node basin is likely to be free of tumor. (See <a class="local">'Lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>SLNB is ideally performed at the same time as wide excision of the primary melanoma lesion. For patients who have already undergone wide excision, SLNs can generally be successfully identified and accurately reflect the status of the regional lymph node basin; however, more extensive surgery may be required. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>We generally obtain lymphoscintigraphy prior to SLNB for all patients, preferably on the same day as surgery. Lymphoscintigraphy involves intradermal injection of a radiotracer at the site of the primary melanoma site with subsequent imaging. A gamma counting probe is also routinely used intraoperatively to detect the radiotracer and identify the SLNs. Prior to surgery, we confirm the location of the SLN(s) on imaging to ensure drainage and that the site(s) receiving radiotracer uptake activity can be reached during the procedure. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>We routinely inject a vital blue dye intradermally in the operating room as part of a combined modality approach to SLNB (ie, along with radiotracer). Combined with intraoperative use of a gamma probe, the visual cue provided by the dye facilitates identification of the SLN(s) and may help limit extent of nodal basin dissection at the time of surgery. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Subsequent management</strong> – Subsequent management depends on the pathology of the SLN(s). (See <a class="local">'Subsequent management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Negative SLNB</strong> – Patients with a negative SLNB (ie, no tumor identified in the sentinel lymph node) are followed by careful clinical observation to identify recurrence. The risk of recurrence is lower than that of patients with identical clinicopathological features with a positive SLNB. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Positive SLNB</strong> – For patients with a positive SLNB, we suggest careful clinical observation coupled with ultrasound surveillance of the nodal basin rather than immediate completion lymph node dissection (CLND) (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Therapeutic CLND and/or evaluation for neoadjuvant therapy may be indicated if there is subsequent evidence of regional lymph node recurrence in the absence of distant metastases. (See <a class="local">'Subsequent management'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinically apparent regional lymph nodes</strong> — For patients who present with clinically apparent regional lymph node involvement confirmed cytologically or histologically (AJCC stage III), neoadjuvant immunotherapy initiated prior to surgical resection may become a reasonable standard option for patients who are candidates. The extent of surgery required may decrease for patients who have an excellent response. When lymph node dissection is indicated, we perform complete regional lymphadenectomy rather than partial dissection or lymph node sampling. The extent of nodal involvement and the location of all involved nodes cannot be predicted reliably preoperatively.
