Despite the technical skills required to ensure safe intravenous device insertion, placement represents only a moment, with the subsequent time spent caring and managing these devices representing the largest portion of time in the device "life-cycle." </p><p>Each clinical interaction with an intravenous device represents an opportunity to promote performance (eg, patency) or introduce harm (eg, infection, malfunction). Care and management of an intravenous device encompasses several aspects, including site assessment, evaluation of patency, and dressing changes. Care and management procedures span a wide interdisciplinary workforce, with varying expertise and competency. </p><p>Routine care and maintenance of intravenous devices are reviewed with an aim to outline strategies to prevent complications. We focus on strategies that are universal and include strategies that help mitigate extraluminal and intraluminal harm. Where appropriate, specific guidance for central compared with peripheral intravenous catheters is provided, as well as a section on guidance for pediatric compared with adult age groups.</p><p>Placement of intravenous catheters and devices and device-related complications are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8194.html" rel="external">"Central venous access in adults: General principles"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/13824.html" rel="external">"Peripheral venous access in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8180.html" rel="external">"Central venous catheters: Overview of complications and prevention in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1721635561"><span class="h1">GOALS OF CARE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prevention of intravenous device-related infection and malfunction are the primary goals of good intravenous device care. Adequate care and maintenance of intravenous devices can avert or reduce the burden of complications.</p><p>Catheter-related bloodstream infection is one of the main complications of intravenous catheter placement. The incidence varies according to type of device. For central venous catheters, the reported incidence is 0.87 in 1000 [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. For peripheral intravenous devices, 0.18 percent are affected [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Infections during intravenous device dwell are primarily caused by intraluminal or extraluminal routes  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef138640" href="/d/graphic/138640.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). To prevent infection from these sources, care and maintenance procedures must be targeted across both these domains. (See <a class="local">'Extraluminal specific strategies'</a> below and <a class="local">'Intraluminal specific strategies'</a> below.)</p><p>Many noninfectious intravenous device-associated harms cause significant morbidity and mortality. Catheter-associated thromboses affects up to 15 percent of central venous catheters and can be caused by suboptimal catheter selection, insertion, or care [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Device occlusion can result from infrequent flushing, failure to check for device patency, or motion of the device at the insertion site. With peripheral intravenous devices, problems can present in the form of infiltration or extravasation injury. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1356152939"><span class="h1">KEY TERMS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H77953980"><span class="h2">Antiseptic</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An antiseptic is a substance used to reduce the risk of infection by killing or inhibiting the growth of microorganisms in or on living tissue [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9244" href="/d/drug information/9244.html" rel="external">Chlorhexidine</a> gluconate (CHG) is a cationic biguanide that provides rapid antisepsis because of its broad-spectrum germicidal activity against most bloodstream infection-causing pathogens [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3569739830"><span class="h2">Aseptic technique</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Aseptic technique is a set of infection prevention actions during invasive clinical procedures and during routine care and management of indwelling medical devices.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H65473671"><span class="h2">Colonization</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Colonization is the presence of microorganisms in or on the body without signs or symptoms of infection or disease. For intravenous devices, colonization can be <strong>extraluminal</strong> or <strong>intraluminal</strong>  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef138640" href="/d/graphic/138640.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). With <strong>extraluminal </strong>colonization, microorganisms originate from the skin in and around the catheter insertion site [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. By contrast, <strong>intraluminal</strong> colonization refers to the process in which microorganisms enter via the catheter apparatus itself (eg, catheter hub, intravenous tubing, etc) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. This distinction is important, as both the timing and pathogens associated with colonization and infection differ according to these routes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1633207881"><span class="h2">Catheter-related bloodstream infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Catheter-related bloodstream infection is a primary (ie, not due to infection at another body site) bloodstream infection associated with an intravenous catheter. Diagnostic criteria include either isolation of the same organism from blood culture as from the tip of the catheter with a quantity greater than 15 colony-forming units [<a href="#rid4">4</a>], or alternatively a positive differential time to positivity (DTP). DTP requires the same organism to be isolated from a peripheral vein and catheter lumen blood culture, with growth detected sooner by two hours in the sample drawn from the catheter (ie, faster incubation). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2005934914"><span class="h2">Peripheral intravenous catheter</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A peripheral venous catheter is an intravenous device whose tip is positioned outside of the superior or inferior vena cava [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. These are placed from a peripheral venous access site. Midline catheters are a special type of peripheral intravenous catheter.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3631889060"><span class="h2">Central venous catheter</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A central venous catheter is an intravenous device whose tip lies within the superior<strong> </strong>vena cava, right atrium, or inferior vena cava [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. A central venous catheter can be inserted from a central venous access site or from a peripheral vein (ie, peripherally inserted central catheter [PICC]) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Tunneled central venous catheters, totally implanted venous devices (ie, subcutaneous ports) and PICCs are commonly used for the administration of long-term intravenous fluids, antibiotics, or nutrition support. PICCs are flexible catheters that are usually inserted into the veins of the arm.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Temporary central venous catheter</strong> – A temporary central venous catheter is one that is placed for shorter durations (eg, days, weeks) and removed after the indication for its use has been met. Common examples of these include nontunneled central venous catheters that are placed in critical care settings in the internal jugular or subclavian veins.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Permanent central venous catheter/device</strong> – A permanent central venous catheter is one that is placed for prolonged durations (weeks, months) and often anchored to, or implanted beneath the skin to ensure durability and to reduce the risk for infection. Examples include tunneled central venous catheters (eg, hemodialysis catheter) and subcutaneous ports. </p><p></p><p>It is important to note that the distinction between a permanent versus temporary device is at best an artificial one and is most often related to indication and implantation technique. In general, tunneled catheters and port devices are generally considered to be "permanent" devices, while nontunneled catheters are considered "temporary"; however, a nontunneled (uncuffed) central venous catheter can be tunneled to allow it to remain in place for a longer period. Similarly, peripherally inserted central catheters, although not implanted, can dwell for prolonged durations (ie, months for <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10307" href="/d/drug information/10307.html" rel="external">parenteral nutrition</a> administration), and as such as they may be considered permanent devices. Subcutaneous ports are placed typically for much longer durations. While imprecise, these terms are nevertheless often used in clinical care and hence it is important to provide context regarding these aspects. Importantly, the care and management of "temporary" and "permanent catheters" are predominantly the same with only minor differences, which are discussed in the sections below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1368267810"><span class="h1">UNIVERSAL CARE STRATEGIES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2449652673"><span class="h2">Aseptic no-touch technique</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Intravenous device care should always be performed using an aseptic, no-touch technique (ANTT) as a foundational step in preventing complications. ANTT is an aseptic technique theory/practice framework based on the concepts of key-part and key-site protection [<a href="#rid4">4</a>] and is a key step in preventing bacterial transmigration into an intravenous device. ANTT is achieved by integrating standard precautions such as hand hygiene (see <a class="local">'Hand hygiene'</a> below) and the use of personal protective equipment, with appropriate aseptic field management, no-touch technique, and sterilized supplies. </p><p>The five practice terms include [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Key-site</strong> – The portal of entry into the patient (ie, intravenous device)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Key-part</strong> – The part of the procedure equipment that, if contaminated, is likely to contaminate the patient (eg, syringe tip, male Luer end/spike of administration set, injection needle)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>General aseptic field</strong> – A decontaminated and disinfected procedure tray or single-use procedure kit/barrier</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Critical aseptic field</strong> – A sterile drape/barrier</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Micro critical aseptic field</strong> – A small, protective sterile surface (eg, sterile caps, covers) that protects key-parts individually</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2669049101"><span class="h2">Hand hygiene</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hand hygiene is the single most important measure to reduce transmission of microorganisms across intravenous devices [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].

Human skin naturally has abundant microbiologic flora. Microorganisms gain access to the device insertion wound and migrate along the insertion tract into the fibrin sheath that surrounds the intravenous device. Each of the following care techniques aims to prevent this translocation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1808660106"><span class="h2">Skin antisepsis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Skin antisepsis involves mechanical and chemical removal of microorganisms from the skin at the intravenous device insertion site during dressing change procedures. Trials evaluating the effectiveness of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9244" href="/d/drug information/9244.html" rel="external">chlorhexidine</a> gluconate (CHG) and other skin decontaminants have focused primarily on central venous catheters; however, it is reasonable to expect that the efficacy of any skin decontaminants would be similar for peripheral intravenous devices.</p><p>Alcohol-containing CHG (≥0.5 percent) is superior to other skin antiseptic agents (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9801" href="/d/drug information/9801.html" rel="external">povidone iodine</a> in water or alcohol) at reducing microbial contamination at the intravenous device insertion site and thereby preventing catheter-related bloodstream infection [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. </p><p>In the intensive care unit setting, the use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9244" href="/d/drug information/9244.html" rel="external">chlorhexidine</a> for routine bathing, rather than soap and water, may also be an effective strategy to decrease the rate of bloodstream infection. Issues related to patient bathing in the intensive care unit and noncritical care units are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3810.html" rel="external">"Nosocomial infections in the intensive care unit: Epidemiology and prevention", section on 'Patient bathing/decolonization'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4042.html" rel="external">"Infection prevention: Precautions for preventing transmission of infection", section on 'Other clinical infection control issues'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2724631906"><span class="h2">Dressing and securement</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3365924619"><span class="h3">Dressings as a shield</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Dressing products cover the catheter entry site and provide a protective barrier from contamination from the environment [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. Prior to application of adhesive products to secure dressings, all skin decontaminants must be allowed to dry completely. (See <a class="local">'Skin antisepsis'</a> above.)</p><p>Ideally, intravenous device dressings should be transparent (ie, sterile semipermeable dressing; eg, Tegaderm, Opsite), to allow frequent assessment of the exit site. However, if the insertion site is bleeding or oozing, additional products can be applied beneath, including hemostatic agents and gauze products. In a systematic review that included 22 studies involving 7436 participants comparing various types of dressings, the authors concluded that it was unclear whether there were any differences in the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infection comparing standard polyurethane with gauze [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Nevertheless, for practical reasons, we agree with practice guidelines that do not recommend the use of gauze beyond 24 hours following catheter insertion, or in circumstances in which there is <strong>no </strong>active oozing or bleeding from the catheter [<a href="#rid4">4,14</a>]. Overlying gauze dressings obscure the view of the catheter insertion site and can serve as media for bacterial growth.</p><p>To achieve their intended goal, dressings must be kept clean, dry, and intact. Clinical guidelines recommend routine dressing changes (every seven days for polyurethane dressings,) unless contraindicated due to clinical safety (eg, extreme critical illness) [<a href="#rid4">4,14</a>]. More frequent dressings may need to be performed if any visible oozing, wound discharge, or loosened (including peeling) dressing is noted. However, excessively frequent dressing changes can also increase the risk of infection, bacterial colonization, and skin irritation [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Thus, in general, routinely changing the dressing more frequently than every seven days is generally not recommended [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1667823583"><span class="h3">Medicated dressings to prevent infections</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Medication-impregnated dressing products provide a slow release of antiseptic solutions onto the intravenous access site (see <a class="local">'Key terms'</a> above). There are a variety of antiseptic solutions available; however, the most common are CHG and silver-impregnated dressings. The strongest evidence for medicated dressings relates to CHG dressing for central venous catheters, where evidence suggests immediate and delayed benefits from reduced microbial colonization preventing extraluminal infection. In general, medicated dressings are selected in response to a particular clinical circumstance, such as nontunneled central venous catheters in an intensive care unit setting, or for the management of long-term hemodialysis catheters; however, these dressings may also benefit patients in other circumstances. </p><p>All trials evaluating the effectiveness of medicated dressings have been performed in central rather than peripheral intravenous devices. While there is no physiological reason that medication-impregnated dressings would function differently in peripheral intravenous devices, their necessity and value have not been established.</p><p>In the systematic review discussed above, the rate of central venous catheter-related bloodstream infection per 1000 patient-days was significantly reduced for central venous catheters managed with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9244" href="/d/drug information/9244.html" rel="external">chlorhexidine</a> gluconate (CHG)-impregnated dressing products (eg, disk, gel, or throughout dressing) compared with plain polyurethane dressings (relative risk [RR] 0.51, 95% CI 0.33-0.78) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. There was moderate-quality evidence that catheter tip colonization was also reduced with CHG dressings compared with plain polyurethane dressings (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.47-0.73). It was unclear if there was any difference in rates of skin irritation or damage when CHG dressings were used compared with plain polyurethane dressings (moderate-quality evidence; RR 11.17, 95% CI 0.84-149.48).</p><p>There are little data to support the use of silver-impregnated dressings outside of the hemodialysis population. In patients who are dialyzing with tunneled hemodialysis catheters, the use of a silver-impregnated dressing may be more effective for prevention of infection compared with CHG dressings [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. However, some have described development of bacterial resistance with silver-impregnated dressings [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Thus, evidence to support optimal recommendations for use of these dressings is limited at this time. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1843.html" rel="external">"Central venous catheters for acute and chronic hemodialysis access and their management", section on 'Dressings'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1973090231"><span class="h2">Device securement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Intravenous devices are foreign objects, and securement products are necessary to stabilize the external portion of the device to the surrounding skin. By doing so, securement devices ensure stability of the device either in a central or peripheral position.

Other locking solutions are used only when clinically indicated and generally as secondary prophylaxis in patients who depend on their catheters for life-saving therapies (eg, hemodialysis, nutrition support).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Dressing changes</strong> – Dressings cover the catheter entry site and provide a barrier from contamination and must be kept clean, dry, and intact. Transparent dressings are ideal for frequent assessment of the catheter exit site. Other types of dressings may be needed depending on the clinical situation. The frequency of dressing changes depends on the material selected (eg, polyurethane dressings are changed every seven days). Medicated dressings may help prevent catheter-related infection but are generally only selected only in response to a particular clinical circumstance (eg, nontunneled central venous catheters in an intensive care unit setting, long-term hemodialysis catheters). (See <a class="local">'Dressing and securement'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Device securement</strong> – Device securement is necessary to stabilize the device to prevent damage to the vessel that can lead to thrombosis or irritation to the surrounding tissues and infection. Select a securement appropriate to the device and insertion location  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef138642" href="/d/graphic/138642.html" rel="external">table 1</a>); all devices should have at least one element of securement. (See <a class="local">'Dressing and securement'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Removal and replacement</strong> – Intravenous devices are removed as soon as they are no longer clinically needed, or for complications. Observers trained to recognize catheter complications must examine the catheter site at least once each day. The risk of infection increases with the duration of catheterization for most device types. (See <a class="local">'Catheter dwell time and replacement'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For catheters placed in a setting in which adherence to aseptic technique cannot be assured (eg, emergency catheter placement), the catheter should be replaced as soon as possible (and within 48 hours after insertion). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For peripheral intravenous devices, we suggest against routine replacement at a designated interval (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). Catheters should be removed when clinically indicated. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For temporary central venous catheters, we recommend against routine replacement at a designated interval (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). Furthermore, when replacement is needed, we recommend replacement at a new site, rather than using guidewire exchange techniques (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). This approach reduces the risk of bloodstream infection. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Long-term (permanent) central venous catheters are designed to remain in place for prolonged durations (weeks, months) and are generally only removed for complications (eg, thrombosis, malposition, infection) or when they are no longer required.</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Patel PR, Weiner-Lastinger LM, Dudeck MA, et al.
