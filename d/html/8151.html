There is a wide range of clinical severity associated with MFS. Although many clinicians view the disorder in terms of classic ocular, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal abnormalities, these patients also demonstrate significant involvement of the lung, skin, and central nervous system.</p><p>The management and prognosis of MFS and related disorders will be reviewed here. The genetics, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of MFS and related disorders and issues related to MFS in pregnancy are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8150.html" rel="external">"Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis of Marfan syndrome and related disorders"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8129.html" rel="external">"Heritable thoracic aortic diseases: Pregnancy and postpartum care"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The prognosis of patients with MFS has improved with the use of medical therapy (beta blockers and angiotensin receptor blockers), routine and noninvasive monitoring of aortic size, elective surgical repair of the aorta, and restriction of vigorous physical exercise. The physiologic changes that occur during pregnancy are associated with an increased risk of aortic dilation and dissection and therefore require more intensive monitoring. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8129.html" rel="external">"Heritable thoracic aortic diseases: Pregnancy and postpartum care"</a>.)</p><p>The 2022 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for aortic disease include recommendations for MFS, Loeys-Dietz Syndrome and other genetic syndromes affecting the aorta [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. These guidelines are similar to the recommendations for MFS published in 2014 by a Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">AORTIC MONITORING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Monitoring of the thoracic aortic diameter is recommended to identify patients at high risk for aortic dissection.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">How to measure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The aortic diameter measurement technique applied to follow a given patient should be noted and used consistently during serial follow-up with nomograms specific for that technique applied when determining deviation from the appropriate age- and size-matched normal population (generally expressed as a Z-score, which designates number of standard deviations from the mean). Since normal aortic dimensions vary with age and body surface area, these parameters should be taken into account  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97882 graphicRef97883" href="/d/graphic/97882.html" rel="external">figure 1A-B</a>). Measurement conventions for aortic diameter differ for echocardiography as compared with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the measurement convention may also differ within modalities from one institution to another.</p><p>Multiple conventions are applied when measuring the maximal dimension of the aortic root and ascending aorta by echocardiography. Examples include the leading-edge-to-leading-edge technique in diastole (a common practice among adult cardiologists) or the inner-edge-to-inner-edge technique in systole (a common practice among pediatric cardiologists). Similar variability can be observed when applying CT or MRI measurements, depending upon whether or not contrast agents are utilized. In general, the external diameter is expected to be 2 to 4 mm larger than the internal diameter. There is also variation in practice with regard to whether the external or internal diameter is operative when considering thresholds for surgical repair. (See <a class="local">'Indications in MFS'</a> below.)</p><p>For MFS, aortic diameter at the sinuses of Valsalva is the key measurement since this is the segment that generally dilates initially and is at greatest risk for aortic dissection. This measurement can usually be monitored by echocardiography. Greater length of aortic dilation (ie, to the aortic arch versus limited to the sinuses of Valsalva) can be associated with a worse prognosis [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Monitoring MFS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As recommended in the 2022 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for aortic disease, patients with MFS should have transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) performed at the time of diagnosis and six months later to determine the aortic root and ascending aortic diameters and their rate of enlargement [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. If the aortic root or ascending aorta are not adequately seen on TTE, CT or MRI is performed.</p><p>For patients with adequate aortic imaging by TTE, we suggest performing cross-sectional aortic imaging with CT or MRI at the time of initial evaluation to confirm that the aorta measurements determined by echocardiography are not underestimated, and also to identify aortic or vascular disease that is not appreciated by echocardiography. When ascending aorta dimensions measured by echocardiography and cross-sectional imaging correlate with each other and no additional aortic disease is identified, cross-sectional imaging is generally repeated every three to five years and prior to elective operation or planned pregnancy. This frequency should be increased if there is a personal or family history of disease in the descending thoracic or abdominal aorta in association with MFS.</p><p>In adults with MFS, if the aortic diameter is documented as stable over time, then annual imaging is recommended if the aortic dimension is less than 45 mm. If the aortic diameter is ≥45 mm or shows consistent growth over time, then more frequent imaging is suggested (eg, twice yearly) and surgery may be indicated (see <a class="local">'Indications in MFS'</a> below). More frequent imaging is also recommended if there are concerns regarding ventricular or valve function [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>For children with MFS, annual imaging is recommended if the aortic dimension is documented as stable over time and not markedly enlarged. There are no validated age-specific absolute aortic diameters that can be used to determine when more frequent imaging should be performed or when prophylactic aortic surgery is indicated. It is recommended that aortic measurements be compared to the body surface area. Sonographic measurement of aortic diameter should be performed annually as long as the increase in aortic size remains proportional to the increase in body surface area. Twice-yearly measurements are recommended if aortic size (expressed as a percentage increase) diverges from the height when expressed in the same fashion.</p><p>Individuals under 20 years of age with systemic findings suggestive of MFS, but without cardiovascular involvement, should also have annual echocardiograms due to the potential risk of development of aortic disease [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Adults with repeatedly normal and stable aortic measurements without a definitive genetic predisposition for aortic enlargement but with a sense of predisposition based upon family history or borderline aortic measurements can be seen at two- to three-year intervals.</p><p>Since measurement techniques vary between imaging modalities, patient age, and institutional preference, it is important to try to use the same imaging modality at the same institution for a specific patient; this facilitates comparison of images and monitoring of aortic dimension over time.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Monitoring Loeys-Dietz and related syndromes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Complete aortic imaging should be performed at the time of diagnosis, and follow-up imaging of the thoracic aorta (generally by TTE) performed six months after, in patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome [<a href="#rid1">1</a>] or a confirmed genetic mutation associated with aortic aneurysms and aortic dissections (eg, TGFBR1, TGFBR2, SMAD3, TGFB2, FBN1, ACTA2, or MYH11) to determine if aortic enlargement is occurring.</p><p>If the aortic dimension is stable and no other specific problem in another vascular segment has been identified, patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (potentially caused by mutations in TGFBR1, TGFBR2, SMAD3, TGFB2, or TGFB3) should have serial MRI or CT angiography from the cerebrovascular circulation to the pelvis (with a maximal interval between studies of two years) since they commonly develop aneurysms that are amenable to prophylactic surgical management.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">DRUG THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For adults with MFS and aortic aneurysm, we recommend a beta blocker or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB); we also suggest this therapy for children. For patients who tolerate beta blocker or ARB therapy, we suggest adding the other type of agent (beta blocker or ARB), as tolerated. For a patient with MFS and aortic aneurysm, it is reasonable to reduce blood pressure with beta blockers and/or ARB to the lowest level the patient can tolerate without adverse effects.</p><p>For adults and children with MFS without aortic aneurysm but with one or more risk factors for development of aortic aneurysm (such as demonstrated aortic root enlargement, a family history of aortic root enlargement, or a mutation previously observed to associate with aortic disease), we suggest a beta blocker or ARB.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Beta blocker</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h3">Beta blocker use</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For a patient with MFS with an indication for beta blocker use, we generally use a long-acting agent (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8940" href="/d/drug information/8940.html" rel="external">atenolol</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9645" href="/d/drug information/9645.html" rel="external">metoprolol</a> extended release), as daily dosing may improve compliance.</p><p>We generally start with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8940" href="/d/drug information/8940.html" rel="external">atenolol</a> 0.5 mg/kg/day and increase the dose based upon heart rate response, with the goal of maintaining heart rate after submaximal exercise (eg, running up and down two flights of stairs) below 100 beats/minute in adults and below 110 beats/minute in children [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. The atenolol dose rarely exceeds 2 mg/kg/day. We generally round the dose to the nearest 25 mg (ie, tablet size). The usual adult dose range for atenolol is 25 to 100 mg per day; maximum dose 200 mg/day.</p><p>Among pregnant women, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9540" href="/d/drug information/9540.html" rel="external">labetalol</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9645" href="/d/drug information/9645.html" rel="external">metoprolol</a> are the preferred beta blockers since <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8940" href="/d/drug information/8940.html" rel="external">atenolol</a> may impair fetal growth, as discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8129.html" rel="external">"Heritable thoracic aortic diseases: Pregnancy and postpartum care"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H137348736"><span class="h3">Beta blocker outcomes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prophylactic treatment with beta blockers has been adopted by many specialized care centers for adults with MFS since the mid-1990s, since publication of an open-label randomized trial comparing beta blocker therapy and no specific treatment in 70 adults with classic MFS [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The following observations were noted at approximately ten years:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with MFS treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9829" href="/d/drug information/9829.html" rel="external">propranolol</a> (mean dose 212 mg/day) had a slower rate of aortic dilatation as reflected by a lower mean slope of the regression line for aortic root dimensions (0.023 versus 0.084 per year).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Survival for the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9829" href="/d/drug information/9829.html" rel="external">propranolol</a> group was higher during the middle years of the trial and slightly but not significantly better at the end of the trial. However, few patients reached a clinical end point (five in the treatment group and nine in the control group).</p><p></p><p>As there are limited data directly comparing beta blocker therapy versus control, an individual patient data meta-analysis estimated the effects of beta blocker versus control by comparing the effects of angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) versus control (mean age 28.6 years) with the effects of ARB versus beta blocker (mean age 13.9 years) on the annual rate of change of aortic root dimension Z score at the sinuses of Valsalva, adjusted for body surface area [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The indirectly calculated difference in the annual change in the aortic root Z score between beta blocker and control was -0.09 (95% CI -0.18 to 0.00). This indirect estimate of the effect of beta blockers is similar that seen in the small prior randomized trial directly comparing a beta blocker with no treatment [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>].</p><p>Data supporting the use of beta blockers in children are less clear:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In an observational study, 44 children and adolescents with MFS were followed for almost four years [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The 20 patients who were taking a beta blocker and the six patients taking a calcium channel blocker had a slower absolute aortic growth rate (0.9 versus 1.8 mm/year in untreated patients) and aortic growth rate adjusted for age and body size. Protection was not complete since 5 of the 26 treated patients had a major cardiovascular complication requiring surgery over a four-year follow-up [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Of note, calcium channel blocker therapy is generally avoided in patients with MFS based on results of other studies. (See <a class="local">'Drugs to avoid'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A retrospective study of 63 children was conducted at two sites in which beta blocker therapy versus no therapy was assigned according to local practice [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. There was no difference in the rate of change in aortic root measurements between the two groups during follow-up (mean of 79 months). Only three patients underwent aortic root replacement, one in the treatment group and two in the untreated group. There was a trend toward more side effects in treated patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Additional randomized trials are needed to determine the efficacy of beta blockers versus placebo in children with MFS.</p><p></p><p>Beta blockers decrease myocardial contractility, pulse pressure, and heart rate and may afford some protection from aortic root enlargement based on these hemodynamic effects. There is also limited evidence that beta blockers can improve the elastic properties of the aorta, particularly in patients with an aortic root diameter &lt;40 mm [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Renin-angiotensin system antagonist</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As described above, an ARB is an alternative or companion treatment to a beta blocker for patients with MFS with aortic aneurysm or a risk factor for development of aortic aneurysm.</p><p>Therapy targeting the renin-angiotensin system may attenuate the clinical manifestations of MFS by blocking TGF-beta signaling [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>The role of therapy targeting the renin-angiotensin system has been evaluated by several studies [<a href="#rid12">12-17</a>] but there is limited evidence for impact on clinical endpoints:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ARB</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Comparison with control</strong> – An individual patient data meta-analysis included four randomized trials with 676 total participants comparing ARB therapy with control [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].

The mean age for patients in this analysis was 28.6 years.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Comparison with beta blocker therapy</strong> – The above-cited individual patient data meta-analysis included three trials with 766 total participants comparing ARB with beta blocker therapy [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].

The mean age for patients in this analysis was 13.9 years.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">The largest included trial was a randomized trial comparing <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9574" href="/d/drug information/9574.html" rel="external">losartan</a> with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8940" href="/d/drug information/8940.html" rel="external">atenolol</a> in 608 children and young adults (mean age 11.5 years) with MFS and aortic Z-scores &gt;3.0 found no significant difference in the rate of aortic root dilation between the two treatment groups over a three-year period [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. A comparable and significant decline in aortic root diameter relative to body surface area was seen with both treatments. The three-year rates of aortic root surgery, aortic dissection, death, and a composite of these events were similar in the losartan and atenolol treatment groups, and the total numbers of events in both groups were small (19 versus 10 events). Importantly, this study compared an atypically high dose of atenolol (mean 2.7 mg/kg/day and up to 4 mg/kg/day) with a conventional dose of losartan (mean 1.3 mg/kg/day and up to 1.4 mg/kg/day).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Added to beta blocker therapy</strong> – Studies evaluating the effect of adding an ARB (to standard beta blocker therapy) have shown mixed results.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Two randomized open-label trials in patients with MFS (one in 28 patients, predominantly children; the other in 233 adults) have reported reductions in aortic root dilation rate with the ARB <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9574" href="/d/drug information/9574.html" rel="external">losartan</a> added to beta blocker therapy at three-year follow-up [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>In contrast, a double-blind randomized trial in 303 patients (mean age 29.9 years) found no significant difference between <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9574" href="/d/drug information/9574.html" rel="external">losartan</a> and placebo on aortic root dilation rate at median 3.5-year follow-up [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Most patients in both treatment groups were also taking a beta blocker. One limitation of the study is inclusion of patients who would not meet current diagnostic criteria for Marfan syndrome (eg, revised Ghent nosology) since 22 percent of patients had no FBN1 mutation identified and many patients had no baseline aortic root dilation. In this light, it is notable that an individual patient data meta-analysis documented that the greatest effect of ARB treatment was observed in patients diagnosed with Marfan syndrome that had a definable FBN1 pathogenic variant [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Effect on clinical endpoints</strong> – In long-term (up to eight years) follow-up of patients with MFS treated with ARBs (with or without concomitant beta blockers), a study from the Netherlands documented a reduced rate of important clinical endpoints including surgery beyond the aortic root, mortality from aortic dissection, and all-cause mortality compared with affected individuals not receiving an ARB.

Social pressure may necessitate inclusion of an affected child in a school-structured physical education program. Parents and school officials should agree upon permitted and excluded activities for the affected child. Physical education instructors must agree to abide by the activity restrictions and be able to monitor the child's participation to avoid excessive exertion. It is not considered acceptable for children with MFS to routinely simply observe exercise by their peers, as this practice is not benefiting the child and will promote stigmatization.

Indications for repair at an external diameter less than 50 mm (ie, aortic root diameter ≥45 mm) include rapid growth (≥3 mm/year), family history of aortic dissection, diffuse aortic root and ascending aortic dilation, or marked vertebral arterial tortuosity [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>One limitation of recommendations based upon absolute aortic root diameters is that predicted aortic root diameter varies with body size [<a href="#rid31">31</a>] and age and may be smaller in women [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].

(See <a class="local">'Drug therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with MFS, elective aortic repair is associated with reduced mortality when compared with urgent or emergency repair. Elective surgical intervention should be considered when an adult has an aortic root diameter of ≥50 mm and a child has a disproportionately rapid increase in aortic diameter when compared with the rate of increase in body surface area even if the diameter is ≤50 mm.
