For most conditions, transthoracic (surface) echocardiography (TTE) is sufficient. Congenital, degenerative, and inflammatory lesions are readily recognized and their severity graded. In addition, it is standard practice for TTE to be the sole method of serial evaluation of aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation.</p><p>This topic will review echocardiography of the aortic valve. The diagnosis and management of aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation are discussed separately in individual topic reviews including the following: (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8164.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aortic stenosis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8154.html" rel="external">"Indications for valve replacement for high gradient aortic stenosis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8117.html" rel="external">"Medical management of asymptomatic aortic stenosis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8130.html" rel="external">"Medical management of symptomatic aortic stenosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8159.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic aortic regurgitation in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8160.html" rel="external">"Natural history and management of chronic aortic regurgitation in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY OF THE NORMAL AORTIC VALVE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Two-dimensional echocardiography</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Two-dimensional (2D) imaging of the normal aortic valve in the parasternal long-axis view demonstrates two leaflets (right and noncoronary)  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77446" href="/d/graphic/77446.html" rel="external">image 1</a>), while the parasternal short axis demonstrates a symmetrical structure with three uniformly thin leaflets that open equally, forming a circular orifice during most of systole  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67673" href="/d/graphic/67673.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). During diastole, the normal leaflets form a three pointed star with a slight thickening or prominence at the central closing point formed by the aortic leaflet nodules, known as the nodules of Arantius. The three aortic valve cusps may also be visualized in a subcostal view.</p><p>The aortic valve is composed of three cusps: the left, right, and noncoronary cusps. The left cusp guards the left sinus of Valsalva, with the left main coronary artery arising superior to and midway between the commissures of this cusp. The right cusp guards the right sinus of Valsalva, with the right coronary artery arising anteriorly and superiorly. It is the most anterior cusp and is positioned immediately just posterior to the right ventricular outflow tract. Its most rightward commissure is adjacent to the attachment of the anterior or septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. The noncoronary cusp is located posteromedially, guards the noncoronary sinus of Valsalva, and is adjacent to the interatrial septum.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">M-mode echocardiogram</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>M-mode echocardiography of the aortic valve is performed in conjunction with 2D imaging by targeting the M-mode beam through the aortic leaflets as displayed in the 2D cross sectional view. The M-mode image of a normal aortic valve and root includes a number of distinctive features:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the parasternal long-axis orientation, the aortic leaflets open and close at the midpoint of the space bounded by the anterior and posterior walls of the aortic root  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79751" href="/d/graphic/79751.html" rel="external">image 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>After the opening motion, the leaflets are parallel to the aortic root and nearly appose its wall, where they remain until the end of systole. The net effect of these features is a "box-like" appearance of the M-mode wave form.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Failure of the leaflets to open widely may be seen with aortic stenosis; a decreased stroke volume is suggested if they open widely but drift shut just after achieving maximum separation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>If the leaflets close immediately and abruptly after achieving full opening, fixed subvalvular stenosis should be considered. If the leaflets close and reopen in the first third to one half of systole, dynamic subvalvular obstruction should be suspected.

The most common cause is valvular aortic stenosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8164.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aortic stenosis in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Valvular aortic stenosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The normal aortic valve area in adults is 3 to 4 cm<sup>2</sup>. As aortic stenosis develops with progressive thickening and calcification of the leaflets, a minimal valve gradient is present until the orifice area becomes less than half of normal. In general, symptoms in patients with aortic stenosis occur when the valve area is &lt;1 cm<sup>2</sup> or the mean transvalvular gradient exceeds 40 mmHg. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8164.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aortic stenosis in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Severe narrowing or obstruction of the aortic valve accompanied by dyspnea, angina, or syncope has a poor prognosis. Surgical (or percutaneous) relief by prosthetic valve implantation dramatically improves survival in such patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8154.html" rel="external">"Indications for valve replacement for high gradient aortic stenosis in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Echocardiography in combination with continuous and pulse wave Doppler enables accurate evaluation of aortic stenosis severity  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95630" href="/d/graphic/95630.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">M-mode echocardiography</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>M-mode echocardiography remains useful in capturing the motion of the aortic valve; variations in motion patterns are often useful in differentiating severe from mild aortic stenosis [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In the setting of a trileaflet aortic valve, aortic valve M-mode excursion of at least 12 mm is generally not consistent with severe aortic stenosis.</p><p>Typically, most aortic stenosis presents on M-mode as dense, persistent echoes replacing the normal motion patterns described above; the echoes may no longer lie parallel to the aorta  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77555" href="/d/graphic/77555.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) (see <a class="local">'Echocardiography of the normal aortic valve'</a> above). Aortic valve sclerosis without stenosis can mimic this pattern; dense echoes from sclerotic areas can obscure normal leaflet motion. Aortic valve sclerosis and stenosis can be differentiated by the 2D Doppler imaging.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Two-dimensional echocardiography</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>2D echocardiographic findings in aortic stenosis include identification of the number of leaflets, the extent, and pattern of calcification, and the degree and pattern of leaflet motion  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef59344 graphicRef59538 graphicRef80369 graphicRef61369 graphicRef71087" href="/d/graphic/59344.html" rel="external">movie 1A-E</a>). The aortic root (including the aortic ring) is also visualized.</p><p>Although the aortic valve area is usually calculated using the continuing equation as discussed below (see <a class="local">'Doppler echocardiography'</a> below), 2D planimetry of the aortic valve area is helpful when the transaortic valve gradient cannot be accurately ascertained (eg, in the setting of significant LV outflow tract [LVOT] obstruction) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may be helpful when TTE images are inadequate for planimetry.</p><p>There are other findings on the echocardiogram that may help in the assessment of severity:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patterns of leaflet motion are helpful, and when leaflets demonstrate a systolic "doming" pattern, the possibility of significant obstruction (or bicuspid valve) is much greater. This is usually only present when the leaflets remain flexible and the pathology is related predominantly to commissural fusion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>2D imaging can display the aorta distal to the valve. Dilatation may be present due to associated aortic disease in acquired aortic valve disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51528" href="/d/graphic/51528.html" rel="external">image 3</a>). Bicuspid aortic valves are associated with aortopathy and the extent of aortic dilation is not proportional to the severity of stenosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8157.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of bicuspid aortic valve in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Varying degrees of concentric LV hypertrophy are seen in aortic stenosis. In the well-compensated patient with severe aortic stenosis, a resting echocardiogram will generally disclose significant LV hypertrophy with normal or even hyperdynamic contractile function. Use of strain analysis is discussed separately.

In fact, carefully obtained Doppler data are so reliable that diagnostic catheterization for the determination of the severity of aortic stenosis has been relegated to a secondary confirmatory role and for assessment of coexistent coronary artery disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef79119" href="/d/graphic/79119.html" rel="external">movie 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef68228" href="/d/graphic/68228.html" rel="external">movie 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52584" href="/d/graphic/52584.html" rel="external">image 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73624" href="/d/graphic/73624.html" rel="external">image 5</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef112888" href="/d/graphic/112888.html" rel="external">waveform 1</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8127.html" rel="external">"Hemodynamics of valvular disorders as measured by cardiac catheterization"</a>.)</p><p>The critical components of the Doppler examination of aortic stenosis are based on the continuous wave Doppler and include the AS jet velocity, the mean AV gradient, and the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8625" href="/d/drug information/8625.html" rel="external">AVA</a> derived from the continuity equation [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>In the evaluation of aortic stenosis with Doppler echocardiography, it is essential to employ continuous wave Doppler from a number of sites to sample flow signals arising from the jet across the stenotic aortic orifice so that the highest velocity can be recorded. Only continuous wave Doppler is acceptable because the velocities encountered in all grades of aortic stenosis are too high for pulsed wave Doppler to sample.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3001024"><span class="h4">Peak velocity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>To obtain the highest velocity, the angle of interrogation should be as parallel with flow as possible. Since the peak velocity is a function of the cosine of this angle, interrogation angles greater than 30 degrees result in major underestimation of the severity of obstruction. Since it is impossible to predict the orientation that will provide the highest peak velocity, the transaortic valve velocity is interrogated from several acoustic windows, including the apex, suprasternal notch, and right parasternal intercostal space. A peak velocity &gt;4 m/s is strongly suggestive of severe stenosis and clinical outcomes related to stenosis, whereas a peak velocity &lt;3 m/s usually indicates mild stenosis.</p><p>Using the highest recorded peak velocity, the simplified Bernoulli equation can be applied to obtain the peak instantaneous gradient:</p><div class="formulaContainer"><div class="formula"><p>    Peak pressure gradient (mmHg)  =  4  x  peak velocity<sup>2</sup></p></div></div><p>It is important to note that the peak instantaneous systolic gradient, as measured by Doppler, may be higher than the "peak to peak gradient" obtained during invasive cardiac catheterization. The peak to peak gradient is derived by comparing peak ventricular and aortic pressures. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8127.html" rel="external">"Hemodynamics of valvular disorders as measured by cardiac catheterization"</a>.)</p><p>At times, relatively large peak systolic gradients can be confused with significant aortic obstruction but such confusion can be avoided in three ways.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Inspection of the rate of rise of the Doppler wave form. If the wave rises rapidly with a short acceleration time, the stenosis is more likely to be mild, but if it rises more slowly with a long acceleration time, a high gradient is likely to connote severe obstruction  (<a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef112888" href="/d/graphic/112888.html" rel="external">waveform 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Using the mean gradient across the valve. Clinical echocardiography analysis packages display peak velocity, peak gradient, mean velocity, mean gradient, and the velocity time integral (VTI) after the spectral Doppler display of the continuous wave velocity signal is traced. There is a stronger correlation between mean gradients obtained by echocardiography and near-simultaneous invasive measurements than between the peak instantaneous gradient and the peak to peak gradient.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The most effective method of quantitating the severity of aortic stenosis is to calculate the valve area  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77899" href="/d/graphic/77899.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>) using the continuity equation (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8115.html" rel="external">"Aortic valve area in aortic stenosis in adults"</a>). This calculation is performed by using the continuity principle, which states that in a closed system the flow in one portion of the system is equal to the flow in another [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p>According to the continuity equation, flow in the LVOT is exactly equal to the flow across the stenotic aortic valve. Simply stated, flow volume (Q) measurements at serial sites in a closed system (such as the heart) should be identical. Planimetry of the pulsed wave Doppler flow signal from the LVOT derives theVTI, which is the distance the average red blood cell travels during systole in the outflow tract:</p><div class="formulaContainer"><div class="formula"><p>    Q  =  Area<sub>LVOT</sub>  x  VTI<sub>LVOT</sub>  =  <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8625" href="/d/drug information/8625.html" rel="external">AVA</a>  x  VTI<sub>AV</sub><br/></p></div></div><p>where Area<sub>LVOT</sub> = cross-sectional area of the LVOT, VTI<sub>LVOT</sub> = velocity time integral in the outflow tract, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8625" href="/d/drug information/8625.html" rel="external">AVA</a> = aortic valve area, and VTI<sub>AV</sub> = velocity time integral across the aortic valve. The effective orifice area of the stenotic valve can therefore be calculated after simple equation rearrangement:</p><div class="formulaContainer"><div class="formula"><p>    <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8625" href="/d/drug information/8625.html" rel="external">AVA</a>  =  (Area<sub>LVOT</sub>  x  VTI<sub>LVOT</sub>)  /  VTI<sub>AV</sub></p></div></div><p>The cross-sectional area of the LVOT is derived from the diameter (d) of the LVOT measured at mid-systole on the parasternal long-axis view just proximal to the aortic valve hinge-points (area = ∏d<sup>2</sup>/4). The peak velocities in the LVOT and across the AV can be substituted for the respective VTIs in a simplified continuity equation [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The threshold for severe aortic stenosis is an aortic valve area of 1.0 cm<sup>2</sup>. In contrast to invasive methods utilizing the Gorlin formula, the continuity equation is relatively insensitive to aortic regurgitation.</p><p>Other methods of estimating the severity of the aortic stenosis include measurement of aortic valve resistance. Aortic valve resistance (AVR) can be calculated using Doppler echocardiography based upon the following equation [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]:</p><div class="formulaContainer"><div class="formula"><p>    AVR  =  [4 (PkV<sub>AV</sub>)<sup>2</sup>  /  (r<sub>LVOT</sub><sup>2</sup> x PkV<sub>LVOT</sub>)]  x  1333<br/></p></div></div><p>where PkV<sub>AV</sub> = peak velocity across the aortic valve, PkV<sub>LVOT</sub> = peak velocity through the LVOT, and r<sub>LVOT</sub> is the systolic radius of the LVOT. The cut-off for severe AS is 280 dynes/s/cm<sup>5</sup>. While aortic valve resistance was initially believed to be less dependent on flow, this claim turns out not to be true. Moreover, resistance is less predictive of prognosis than other measures such as the peak velocity through the valve.</p><p>Aortic stenosis complicated by LV dysfunction with low stroke volume is one cause of low gradient aortic stenosis. Determination of the role of aortic stenosis in this setting is difficult since low stroke volume, on its own, may falsely decrease the calculated valve area by the continuity equation. Identification and evaluation of low gradient aortic stenosis is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8114.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of low gradient severe aortic stenosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Aortic valve sclerosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Aortic valve thickening (sclerosis) without stenosis is common in older adults. It is often detected either as a systolic murmur on physical examination or on echocardiography. Aortic valve sclerosis may be important clinically as a marker for increased cardiovascular risk. Aortic and mitral annular calcification frequently accompany aortic sclerosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8123.html" rel="external">"Aortic valve sclerosis and pathogenesis of calcific aortic stenosis"</a>.)</p><p>A variety of definitions have been used to identify aortic valve sclerosis. A proposed revised definition includes the following criteria [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]: irregular nonuniform thickening of portion of the aortic valve leaflets or commissure, or both; thickened portions of the aortic valve with an appearance (highly echogenic) suggesting calcification, nonrestricted or minimally restricted aortic cusp opening; and transvalvular peak continuous wave Doppler velocity &lt;2 m/s.

Using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging phase velocity methods, forward flow is seen to stop in the descending aorta during diastole. On pulsed wave Doppler of the descending aorta in normal individuals, there is brief early diastolic reversal of flow. In aortic regurgitation, retrograde flow can be detected and its quantity and duration is proportional to the degree of severity of the lesion  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55026" href="/d/graphic/55026.html" rel="external">image 8</a>).

The flow signal velocity is determined throughout diastole by the gradient between the aortic root and the LV. Ordinarily, the diastolic pressure in the LV is much lower than the aortic root pressure (12 versus 80 mmHg). Thus, the velocity of the aortic regurgitation jet at early diastole is generally at least 4 m/s and subsequently slowly declines. In mild regurgitation, the deceleration time for that decline usually exceeds 500 ms. In severe aortic regurgitation, the pressure gradient between aortic root and LV becomes very small because the diastolic systemic pressure falls and the LV pressure rises. As the gradient is abolished, the retrograde flow ceases and the velocity of the diastolic signal falls towards zero. The more rapidly the signal decays, the more severe the regurgitation [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. A deceleration time of less than 200 ms or a decay slope greater than 3 m/s<sup>2</sup> is indicative of severe aortic regurgitation.</p><p>However, the pressure half-time has limited sensitivity for detection of severe aortic regurgitation, particularly in the chronic setting.

It can also be influenced by changes in systemic vascular resistance and LV compliance. Increasing the systemic vascular resistance increases the rate of decay without any change in valve orifice; reduced LV compliance produces a more rapid rise in LV pressure, which influences the diastolic slope without reflecting the severity of aortic regurgitation.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5776.html" rel="external">"Subvalvar aortic stenosis (subaortic stenosis)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H33"><span class="h2">Myxomatous disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Aortic regurgitation in association with mitral valve prolapse can be due either to myxomatous changes in the leaflets themselves or to aortic root disease. Although very uncommon, aortic valve prolapse due to myxomatous degeneration can be seen in association with mitral prolapse.</p><p>The most common manifestation of aortic root disease is general dilatation of the sinuses. Dilatation limited to one sinus is called a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm, which is a form of aortic root aneurysm. (See <a class="local">'Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3340925"><span class="h2">Aortic valve sclerosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As discussed above, aortic valve sclerosis is a degenerative process that may progress to aortic stenosis. When aortic regurgitation is present, it is usually mild. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8123.html" rel="external">"Aortic valve sclerosis and pathogenesis of calcific aortic stenosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H38"><span class="h2">Rheumatoid arthritis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Rarely, aortic regurgitation can arise from a rheumatoid nodule on the valve.

They can be inferred by color flow Doppler detection of an unusual site of regurgitation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H40"><span class="h2">Ventricular septal defect</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Small ventricular septal defects in the perimembranous region frequently close during childhood. They can be associated with aortic regurgitation that can persist after closure. Infundibular (also known as supracristal) ventricular septal defects are also associated with aortic regurgitation and are more likely to be associated with hemodynamically significant aortic regurgitation due to undermining of the right coronary cusp, resulting in prolapse.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1626969207"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
