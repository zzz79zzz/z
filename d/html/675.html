         Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is an advanced endoscopic procedure that is most often used for biliary interventions (eg, removal of bile duct stones, relief of biliary obstruction, closure of bile leaks). During the procedure, a specialized, side-viewing upper endoscope is used to visualize the ampulla of Vater, followed by accessing the common bile duct with selective biliary cannulation. The bile duct is opacified by injecting a contrast medium, thereby permitting radiographic visualization and therapeutic interventions.
        </p>
        <p>
         During some ERCPs, difficult biliary access occurs when attempts to cannulate the bile duct are unsuccessful, and this may contribute to an increased risk of ERCP-related adverse events (eg, pancreatitis) and require repeat intervention. Specialized techniques may be used to overcome difficult biliary access, but they are typically more complex than standard, guidewire-assisted cannulation and require additional training.

         </span>
         Difficult biliary access (or difficult biliary cannulation) during ERCP has been defined as the inability to cannulate the common bile duct using standard, guidewire-assisted technique within 5 to 10 minutes or up to five attempts [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. However, the definition of difficult access has varied among studies, and whether it is widely applied in clinical practice is uncertain.

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The reported incidence of difficult biliary access during ERCP ranges from 4 to 20 percent among patients with normal anatomy (ie, native ampulla and no duodenal diverticulum) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,4-6
         </a>
         ]. A biliary cannulation rate of 90 percent is generally regarded as the threshold for standard of practice [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,7
         </a>
         ]. In a systematic review of four studies including 567 patients who had ERCP with guidewire-assisted cannulation technique, the pooled rate of unsuccessful biliary cannulation was 11 percent [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. However,
         <strong>
         </strong>
         rates of difficult and failed cannulation vary substantially among centers and endoscopists. While success rates for biliary access among community practices are expected to exceed 90 percent, the rates of biliary access during the index ERCP typically exceed 95 percent at advanced centers by using multiple techniques [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,8-12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Studies on risk factors for difficult biliary access are limited. In a study including 545 patients who had ERCP with biliary sphincterotomy, advanced cannulation techniques were used in 173 patients (31 percent), and risk factors for use of needle-knife or other methods included ampullary malignancy, papillary anatomic abnormality, and duodenal stenosis [

         For most patients undergoing ERCP, standard guidewire-assisted cannulation is successful for establishing biliary access. (See

          'Incidence and risk factors'

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, when biliary access is challenging, endoscopists should weigh their own likelihood of success using advanced methods and the urgency of the procedure against the risk of adverse events. If additional endoscopic expertise is available, one may call a more experienced colleague to assist with the ERCP or to perform an alternative approach such as endoscopic ultrasound-guided access. Other options include stopping the procedure and referring the patient to a second endoscopist or to a specialized center for repeat ERCP or for an alternative approach such as endoscopic ultrasound or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography.

         For patients with difficult biliary access, the goals of using advanced cannulation methods are to establish biliary access for therapy (eg, stone removal, stent placement, closure of bile leak) while minimizing the risk of adverse events. Achieving the optimal balance between technical success and adverse events requires attention to the individual patient's underlying condition and risk profile, as well as the endoscopist's expertise. As techniques and supporting data evolve, endoscopists are advised to refine and update their approaches. Educational materials including video instruction are available online at the

         The use of advanced cannulation methods is essentially limited to therapeutic procedures because other options for diagnostic assessment (eg, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography [MRCP] and endoscopic ultrasound) provide high diagnostic accuracy without the risks associated with ERCP.

         Based on published data and clinical experience,
         <strong>
         </strong>
         we use a risk-stratified approach for establishing biliary access that involves tailoring techniques to the individual patient and switching expeditiously to an advanced cannulation technique when standard technique is not successful  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef143287" href="/z/d/graphic/143287.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1

         There are multiple techniques available for achieving biliary access [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3,12,14,17
         </a>
         ]. The balance between success and adverse events varies between patients as well as endoscopists. Put simply, what is safe in one patient may not be tolerated in another due to patient-related and anatomic characteristics  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef142087" href="/z/d/graphic/142087.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         The choice of a rescue method is also informed by the endoscope position and stability, whether there has been guidewire insertion into the pancreatic duct, and efficacy/safety of advanced cannulation methods.

         The pancreatic guidewire technique (also referred to as double guidewire technique) involves leaving the guidewire in the pancreatic duct and using it to facilitate cannulating the common bile duct with a second guidewire  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef143289" href="/z/d/graphic/143289.html" rel="external">
          picture 1
         </a>
         ). We typically place a pancreatic stent after achieving biliary access because use of double guidewire technique without subsequent pancreatic stent placement increases the risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,24
         </a>
         ]. In a trial including 70 patients who underwent ERCP with pancreatic guidewire technique for achieving biliary cannulation, pancreatic stenting reduced the rates of post-ERCP pancreatitis compared with no stenting (3 versus 23 percent) [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, society guidelines support placing a pancreatic stent after dual wire cannulation [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,20,22,23
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Our approach to pancreatic guidewire technique is summarized as follows:

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Leave the guidewire in the pancreatic duct and place a sphincterotome or ultra-tapered 5-4-3 catheter above it. The pancreatic guidewire helps to straighten the S-shaped portion of the distal common bile duct and stabilize the papilla.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Advance a second guidewire through a sphincterotome, or ultra-tapered 5-4-3 catheter, to selectively cannulate the bile duct, with attention to false passages.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">

         Place a pancreatic stent prior to withdrawing the pancreatic guidewire, unless the patient has a completely obstructed pancreatic duct, or otherwise is at very low risk for post-ERCP pancreatitis.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">

        </p>
        <p>
         A modification of the pancreatic guidewire technique is to place a pancreatic stent into the pancreatic duct, followed by biliary cannulation over the stent [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. We use this technique sparingly in patients with a stenotic papilla, as it can "crowd out" the sphincter and make biliary access more difficult.

         Transpancreatic precut sphincterotomy (also referred to as transpancreatic septotomy or transpancreatic precut papillotomy) is typically an option for patients with difficult biliary access when a guidewire is inadvertently and repeatedly passed into the pancreatic duct, and this technique does not require the use of a needle-knife  (

        </p>
        <p>
         We agree with society guidelines that transpancreatic precut sphincterotomy may be preferred in selected patients (ie, those with an intradiverticular or small papilla) because it may be associated with lower risk of adverse events than other precut techniques when the papilla is distorted by tumor or other factors [

          Needle-knife fistulotomy

         – For needle-knife fistulotomy (also referred to as fistulotomy), the needle-knife papillotome punctures the papilla above the orifice and then cuts either downward toward the papillary orifice or upward in a cephalad direction until the biliary sphincter is visualized  (

         <strong>
         </strong>
         Needle-knife papillotomy (NKP; also referred to as needle-knife precut papillotomy [NKPP]), involves making an incision with the needle-knife starting at the upper margin of the papillary orifice and extending cephalad (ie, in the direction of the bile duct)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76180" href="/z/d/graphic/76180.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). NKP is typically followed by biliary sphincterotomy, which facilitates interventions such as stone extraction. Thus, the terms "access papillotomy," "access sphincterotomy," or "precut sphincterotomy" have also been used to describe this method. We typically use this technique for patients with a nonbulging papilla in whom the pancreatic duct has not been accessed. Needle-knife papillotomy should be used with extreme caution when initiating the papillary orifice incision. In addition, use of this technique is generally limited to patients with well-defined anatomic landmarks and by experienced advanced endoscopists.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         We visualize the papillary orifice and insert 2 to 5 mm of cutting wire. We raise the elevator to "load" the cutting wire upwards and aim to the center of the papillary mound, which is typically located in the 11 to 12 o'clock direction but can vary depending on the endoscope position. We also ensure that the tip of the needle is just under the roof of the papilla and not impacted against the duodenal wall or the orifice of the pancreatic duct. The cut is continued in small increments, exposing deeper or high layers, somewhat akin to the layers of an onion, until either the biliary sphincter muscle is exposed, which often appears as a "nipple," or there is some bile seepage. We then gently probe the suspected bile duct with a wire-assisted papillotome or ultra-tapered catheter to gain access. Once access is established, the sphincterotomy is usually completed with a conventional, pull-type papillotome. If access is not obtained after gentle probing, the needle-knife can be used to unroof more of the papilla, once again beginning at the orifice and advancing through the previously cut area to expose deeper layers.

          Needle-knife over a pancreatic stent

         – If the pancreatic duct has been deeply accessed with a wire during cannulation attempts, a variation of the needle-knife technique is to place a protective pancreatic stent prior to performing the incision  (

         Pancreatic stents are available in multiple configurations and materials. Thus, selecting a stent size and configuration is generally informed by patient and duct characteristics (eg, ductal anatomy).
        </p>
        <p>
         For most patients with difficult biliary access, we use a small caliber (ie, 4 or 5 French) plastic stent. When the wire is easily advanced into the pancreatic duct and beyond the genu of the pancreas, we usually place a smaller caliber (4 French), longer (eg, 9 to 11 cm) soft plastic, unflanged stent with a single external pigtail.
        </p>
        <p>
         If the wire cannot be passed easily beyond a tight turn or the genu of the pancreas, an alternative is to pass a small caliber (0.018 to 0.025 inch) wire and then place a short (2 to 3 cm) stent [

          42

However, we do not place stents with lengths between 4 to 7 cm or stents made of rigid polyethylene material in such patients because these stents typically impact into the genu and may cause strictures.

          15,35,39,49,50
         </a>
         ]. In a meta-analysis of six trials including 853 patients, early use of needle-knife techniques resulted in lower risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis compared with repeated attempts at standard cannulation (5 versus 11 percent, risk ratio [RR] 0.55, 95% CI 0.31-0.97) [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Studies suggested that guidewire-assisted cannulation was more effective and safer than catheter-guided cannulation followed by contrast injection [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3,17
         </a>
         ]. However, a common misconception is that avoiding pancreatic contrast injection per se prevents post-ERCP pancreatitis, especially in patients with multiple risk factors  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef142087" href="/z/d/graphic/142087.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Although pancreatic contrast injection poses a risk, there are multiple other patient- and procedure-related risk factors that are additive or even synergistic [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18-23
         </a>
         ]. Passing a guidewire into the pancreatic duct is a significant risk factor, independent of contrast injection. Studies have found that deep pancreatic wire passage resulted in equal or greater risk compared with contrast injection, unless guidewire passage is followed by pancreatic stent placement [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19-23
         </a>
         ]. In a multivariate analysis of 800 patients with intact papilla undergoing ERCP with guidewire cannulation, pancreatic wire passage was associated with increased risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis, whereas pancreatic contrast injection was not a risk factor [
         <a href="#rid21">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         When attempting cannulation with the wire-guided technique, an additional risk of "blind" wire passage is inadvertent perforation of the pancreatic duct or its side branches, which can result in severe and potentially necrotizing pancreatitis. Such a risk is likely greatest in patients with a normal, healthy pancreas and those with a tortuous pancreatic duct. When performed appropriately, pancreatic stenting minimizes the risk of deep pancreatic guidewire passage. (See

          Other adverse events
         </strong>
         – Studies have suggested that advanced access techniques were not associated with higher risk of other adverse events such as perforation, cholangitis, and bleeding [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,50
         </a>
         ]. In a meta-analysis of seven trials including 1032 patients who underwent ERCP, the risk of perforation, cholangitis, or bleeding was not significantly different between patients who had ERCP with needle-knife access method compared with repeated standard cannulation attempts [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Although these data are promising, rates of adverse events may be higher when advanced techniques are performed by less experienced endoscopists [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34,42,51
         </a>
         ]. In addition, studies comparing advanced techniques with standard cannulation are limited by variable definitions of adverse events (eg, criteria for post-ERCP pancreatitis), patient characteristics (eg, anatomy, underlying disease), and individual variations of the techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, it has been recognized that use of advanced techniques such as needle-knife precut papillotomy by less experienced endoscopists or in patients with altered anatomy or uncertain indications may be complicated by perforation, severe pancreatitis, and/or bleeding [

          Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography
         </strong>
         – Percutaneous transhepatic puncture of the bile duct is an option for achieving biliary access in patients with biliary tract dilatation related to biliary obstruction. During percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC), the interventional radiologist inserts a small-gauge needle into the peripheral bile ducts, followed by injection of contrast material to opacify the biliary tree. When biliary drainage is indicated, an external catheter or an internal stent may be placed. An alternative to imaging-guided stent placement is percutaneous introduction of a guidewire into the duodenum, followed by a rendezvous endoscopic procedure. ERCP requiring percutaneous biliary access is associated with increased risk of adverse events but may be the only option for some patients [

         – For patients in whom biliary access is unsuccessful with ERCP alone, and especially for those with obstructing duodenal or ampullary lesions, EUS-guided rendezvous or direct biliary drainage is an alternative method for gaining access to the bile ducts.

          Background

         – Difficult biliary access during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is typically defined as the inability to cannulate the common bile duct using standard, guidewire-assisted technique within 5 to 10 minutes or up to five attempts. (See

         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         The goals of using an advanced cannulation method are to establish biliary access and provide biliary therapy (eg, stone removal, biliary drainage) while minimizing the risk of adverse events. In general, we use a rapid succession of techniques rather than persistent cannulation attempts with standard techniques. The use of advanced cannulation techniques should be limited to therapeutic procedures because noninvasive diagnostic testing (eg, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography) provides high diagnostic accuracy without the risks associated with ERCP.

          Selecting a method
         </strong>
         – When standard cannulation attempts are not successful, the choice of a rescue method is generally informed by multiple factors including patient characteristics (eg, indications for the procedure, anatomy, and risk profile), endoscope position, wire passage into the pancreatic duct, efficacy/safety of advanced cannulation methods, and endoscopist expertise with individual approaches  (

          Pancreatic stenting

         – For patients with difficult biliary access, the decision to place a pancreatic stent is individualized and informed by patient risk factors for post-ERCP pancreatitis  (
