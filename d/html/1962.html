Of these deaths related to CVD, the majority are due to arrhythmia/sudden cardiac death, whereas a minority are attributable to coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and heart failure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1847.html" rel="external">"Patient survival and maintenance dialysis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7190.html" rel="external">"Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease"</a>.)</p><p>Compared with the general population, patients undergoing maintenance dialysis have a significantly increased incidence of CVD. This is due to both an increased prevalence of traditional risk factors for CVD and risk factors due to the severe loss of kidney function. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1960.html" rel="external">"Risk factors and epidemiology of coronary heart disease in end-stage kidney disease (dialysis)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7190.html" rel="external">"Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease"</a>.)</p><p>A discussion of risk-factor modification for CVD by therapeutic lifestyle changes and drug therapies among patients undergoing maintenance dialysis will be presented in this topic review. Although many of the issues relating to CVD are presumed similar in patients with and without kidney failure, many traditional CVD risk factors and their management have not been adequately studied in the ESKD population. This topic review will emphasize those features that distinguish the patient on dialysis from those without kidney dysfunction. Discussions of this issue in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are not yet on dialysis as well as those without kidney disease are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7190.html" rel="external">"Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1505.html" rel="external">"Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease (secondary prevention) or at very high risk"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CORONARY HEART DISEASE RISK EQUIVALENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some patients without known coronary heart disease (CHD), such as those with diabetes, have a risk of subsequent cardiovascular events that is comparable with that seen in patients with established coronary disease. Such patients are regarded as having a CHD risk equivalent.</p><p>Practice guidelines from several national organizations recommend that chronic kidney disease (CKD), including end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), be considered a CHD risk equivalent. This is based upon evidence that advanced CKD is associated with an increase in CHD risk [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. However, whether CKD per se, in the absence of other traditional risk factors, accelerates atherogenesis is uncertain. Not all experts agree with the generalization that CKD is a CHD risk equivalent for all persons with CKD. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7190.html" rel="external">"Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF SECONDARY PREVENTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although the efficacy of preventive measures for coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients on dialysis is often uncertain, we recommend risk-factor modification for patients on dialysis. In patients with established CHD, these measures are referred to as "secondary prevention" or prevention of complications due to established disease.</p><p>Evidence of benefit with cardiovascular risk factor modification has largely been shown in patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD). By comparison, few interventions in patients on dialysis have been examined in large, randomized trials, and even fewer have shown to be effective. Risk factor modification for secondary prevention in patients on dialysis will be reviewed here, with the evidence examining each of the possible modalities.</p><p>Detailed discussions of each risk factor in those without kidney disease and the efficacy of primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1505.html" rel="external">"Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease (secondary prevention) or at very high risk"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7573.html" rel="external">"Overview of primary prevention of cardiovascular disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">LIPID MODIFICATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD), there is a graded relationship between the serum total cholesterol concentration and coronary risk, and the absolute risk is greater in patients with previous manifestations of coronary heart disease (CHD). During the past few decades, many large, randomized trials in patients with normal and/or modestly reduced kidney function have demonstrated the benefit of cholesterol lowering, largely with statin therapy and more recently with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="103780" href="/z/d/drug information/103780.html" rel="external">evolocumab</a>, for secondary prevention. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/112841.html" rel="external">"Management of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease"</a>.)</p><p>Available evidence, however, calls into the question whether the strategy of using statin therapy for secondary cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention is applicable to patients on maintenance dialysis. Specifically, two large, well-designed trials, Die Deutsche Diabetes Dialyse (4-D) and A Study to Evaluate the Use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10282" href="/z/d/drug information/10282.html" rel="external">Rosuvastatin</a> in Subjects on Regular Hemodialysis: An Assessment of Survival and Cardiovascular Events (AURORA), evaluated the effect of statin therapy in patients on dialysis on the combined endpoint of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke. Despite a substantial decrease in serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, both trials found that the initiation of statin therapy provided <strong>no</strong> cardiovascular benefit in primary analyses. In apparent contrast, the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP) trial showed a benefit of pharmacologic therapy using the combination of statin and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/z/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a> in the entire study cohort, which included patients with nondialysis CKD and patients on dialysis. The beneficial effect on atherosclerotic events was not statistically significant in the dialysis subgroup. However, the SHARP trial was not powered to detect an effect on subgroups, and there was no evidence that the effect differed according to the presence of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) at baseline [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Thus, the SHARP trial may be interpreted as showing efficacy of LDL cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular benefit in patients on dialysis.</p><p>The effect of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="103780" href="/z/d/drug information/103780.html" rel="external">evolocumab</a>) inhibitors on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with ESKD is unknown. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/106888.html" rel="external">"PCSK9 inhibitors: Pharmacology, adverse effects, and use"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Trials of statin therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The issue of whether statins are effective in lowering the risk of a cardiovascular event in patients on dialysis was addressed in the 4-D, AURORA, and SHARP trials.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">4-D trial</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the 4-D study, 1255 patients on hemodialysis (80 percent were not being treated with a statin) with type 2 diabetes and elevated serum LDL cholesterol levels were randomly assigned to placebo or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8949" href="/z/d/drug information/8949.html" rel="external">atorvastatin</a> (20 mg/day) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The primary outcome measure was the composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and stroke. After four weeks, atorvastatin successfully lowered LDL cholesterol (121 to 72 mg/dL [3.1 to 1.9 mmol/L]) versus no change with placebo (125 to 120 mg/dL [3.2 to 3.1 mmol/L]).</p><p>At a median follow-up of four years, however, there was no difference in the incidence of the primary outcome between both groups (relative risk [RR] 0.92, 95% CI 0.77-1.10). There was, however, a significant reduction in the rate of cardiac events (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68-0.99). On the other hand, there was also a significant and apparently paradoxical increase in the rate of fatal stroke (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.05-3.93), but the absolute number of stroke events was small in both the statin and the placebo groups.</p><p>A post-hoc analysis that stratified patients by baseline LDL cholesterol concentration demonstrated a reduction in the primary outcome among those with a baseline LDL cholesterol concentration &gt;145 mg/dL (3.76 mmol/L) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.69, 95% CI 0.48-1.00) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Among such patients, there were also reductions in risk for cardiac death, sudden cardiac death, nonfatal MI, and for all cardiac deaths combined. There was no difference between groups among patients with baseline LDL cholesterol &lt;145 mg/dL. Importantly, this analysis was performed in a subgroup that was not predefined, which limits its interpretation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">AURORA trial</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the AURORA trial, 2776 patients on hemodialysis who were not being treated with a statin were randomly assigned to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10282" href="/z/d/drug information/10282.html" rel="external">rosuvastatin</a> (10 mg/day) or placebo [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. At three months, mean serum LDL cholesterol levels were lowered significantly with rosuvastatin (100 to 58 mg/dL [2.6 to 1.5 mmol/L]) versus no change with placebo (99 to 98 mg/dL [2.56 to 2.53 mmol/L]).</p><p>Nonetheless, at a median follow-up period of 3.8 years, the incidence of the primary composite endpoint (death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke) was similar in the two groups (9.2 versus 9.5 events per 100 patient-years; HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84-1.11). The individual components of the primary composite endpoint as well as all-cause mortality were also not significantly different between the two groups. Active therapy did not provide benefit for any prespecified subgroups, including those with diabetes or elevated C-reactive protein levels. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10282" href="/z/d/drug information/10282.html" rel="external">Rosuvastatin</a> was not associated with an increased incidence of adverse events.</p><p>A post-hoc analysis of 731 patients with diabetes from AURORA also showed no difference in the composite outcome or in the risk of stroke [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. However, there was a 32 percent reduction in cardiac events (including cardiac death and nonfatal MI) among patients with diabetes assigned to receive <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10282" href="/z/d/drug information/10282.html" rel="external">rosuvastatin</a> (n = 388) compared with placebo (n = 343; HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51-0.90) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The rosuvastatin group had a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke compared with placebo, although the number of events was small (12 versus 2, respectively). Similar to the 4-D study, these data suggest a possible benefit of statins in the reduction of cardiac events among patients with diabetes who are on dialysis, although this is only a subgroup analysis [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23811909"><span class="h3">SHARP trial</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The SHARP trial evaluated the efficacy of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9923" href="/z/d/drug information/9923.html" rel="external">simvastatin</a> plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/z/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a> compared with placebo in lowering cardiovascular morbidity in patients with CKD, approximately one-third of whom required maintenance dialysis [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The results dealing with the patients with CKD who were not on dialysis are discussed separately. (See <a class="local">'Trials of statin therapy'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7204.html" rel="external">"Lipid management in patients with nondialysis chronic kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p>Originally, patients were randomly allocated to three treatment arms: a combination pill containing 20 mg of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9923" href="/z/d/drug information/9923.html" rel="external">simvastatin</a> and 10 mg of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/z/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a>, 20 mg of simvastatin only, or placebo. After one year of follow-up, however, the patients in the simvastatin-only arm were reassigned to receive either the combination pill (containing simvastatin and ezetimibe) or placebo; this rerandomization of the simvastatin-only group was prespecified to occur at one year if adverse events were no greater with the combination of simvastatin and ezetimibe than with simvastatin alone. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4562.html" rel="external">"Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering with drugs other than statins and PCSK9 inhibitors", section on 'Ezetimibe'</a>.)</p><p>SHARP included 3023 patients treated with maintenance dialysis. By design, none had a history of MI or coronary revascularization. During a median follow-up of 4.9 years, patients taking the combination of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9923" href="/z/d/drug information/9923.html" rel="external">simvastatin</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/z/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a> had a lower incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events that was not statistically significant (15.0 versus 16.5 percent [RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.75-1.08]). However, the trial was not powered to detect an effect specifically in the dialysis population. Results for the individual components of this composite endpoint were presented only for the entire study population (combining patients on dialysis and not on dialysis) and are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7204.html" rel="external">"Lipid management in patients with nondialysis chronic kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H878000148"><span class="h3">Meta-analyses</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Three meta-analyses have been performed of randomized, controlled trials that examined a benefit of lipid-lowering agents (including statins and statins plus <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/z/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a>) among patients with all stages of CKD, including those on dialysis [<a href="#rid9">9-11</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In one meta-analysis, subgroup analyses of patients on dialysis showed reductions in the risk of cardiac mortality (two studies, n = 1986; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68–0.89) and MI (one study, n = 731; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56-0.92) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Analysis of two studies showed an increase in the risk of stroke (n = 1986; RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.09-2.0); however, the studies that were included in this last analysis were considered of poor quality.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Another meta-analysis reported that, among patients on dialysis, statin treatment had little or no effect on all-cause mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.88-1.04), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82-1.07), and major cardiovascular events (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.87-1.03).

There were no differences in relative risk reduction associated with statins for coronary events (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.81-1.02) or for stroke (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.91-1.47) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p>The results of these meta-analyses among patients with CKD who are not receiving dialysis and among transplant recipients are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7204.html" rel="external">"Lipid management in patients with nondialysis chronic kidney disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7303.html" rel="external">"Lipid abnormalities after kidney transplantation", section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Recommendations for treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We agree with the 2013 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines and with the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) work group that statin therapy <strong>not</strong> be routinely initiated in patients on dialysis [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. We include in this group patients on peritoneal dialysis, although the data on patients on peritoneal dialysis are more sparse than that for patients on hemodialysis. Despite significant reductions in mean serum LDL cholesterol levels, the 4-D, AURORA, and SHARP trials found no definite clinical benefit with statin therapy in patients on hemodialysis. However, as noted above, primary analysis of the SHARP trial showed a decrease in atherosclerotic events in the entire cohort that included both dialysis and nondialysis-dependent patients with CKD and a potential benefit in atherosclerotic events in the dialysis subgroup, and post-hoc analyses of AURORA and 4-D showed benefits among patients with diabetes and among those with an LDL cholesterol concentration &gt;145 mg/dL (3.76 mmol/L), respectively. In addition, one meta-analysis including all three trials showed a modest benefit in atherosclerotic-related events, while another found no benefit of statin treatment in all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and major cardiovascular events. (See <a class="local">'Meta-analyses'</a> above.)</p><p>By contrast, randomized, prospective studies have reported consistent and robust improvements in cardiovascular outcomes with statin therapy in patients with normal kidney function at increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. In addition, meta-analyses and post-hoc analyses of studies of patients with mild-to-moderate kidney dysfunction have noted benefits with statin therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/112841.html" rel="external">"Management of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7190.html" rel="external">"Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease"</a>.)</p><p>The most likely explanation for these discordant results is that the pathogenic processes for adverse cardiovascular outcomes among patients with ESKD differ from those with either mild-to-moderate kidney dysfunction or normal kidney function. In the dialysis population, approximately 60 percent of all cardiac deaths are presumably due to sudden death or arrhythmias, and the underlying diseases that trigger the sudden death or arrhythmias are unclear. There is a markedly increased prevalence of myocardial abnormalities such as left ventricular hypertrophy (present in approximately 75 percent of patients on dialysis) and alterations in myocardial ultrastructure and function. Atheromatous coronary lesions are thought by some investigators to be less important than the nonatherosclerotic diseases, such as nonischemic cardiac fibrosis, in patients on maintenance dialysis. The supportive data for these conclusions are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1922.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death in patients on dialysis"</a>.)</p><p>We also agree that statin therapy be continued in patients who are already receiving statins or a statin/<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/z/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a> combination at the time of initiation of dialysis [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>], especially in those patients with significantly elevated serum levels of LDL cholesterol, largely due to the overwhelming evidence of benefit in the general population and limited data in the dialysis population. However, some clinicians would withdraw statin therapy in patients on dialysis based upon the lack of benefit in 4-D and AURORA. The question of whether to withdraw statin therapy in patients on dialysis already being treated with these agents has not been addressed in randomized trials. Both 4-D and AURORA trials had a large number of patients who discontinued the study medication, but this was most commonly due to achieving a study endpoint or undergoing kidney transplantation.</p><p>Our overall recommendation not to routinely administer statins to patients on dialysis does not necessarily apply to those with very high serum LDL cholesterol levels (such as &gt;145 mg/dL [3.8 mmol/L]), as the post-hoc analysis of the 4-D trial showed an apparent beneficial effect in patients in that subgroup. This uncertainty is particularly poignant for patients with very high LDL cholesterol (eg, &gt;190 mg/dL [4.9 mmol/L]) since those patients might not have been enrolled in AURORA, because of the potential reluctance of nephrologists to refer these patients to the randomized trial and be allocated to the placebo arm. Thus, in the uncommon patient on dialysis with very high LDL cholesterol levels, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy. For these patients in whom statin therapy is prescribed, the following goals are reasonable, although they have not been validated in patients on dialysis:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A serum LDL cholesterol of &lt;100 mg/dL (&lt;2.6 mmol/L)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A serum non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration (ie, total minus HDL cholesterol) of &lt;130 mg/dL (&lt;3.36 mmol/L) in patients who have already achieved the target LDL cholesterol level but have fasting triglycerides ≥200 mg/dL (≥2.26 mmol/L)</p><p></p><p>For patients not on dialysis, some experts have advocated the use of statins without follow-up serum cholesterol measurements. We do not support that approach in patients on dialysis, since statins have not been definitively shown to be beneficial in improving clinical outcomes, as described above. For patients on dialysis who have very high baseline LDL cholesterol levels, the use of statins should be justified based solely on their cholesterol-lowering effects, rather than on putative pleotropic effects. </p><p>For patients on dialysis with very high baseline LDL cholesterol levels who initiate pharmacologic treatment, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8790" href="/z/d/drug information/8790.html" rel="external">ezetimibe</a> is probably unnecessary as long as the LDL cholesterol and the non-HDL cholesterol targets can be achieved with statin therapy.

Strong data from randomized trials in patients on dialysis are, however, lacking.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Smoking</strong> – In patients on dialysis, observational studies suggest that smoking greatly increases the risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [<a href="#rid30">30-32</a>]. However, unlike that found in the general population, there are few studies showing beneficial cardiovascular outcomes with smoking cessation in patients on dialysis. In a post-hoc analysis of the Hemodialysis (HEMO) study, including 1842 patients on hemodialysis, there was a trend toward an increase in risk of cardiovascular mortality among current smokers compared with former smokers, but this was not statistically significant [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. In this analysis, the population-attributable fractions (ie, the fraction of observed deaths that might have been avoided) were 5.3 for current smokers versus patients who never smoked and 2.1 for current versus former smokers. Nonetheless, we recommend that patients on dialysis completely stop smoking, given the marked benefits of smoking cessation observed in the general population. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1504.html" rel="external">"Cardiovascular risk of smoking and benefits of smoking cessation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Weight reduction</strong> – In those with normal kidney function, obesity is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The benefits of weight reduction in patients on dialysis are, however, unclear. In fact, there appears to be a survival advantage in patients on dialysis who have obesity. The higher mortality risks in patients on dialysis with lower body mass indices (BMIs) may be attributed to malnutrition. Limited data suggest that increased muscle mass confers greater survival advantage than increased fat in the dialysis population [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In general, we do not currently recommend weight reduction for all patients on dialysis with higher BMI. Weight reduction, however, should be considered in patients with severe obesity, especially in those who are planning kidney transplant surgery.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Exercise</strong> – Regular exercise has a variety of cardiovascular benefits in those with normal kidney function. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1510.html" rel="external">"Exercise and fitness in the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">By comparison, a paucity of data exists among patients on dialysis concerning the association between exercise and cardiovascular and overall survival. This was examined in an observational study using data for 2507 patients from the Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality Wave II Study [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. Patients who exercised two to three and four to five times per week had lower mortality. However, for unclear reasons, daily exercise provided no survival benefit. Nonetheless, a gradual increase in physical activity is probably beneficial in most patients on dialysis and should be encouraged unless there are specific medical contraindications. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7324.html" rel="external">"Uremic myopathy and deconditioning in patients with chronic kidney disease (including those on dialysis)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3540293482"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

In patients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD), these measures are referred to as "secondary prevention". (See <a class="local">'Coronary heart disease risk equivalent'</a> above and <a class="local">'Overview of secondary prevention'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lipid modification</strong> – We recommend <strong>not</strong> initiating statin therapy in patients on dialysis with no, mild, or moderate increase in serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, pending more definitive data (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). We suggest continuing statin therapy in patients on dialysis currently receiving these agents unless side effects develop (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). However, some clinicians would withdraw statin therapy in patients on dialysis based upon the lack of clearly demonstrable benefits. In patients on dialysis with very high serum LDL cholesterol levels, the initiation of statins may be reasonable. (See <a class="local">'Lipid modification'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hypertension</strong> – Target blood pressure in patients on dialysis should be individualized, partly depending upon symptoms of intradialytic hypotension. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1848.html" rel="external">"Hypertension in patients on dialysis"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">Aspirin</a> – For most patients on dialysis who have established CVD, we suggest the administration of aspirin (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). The dose of aspirin is 81 mg/day. However, patients on dialysis who would prefer to avoid the increased risk of bleeding for an unproven cardiovascular benefit may reasonably choose to forgo aspirin therapy. (See <a class="local">'Aspirin'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Beta-blockers,</strong> <strong>ACE-inhibitors, ARBs, and MRAs</strong> – The use of beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) for secondary prevention in patients on dialysis is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1961.html" rel="external">"Management of heart failure in patients on dialysis", section on 'Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Therapeutic lifestyle changes</strong> – We recommend complete smoking cessation (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_1" rel="external">Grade 1A</a>). Patients on dialysis may also benefit from a gradual increase in physical activity as tolerated for cardiovascular protection and increase in muscle mass. (See <a class="local">'Therapeutic lifestyle changes'</a> above.)</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li class="breakAll">United States Renal Data System.
