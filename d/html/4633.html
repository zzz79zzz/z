SCLC occurs predominantly in smokers. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4640.html" rel="external">"Cigarette smoking and other possible risk factors for lung cancer"</a>.)</p><p>SCLC is distinguished clinically from most types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by its rapid doubling time, high growth fraction, and the early development of metastases. Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, a rare form of lung cancer, and extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas are generally treated with the same chemotherapy regimens used for SCLC. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4882.html" rel="external">"Extrapulmonary small cell cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4603.html" rel="external">"Pathology of lung malignancies", section on 'Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma'</a>.)</p><p>SCLC usually presents with disseminated disease, and treatment strategies have focused on systemic therapy. Although SCLC is highly responsive to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT), it commonly relapses within months despite treatment.</p><p>The initial management of patients with extensive-stage (ES)-SCLC will be reviewed here. Related topics include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4628.html" rel="external">"Pathobiology and staging of small cell carcinoma of the lung"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4634.html" rel="external">"Limited-stage small cell lung cancer: Initial management"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4631.html" rel="external">"Prophylactic cranial irradiation for patients with small cell lung cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4614.html" rel="external">"Treatment of refractory and relapsed small cell lung cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88587.html" rel="external">"Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H193053020"><span class="h1">STAGING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with SCLC are typically divided into those with limited-stage (LS) versus extensive-stage (ES) disease, although the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASCLC) has recommended that patients should be staged using the Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) classification. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4628.html" rel="external">"Pathobiology and staging of small cell carcinoma of the lung", section on 'Staging'</a>.)</p><p>LS-SCLC is defined as disease that is limited to the ipsilateral hemithorax and regional lymph nodes and can be encompassed in a safe radiotherapy field. ES-SCLC is disease that has spread beyond this and may include distant metastases, malignant pericardial or pleural effusions, and/or contralateral supraclavicular and contralateral hilar lymph node involvement.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H193053207"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF TREATMENT OF EXTENSIVE-STAGE DISEASE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with SCLC rarely survive more than a couple of months without treatment. However, SCLC is highly responsive to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs, and chemotherapy is the mainstay of initial treatment, prolonging survival compared with best supportive care [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. These benefits may be seen even in patients with advanced disease, poor performance status, and severe organ dysfunction [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The addition of immunotherapy to a chemotherapy backbone adds further benefit  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef126166" href="/d/graphic/126166.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>For those with residual disease in the thorax following systemic chemotherapy, thoracic radiation therapy improves survival. Additionally, prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) decreases the incidence of symptomatic brain metastases in patients who have responded to systemic chemotherapy, although its impact on overall survival is uncertain. In this modern imaging era, surveillance magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans may be considered as an alternative to PCI. (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4631.html" rel="external">"Prophylactic cranial irradiation for patients with small cell lung cancer", section on 'Extensive-stage SCLC'</a> and <a class="local">'Prophylactic cranial irradiation'</a> below).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2289997554"><span class="h1">INITIAL TREATMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H21065092"><span class="h2">Preferred option: Immunotherapy plus platinum-etoposide</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4213354453"><span class="h3">Rationale for platinum-etoposide as choice of chemotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Randomized trials have shown a survival benefit for combination regimens compared with single agent chemotherapy, and for simultaneous administration of multiple agents as compared with sequential administration of the same agents [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The use of maintenance chemotherapy, three- or four-drug combinations, and alternating or sequential non-cross-resistant regimens have not been shown to offer substantial benefits compared with a two-drug combination; thus, these approaches should not be utilized.</p><p>No specific combination has established superiority in the treatment of SCLC. However, platinum-based combinations are the standard of care for the initial systemic therapy in patients with SCLC, based upon their clinical activity and toxicity profile. In multiple randomized trials, the cisplatin-etoposide (PE) regimen appears to be at least as effective as older regimens such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9391" href="/d/drug information/9391.html" rel="external">doxorubicin</a>, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10045" href="/d/drug information/10045.html" rel="external">vincristine</a> (CAV) or cyclophosphamide, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8663" href="/d/drug information/8663.html" rel="external">epirubicin</a>, and vincristine (CEV), and has less toxicity [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>].</p><p>Although PE is associated with comparable response rates to carboplatin-etoposide (CE), most clinicians in the United States use CE to treat patients with ES-SCLC based upon its better toxicity profile  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75586" href="/d/graphic/75586.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). CE poses less risk for nephrotoxicity, neuropathy, and ototoxicity than PE, and is associated with lesser risk of emesis. PE, however, has less hematologic toxicity, risk of mucosal toxicity, and interstitial pneumonitis.</p><p>Cisplatin-based regimens have been compared with carboplatin-based combinations in four randomized trials [<a href="#rid7">7-10</a>]. A meta-analysis that included individual patient data from these four trials found no statistically significant difference between <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a> and carboplatin-based combinations in terms of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), or objective response rate (median OS 9.6 versus 9.4 months, 5.5 versus 5.3 months, and 67 versus 66 percent, respectively) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>Other efforts to improve on the results with PE have substituted <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8430" href="/d/drug information/8430.html" rel="external">etoposide</a> with a camptothecin analogue (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8573" href="/d/drug information/8573.html" rel="external">irinotecan</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10007" href="/d/drug information/10007.html" rel="external">topotecan</a>) or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8663" href="/d/drug information/8663.html" rel="external">epirubicin</a>. These results are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Less preferred options'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H116211046"><span class="h3">Rationale for addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors to chemotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="108314" href="/d/drug information/108314.html" rel="external">Atezolizumab</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="112994" href="/d/drug information/112994.html" rel="external">durvalumab</a> are humanized monoclonal anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies that have improved survival, when combined with a platinum agent and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8430" href="/d/drug information/8430.html" rel="external">etoposide</a> during induction and continued as maintenance [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. The anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="96957" href="/d/drug information/96957.html" rel="external">pembrolizumab</a> has been shown to improve PFS with a favorable but nonsignificant survival advantage [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The addition of an anti-CTLA4 inhibitor to durvalumab and PE also showed a trend towards improved survival compared with PE alone, but this was not statistically significant. These randomized trial data are summarized in the sections below. </p><p>Cross-trial comparisons suggest similar efficacy and toxicities between <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="112994" href="/d/drug information/112994.html" rel="external">durvalumab</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="108314" href="/d/drug information/108314.html" rel="external">atezolizumab</a> when paired with chemotherapy, and a choice between them should depend on provider preference and insurance coverage. If atezolizumab is chosen, we use CE as the accompanying chemotherapy regimen, as atezolizumab has not been evaluated in combination with PE. Durvalumab may be paired with either PE or CE [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>Despite the improvements observed with the addition of immunotherapy to chemotherapy in induction, maintenance immunotherapy has not demonstrated benefits among those induced with chemotherapy alone. In CHECKMATE 451, which evaluated maintenance therapy in patients with stable disease or response after initial chemotherapy, neither of the two immunotherapy arms (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="98764" href="/d/drug information/98764.html" rel="external">nivolumab</a> alone or nivolumab in combination with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16084" href="/d/drug information/16084.html" rel="external">ipilimumab</a>) improved survival relative to placebo [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>The available data collectively support chemoimmunotherapy as induction (followed by immunotherapy maintenance), rather than chemotherapy alone as induction followed by maintenance immunotherapy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H131372869"><span class="h4">Atezolizumab plus carboplatin and etoposide</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="108314" href="/d/drug information/108314.html" rel="external">Atezolizumab</a> in combination with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9202" href="/d/drug information/9202.html" rel="external">carboplatin</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8430" href="/d/drug information/8430.html" rel="external">etoposide</a>  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef128076" href="/d/graphic/128076.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) was the first therapeutic advance in the treatment of SCLC since approximately the 1990s. </p><p>In a randomized trial of 403 patients with treatment-naïve ES-SCLC, patients were assigned to receive <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9202" href="/d/drug information/9202.html" rel="external">carboplatin</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8430" href="/d/drug information/8430.html" rel="external">etoposide</a> with either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="108314" href="/d/drug information/108314.html" rel="external">atezolizumab</a> or placebo for four cycles, followed by maintenance with either atezolizumab or placebo (according to the previous assignment)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef128076" href="/d/graphic/128076.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) [<a href="#rid12">12,17</a>]. At a median follow-up of 23 months, the median OS for the atezolizumab versus placebo group was 12.3 and 10.3 months (hazard ratio [HR] 0.76, 95% CI 0.60-0.95). Median PFS was also improved among those receiving atezolizumab (5.2 versus 4.3 months; HR for disease progression or death 0.77, 95% CI 0.62-0.96). Rates of toxicity of any grade were similar between the two groups, as were grade ≥3 toxicities, which occurred in 58 percent of patients in each group. Neither PD-L1 immunohistochemistry nor blood-based (circulating tumor DNA) tumor mutational burden was shown to be a predictive biomarker. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1799642900"><span class="h4">Durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The addition of the anti-PD-L1 antibody <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="112994" href="/d/drug information/112994.html" rel="external">durvalumab</a> to platinum-etoposide has also shown improved survival outcomes relative to chemotherapy alone as front-line treatment for ES-SCLC.</p><p>In updated results from the phase III CASPIAN trial that included 537 treatment-naïve patients with ES-SCLC, those randomly assigned to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="112994" href="/d/drug information/112994.html" rel="external">durvalumab</a> plus four cycles of platinum-etoposide followed by maintenance durvalumab had improved OS relative to those assigned to four to six cycles of platinum-etoposide (12.9 versus 10.5 months; HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.9) [<a href="#rid13">13,18</a>].

Although stereotactic radiation surgery (SRS) is often chosen for tumors of other histologies with a small and limited number of brain metastases, WBRT is typically preferred for those with SCLC and any degree of intracranial disease, due to the propensity for SCLC to recur intracranially.

Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on "patient info" and the keyword(s) of interest.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Basics topics (see  <a class="medical medical_basics" href="/d/html/15812.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Small cell lung cancer (The Basics)"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Beyond the Basics topics (see  <a class="medical medical_patient" href="/d/html/893.html" rel="external">"Patient education: Small cell lung cancer treatment (Beyond the Basics)"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H33"><span class="h1">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Introduction</strong> – Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a neuroendocrine tumor that represents about 15 percent of all lung cancers. SCLC occurs predominantly in smokers. SCLC is distinguished clinically from most types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by its rapid doubling time, high growth fraction, and the early development of metastases. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial treatment</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Approach to treatment is summarized in the algorithm  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef126166" href="/d/graphic/126166.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients with extensive-stage (ES)-SCLC, we recommend addition of an immune checkpoint inhibitor to platinum-etoposide rather than chemotherapy alone (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">Grade 1B</a>). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In choosing between immunotherapy options, we suggest <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="108314" href="/d/drug information/108314.html" rel="external">atezolizumab</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="112994" href="/d/drug information/112994.html" rel="external">durvalumab</a> rather than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="96957" href="/d/drug information/96957.html" rel="external">pembrolizumab</a>  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef128076" href="/d/graphic/128076.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>), although the agents have never been compared directly, and pembrolizumab is a reasonable alternative. (See <a class="local">'Preferred option: Immunotherapy plus platinum-etoposide'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In regards to choice of chemotherapy, we suggest carboplatin-etoposide (CE) over cisplatin-etoposide (PE) (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>), based on its better toxicity profile and comparable outcomes, although PE is an acceptable alternative  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66855" href="/d/graphic/66855.html" rel="external">table 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75586" href="/d/graphic/75586.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Rationale for platinum-etoposide as choice of chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The use of maintenance chemotherapy, three- or four-drug combinations, and alternating or sequential non-cross-resistant regimens have not been shown to offer substantial benefits compared with a two-drug combination; thus, these approaches should not be utilized.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients who are not candidates for immunotherapy, platinum-etoposide chemotherapy alone is appropriate. Additional alternatives include regimens substituting <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8573" href="/d/drug information/8573.html" rel="external">irinotecan</a> instead of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8430" href="/d/drug information/8430.html" rel="external">etoposide</a>, in combination with a platinum agent. (See <a class="local">'Less preferred options'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Initial chemotherapy is usually limited to four to six cycles, with the immune checkpoint inhibitor continuing until progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity. (See <a class="local">'Duration of treatment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Special considerations </strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Patients with brain metastases</strong> – Patients who present with ES-SCLC with brain metastases may be treated with initial systemic therapy if their intracranial disease is asymptomatic, followed by radiation therapy (RT) upon completion of induction therapy. However, those with symptomatic brain metastases are usually managed initially with radiation, followed by induction systemic therapy. In regards to type of radiation, we suggest whole-brain RT (WBRT) (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Stereotactic radiation surgery is a reasonable alternative to WBRT, although we recognize that randomized trial data are lacking. (See <a class="local">'Patients who present with brain metastases'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Older patients</strong> – Only limited data are available from randomized trials to guide treatment in older adult patients. We suggest that older adult patients be treated with the same doses and regimens as younger patients, if their overall medical condition is satisfactory (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). Otherwise, modified doses are reasonable. A comprehensive geriatric assessment prior to initiating treatment may be useful in assessing whether or not an individual patient is a candidate for chemotherapy. (See <a class="local">'Older adult patients or those with poor performance status'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2808.html" rel="external">"Comprehensive geriatric assessment for patients with cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Assessment of response</strong> <strong>and next steps</strong> – Following initial therapy (or earlier, if clinically indicated), we assess response with computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, with intravenous (IV) contrast. We also obtain a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Subsequent treatment depends on clinical response. (See <a class="local">'Assessment of response and next steps'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients with ES-SCLC who have had a favorable response to chemotherapy but in whom there is evidence of residual disease within the chest identified on CT, we suggest thoracic RT (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). However, we acknowledge the limitations in available data, given that trials evaluating chemoimmunotherapy induction did not permit thoracic RT. (See <a class="local">'Thoracic radiation for those with residual disease in the chest'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients with ES-SCLC with favorable tumor response or better at the completion of chemotherapy and a good performance status, we suggest prophylactic cranial irradiation (<a class="grade" href="https://medilib.ir/uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>), but recognize that surveillance with MRI is also acceptable and may be preferred by some patients. PCI following chemotherapy decreases the incidence of symptomatic brain metastases, although the impact on overall survival is uncertain in the era of modern imaging. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4631.html" rel="external">"Prophylactic cranial irradiation for patients with small cell lung cancer", section on 'Extensive-stage SCLC'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Disease surveillance</strong> – For those with stable disease or response after initial treatment, we typically follow up initially every two months with history and physical exam, and CT scans of the chest abdomen and pelvis, with brain MRI every two to four months. (See <a class="local">'Disease surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Prognosis</strong> – From the time of original diagnosis, the median survival for patients with ES-SCLC is about 8 to 13 months. In most series, less than 5 percent of those with ES-SCLC survive beyond two years. (See <a class="local">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Agra Y, Pelayo M, Sacristan M, et al.
