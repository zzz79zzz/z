(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2842.html" rel="external">"Headache in children: Approach to evaluation and general management strategies"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6161.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of migraine in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6160.html" rel="external">"Tension-type headache in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H401448542"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Headache is the most common neurologic complaint in the pediatric population and a common presenting complaint in the emergency department (ED). The prevalence of headache in children is increasing, as are ED visits and hospitalizations [<a href="#rid1">1-4</a>]. Caretakers may bring children to the ED or a primary care provider for headaches that are more severe or have not responded to nonprescription medications. In the pediatric ED, nontraumatic headaches account for up to 2.5 percent of visits [<a href="#rid5">5-7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H825553756"><span class="h1">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The terms "primary" and "secondary" are used to describe headache etiology:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Primary headaches</strong> – Primary headaches comprise 90 percent of all pediatric headaches [<a href="#rid8">8</a>] (ie, migraine, tension-type, or cluster headaches), are typically self-limited, and are diagnosed based on symptom profiles and patterns of headache attacks  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70794" href="/z/d/graphic/70794.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Secondary headaches</strong> – Secondary headaches have identifiable underlying conditions. Although the vast majority of secondary headaches in children have benign etiologies (eg, acute febrile viral illness), the goal of the emergency evaluation of children with headaches is to identify as a first priority those with serious or life-threatening causes such as central nervous system infection, brain tumor, intracranial hemorrhage, or severe hypertension [<a href="#rid8">8-12</a>]. In most patients, this task can be accomplished with a careful history and physical examination and selected ancillary testing. The prevalence of serious or life-threatening intracranial conditions in children presenting to the ED with nontraumatic headache ranges from 1 to 10 percent, depending upon the clinical findings [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. </p><p></p><p>Headache can be the symptom of life-threatening complications for children with various underlying conditions (eg, those with indolent, progressive, or unsuspected head trauma; immunodeficiencies who develop opportunistic infections; or patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts that malfunction, causing obstruction). Evaluation of headache in these children is often guided by specific protocols that include neuroimaging and consultation with a specialist (eg, neurosurgeon, infectious disease specialist, or oncologist). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/111138.html" rel="external">"Hydrocephalus in children: Management and prognosis", section on 'Shunt complications'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1297.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of brain abscess"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CAUSES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most important consideration in the evaluation is to differentiate between primary and secondary headache. The challenge for the emergency clinician is to identify patients with secondary headaches who require rapid diagnosis and treatment  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78979" href="/z/d/graphic/78979.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). The majority of children who undergo emergency evaluations for headaches are diagnosed with viral illnesses or migraine headaches [<a href="#rid5">5,6,15,16</a>]. This epidemiology is similar to the causes of headache among children seen in primary care settings. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2842.html" rel="external">"Headache in children: Approach to evaluation and general management strategies"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Life-threatening conditions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Life-threatening causes of headache are those that may result in brain injury or death from various mechanisms including brain tumor, inflammation, increased intracranial pressure (ICP), and/or hypoxia.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h3">Infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children with life-threatening infections as the cause of headache typically have other worrisome clinical features, such as altered mental status or focal neurologic findings. These manifestations may be subtle in younger children who cannot describe their symptoms.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Bacterial meningitis</strong> – The irritable or lethargic child with fever, neck pain/stiffness, and/or headache may have bacterial meningitis. The incidence of bacterial meningitis among children has declined since the introduction of conjugate vaccines against <em>Haemophilus influenza </em>type B<em> </em>and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5968.html" rel="external">"Bacterial meningitis in children older than one month: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other non-viral meningitis</strong> – The differential diagnosis of headache is not complete without consideration of rare causes of meningitis:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Tuberculous meningitis occurs in patients who have or have had tuberculosis and should be considered in the context of a history of possible exposure to <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> and signs of meningitis, including fever, headache, and nuchal rigidity. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8009.html" rel="external">"Central nervous system tuberculosis: An overview"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Fungal meningitis is considered in the immunocompromised host who presents with signs of meningitis, including headache. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2453.html" rel="external">"Candida infections of the central nervous system"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2445.html" rel="external">"Coccidioidal meningitis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3757.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of Cryptococcus neoformans meningoencephalitis in patients with HIV"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Viral encephalitis</strong> – Progressive symptoms of fever, headache, and abrupt onset of altered sensorium (eg, bizarre behavior, visual or auditory hallucinations) are associated with viral encephalitis. In otherwise healthy children, herpes simplex virus causes 10 to 20 percent of sporadic cases of encephalitis and is the only treatable pathogen in this condition. Infection with specific arthropod-borne viruses may be suggested by seasonal patterns (eg, Eastern equine encephalitis or West Nile virus) or recent travel. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8278.html" rel="external">"Herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1293.html" rel="external">"Arthropod-borne encephalitides"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Orbital or cerebral abscess</strong> – Children with focal infections, such as orbital or cerebral abscesses, typically have focal findings on ocular and/or neurologic examination. Conditions that may be associated with central nervous system abscess formation include immunocompromise and congenital heart disease with right-to-left intracardiac shunting. Cerebral abscess and cerebral venous thrombosis are uncommon but life-threatening complications of orbital, sinus, ear, or dental infections [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3414.html" rel="external">"Orbital cellulitis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6000.html" rel="external">"Bacterial meningitis in children: Neurologic complications"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1103.html" rel="external">"Cerebral venous thrombosis: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Risk factors and associated conditions'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Tumor</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Chronic progressive headache (increasing in frequency and severity over time) is a common presenting symptom among children with brain tumors. Nocturnal or morning headache, especially when associated with vomiting, is also prevalent in children with brain tumors (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14113.html" rel="external">"Brain tumor headache", section on 'Clinical features'</a>). However, very few children evaluated in the ED for headache have brain tumors as the cause. In a large multicenter pediatric series describing children with brain tumors, 62 percent of patients had headaches at the time of diagnosis [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. In comparison, in a small prospective series, less than 3 percent of children presenting to the ED with headaches had newly diagnosed brain tumors [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>The early symptoms of brain tumors are often nonspecific, and diagnosis may be delayed [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. At the time of diagnosis, the overwhelming majority of children with brain tumors as the cause have other symptoms in addition to headache [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Over 99 percent of children in the multicenter report and all of the children in the ED series had at least one other symptom or sign (eg, nausea/vomiting, visual disturbance, ataxia, or abnormal eye movements) [<a href="#rid15">15,19</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Subarachnoid and intracranial hemorrhage</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage (typically subarachnoid) can develop in association with an aneurysm, vascular malformation, coagulopathy, or hemoglobinopathy. The patient may report the abrupt onset of headache, which reaches maximal intensity in less than one minute. In one retrospective series that described children with nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage, more than half presented with headache and vomiting [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Frequent signs included hemiparesis and seizures. Among patients with sickle cell disease, intracranial hemorrhage accounts for about one-third of cerebrovascular events. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5926.html" rel="external">"Acute stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) in children and adults with sickle cell disease"</a>.)</p><p>Intracranial hemorrhage is an uncommon but life-threatening cause of headache among children. Headache is rarely the sole manifestation of hemorrhage that occurs as the result of trauma (ie, epidural or subdural hematoma). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6566.html" rel="external">"Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children: Initial evaluation and management"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6610.html" rel="external">"Child abuse: Evaluation and diagnosis of abusive head trauma in infants and children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1894688408"><span class="h3">Acute obstructive hydrocephalus</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Acute obstructive hydrocephalus causes an abrupt rise in intracranial pressure with one or more of the following findings:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Headache</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Vomiting</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lethargy or coma</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hypertension with bradycardia or tachycardia</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Signs of transtentorial herniation  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70683" href="/z/d/graphic/70683.html" rel="external">table 3</a>)</p><p></p><p>Acute obstructive hydrocephalus may occur in patients with central nervous system (CNS) infection, space-occupying lesions such as tumor or hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, and cerebrospinal fluid shunt malfunction (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/111138.html" rel="external">"Hydrocephalus in children: Management and prognosis", section on 'Shunt malfunction'</a>), and, less commonly, as a presenting feature of selected brain malformations (eg, Chiari type I or Dandy-Walker malformation). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13507.html" rel="external">"Chiari malformations"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6745.html" rel="external">"Prenatal diagnosis of CNS anomalies other than neural tube defects and ventriculomegaly", section on 'Dandy-Walker malformation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h3">Carbon monoxide poisoning</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Symptoms of mild to moderate carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning are nonspecific but typically include headache [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. Children may develop CO poisoning from occult sources, such as improperly vented home heating systems, space heaters, or automobile exhaust fumes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/322.html" rel="external">"Carbon monoxide poisoning"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Hypertensive urgency or emergency</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with hypertensive crisis may present with headache as one manifestation of hypertensive encephalopathy. Other symptoms include visual changes from retinal hemorrhage or exudates, altered mental status, and seizures. Hypertensive encephalopathy is uncommon among children and is typically caused by systemic illness or renovascular disease. Pheochromocytoma is an exceptionally rare pediatric tumor that usually presents with headache, pallor, diaphoresis, and hypertension. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6438.html" rel="external">"Approach to hypertensive emergencies and urgencies in children", section on 'Initial stabilization'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5850.html" rel="external">"Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Common conditions</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Infection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Among children evaluated in the ED for headache, infection is the most common cause [<a href="#rid5">5,15,16</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fever</strong> – Children with fever (related almost entirely to infection) frequently complain of headache. Headaches associated with fever are thought to be due to vasodilation [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Viral meningitis</strong> – Headache, with or without neck discomfort, is a typical presentation of viral meningitis among older children and adolescents. Other clinical manifestations (eg, rash or mouth lesions with enterovirus) may suggest a specific virus. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5983.html" rel="external">"Viral meningitis in children: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lyme meningitis</strong> – In endemic regions  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82648" href="/z/d/graphic/82648.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>), Lyme meningitis is an important diagnostic consideration in children with headache. The presentation of Lyme meningitis is similar to that of aseptic meningitis. Erythema migrans (by history or examination), cranial nerve palsy, and papilledema (from increased ICP) are strongly associated with Lyme meningitis but uncommon in patients with viral meningitis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6038.html" rel="external">"Lyme disease: Clinical manifestations in children", section on 'Meningitis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pharyngitis</strong> – Headache, sore throat, and abdominal pain are the classic symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis. Influenza virus infection can cause similar symptoms, including headache. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5971.html" rel="external">"Group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis in children and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other</strong> – Otitis media, sinusitis, and dental infections can cause headache. Localized pain and signs of inflammation suggest the specific diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6069.html" rel="external">"Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in children: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Complications'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6009.html" rel="external">"Acute otitis media in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h3">Migraine</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In several observational series describing children evaluated in EDs for acute headache, migraine was second only to viral illness as the cause [<a href="#rid2">2,3,15,16,25</a>]. Migraine headaches are typically recurrent and episodic, with characteristic patterns that are easily described by patients or parents/caregivers  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70794" href="/z/d/graphic/70794.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef50876" href="/z/d/graphic/50876.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). A family history of migraine or headaches is common. Children with significant changes in the quality, severity, or timing of headaches should be carefully evaluated for other causes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6161.html" rel="external">"Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of migraine in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Tension-type headache</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Tension-type headache is the term designated by the International Headache Society to describe what were previously called tension, muscle-contraction, stress, or psychogenic headaches. Tension-type headaches occur in 10 to 25 percent of schoolchildren and adolescents, making them as common as migraine headaches [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Among children, they appear to be associated with depression, oromandibular dysfunction, and muscle tension due to stress [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p>In contrast with headaches related to brain tumors, pain is typically intermittent and recurring (but nonprogressive), and the neurologic examination is unremarkable  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef68064" href="/z/d/graphic/68064.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6160.html" rel="external">"Tension-type headache in children", section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h2">Other conditions</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h3">Temporomandibular joint dysfunction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction occurs in children with primary and mixed dentition. Children typically report increased pain while chewing and have point tenderness over the mandibular condyle [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].

Headache is the most common chief complaint among children who are old enough to describe their symptoms. Although IIH has been described in young children, most patients are adolescents and typically female.

This group of headaches is characterized by trigeminal location and association with autonomic features. Cluster headaches are typically unilateral and frontal-periorbital in location  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80843" href="/z/d/graphic/80843.html" rel="external">table 6</a>). The pain of cluster headaches is severe and lasts less than three hours, but multiple headaches occur in a very short period of time (hence "cluster"). Cluster headaches usually are associated with ipsilateral autonomic findings, which may include one or more of the following: lacrimation, rhinorrhea, ophthalmic injection, and occasionally Horner syndrome (ipsilateral miosis, ptosis, and facial anhidrosis).</p><p>Cluster headaches have been reported in children as young as three years of age, but they are rare in children younger than 10 years of age and uncommon in older patients. They become more apparent between the ages of 10 and 20 years, although they remain infrequent. Cluster headaches are discussed separately.

This was demonstrated in one prospective study describing children evaluated in an ED for headache in which 98 percent of children selected the most severe rating on a pain scale to describe the severity of their headaches [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. In this study, children with upper respiratory infections were more likely to be able to describe the quality of headache pain than those with brain tumors and ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunctions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">When able to describe the headache, the following characteristics are helpful in identifying an etiology:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Laterality – Unilaterality suggests migraine headache, although in children under age 10 years, the pain in this condition may be bilateral. Also, unilateral headaches occur with focal infections, such as sinusitis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Location – Cluster headaches are usually temporal or retro-orbital in location. Pain may also localize to specific regions in secondary headaches, such as with sinusitis or dental abscess.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pattern of previous headaches</strong> – The following temporal headache patterns often suggest a specific diagnosis:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Acute – This pattern describes a single episode of headache without a history of previous events.

The headache is usually bilateral but can be on the side of the tumor. Supratentorial tumors impinging on structures innervated by the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve may produce a frontotemporal headache, while posterior fossa tumors compressing the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves can cause occipitonuchal pain. There is generally little radiation of pain, except in posterior fossa tumors. Among children with headache who have brain tumors, additional symptoms are almost always present at the time of diagnosis, and funduscopic or neurologic examination is often abnormal. In addition to a chronic progressive pattern, the following symptoms suggest the possibility of an intracranial mass, such as a brain tumor (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14113.html" rel="external">"Brain tumor headache", section on 'Clinical features'</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Headache pain that wakes the patient from sleep or occurs on waking in the morning</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Association with vomiting, especially progressive vomiting</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Behavioral changes</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Polydipsia/polyuria and/or visual field deficits (suggestive of craniopharyngioma)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Other neurologic symptoms, such as ataxia, change in coordination, "clumsiness," blurred vision, or diplopia</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Trauma</strong> – Intracranial hemorrhage may cause headache for a child who has had a head injury, although this history may be absent in cases of abusive head trauma, especially in children younger than five years of age.
