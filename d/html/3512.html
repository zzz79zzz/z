         Evaluation and optimization of volume status is an essential component of treatment in patients with systolic or diastolic heart failure (HF) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Removal of excess extracellular fluid with diuretics to treat peripheral and/or pulmonary edema is one of the mainstays of volume management. In contrast to other HF therapies, such as angiotensin inhibitors, beta blockers, and aldosterone antagonists, limited outcome data are available for diuretic therapy. However, for the majority of patients with HF, diuretics are essential for the control of volume status.
        </p>
        <p>
         Issues related to the use of diuretics, as well as sodium and fluid restriction, in patients with HF will be reviewed here. The evaluation, including assessment of volume status, and overall management of HF are discussed separately. (See

         Diuretics are the cornerstone of treatment of volume overload in patients with HF. However, few clinical trials have studied the impact of diuretic therapy on clinical outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
         A meta-analysis of diuretic treatment in chronic HF demonstrated a beneficial effect on clinical outcomes, although only small trials were available [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Three trials with a total of 202 patients with chronic HF found a reduction in mortality with diuretic use compared with placebo (odds ratio [OR] 0.24, 95% CI 0.07-0.83). Admission for worsening HF was reduced by diuretics compared with placebo in two trials with a total of 169 patients (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01-0.52). These results are consistent with data from observational studies as well as diuretic trials demonstrating rapid improvement in dyspnea in patients treated largely with diuretic therapy [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         However, observational data have raised safety concerns about diuretic treatment of HF. Several uncontrolled studies have found that higher diuretic doses are associated with worse outcomes, including mortality [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Use of nonpotassium sparing diuretics to treat HF has been associated with arrhythmic death [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. However, these observations are confounded by the indications for high dose diuretic use (ie, the need for higher doses of loop diuretics is likely a marker of more severe HF with increased mortality risk).
        </p>
        <p>
         Blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels often rise during diuretic treatment of HF, and careful monitoring of renal function and electrolytes is recommended. These issues are discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Effects on renal function'
         </a>

         The major issues that should be considered about diuretic therapy in patients with HF include salt and water restriction, the choice and dose of diuretic, hemodynamic consequences of diuresis, improved survival with aldosterone antagonism, and variable effects on systemic vascular resistance.

         The approach to sodium and fluid restriction and other aspects of self-management in patients with HF are discussed separately. (See

          —
         </span>
         Most patients with HF and volume overload are initially treated with the combination of an oral loop diuretic (such as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8482" href="/z/d/drug information/8482.html" rel="external">
          furosemide

          torsemide

         , or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9168" href="/z/d/drug information/9168.html" rel="external">
          bumetanide
         </a>
         ) and a low sodium diet. The three major manifestations of volume overload in HF are pulmonary congestion, peripheral edema, and elevated jugular venous pressure (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3510.html" rel="external">
          "Heart failure: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis in adults", section on 'Volume assessment'
         </a>
         ). Intravenous administration of loop diuretics (either as a bolus or a continuous infusion) is generally required for acute decompensation in order to achieve rapid diuresis or for severe disease, in which case there may be diuretic resistance. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Refractory congestion'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Loop diuretics are often required for fluid control and to relieve symptoms, but the risk of arrhythmic death may be increased if hypokalemia occurs [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. However, the data supporting this observation may be confounded by the fact that the need for loop diuretics may be correlated with more severe HF and increased mortality risk.
        </p>
        <p>
         Aldosterone antagonism with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9943" href="/z/d/drug information/9943.html" rel="external">
          spironolactone
         </a>
         or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8789" href="/z/d/drug information/8789.html" rel="external">
          eplerenone
         </a>
         can be added to loop diuretics to modestly enhance diuresis and minimize potassium loss. More importantly, these drugs improve survival in patients with systolic HF. The benefits of aldosterone antagonists in patients with HF are thought to be relatively independent of their diuretic effect and may be due to a beneficial influence on cardiovascular remodeling and other actions. Eplerenone is a more specific aldosterone antagonist that is associated with fewer side effects but is much more expensive than generic spironolactone.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents are among the drugs that should be avoided in patients with HF, in part because they interfere with the response to diuretics. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3499.html" rel="external">
          "Drugs that should be avoided or used with caution in patients with heart failure", section on 'Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs'

          bumetanide
         </a>
         can be used as the initial therapy; all three are generally effective and well tolerated. We typically start oral diuretic therapy with furosemide. If the patient cannot be effectively diuresed with high-dose furosemide (eg, total daily dose is ≥200 mg), we switch from furosemide to torsemide or bumetanide.
        </p>
        <p>
         This approach is based on the following:

          Furosemide

         is effective in most patients, its dosing is familiar to most health care providers, and it can be readily converted between its intravenous and oral forms if necessary. In patients who are refractory to furosemide, the pharmacologic properties of the loop diuretics favor the use of

The study found no significant differences between the loop diuretics for the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, or hypokalemia, while torsemide had the lowest risk of HF hospitalization and a trend towards less acute renal failure. Several features of this study limit the generalizability of its findings: most of the trials included in the meta-analysis were conducted prior to the year 2000, the trials had diverse methodologies (eg, diuretic dose, follow-up time, endpoint definitions), and torsemide was only superior to other diuretics for two of five outcomes examined.

         The diuretic response to loop diuretics is described by a threshold type dose-response curve linking the rate of diuretic excretion in the urine (reflecting the concentration of diuretic in the renal tubular lumen) and the degree of natriuresis [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. There is virtually no increase in natriuresis until the threshold concentration of luminal diuretic is reached and, once the threshold is exceeded, the degree of natriuresis increases until a maximal ceiling is reached. Patients with HF have a lesser response to a given dose of diuretic than normal subjects for two reasons: decreased diuretic delivery to the kidney (and therefore less transport of diuretic into the tubular lumen) because renal blood flow is reduced; and increased sodium reabsorption at other sites due to hypoperfusion-induced activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems. Intestinal absorption of an oral loop diuretic may be delayed in patients with edema [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Slower absorption will generate a lower peak concentration despite total absorbed dose similar to that in healthy individuals [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ], and this will reduce the diuretic effect if the threshold concentration is not achieved.

         An effective diuretic dose must be determined. The usual starting dose is 20 to 40 mg of

          furosemide
         </a>
         or its equivalent. Subsequent dosing is determined by the diuretic response. Thus, if a patient does not respond to 20 mg of furosemide, the dose should be increased to 40 mg rather than giving the same dose twice a day. Maximum single doses are discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">

         Patients with acute decompensated HF (ADHF) and evidence of fluid overload should be promptly treated with intravenous diuretics as part of the initial therapeutic regimen. The expeditious initiation of an effective diuretic regimen is important in controlling dyspnea and other symptoms related to fluid overload and, in addition, may improve hospital outcomes. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3450.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Intravenous diuretics (either as a bolus or a continuous infusion) are more potent than equivalent oral doses, and elicit an earlier diuretic response, especially in the presence of significant interstitial edema in the gastrointestinal tract. The overall treatment of ADHF is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3454.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         With intravenous therapy in patients with ADHF, the onset of diuresis is within 30 minutes, with peak diuresis usually at one to two hours. Most patients require continued diuretic therapy after the initial dose. This can be achieved with the administration of two or more doses per day or with a continuous intravenous infusion.
        </p>
        <p>
         We switch from an effective intravenous dose to an oral regimen once the patient’s acute symptoms have been stabilized to help ensure that an effective outpatient dose is identified and prescribed.

         The approach to diuretic therapy and concomitant monitoring in patients with ADHF and fluid overload is discussed further separately. (See

         administered intravenously via either a bolus every 12 hours or continuous infusion and at either a low dose (equivalent to the patient’s previous oral dose) or a high dose (2.5 times the previous oral dose). The efficacy endpoint was the global assessment of symptoms over the course of 72 hours, and the safety endpoint was change in serum creatinine level from baseline to 72 hours. Worsening renal function was defined as an increase in the serum creatinine level &gt;0.3 mg/dL (&gt;26.5 micromol/L) at any time during the 72 hours after randomization.

         Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine levels often rise during diuretic treatment of HF, and careful monitoring is recommended. In the absence of other causes for an elevated BUN level, a disproportionate rise in BUN level relative to serum creatinine (BUN/serum creatinine ratio &gt;20:1) suggests a prerenal state with increased passive reabsorption of urea. An initial rise in BUN level may be accompanied by a stable serum creatinine level, reflecting preserved GFR. Further elevations in BUN level along with a rise in serum creatinine level are likely if diuresis is continued in such patients. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7216.html" rel="external">
          "Etiology and diagnosis of prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis in acute kidney injury in adults", section on 'Blood urea nitrogen/serum creatinine ratio'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         An otherwise unexplained rise in serum creatinine level, which reflects a reduction in GFR, may be a marker of reduced perfusion to the kidney and other organs. Patients in whom this occurs before euvolemic status is achieved have a worse prognosis. Nevertheless, fluid removal may still be required to treat signs and symptoms of congestion, particularly pulmonary edema. On the other hand, a stable serum creatinine suggests that perfusion to the kidneys (and therefore to other organs) is being well maintained and that diuresis can be continued if the patient is still edematous. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13606.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Changes in cardiac output and the consequent changes in renal perfusion are not the only determinant of changes in GFR in patients with HF. Among patients with an elevated central venous pressure, the associated increase in renal venous pressure can reduce the GFR, while lowering venous pressure with diuretics and other therapies might therefore increase the GFR. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13606.html" rel="external">

         Patients with severe symptoms or signs of congestion, particularly pulmonary edema, require continued fluid removal independent of changes in GFR. In the presence of elevated central venous pressure, renal function may improve with diuresis. (See

         If the BUN level rises and the serum creatinine level is stable or increases minimally, and the patient is still fluid overloaded, diuresis can be continued to achieve the goal of eliminating clinical evidence of fluid retention with careful monitoring of renal function. (See

         If increases in serum creatinine level appear to reflect intravascular volume depletion, then reduction in or temporary discontinuation of diuretic and/or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) therapy should be considered.

         If hypotension or worsening renal function develops before the goals of treatment are achieved, diuresis may be slowed. Diuresis should be maintained until fluid retention is eliminated even if this results in asymptomatic mild to moderate decreases in blood pressure or renal function. Excessive concern about hypotension and azotemia can lead to underutilization of diuretics and persistent volume overload. Persistent volume overload contributes to continued symptoms, may reduce the efficacy of drug therapy for HF, and, as suggested in the following study, may be associated with increased mortality.

         The potential importance of aggressive fluid removal was suggested by an observational study of 336 patients hospitalized with HF [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Patients developing significant hemoconcentration (defined as elevations in at least two of the following three parameters: hematocrit, serum albumin, and serum total protein) during treatment received higher doses of loop diuretics, lost more weight, and had greater reductions in intracardiac filling pressures. Although hemoconcentration was strongly associated with worsening renal function (odds ratio 5.3), it was also associated with a large and significant reduction in 180-day mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.02-0.44).

          'Filling pressures and cardiac output'
         </a>
         below) has important implications for the time course of diuresis. In both normal individuals and those with HF, the ensuing activation of sodium-retaining mechanisms (angiotensin II, aldosterone, and norepinephrine) as well as flow-dependent hypertrophy in the distal tubule limits the response to continued diuretic therapy [

         In

         </strong>
         patients with HF, negative balances for sodium and potassium are greatest during the first few days of loop diuretic therapy (with most sodium losses typically occurring after the first dose). The time required to achieve a new steady state (when sodium and potassium excretion equals intake) depends on the amount of fluid overload at the start of therapy, but it averages two weeks  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74940" href="/z/d/graphic/74940.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Once a new steady state is reached, continued diuretic therapy will maintain the fluid loss that has been attained but will not induce further fluid or potassium loss unless the dose is increased, a second type of diuretic is added, or there is a change in HF severity or sodium intake. Thus, monitoring of serum electrolyte levels is warranted if the diuretic regimen is augmented or changes in HF severity or sodium intake are suspected. (See

         Once begun, diuretic therapy is generally continued indefinitely for fluid control unless cardiac function improves. However, the diuretic dose should be reconsidered after the patient is placed on other HF medications. Daily assessment of patient weight may be the most effective method for documenting effective diuresis [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. For accurate comparisons, daily measurements should use the same scale and should be performed at the same time each day, usually in the morning, prior to eating, and after voiding. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13607.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Long-term therapy can be facilitated by having patients record their weight each day and allowing them to make prespecified changes in dose if the weight increases or decreases beyond a specified range. Increases in body weight of more than 0.9 kg have been associated with an increased risk of HF hospitalization; these weight gains typically began at least one week before admission [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25,26
         </a>

         There is a subpopulation of stable patients with less severe HF who can be withdrawn from diuretics. This issue was directly addressed in a 12-week clinical trial of 41 patients with stable HF who had been treated with diuretics but not an ACE inhibitor [

         Diuretic-induced fluid losses decrease intravascular volume and capillary pressure, permitting mobilization of edema fluid from the interstitium. Refilling of the vasculature with interstitial fluid derived from all capillary beds takes place with a half-life of approximately 20 minutes. The net effect is that systemic hemodynamics are maintained unless the rate of diuresis is extremely rapid.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite often marked symptomatic improvement and increased exercise tolerance, the decrease in intracardiac filling pressure induced by diuresis can, by reducing ventricular preload, lower the cardiac output (by as much as 20 percent) [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28

         <a href="#rid29">
          29,30
         </a>
         ]. However, some patients initially have little or no reduction in cardiac output because they are on the flat part of the Frank-Starling curve in which changes in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure have little or no effect on cardiac performance  (

         An otherwise unexplained rise in serum creatinine, which reflects a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), is a marker of reduced tissue perfusion.
        </p>
        <p>
         A rise in serum creatinine level during therapy for HF may occur before euvolemic status is achieved; such patients have a worse prognosis. A rise in creatinine level may also reflect a rate of diuresis that exceeds the rate at which interstitial fluid can be mobilized, in which case a slower rate of diuresis may be tolerated without a rise in creatinine level. On the other hand, a stable serum creatinine level suggests that perfusion to the kidneys (and therefore to other organs) is being well maintained and that diuresis can be continued if the patient is still edematous.

         However, changes in renal perfusion are not the only determinant of changes in GFR in patients with advanced HF. Severe congestion of splanchnic veins results in increased intraabdominal pressure in 60 percent of patients admitted with advanced HF. The associated increase in renal venous pressure can reduce the GFR. Lowering initially elevated intraabdominal pressure with diuretics and other therapies has been associated with an increase in GFR, a relationship not seen with other hemodynamic variables  (

         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. In this setting, there may be an acute increase in plasma renin and norepinephrine levels, leading to arteriolar vasoconstriction and a rise in systemic blood pressure; this increase in afterload then induces a reduction in cardiac output and a transient rise in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure that can last for an hour, with possible worsening of dyspnea. Fortunately, by four hours, pulmonary capillary wedge pressures fall below prediuretic values due both to diuresis and a decrease in vasoconstrictors [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. A similar initial vasoconstrictor response has been demonstrated in patients with cirrhosis [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         It is uncertain how to reconcile these different hemodynamic effects of diuretic therapy. One possibility is that patients with chronic HF (or cirrhosis) have persistent elevations in renin and angiotensin II release (induced by decreased renal perfusion) that are associated with hyperplasia of the renin secretory apparatus. As a result, administration of a loop diuretic may lead to an exaggerated rise in renin release and systemic vasoconstriction. By comparison, the vasodilator prostaglandin response may predominate in patients with an acute myocardial infarction who do not have chronic hypersecretion of renin.

          Switch to intravenous diuresis
         </strong>
         – Patients who fail oral therapy may respond to more reliable diuretic delivery via intravenous administration by either intermittent bolus therapy or continuous intravenous infusion. Both methods of delivery appear to have similar efficacy and safety in patients with HF. The efficacy of a continuous intravenous infusion has not been evaluated in patients with refractory edema.

          Add another diuretic to the regimen
         </strong>
         – Use of a loop diuretic with another diuretic agent ("combination therapy") augments diuresis by blocking sodium reabsorption at additional sites in the nephron  (

         ). In patients with signs and symptoms of congestion who are refractory to a total daily oral dose of

         </a>
         of at least 200 mg (or its equivalent) or an intravenous dose of furosemide of at least 200 mg daily (or its equivalent), our contributors typically attempt combination diuretic therapy in patients who can be adequately monitored (see below). We suggest adding

          metolazone

         to the existing loop diuretic regimen rather than other agents  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ). However, other thiazide diuretics, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are reasonable choices for combination therapy.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In patients with a high suspicion for decreased absorption of oral diuretics, use of an intravenous rather than oral agent to augment diuresis is reasonable. In patients with persistent hypokalemia, combination therapy with a potassium-sparing diuretic (eg,

          Requirements and dosing
         </strong>
         – The requirements of combination therapy include daily monitoring of the diuretic response and electrolytes, time-limited dosing, and supervision by a provider experienced with this approach to diuresis. Due to these requirements, our experts rarely use combination therapy in outpatients for acute or chronic management of volume status.

          Dosing
         </strong>
         – The initial and maximum doses of diuretics used in combination therapy are listed in the table  (

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Some contributors to this topic typically administer a thiazide diuretic (or other agent) 30 to 60 minutes prior to administration of a bolus dose of loop diuretic to maximize the effect of combination therapy. Other contributors do not time the administration of thiazide diuretics with the administration of the loop diuretic due to the long half-lives of these agents, which lead to sustained sodium blockade. Our contributors agree that timing of the first dose is most important and that, in patients on a continuous loop diuretic infusion, a thiazide or other agent can be added at any time during the infusion.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         In patients who respond to combination therapy, subsequent doses of a nonloop diuretic are typically given daily until adequate volume reduction has been achieved or the patient has an adequate diuretic response to monotherapy with a loop diuretic.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         If after six to eight hours following the initial dose of combination diuretic therapy the rate of diuresis has not sufficiently increased, we typically double the dose of the nonloop diuretic or use an intravenous nonloop diuretic to augment diuresis. If the diuretic response remains inadequate, management is individualized and is based on the severity of congestion.

         – The use of combination diuretic therapy is based on our experience. There are no high-quality trials to suggest the superiority of one agent over another or that established the safety of combination therapy in patients who are truly refractory to loop diuretics.

Patients receiving acetazolamide had higher cumulative urine output and natriuresis, a greater incidence of successful decongestion (42.2 versus 30.5 percent), and a shorter length of stay (geometric mean 9 versus 10 days; adjusted difference 0.9 days, 95% CI 0.81-0.98). There were similar rates of death or readmission after three months (30 versus 28 percent in the control group; hazard ratio 1.1, 95% CI 0.8-1.5). The overall results were similar for patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction and HF with preserved ejection fraction, and the rate of adverse kidney events was similar between the groups.

          Goal of therapy

         – The goal of diuretic therapy is to eliminate clinical evidence of fluid retention, such as elevated jugular venous pressure and peripheral edema. This goal should be pursued while adverse effects are monitored. Persistent volume overload contributes to continued symptoms, may reduce the efficacy of drug therapy for heart failure (HF), and may be associated with increased mortality. (See

         – Intravenous diuretics (either as a bolus or a continuous infusion) are more potent than equivalent oral doses and are sometimes required for unstable or severe disease. (See
