HCT offers potential long-term survival for patients with cancers that have a high risk for relapse, for relapsed or refractory malignancies that cannot be cured using other approaches, and for certain inherited/germline conditions that affect hematopoiesis.</p><p>HCT uses chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy as conditioning therapy to reduce the burden of disease and partially or completely ablate hematopoiesis. Hematopoiesis can be restored using autologous cells (ie, the patient's own stored blood or marrow cells) or allogeneic cells (a graft from another individual). </p><p>HCT is associated with both short-term and long-term adverse effects (AEs). Short-term AEs include profound cytopenias, infections, toxic effects of the conditioning regimen, and other causes of organ damage. For patients who undergo allogeneic HCT, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which is caused by immunologic differences between the transplant recipient (ie, host) and the graft donor, can cause morbidity and transplant-related mortality. </p><p>Transplantation is also associated with important late AEs, including secondary cancers (ie, new cancers unrelated to the cause for transplantation), cardiac toxicity, endocrinopathies, and other complications. There is an increase in solid tumors, myeloid malignancies, and lymphoid cancers in the years following HCT. The latency (time until manifestation) of secondary cancers varies with the type of cancer. The increased incidence of secondary cancers is associated with age, aspects of the transplantation technique, GVHD, and other factors. </p><p>Transplant recipients should adopt behaviors to lessen cancer risk and have lifelong screening for secondary cancers. </p><p>This topic reviews secondary cancers after HCT.</p><p>Other late AEs associated with HCT are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14228.html" rel="external">"Long-term care of the adult hematopoietic cell transplantation survivor"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">GENERAL OBSERVATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who undergo HCT are at an increased risk for developing secondary cancers (ie, cancers that are distinct from the condition for which they underwent transplantation). </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Magnitude of risk</strong> – Compared with the general population, secondary cancers occur at least twice as frequently in patients who undergo HCT. Secondary cancers can arise after either autologous HCT (in which the patient’s own stem and progenitor cells are used to restore hematopoiesis) or allogeneic HCT (in which the hematopoietic graft is provided by another individual). (See <a class="local">'Aspects of transplantation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Types of secondary cancers</strong> – The most common secondary cancers are various solid tumors, myeloid malignancies, and lymphoid proliferations. Secondary solid tumors and myeloid malignancies generally arise years after HCT, while post-transplant proliferative disorder generally occurs within the first year. (See <a class="local">'Types of second cancers'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Source of malignant cells in second cancers</strong> – Most secondary cancers are derived from the host (ie, transplant recipient) cells. An important exception is post-lymphoproliferative disease, in which the malignancy arises in cells from the transplant donor. (See <a class="local">'Donor-derived tumors'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Secondary cancers are a significant contributor to nonrelapse mortality (NRM) after HCT, but NRM has decreased significantly over recent decades. Estimated one-year NRM was 30 percent in the 1980s, 24 percent in the 1990s, 15 percent in the 2000s, and 12 percent in the 2010s [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Reduced NRM is related to improving supportive care and evolving transplantation technique. However, it is uncertain how newer transplantation techniques, such as nonmyeloablative conditioning or alternative graft donor sources, will affect rates of secondary cancers because there are fewer long-term outcomes data with their use. </p><p>HCT survivors are also at risk for other late adverse effects, such as cardiac toxicity, endocrinopathies, and other long-term complications, as described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/122403.html" rel="external">"Survival, quality of life, and late complications after hematopoietic cell transplantation in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1962524811"><span class="h1">RISK FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Increased risk for secondary cancers is associated with various aspects of transplantation and certain patient characteristics. However, it is difficult to define the risk for a specific individual and to quantify the risk attributable to host factors, the underlying disease, and prior treatments because of the complex clinical history of many transplantation survivors. </p><p>Factors that are associated with an increased risk for secondary cancers include [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Aspects of transplantation</strong> – Type and intensity of the conditioning regimen, graft source, post-HCT maintenance therapy</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Graft-versus-host disease</strong> – Graft-versus-host disease<strong> </strong>(GVHD) and its management; this is relevant only for patients who undergo allogeneic HCT</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Patient/disease factors</strong> – Age at transplantation, current age, underlying disease, lifestyle-related behaviors (eg, smoking, sun exposure)</p><p></p><p>In addition, some patients have a predisposition toward developing secondary malignancies due to inherited/germline gene variants (mutations) for which they are transplanted (eg, Fanconi anemia [FA]).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3992184318"><span class="h2">Aspects of transplantation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Aspects of the transplantation technique itself contribute to the development of secondary cancers after HCT.</p><p></p><p>It is uncertain how much the transplant procedure itself contributes relative to previous treatments. Studies that attempted to parse the risk attributable to HCT versus prior therapy reported mixed results and variable effects. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In one study, there was no difference in the incidence of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MNs; ie, myelodysplastic syndromes/neoplasms [MDS] and acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) in patients who underwent HCT for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) compared with matched nontransplanted patients [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A study of aplastic anemia (AA) that included 748 patients who underwent HCT and 860 who were treated with immunosuppressive therapy (IST) reported the 10-year cumulative risk of secondary cancers was 3.1 percent with HCT and 18.8 percent with IST [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. The distribution of tumors was different in those groups. Although the risk for solid tumors was the same in the two groups, solid tumors accounted for most secondary cancers after HCT, while t-MNs were more common after IST. The major risk factors for malignancy after HCT were increasing age and the use of radiation therapy (RT) in the conditioning regimen.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>One study reported that the risk factors for secondary t-MNs were similar to those associated with difficulty obtaining an adequate stem-cell harvest for autologous HCT; some may interpret this as evidence of an underlying cause for t-MNs that is distinct from the transplant procedure itself. Secondary MDS/AML arose in 6.8 percent of transplanted patients after 10 years, and multivariable analysis reported that prior exposure to RT, ≥4 chemotherapy regimens, and &gt;5 days of apheresis to harvest sufficient hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells were independent risk factors for these secondary cancers [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. </p><p></p><p>Potential contribution of prior therapies to secondary cancer risk are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Underlying disease'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3681451939"><span class="h3">Conditioning regimen</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Conditioning therapy uses varying doses of chemotherapy and/or RT to reduce the burden of disease and enable engraftment of transplanted hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. </p><p>Conditioning regimens are described as myeloablative conditioning (MAC), reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC), or nonmyeloablative (NMA) conditioning, depending on the intensity. It is uncertain if either RIC or NMA conditioning is associated with a lower incidence of secondary cancers than MAC in part because there is less long-term follow-up with those techniques. One study attempted to address this and found that after adjustment for other risk factors, there was no difference in cancer risks between RIC/NMA and MAC in leukemia/MDS patients (hazard ratio [HR] 0.98, P = 0.91), but in lymphoma patients, risks were lower in the RIC/NMA group (HR 0.51, P = 0.5) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Further research is needed to more accurately address this issue. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Radiation therapy</strong> – Inclusion of RT in the conditioning regimen is considered an adverse risk factor for secondary cancers after HCT. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In a large registry study, patients who received RT as a component of conditioning therapy had a significantly higher risk of a secondary invasive solid cancer compared with nonirradiated patients (observed/expected [O/E] ratio 2.7 versus 1.3) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Children who received RT at age ≤10 years had a particularly high risk for an invasive solid tumor (O/E ratio 55); the risk remained elevated (O/E ratio 4 to 6) for RT given at age 10 to 29 years, but there was no excess risk evident for those who received RT-based conditioning at ≥30 years [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Total body irradiation</strong> – Results have been mixed in studies that assessed risk for secondary cancers when total body irradiation (TBI) is administered. Some studies identified an increased risk from TBI, while others found no such association [<a href="#rid9">9-22</a>]. As above, other factors (age, primary disease, and intensity of prior therapies) likely also factor into the risk for secondary cancers in this setting.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Age at transplantation</strong> – The risk of RT is greater for younger patients than for older patients [<a href="#rid8">8,23</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">In one study, among patients irradiated at age &lt;30 years, the relative risk (RR) of nonsquamous cell cancer was nine times that of nonirradiated patients; by contrast, the risk for patients who received RT at age ≥30 years was just 1.1-fold [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Chemotherapy</strong> – Incorporation of certain chemotherapy agents into conditioning therapy may affect the risk for secondary cancers. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Among 4318 patients who underwent allogeneic HCT for AML, conditioning with busulfan-cyclophosphamide was associated with a 1.4-fold increased risk compared with the general population [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Inclusion of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8430" href="/z/d/drug information/8430.html" rel="external">etoposide</a> in the conditioning regimen was not associated with an increased risk for secondary cancers in pediatric patients who underwent autologous HCT [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1159733623"><span class="h3">Graft</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The graft source, degree of immunologic mismatch, and ex vivo manipulation of the graft may contribute to the risk for secondary cancers, but the extent of these effects is not well defined.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Graft source</strong> – Hematopoietic grafts can be obtained from peripheral blood, bone marrow, or umbilical cord blood (UCB). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Peripheral blood versus marrow grafts</strong> – The incidence of t-MNs is higher in patients who received peripheral blood grafts compared with bone marrow grafts. In a single-institution study, there were 36 cases of MDS or AML among 3372 patients who underwent autologous HCT; compared with bone marrow grafts, the RR for peripheral blood grafts was 3.1 (95% CI 1.3-7.1) [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Other studies also reported that the incidence of t-MNs was similar with peripheral blood and bone marrow grafts [<a href="#rid10">10,20,22,27</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Umbilical cord blood grafts</strong> – UCB grafts are associated with an increased risk for certain secondary cancers. However, an accurate assessment of the risk is limited by the small size and relatively short follow-up of most studies. As an example, among 98 adult patients who received UCB grafts, the cumulative incidence of second cancers was 19 percent at two years; post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) were the most common type of second cancer [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Human leukocyte antigen match</strong> – There is no clear evidence that the degree of immunologic match at human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci between the graft donor and the transplant recipient affects the risk for secondary cancers after allogeneic HCT. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Grafts can be HLA matched (eg, 8 of 8 or 10 of 10 HLA loci), HLA mismatched (eg, 7 of 8 or 9 of 10 HLA loci), or haploidentical (ie, a graft from a parent or child of the transplant recipient). HLA-matched grafts can come from matched sibling donors (MSD) or matched unrelated donors (MUD); HLA-mismatched grafts can come from unrelated donors, haploidentical relatives, or UCB. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3535.html" rel="external">"Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) study of 1036 recipients who survived &gt;5 years after transplantation did not find donor-recipient histocompatibility to be a significant risk factor for the development of secondary cancers [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A comparison of 355 MSD and 108 MUD recipients who survived &gt;2 years after transplantation found no effect of donor source on secondary cancer risk [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A small percentage of secondary solid tumors and t-MNs are of donor cell origin. An EBMT study of 10,489 allogeneic transplants (1975 to 1998) found 14 cases of donor cell leukemia; 12 were from MSD and 2 were from MUD [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. However, the small sample size and limited number of unrelated donor grafts limit conclusions regarding the RR for secondary donor-derived cancers. (See <a class="local">'Donor-derived tumors'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Graft manipulation</strong> – Ex vivo T cell depletion has been associated with an increased risk for PTLD. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The cancer risk associated with T cell depletion appears to be especially elevated when antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8725" href="/z/d/drug information/8725.html" rel="external">alemtuzumab</a> was used in the conditioning regimen, but there was no difference between MSD versus MUD products [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H583184119"><span class="h3">Post-transplant maintenance therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The risk of secondary cancers is increased when <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9822" href="/z/d/drug information/9822.html" rel="external">lenalidomide</a> maintenance is used for multiple myeloma (MM).
