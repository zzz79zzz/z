         According to the World Health Organization, more than 5 million snakebites occur worldwide each year, resulting in approximately 2.5 million envenomations and 81,000 to 138,000 deaths [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Because most venomous snakebites occur in developing countries with poorly developed health reporting systems and because many deaths occur before medical care can be provided, these numbers are likely underestimates [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Regions with the highest incidence of venomous snakebites and snakebite deaths include Southeast and South Asia (eg, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh), sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88754" href="/z/d/graphic/88754.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2,4-9
         </a>
         ]. In many of these regions, access to health care and timely administration of antivenom is limited. In an observational study that mapped dangerous venomous snakes against human populations, access to health care for those populations, and availability of appropriate antivenoms, large parts of sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia are particularly vulnerable [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. There are 93 million people in the highest risk areas, but many more at risk overall (eg, the population of India exceeds 1.3 billion with an estimated annual mortality from snakebites exceeding 45,000) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In an effort to draw attention to the problem of venomous snakebites worldwide and to spur strategies that improve outcomes, the World Health Organization has designated snakebite envenomation as a neglected tropical disease [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. The goal of the WHO designation is to raise awareness aiming to increase the availability of safe, universally available antivenoms for populations that are most affected worldwide although antivenom is only one component of snakebite treatment [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Snakebites disproportionately affect poorer populations in rural areas [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,14
         </a>
         ]. Two common patterns are described [

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The risk of snakebite also increases during the rainy season and after floods due to displacement of snakes from their burrows [

         Most venomous snakes routinely dangerous for humans belong to one of two families, Elapidae and Viperidae [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,17
         </a>
         ]. However, the "classic" literature suggesting that elapids cause neurotoxic effects and vipers cause local and hemorrhagic effects is misleading and inaccurate. A number of Elapid snakes cause predominantly local effects, rather than systemic effects (typically the "spitting" cobras), while others cause predominantly coagulopathic rather than neurotoxic systemic effects (eg, Australian brown snakes). Similarly, some Viperid snakes cause minimal local effects and predominantly systemic effects, including paralysis, coagulopathy, and/or rhabdomyolysis (eg, South American rattlesnakes).

         Physical characteristics that, with some exceptions, distinguish these snakes from members of the Viperidae family include shorter fangs (compared with body size), a less triangular head with a more subtle transition from head to body (but with exceptions, such as Australian death adders), and a larger scale pattern on the head. The way fangs attach to the bone is different in Elapid snakes, compared with Viperid snakes; specifically, the fangs have minimal or no capacity to rotate, unlike Viperid snakes, which can rotate the fang, folding it against the roof of the mouth, thus enabling development of significantly longer fangs, compared with body size, than found in Elapid snakes.

         Envenomation from many but not all of these snakes can frequently cause flaccid paralysis. However, bites from individual species may also cause local tissue toxicity, tissue necrosis, coagulopathy, hemorrhage, rhabdomyolysis, hypotension, or acute kidney injury (AKI).

         Snake venom is a complex mixture of toxins used primarily to immobilize and sometimes initiate digestion of prey and secondarily to ward off predators [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,17,22
         </a>
         ]. Composition of venom varies greatly from one species to another. Within a species the composition can also differ, sometimes according to age of the snake or the geographic location [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. This venom variability can be important in selecting an appropriate antivenom (eg, for Russell's vipers or saw-scaled vipers).

         The identified components and physiologic sites of action for snake venom determine the spectrum of clinical features commonly seen after snakebite as follows  (

         Swelling, blistering, ecchymosis, tissue necrosis, and pain indicate the presence of these proteolytic enzymes in the venom and are commonly seen after snakebites by many, but not all Viperid snakes. Local effects are minimal or absent after bites of many elapid snakes (eg, kraits, some mambas, or death adder). However, other elapid snakes can cause serious tissue necrosis (eg, some African and Asian cobras).

         and damage the terminal axon at the NMJ, through entry into the cell. This type of paralysis, once established, is not reversible with antivenom or anticholinesterase and may take days to weeks for recovery of function as the axon regenerates. Examples of snakes with venom active at the presynaptic NMJ include kraits and many Australian snakes.

This type of paralysis can sometimes be fully reversed with antivenom, or the neuromuscular block overcome with anticholinesterases (eg,

Rhabdomyolysis may occur from enzymatic tissue damage adjacent to the bite wound and, or by actions of systemic venom myotoxins on skeletal muscle (notably some Australian snakes, sea snakes, some kraits, South American rattlesnakes, Sri Lankan Russell's viper). Secondary hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury (AKI) can occur if muscle damage is extensive and may lead to secondary cardiotoxicity.

          Systemic hemostasis toxins
         </strong>
         – These common snake venom toxins represent a vast array of molecular types, mechanisms and targets. The common theme is interference with blood clotting, usually by increasing bleeding tendency, with resulting consumptive coagulopathy and hemorrhage. The coagulopathy can usually be reversed by timely administration of antivenom, though there is often a delay in return to normal hemostasis while normal coagulation factors are replenished.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Less commonly, clotting and thrombosis may be promoted (eg, Martinique viper venom) and cause deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, and cerebral infarction.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         There are also toxins within this broad group that damage blood vessels, often a synergistic action which, combined with other toxins reducing clotting function, can cause significant hemorrhagic disease. Toxins targeting the coagulation cascade include factor X, IX, and V activators; procoagulants that activate factor II (prothrombin); and direct and indirect fibrinogenolytics or fibrinogenases. There are also toxins causing direct inhibition of parts of the coagulation system (anticoagulants), and toxins either inhibiting or stimulating platelet activation directly or through action on elements, such as Von Willebrand factor. The hemorrhagins target blood vessel walls and are predominantly zinc metalloproteinases.

         A wide variety of methods to determine venom potency have been developed using in vivo and in vitro methods [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Median lethal dose in a live mouse (LD50) is a commonly used measure [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,22
         </a>
         ]. Based upon this approach, several types of elapid venoms appear to be most potent. However, the clinical severity of a bite depends upon several factors other than venom potency such as the amount of venom injected and the site of the bite (eg, extremity, trunk, or head).
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, many factors can influence LD50 measurements, including how the venom is collected, stored, reconstituted and injected. Thus, conflicting results appear in the literature, with major differences between research groups. Venom potency (LD50) should be placed in a "real-world" perspective [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,22
         </a>
         ]. As an example, the saw scaled viper (
         <em>
          Echis
         </em>
         species) has venom that ranks well down the list in potency. However, because of the coagulopathy that this venom creates in humans and poor access to quality health care that at-risk populations for this envenomation endure, more snakebite mortality and morbidity are anecdotally attributed to
         <em>
          Echis
         </em>
         species than any other group of snakes.
        </p>
        <p>
         By contrast, the snake with arguably the most potent venom, the inland taipan (
         <em>
          Oxyuranus microlepidotus
         </em>
         ), has not been recorded as causing any human fatalities, because it is rarely encountered and bites generally occur in keepers with ready access to high quality and effective care, including antivenom.

Patients bitten in this way may present with paralysis and/or coagulopathy as the first sign of envenomation. This scenario is common for snakebites by nocturnal species (eg, kraits), which frequently happen to people sleeping on the ground in rural tropical areas. Subsequently, victims may develop progressive paralysis without any history of snake bite.
        </p>
        <p>
         Similarly, victims of highly toxic snakes, especially children, may present with cardiovascular collapse or seizures without any reported snakebite.
        </p>
        <p>
         Symptoms of snakebite can be nonspecific and frequently may be difficult to differentiate from manifestations of anxiety and emotional disturbance caused by the bite. However, findings such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and headache may be the first symptoms of systemic envenomation and warrant close assessment for the other clinical syndromes associated with snake envenomation  (

         ]. Syncope, diarrhea, and, especially in children, seizures may also occur, but less commonly.
        </p>
        <p>
         Symptoms also vary according to the venom characteristics of the biting snake. For example, victims bitten by neurotoxic snakes may report weakness, paralysis, diplopia, or difficulty speaking or swallowing. Taste or smell may be impaired. In addition to local pain and swelling, patients with systemic envenomation by some viper species (eg, North American rattlesnake) may describe a metallic taste in their mouth. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         All patients with a potentially toxic snakebite warrant frequent measurement of vital signs and, if available, continuous cardio-respiratory and pulse oximetry monitoring. For many species additional monitoring should be performed based upon expected toxicity and may include checking for ptosis and partial ophthalmoplegia (neurotoxic snakes) or persistent oozing from any wounds or gums (venom-induced coagulopathy). For some snake species, primary or secondary acute kidney injury (AKI) is a significant risk; monitoring urine output and quality (eg, albuminuria as early evidence of developing AKI) may facilitate early detection of impending renal problems.

         There is considerable variation in the local effects of snake venom. With certain species, such as kraits, Asian coral snakes, South American rattlesnakes, some non-spitting cobras, death adders, mambas, taipans, tiger snakes, and brown snakes, little local necrosis or pain may occur. Thus, fang marks may easily be missed. In situations where the snakebite was not felt or observed, the diagnosis may be called into question until the wound is found or the systemic effects recognized as common to snake species in the region. For these snakes, it is possible for the patient to be unaware they have been bitten, so they may present with nonspecific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or headache that may not give rise to snakebite as a possible diagnosis. Young children may present after playing unsupervised and have irritability, occasionally followed by collapse and/or convulsions.
        </p>
        <p>
         By contrast, many cobras (notably spitting cobras) and vipers frequently cause an immediate onset of pain followed by extensive local tissue effects or destruction that makes recognition of the wound site straightforward.

         Tachycardia and findings of shock, including hypotension and/or poor tissue perfusion (eg, prolonged capillary refill time, altered mental status, and decreased urine output) frequently accompany snakebite, especially by species causing major local effects. Causes include venom-induced vasodilation, direct myocardial depression, and/or hypovolemia from bleeding or "third spacing" of fluids into the bitten limb. If available, central venous pressure monitoring may be warranted to guide management. (See

         Although uncommon with snakebite, compartment syndrome may occur if marked extremity swelling or direct envenomation of a muscle compartment occurs. Findings of compartment syndrome can significantly overlap with local and systemic effects of snake venom. When suspected, direct compartment measurement should be performed to confirm dangerously elevated pressures, before proceeding to any consideration of surgical intervention. (See

         The target for most snake neurotoxins is the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Cranial nerve effects (eg, ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, pupillary dilation, or difficulty with swallowing or speaking) are generally observed first. More generalized muscle weakness or respiratory failure may be delayed by many hours, although paralysis can develop within the first few hours in some severe cases [

         Victims of snakebite where neurotoxicity may be possible warrant frequent, serial observations that assess the patients’ airway and breathing, in addition to frequent evaluation for early signs of developing neurotoxicity (eg, ptosis or partial ophthalmoplegia). Cyanosis, combativeness, and confusion can indicate serious hypoxia warranting immediate attention.

          neostigmine

         ) can identify whether paralysis is due to snakes with purely or predominantly post-synaptic venom effects (eg, cobras, some coral snakes). In addition, some Australian snakes, such as death adders, brown snakes, and copperheads, though possessing presynaptic neurotoxins, may in some cases show predominantly postsynaptic paralysis [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26-35
         </a>
         ]. When associated with significant improvement, anticholinesterases can also provide treatment for paralysis when administration of antivenom is delayed or antivenom is in low supply or not available. Thus, the utility of administration of anticholinesterases depends upon a knowledge of the common snakes in the region, the severity of envenomation and paralysis, and availability of supportive treatment. It is not without risk and should be performed with appropriate medical supervision. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/93182.html" rel="external">

         However, for snakes with predominant presynaptic neurotoxicity, it is quite unlikely that anticholinesterase therapy will be of benefit. Thus, for these snakes, use of

         Signs of overt bleeding should be sought following a snake bite. Low-grade bleeding from gums, oozing from needle puncture sites, and epistaxis are common. Hematemesis and hematochezia may also be present. Signs of hemorrhage into internal organs may occur as well. For example, stroke resulting primarily from intracranial hemorrhage complicated

          Calloselasma rhodostoma
         </em>

         The 20 minute whole blood clotting test (20WBCT) has also been considered a useful bedside screening test when more formal coagulation testing is not available; failure of the blood to clot in a clean glass tube after 20 minutes has been considered evidence of severe hypofibrinogenemia [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         However, in one series of 140 patients with Russell's viper envenomation, the sensitivity of the 20WBCT for an international normalized ratio of &gt;1.5 was only 40 percent, regardless of the severity of the coagulopathy, and use of the 20WBCT was associated with a delay in antivenom administration [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. On the other hand, the 20WBCT had a specificity of 100 percent in this study. Thus, a positive 20WBCT is a reasonable indication for antivenom administration, but a negative 20WBCT does
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         mean that antivenom should be withheld, especially if other clinical findings of coagulopathy (eg, blood oozing at puncture sites, bleeding gums, or epistaxis) are present. Furthermore, if more formal coagulation tests are available, they should be used in preference to the 20WBCT.

As an example, in an observational study of 15 Australian patients with snakebite that compared POC INR with conventional coagulation studies, measurement of INR by a POC device gave a false negative result in three of seven patients with venom-induced coagulopathy and one patient with anticoagulant induced coagulopathy and a false positive result in one of seven patients without coagulopathy [

         In Australia and New Guinea, swabs, ideally from an expressed and unwashed bite site, or urine can undergo snake venom detection using a commercially available immunosorbent assay [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17,42
         </a>
         ]. Results need to be interpreted based upon the clinical setting. A positive result confirms the snakebite and identifies the most appropriate antivenom to be used but is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         , by itself, an indication for antivenom administration in otherwise asymptomatic patients. The assay is highly dependent upon the specimen and how it was obtained and can have low sensitivity. Thus, a negative assay does
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         rule out snakebite.
        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with systemic envenoming, where antivenom is indicated, it is advisable to compare the venom detection result with a venom immunotype determined by diagnostic algorithms for Australian snakes; if the two routes provide a similar answer, an appropriate specific antivenom can be used with confidence, but if each route gives a different answer, expert advice should be sought from a clinical toxinologist, or if that will entail an unacceptable delay in treatment, polyvalent antivenom should be used.
        </p>
        <p>
         When performing the test, carefully read the manufacturer's instructions. Although the manufacturer provides instructions for testing of blood, the results are typically unreliable and, whenever possible, swabs from the bite site or urine should be used [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42

         </span>
         In some patients, diagnosis of snakebite is straightforward because the bite is immediately felt and a snake is seen, but often a snake is not reliably witnessed and at least for some snake species, the act of biting may cause minor effects to the human victim and may go unnoticed. However, depending upon the region, snakebite should remain in the differential diagnosis of abrupt onset of paralysis, coagulopathy, myolysis, renal failure, collapse, and, especially in children, seizures, syncope, or cardiovascular collapse.
        </p>
        <p>
         The effects of snake venom can be divided into distinct syndromes, which may vary in severity depending upon the species of snake  (

As an example, in Papua New Guinea, envenomation from the death adder rarely causes a significant coagulopathy in contrast to taipan snakebites. In some regions, such as Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and Australia, there are diagnostic algorithms that may assist in determining the most likely type of snake in patients based upon local and systemic findings  (

         In many patients the diagnosis of snakebite is obvious based upon clinical findings. However, sudden collapse, seizure, syncope, unexplained coagulopathy/bleeding, developing descending flaccid paralysis, rhabdomyolysis, or renal failure should raise the possibility of snakebite within a wider set of differential diagnoses. In addition, a patient stating that they have suffered a snakebite may potentially present with clinical features that could have other etiologies that might become apparent by detailed history taking.
        </p>

         The differential diagnosis varies according to the primary clinical features snakebite victims might develop:

          Rhabdomyolysis
         </strong>
         – Rhabdomyolysis may be caused by other disease states. The causes of rhabdomyolysis can be broadly divided into three categories: traumatic or muscle compression (eg, crush syndrome or prolonged immobilization), nontraumatic exertional (eg, marked exercise, hyperthermia, or metabolic myopathies), and nontraumatic nonexertional (eg, drugs or toxins, such as snake venoms, infections, or electrolyte disorders). In most instances, rhabdomyolysis caused by snake bite is associated with pain and sometimes local swelling and thus is readily distinguished from other causes. The causes of rhabdomyolysis and its diagnosis are discussed in detail separately. (See

         <strong>
          Coagulopathy
         </strong>
         – Consumptive coagulopathy with bleeding is a common feature of bites by many snake species and, given the effect of snake venoms on multiple pathways, is characterized by prolongation of both prothrombin (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTT) in association with decreased fibrinogen. Such primary consumptive coagulopathy is not generally a feature of other types of envenoming, except for South American
         <em>
          Lonomia
         </em>
         caterpillars, skin contact with which can cause a profound and potentially fatal coagulopathy similar to snakebite (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15884.html" rel="external">
          "Lepidopterism: Skin disorders secondary to caterpillars and moths", section on 'Lonomism'
         </a>
         ). A number of other types of envenoming can cause major systemic illness, with intravascular hemolysis, multi-organ failure and secondary disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), in some ways similar to sepsis, but rather distinct from the primary coagulopathy caused by some snakes.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Sepsis, multiple trauma, obstetrical complications, or malignancy may present with similar hematologic features as snake envenomation but are readily distinguished by clinical findings (eg, the presence of fever and signs of infection [eg, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and/or petechiae] in patients with sepsis, evidence of multiple trauma, or known or suspected malignancy). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1306.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Bleeding may also be caused by a wide array of other disease states, including hereditary abnormalities of the hemostasis system (such as hemophilia or Von Willebrand disease). Of note, mild variants of such congenital abnormalities are an important underlying cause for unexplained, but minor changes in coagulation tests in a snakebite patient who otherwise shows no evidence of significant envenoming. In many instances, a careful history and physical examination and more rigorous laboratory testing can define the underlying cause. (See

          Venom properties and clinical manifestations
         </strong>
         – The identified components and physiologic sites of action for snake venom determine the spectrum of clinical features commonly seen after snakebite. Diagnostic testing is based upon clinical findings and targeted towards the expected spectrum of toxicity from snakebites within the specific region. Major clinical manifestations are provided in the table  (

         <strong>
          History
         </strong>
         – In many cases, the bite is immediately felt and the snake readily identified. However, some snakes, especially elapids, cause limited to no local pain or tissue necrosis when injecting venom. Patients bitten in this way may present with paralysis and/or coagulopathy as the first sign of envenomation with no history of snakebite. This scenario is common for snakebites by nocturnal species (eg, kraits) in rural tropical regions. Similarly, victims of highly toxic snakes, especially children, may present with cardiovascular collapse or seizures without any reported snakebite. (See
         <a class="local">
          'History'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Physical examination
         </strong>
         – Physical findings of snakebite vary significantly by species and often evolve over time  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73959" href="/z/d/graphic/73959.html" rel="external">
          table 7
         </a>
         ). Frequent, repeated examinations are important to ensure detection of all signs of snake envenomation and to identify serious local or systemic effects. All patients with a potentially toxic snakebite warrant frequent measurement of vital signs and, if available, continuous cardio-respiratory and pulse oximetry monitoring. For many species additional monitoring may include checking for ptosis, partial ophthalmoplegia, or persistent oozing from any wounds or gums. A fluid balance chart should also be maintained. (See

         <strong>
          Coagulation studies
         </strong>
         – When assessing for coagulopathy in snakebite victims, traditional coagulation studies (ie, D-dimer or fibrin degradation products, complete blood count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and international normalized ratio) are preferred to the whole blood clotting test whenever possible. Point of care coagulation tests should
         <strong>

         be used. (See

         – Administration of anticholinesterases (eg,

          neostigmine
         </a>
         ) can identify whether paralysis is due to snakes with purely or predominantly post-synaptic neurotoxic venom effects. When associated with significant improvement, anticholinesterases can also provide treatment for paralysis when administration of antivenom is delayed or antivenom is in low supply or not available. Precautions and dosing of anticholinesterases for an edrophonium (Tensilon) or neostigmine test are provided. (See

          Venom identification

         – In Australia and New Guinea, swabs from an expressed and unwashed bite site, or urine samples can provide snake venom detection using a commercially available immunosorbent assay. Results need to be interpreted based upon the clinical setting. (See

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – In some patients, diagnosis of snakebite is straightforward based upon clinical grounds because the bite is immediately felt and a snake is seen. However, often a snake is not reliably witnessed and at least for some snake species, the act of biting may cause minor effects to the human victim and may go unnoticed. Thus, depending upon the region, snakebite should remain in the differential diagnosis of abrupt onset of paralysis, coagulopathy, myolysis, renal failure, collapse, and, especially in children, seizures, syncope, or cardiovascular collapse. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnosis'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">
          'Differential diagnosis'

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In some regions, such as Sri Lanka and Australia, there are diagnostic algorithms that may assist in determining the most likely type of snake based upon local and systemic findings  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93179" href="/z/d/graphic/93179.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         and
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93180 graphicRef93181" href="/z/d/graphic/93180.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 2A-B
         </a>
         ). (See
         <a class="local">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Severe envenomation is suggested by confirmation of a bite from a dangerous snake (digital photograph or verified snake specimen), rapidly progressive local effects (swelling, blistering, or bruising), signs of coagulopathy (oozing of blood from the bite site, phlebotomy sites, or gums), and other findings of systemic envenomation including lethargy, nausea, vomiting, headache, epistaxis, weakness, sudden collapse, seizures, or evidence of rhabdomyolysis.
