         Health care-associated meningitis and ventriculitis can occur as a complication of neurosurgery, placement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt or external ventricular drain (EVD), intrathecal pump, or deep brain stimulator, and less frequently, following dural puncture. Early recognition and treatment are crucial to reduce morbidity and long-term complications.
        </p>
        <p>
         Meningitis and ventriculitis can occur on a continuum and often do in patients with health care-associated infection, particularly in those who have undergone neurosurgical procedures or have an indwelling ventricular device.
        </p>
        <p>
         The epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of health care-associated meningitis and ventriculitis are reviewed in this topic. Treatment and prognosis of health care-associated meningitis and ventriculitis are discussed elsewhere. (See

         Overall, health care-associated meningitis and ventriculitis are uncommon infections and occur primarily as a complication of a neurosurgical procedure or central nervous system (CNS) device. As an example, in a study from Turkey, health care-associated meningitis occurred in 0.3 percent of all admissions and accounted for only 0.5 percent of all health care-associated infections over an eight-year period [
         <a href="#rid1">

         Meningitis and ventriculitis complicate fewer than 5 percent of craniotomies. In one large series of 1587 patients who underwent cranial operations, only 14 (0.8 percent) were complicated by CNS infection [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Factors associated with an increased risk of postoperative infection include surgery for tumor resection (especially resection of recurrent gliomas), surgical procedures traversing areas of high bacterial colonization (such as the paranasal sinuses), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, and concomitant infection outside the CNS [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Craniotomy can also be complicated by bone-flap infection, epidural or brain abscess, or subdural empyema. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1297.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Endoscopic endonasal surgery accesses the skull base through the nose or sinuses, thereby obviating a craniotomy or facial incision; it is associated with a low rate of postoperative meningitis (1.8 percent in one series at a center that used preoperative prophylaxis) [

          External ventricular drain (EVD)
         </strong>
         – The reported rates of infection associated with EVDs, also known as ventriculostomy catheters, are variable. In a systematic review of 23 studies that included 5733 EVD placements, the rate of a positive CSF culture ranged from 2.3 to 23 percent, with an average pooled rate of 8.8 percent [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Among a subset of studies using a more stringent definition of infection (eg, positive CSF cultures in the absence of both clinical changes and CSF pleocytosis were not counted as infection), the rate was 6.6 percent. However, in another systematic review of 42 studies that included 3035 patients with an EVD, the average rate of drain-associated ventriculitis (which also included culture negative cases) was 23 percent [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. These differences in reported rates may be related to definition of infection, underlying patient populations, and differences in catheter management across studies.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Features associated with an increased risk of EVD include intraventricular or subarachnoid hemorrhage, history of cranial fracture with CSF leak, history of craniotomy, irrigation of the EVD, concomitant systemic infections, and duration of catheterization [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6

         The incidence of health care-associated meningitis following lumbar puncture (LP) is extremely low. In one study of almost 2 million instances of spinal or epidural anesthesia, the rate of meningitis was approximately 1 in 50,000 [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Women in labor and immunocompromised patients who have an increased risk of bacteremia may be at increased risk of health care-associated meningitis following dural puncture [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Few of the reported cases of meningitis following dural puncture have been fatal, suggesting that meningitis in this setting may be less severe than community-acquired meningitis, may be caused by less virulent organisms, or may be recognized and treated earlier [
         <a href="#rid10">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The risk of infection with indwelling lumbar catheters is higher than with LP alone but is also relatively low, especially if catheter care minimizes instrumentation of the closed drainage system and limits duration. In one study of 233 patients with external lumbar catheter for normal pressure hydrocephalus, only two (0.8 percent) developed meningitis [

          Intracranial pressure monitor
         </strong>
         – An intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor may be placed within the subdural space, parenchyma, or ventricle to provide a quantitative measure of ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure following open- or closed-head injury or neurosurgery. Central nervous system (CNS) infection occurs as a complication of ICP monitor placement in 2.9 to 10.3 percent of patients [

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Risk factors for infection include placement following open-head injury or intraparenchymal hemorrhage, placement in the intraventricular space, CSF leak, concomitant infection outside the CNS, and placement of the monitor for more than five days [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13
         </a>
         ]. Unlike the increased rate of CNS infection seen with placement of a CSF shunt by less-experienced surgeons, CNS infection rates following ICP monitor placement are similar when a neurosurgeon, general surgeon, or midlevel practitioner has performed the procedure [

          Deep-brain stimulators
         </strong>
         – Deep-brain stimulators are used for treatment of a variety of movement disorders. Infections complicate 0 to 15 percent of deep-brain stimulator placement surgery [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15-18
         </a>

          Ommaya reservoirs
         </strong>
         – Ommaya reservoirs permit direct instillation of medications into the subarachnoid space, resulting in higher and more consistent concentrations for the treatment of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, pain, and chronic or recurrent CNS infection [

         Although no study has directly demonstrated that a lumbar puncture (LP) needle can introduce skin flora into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), several pieces of evidence support this mechanism. Clusters of meningitis cases occurring after LP or placement of an epidural catheter performed by the same operator suggest that organisms may be introduced through disruption of sterile technique [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. Bacterial cultures of the skin surrounding puncture sites have detected streptococci and other bacteria, supporting the hypothesis that patients who develop meningitis following dural puncture acquire the organism from skin flora introduced with the spinal needle [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. In addition, culture of spinal needles immediately after dural puncture revealed bacterial contamination in 17.9 percent of the needles, mostly by coagulase-negative staphylococci (87.5 percent) [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Droplet transmission (eg, from the upper airways of the operator) as a potential but likely rare cause of health care-associated meningitis is supported by a study that used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to match isolates of
         <em>
          Streptococcus salivarius

         The diagnosis of meningitis, regardless of whether it is community- or health care-associated, predominantly relies upon examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). For health care-associated meningitis and ventriculitis, CSF culture is the most important diagnostic test, although the diagnosis depends on a constellation of findings.

         </span>
         Among patients who have undergone a recent neurosurgical procedure or have an indwelling central nervous system (CNS) device, the possibility of meningitis or ventriculitis should be suspected in the setting of new fever or leukocytosis with new headache, meningeal signs, focal neurologic defects, seizures, or worsening mental status. It should also be suspected in patients who have erythema, tenderness, or drainage at the site of a craniotomy incision or CNS device placement (eg, external ventricular drain [EVD], intracranial pressure monitor). (See
         <a class="local">

        </p>
        <p>
         A low threshold for suspicion is warranted when considering the possibility of health care-associated meningitis and ventriculitis in a neurosurgical patient. Recognition can be challenging for various reasons. Many patients do not present with the full constellation of typical findings. Obtaining an accurate history and review of symptoms may be limited in patients with impaired consciousness. Changes in underlying neurologic deficits may be difficult to assess. Symptoms of systemic infection (eg, fever, leukocytosis, confusion) might be attributed to common postoperative infections, which can co-occur with meningitis.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, health care-associated meningitis and ventriculitis rarely occur in the absence of head trauma, neurosurgical or invasive neurological procedure (including lumbar puncture [LP]), or immunosuppression. Thus, performing LP to exclude health care-associated meningitis and ventriculitis in an immunocompetent hospitalized patient without a history of trauma or intervention has a low yield and rarely changes management [

         When suspicion for CNS infection is high based on the clinical assessment and initial results of this evaluation, (eg, in a patient with CSF pleocytosis or fever that cannot be explained by another etiology), we recommend initiation of empiric antibiotic therapy for meningitis/ventriculitis.
        </p>
        <p>
         We obtain all CSF and blood cultures prior to initiating antibiotics because cultures can become negative within hours of antibiotic administration. In a retrospective review of 326 cases of health care-associated meningitis and ventriculitis, CSF specimens obtained after antibiotics were given were less likely to be positive on Gram stain (13 versus 26 percent) and culture (49 versus 66 percent) compared with specimens obtained prior to antibiotics [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27

         ]. Among those who received antibiotics prior to CSF sampling, a shorter interval between antibiotic administration and specimen collection was associated with a higher likelihood of a positive CSF culture.

         Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be obtained via LP, cisternal puncture (preferably under fluoroscopic guidance), or from a shunt or Ommaya reservoir. In patients with an EVD, initial CSF samples are typically obtained from that drain. Nevertheless, even if an EVD is present, CSF obtained via LP can provide additional useful information, especially in patients with obstruction of CSF flow who may have infection initially confined to the extraventricular compartment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Accessing an Ommaya reservoir to obtain CSF is usually a last resort, as this requires puncturing the skin, which carries a risk of introducing infection.

          Gram stain and culture, including anaerobic culture
         </strong>
         – Cultures should be held for at least 10 days, as some organisms (eg,
         <em>
          C. acnes
         </em>
         ) grow slowly. A positive CSF Gram stain and culture are considered the gold standard for diagnosis of health care-associated meningitis and ventriculitis and are the most important assays to establish the diagnosis and etiology of meningitis [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Identification of an organism on CSF Gram stain is sufficient for diagnosing infectious meningitis in a patient with clinical suspicion for infection. Culture is also critical to identify a specific pathogen and determine its antimicrobial susceptibilities. However, negative results do not exclude infection, especially in patients who have received antibiotics. Up to 70 percent of patients with positive CSF culture have a negative Gram stain [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. As examples, in a study of 91 patients with health care-associated meningitis and ventriculitis, the CSF Gram stain was positive in 65 (71 percent) of patients with culture-proven infection [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. However, in another study of 216 patients with health care-associated infection, culture was positive in 48 percent but Gram stain in only 20 percent [

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Furthermore, a positive culture may rarely be a false positive. Specifically, in a patient with an indwelling CNS device without clinical concern for infection, a single positive culture of CSF taken from the device (eg, an external ventricular drain [EVD]) may represent contamination of the culture or drainage tubing rather than a true infection [

         – Typical CSF findings in health care-associated meningitis and ventriculitis include an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count with a polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) predominance, elevated protein, low glucose. However, these features do not always reliably distinguish bacterial meningitis from nonbacterial processes [

         Cell count – Although all forms of meningitis are typically associated with elevated WBC count, and elevated WBC is correlated with a positive CSF culture, there is no specific cutoff at which an elevated WBC can confirm health care-associated meningitis and ventriculitis nor at which a low WBC count can exclude it [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51

         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ], but this threshold has not been well validated. In studies of patients with gram-negative bacillary meningitis, CSF WBC counts ranged from 0 to 80,600 cells/microL [
         <a href="#rid53">
          53-55

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Although data are limited on the significance of trends in WBC count, increasing CSF pleocytosis should raise concern for CNS infection.

         Broad-range PCR – This can be performed on CSF for the diagnosis of meningitis and identification of a bacterial, mycobacterial, or fungal pathogen.

         Lactate – Measurement of CSF lactate concentration is a rapid and inexpensive ancillary test but is not widely available. Elevations in lactate levels result from a combination of bacterial growth, anaerobic metabolism, and release of lactate by neurons and glial cells affected by meningitis-induced brain edema [

          61,62

         ]. Because lactate levels are not affected by the presence of red blood cells (RBCs) in the CSF, lactate testing can sometimes be helpful when the CSF is bloody or when routine tests give inconclusive results. In one study of CSF lactate levels in the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis following neurosurgery, lactate levels had a higher sensitivity and specificity compared with the CSF-to-blood glucose ratios (88 versus 77 percent and 98 versus 87 percent, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid49">

In patients with bacterial meningitis following craniotomy, elevation of CSF lactate level ≥4 mmol/L was a sensitive and specific predictor for bacterial meningitis [

         We routinely perform neuroimaging as part of the evaluation for health care-associated meningitis and ventriculitis. In patients who have undergone neurosurgery, imaging that includes the cranial surgical site should be done to assess for potential infectious fluid collections at or adjacent to the surgical site. For patients with ventricular drains, layering of purulent material within the ventricle supports the diagnosis of infection. Neuroimaging may also be useful for determining if there is an adjacent soft tissue or sinus infection and for identifying potential complications of infection, such as hydrocephalus, vasculitis, or cerebral thrombosis [
         <a href="#rid68">
          68,69
         </a>
         ]. For patients with internalized shunts, imaging of the distal site can detect abnormalities that support infection; this is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         Between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), MRI provides higher resolution and is generally our preferred modality; however, CT is an appropriate alternative if it can be obtained more expediently, if metal at the site of interest would distort the MR image or the patient has a contraindication to MRI. Whichever imaging modality is selected, images should be obtained with and without contrast agent.
        </p>
        <p>
         In one study of 17 patients with ventriculitis who underwent either CT or MRI, ventricular debris was present in 94 percent, ependymal enhancement was present in 64 percent, and meningeal enhancement was present in 76 percent [
         <a href="#rid70">
          70

         Neuroimaging cannot reliably differentiate between aseptic or infectious meningitis as inflammation and contrast enhancement occurs in up to 80 percent of post-craniotomy patients who do not have CNS infection [

         Making a diagnosis of health care-associated meningitis and ventriculitis requires synthesis of clinical features, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) microbiologic testing, and results of other CSF tests. The diagnosis can be made relatively straightforwardly in a patient with a recent central nervous system (CNS) intervention or indwelling CNS device who has new fever, new neurologic deficits or symptoms, and identification of an organism on CSF culture or molecular testing, particularly if there is also CSF pleocytosis or hypoglycorrhachia.

         However, the diagnosis can be more challenging when clinical and microbiologic features are discordant, as discussed below. (See

         The National Healthcare Safety Network of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published criteria for the diagnosis of health care-associated meningitis and ventriculitis for health care facilities to use to track specific health care-associated infections  (

Although culture of CSF or CNS devices is the most important diagnostic test in establishing the presence of infection, no single clinical or laboratory finding can confirm or exclude the diagnosis. Critical clinical judgment is often necessary when the clinical and microbiologic features are discordant:

          Negative CSF culture in setting of clinical suspicion
         </strong>
         – If initial CSF cultures are negative yet CNS infection is still suspected clinically, we repeat CSF microbiologic testing with routine, anaerobic, and fungal culture; PCR testing; fungal markers; and, if available, metagenomic next-generation sequencing. Additional assays, such as lactate and procalcitonin, may be used depending on availability at the institution and regional practice. (See

         If testing remains unrevealing, the diagnosis of health care-associated meningitis and ventriculitis remains presumptive. Without a pathogen identified, symptoms and CSF abnormalities could represent aseptic meningitis due to CNS instrumentation or side effect of a medication. However, CSF Gram stain and culture can be negative despite bacterial (or fungal) infection, especially if antibiotics were administered prior to CSF sampling, and molecular tests do not have perfect sensitivity. Features that support the diagnosis of infection over aseptic meningitis in the setting of negative microbiologic testing include:

         may cause infection without substantial symptoms or signs, so the lack of these cannot rule out infection. In such patients, we repeat CSF testing (cell count and microbiology). Repeated positive culture with the same organism, particularly if the CSF white blood cell (WBC) count increases on repeat testing, is suggestive of infection. (See

         The main differential diagnosis of health care-associated meningitis and ventriculitis is aseptic meningitis, which can also complicate neurosurgical procedures or dural puncture and can present with similar symptoms and signs, such as fever, neurologic symptoms or deficits, and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell count, protein, and glucose. By definition, aseptic meningitis requires negative CSF Gram stain and culture, as well as recovery of the patient without administration of antibiotics [
         <a href="#rid73">
          73
         </a>
         ]. Thus, aseptic meningitis cannot be confirmed until several days after initiating the evaluation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Until culture results are available, it is difficult to distinguish between aseptic and infectious meningitis in the postoperative neurosurgical patient. Following a neurosurgical procedure, CSF protein, glucose, white blood cell (WBC) count, and Gram stain do not reliably distinguish bacterial meningitis from nonbacterial processes [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26,49,50
         </a>
         ]. Quick resolution of an elevated CSF WBC count without administration of antibiotics is more consistent with aseptic meningitis. As an example, in a study of patients who underwent spinal anesthesia but did not develop meningitis, CSF pleocytosis was present in 65 percent at 24 hours, 30 percent at 48 hours, and 18 percent at 72 hours; the highest cell count in this study was 1950 cells/microL [
         <a href="#rid74">
          74
         </a>
         ]. A more recent study noted that none of the CSF characteristics, other than a positive culture, could clearly distinguish between bacterial and aseptic meningitis [
         <a href="#rid75">
          75
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Certain clinical features may suggest against aseptic meningitis. In a study of 70 patients who developed meningitis following craniotomy or paranasal or spinal surgery, those with aseptic meningitis did not have purulent wound drainage, wound erythema or tenderness, coma, new focal neurologic deficits, or seizures [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52

        </p>
        <p>
         The etiology of aseptic meningitis following neurosurgery or dural puncture is not completely understood. One hypothesis is that red blood cells or other materials released during surgery induce meningeal inflammation and pleocytosis. Experimental injection of

         Health care-associated meningitis and ventriculitis are uncommon infections that occur primarily as a complication of central nervous system (CNS) devices, such as external ventricular drains (EVDs), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts, and lumbar drains. Post-craniotomy infections are less common. The risk of infection following lumbar puncture (LP) without an indwelling device is extremely low. (See

         <strong>
         </strong>
         Following neurosurgery or in the setting of an indwelling CNS device, the possibility of meningitis or ventriculitis should be suspected in the setting of new fever or leukocytosis with new headache, meningeal signs, focal neurologic defects, seizures, or worsening mental status. It should also be suspected in patients who have erythema, tenderness, or drainage at the site of a craniotomy incision or CNS device. (See

In immunocompromised patients or in other situations when fungal infection is suspected (eg, outbreak situation), fungal wet prep and culture, beta-D-glucan, and galactomannan should also be performed. We also request that the laboratory save an aliquot of CSF for additional testing, such as 16S ribosomal DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, in case cultures are negative. We do not routinely test CSF for lactate and procalcitonin, although if available, can provide additional supportive evidence of an infection. (See

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis is relatively straightforward in a patient with a recent CNS intervention or indwelling CNS device who has new fever, new neurologic deficits or symptoms, and growth of an organism on CSF culture (or pathogen identification on molecular testing), particularly if there is also CSF pleocytosis or hypoglycorrhachia  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef140116" href="/z/d/graphic/140116.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). (See

         above.)

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         When clinical and microbiologic features are discordant, making the diagnosis often requires repeating CSF analysis and synthesis of other findings that could support CNS infection (lack of other explanation, increasing CSF white blood cell [WBC] count, signs of infection at surgical or drain site, new neurologic deficits, purulent fluid or abscess on imaging). Overall, we have a low threshold to presumptively diagnose and treat health care-associated meningitis and ventriculitis because of the potential for severe morbidity. (See
