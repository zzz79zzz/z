         Palliative care is an interdisciplinary medical specialty that focuses on preventing and relieving suffering and on supporting the best possible quality of life for patients and their families facing serious illness. The primary tenets of palliative care are symptom management; establishing goals of care that are in keeping with the patient's values and preferences; consistent and sustained communication between the patient and all those involved in their care; psychosocial, spiritual, and practical support, both to patients and their family caregivers; and coordination across sites of care.

         Hospice and palliative medicine is a recognized medical subspecialty in the United States and internationally, including in Canada, England, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. Many European countries are also in the process of developing certification for palliative care. Unfortunately, in many other parts of the world, access to quality palliative care is limited [
         <a href="#rid1">

         In 2000, palliative care was included in the United Nation's International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, which states: "States are under the obligation to respect the right to health by, inter alia, refraining from denying or limiting equal access for all persons… to preventive, curative, and palliative health services."

         The 2014 World Health Assembly (WHA) passed a resolution appealing to member countries to incorporate palliative care services into the mainstream health care system [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Palliative care has been integrated in subsequent WHO and WHA resolutions, although these were nonbinding in character, making for difficulties in global implementation and in the assessment of impact on national policies [

         In 2016, a civil society report cited examples of progress following WHA resolution on the integration of palliative care into the health policy (India, Colombia, Romania), palliative care education (Jordan, Panama, Morocco), drug availability (Mexico), and in rolling out palliative care services (Ethiopia) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7

         The Declaration of Astana (2018), focusing on primary care as an aspect of universal health coverage and sustainable development goals, also included palliative care across a spectrum of provision that must be accessible to all [

         Because access to medical care in general differs by the socioeconomic realities in individual countries, access to palliative care can be stratified by whether one lives in a high- versus low-income country.

         Recognizing the challenges of economic constraints, in 2018 the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) released guidelines for implementing palliative care for patients with cancer and their caregivers in resource-limited settings [

         The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the great majority (78 percent) of adults and children (98 percent) in need of end-of-life care live in LMICs [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. However, only 9 percent of the world's countries, all of relatively high income, are considered to have advanced levels of palliative care integrated into mainstream health services [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. One 2013 study of over 230 countries evaluated the availability of palliative care internationally and reported that 58 percent had one or more palliative care systems available [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Separate studies indicate that specialist-level palliative care is available in only approximately 30 to 45 percent of nations [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,15
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         There is huge geographic variation in coverage. For example, the estimations of coverage for inpatient palliative care service, home care team, and hospital support team are 62, 52, and 31 percent for Western Europe and 20, 14, and 3 percent for Central and Eastern Europe, respectively [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. In another example, the ratio of palliative care services to population ranges from 1:1000 (in Niue, an island country in the South Pacific Ocean) to 1:90 million (in Pakistan) [
         <a href="#rid11">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Although it has been estimated that 5.3 million children experience serious health-related suffering globally [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ], accessibility to pediatric palliative care continues to be disparate across the world, and pediatric palliative care services are considered underdeveloped across Asia, Africa, and Latin America compared with North America and Europe [
         <a href="#rid17">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A report on the global situation in 2017 mentioned that countries with the highest levels of palliative care development contain 41.8 percent of the world population and are concentrated mainly in the global north, while 80 percent of the need for palliative care is in LMICs; 53.3 percent of the world's population is in countries in the global south, with very limited palliative care development. The remainder of the global population (4.8 percent) is located in countries that have no known palliative care activity or are only at the level of capacity building, and in territories that were not included in the survey (0.1 percent). These two lowest categories contain 60 countries and account for less than 5 percent of the global population. Eighty-seven countries are in categories with some availability of palliative care, but with weak development, and these make up more than half of the world population [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The Lancet Commission Report, published in 2018, noted that 80 percent of the more than 25.5 million people who died in 2015 experiencing serious health-related suffering were from resource-limited regions, and the vast majority lacked access to palliative care and pain relief [
         <a href="#rid19">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Also of concern, up to 83 percent of the world's population lives in countries with limited or nonexistent access to opioid medicines that are essential for pain relief in advanced diseases [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>

         High-income countries have greater integration of palliative care as part of their health care systems, as exemplified in the United States, Canada, and Great Britain. In addition, many high-income countries provide near-universal access to pediatric palliative care [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22

          "Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care"
         </a>
         ). The majority of countries with an established national palliative care strategy, reference to palliative care in a national law, or a dedicated individual or unit within government responsible for palliative care are in the high- or upper-middle-income categories [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         One study ranked countries (n = 40) on the availability of services using a Quality of Death Index comprised of 27 indices, including expectancy, health care spending as a percentage of gross domestic product, public awareness of end-of-life care, opioid availability, and existence of a national palliative care strategy or agenda [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. As might be expected, high-income countries had greater scores (eg, the United Kingdom scored at the top; South Korea scored in the middle) compared with low-income countries (eg, India).
        </p>
        <p>
         However, the coverage and quality of care are not always uniform within a country. As an example, there is widespread geographical variability in specialist palliative care services in the United Kingdom. It has also been noticed that gaps in knowledge and implementation of indigenous‐centered palliative care approaches are significant in Canada [
         <a href="#rid25">

         There is a significant need for palliative care services among populations in low-income, resource-constrained countries. Nonmalignant conditions generally predominate as the causes of death in these areas. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Common diseases'

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, the need for palliative care in the case of cancers is also high in low-income countries due to late diagnosis, inadequate curative care facilities, and difficulties in access to care. In India, for example, more than 80 percent of cancer patients present with advanced (stage III or IV) disease [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. It is estimated that annually, 40,000 Kenyans are diagnosed with cancer and more than 27,000 will die from the disease within one to two years of being diagnosed [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. Kenyatta National Hospital, the country's largest and only public cancer treatment facility, has only two radiotherapy machines, with more than 1800 patients scheduled for radiotherapy per year [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. Some private hospitals in Nairobi provide both radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but the cost ranges from USD $1600 to $5000, which is prohibitive given that many Kenyans live on only $1 per day or less. In addition, many Kenyans live in rural and remote areas, and making the long journey to access these services is challenging [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. The disparity is also obvious when treatment facilities which can be used both for curative and palliative management are considered. Estimates by International Atomic Energy Agency show the disparity between high- and low-income settings, with 11.4 radiotherapy machines per million in North America versus 0.05 machines per million in Central Africa [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]. There are no machines in nearly forty countries, most of which are low-income [
         <a href="#rid29">

         A 2015 report by the Quality of Death Index team demonstrated improvement in palliative care services in some of the lower-income countries, such as Panama (through building palliative care into its primary care services), Mongolia (through rapid growth in hospice facilities and teaching programs), and Uganda (through advances in the availability of opioid medicines). The supply-demand analysis in the same document, based upon the countries' demographic profiles and the burden of diseases for which palliative care is necessary, points out that many other similar countries will have to work hard to meet rising future needs as the incidence of noncommunicable disease increases and their populations grow older. The report shows China to be among the most vulnerable from population aging and the rising incidence of conditions such as cardiovascular disease, which accounted for one-third of all deaths in the country in 2012 [

         Palliative care in Kerala started in 1993 as a Civil Society Organization-run service linked to a government medical college. Support in the form of donations and voluntary work was solicited from the local community. Seven years later, a program named Neighborhood Network in Palliative Care was launched to expand the program and encourage better participation from the community. Community groups formed were encouraged to take up the responsibility of developing palliative care initiatives in the locality. Around 50 such local palliative care initiatives came up in the next eight years. By that time, local governments in Kerala also started taking interest in the program. Palliative home care units were established soon by all the more than 1000 local government institutions in the region, guided by a pain and palliative care policy by the state government of Kerala. Two decades after the initial attempts at deeper involvement of the community, Kerala now has more than 1000 palliative care units linked to local government institutions and more than 400 units run by local community groups. More than 300 of these Civil Society projects developed spontaneously over the last decade, "uninvited" and not as part of the original system.

Approximately 26 nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and 68 government hospitals provide palliative care services nationwide. Government palliative care has a focus on in-patient care, whereas NGOs largely focus on nurse-led community services. Despite distinctions between NGO and the government palliative care services, they mostly operate symbiotically. Specifically, many NGOs rely on government health care for essential prescriptions and to provide in-patient facilities, whilst government health care benefits from the home care service, which helps alleviate overcrowding in hospitals. The emphasis of Malaysian palliative care is on cancer, with many NGOs specifically focusing on cancer patients, and those accepting patients with other life-limiting conditions reporting over 90 percent of patient cases with cancer [

There is a registered NGO providing palliative care services in Bethlehem focusing on educating clinicians, nurses, patients and their families on the basics. The organization has two qualified palliative care workers (a nurse and a social worker) who also provide consultation for cancer patients and their families through its team along with occasional consultations from an oncologist who received six months of training in palliative care. The NGO has also started a program with the Ministry of Health and Augusta Victoria Hospital at Ibn-Sina College for Health Sciences to train undergraduate nursing students on palliative care [

Many people, both in the West and East, find death too distressing to contemplate, and it is, therefore, ignored or avoided. Such attitudes among professionals and the general public can cause delayed or no referrals to palliative care, even in places where good services exist [

          Outdated health care policies
         </strong>
         – Globally, over 80 percent of countries had strict policies governing access to pain medications, which served as substantial barriers to patients. These included restrictions on types of hospitals and even wards where opioids could be administered, the dose and time interval allowable by a single prescription, and the type of health care provider that could prescribe these agents. Emphasis on prevention of diversion and illicit use of narcotics dating back to the 1961 United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs [
         <a href="#rid89">
          89
         </a>

         <strong>
          Administrative barriers
         </strong>
         – Even where these agents are available, the process by which patients procure opioids can be a significant barrier, including the paperwork required to prescribe, the cost of agents (often not subsidized by the government), and limits on the dose that can be prescribed.

          Lack of provider education and empowerment

         Cost of medicines is also an issue. Findings of Opioid Price Watch indicate that in regards to its international reference price (USD $0.47 per dose), the median price of a

          morphine
         </a>
         oral solid immediate-release tablet (10 mg) is 5.8 times higher in LMICs than in high-income countries. Monthly treatment costs of morphine oral solid immediate release, measured in the number of days' wages of the lowest-paid worker, varies greatly (Philippines 29 days, India 21 days, and Guatemala 8 days) [

        </p>
        <p>
         In the poorest 10 percent of the world's countries, a patient with pain who dies from AIDS or cancer has access to, on average, 200 mg of oral

         Despite these barriers, some countries have made great strides to provide access to medically appropriate opioids for its citizens. As an example, in Colombia, all 32 states have been mandated to have at least one place where opioids are guaranteed to be in stock [
         <a href="#rid94">
          94

         ]. Because of this, the utilization of opioids in Colombia improved dramatically. In Ethiopia, a government-owned company formulates and distributes oral

         On the other hand, the lack of progress in improving access to opioid medications in most LMICs was underscored in a statistical analysis of use and barriers to access of opioid analgesics between 2001 to 2003 and 2011 to 2013 [
         <a href="#rid96">
          96

         ]. Worldwide, use of opioid analgesics had increased over this 10-year period, but the increase in consumption was limited to North America, Western and Central Europe, and Oceania (including Australia, New Zealand, and the South Pacific Islands). Countries in other regions, including Africa, Asia, Central America, the Caribbean, South America, and Eastern and Southeastern Europe, showed no substantial increase in use. Their analysis of impediments to use echoed many of the same issues raised by the ESMO working group and included absence of training and awareness in medical professionals, fear of dependence, restricted financial resources, issues in sourcing or importing opioids, cultural attitudes, fear of diversion, international trade controls, and onerous regulation. However, fear of causing dependence and onerous regulations or legislative restrictions as impediments to opioid access were less frequently mentioned in a United Nations global analysis of access to opioids in 2015 as compared with 1995 (fear of dependence 32 versus 64 percent, onerous regulation 18 versus 53 percent) [

         Do not resuscitate (DNR) documents are widely in use in hospitals and are accepted in the majority of high-income countries. In Taiwan, for example, the Natural Death Act was passed in 2000, which allows patients over the age of 20 with terminal diseases to express in writing their wish to discontinue medical treatment, and it does not prosecute doctors who allow such deaths [
         <a href="#rid105">
          105
         </a>
         ]. It was observed that the rate of DNR orders in terminally ill patients gradually increased in the 10 years (2001 to 2011) following the act [
         <a href="#rid106">
          106
         </a>
         ]. By contrast, in most low-income countries, DNR documents and other types of advance directives do not have valid legal status and are not part of standard medical practice. (See

         Active euthanasia and medical aid in dying (MAID) are illegal in most countries. However, several Western countries have legalized one or both of the practices. The current legal status of voluntary active euthanasia (VAE) and MAID in the United States and other countries is discussed elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95251.html" rel="external">
          "Medical aid in dying: Ethical and legal issues"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Public debates and media attention on issues related to euthanasia or MAID can be catalysts for policymakers to improve palliative care services. For example, in Australia, euthanasia was legalized in the Northern Territory by the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, passed in 1995, but was voided by amendment to the Self-Government Act governing the Northern Territory later in 1996. However, this was subsequently followed by an increase in national funding for palliative care [
         <a href="#rid107">
          107
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In Japan, medical voluntary euthanasia was approved by a high court as early as 1962, but instances are extremely rare, seemingly because of complicated taboos on suicide, dying, and death in the country [
         <a href="#rid108">
          108
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         On the other hand, VAE or MAID is not legal in any of the LMICs other than Colombia. Occasional discussions/debates in the media around these issues occur (eg, media attention on euthanasia as linked to the Aruna Shanbaug case and a Supreme Court verdict on living will in India) [
         <a href="#rid109">
          109-111
         </a>
         ], but they rarely bring greater attention to palliative care, likely because of a very low baseline level of awareness about palliative care.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most palliative care associations in the world oppose assisted dying and are often vocal in their opposition. In some instances, however, there is evidence of divided opinions; for example, within the Association of Palliative Medicine in the United Kingdom [
         <a href="#rid112">
          112

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The European Association of Palliative Care (EAPC) has developed a "white paper" on euthanasia and MAID with the aim of "providing a viewpoint from the palliative care perspective" [

         Estimates of the cost of care in the last year of life are consistently high. Access to palliative care remains inconsistent, even in high-income countries, with the number of providers varying from 5 to 680 per million population [

         Lack of government funding is an obvious barrier to the availability of palliative care services in many countries, especially those with low income. One exception is Kerala, India, where more than 60 percent of the funding for palliative care comes from the local government. A few international organizations, such as the Global Fund, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the United Kingdom's Department for International Development, are active in supporting palliative care efforts in low-income countries. PEPFAR, for example, has earmarked 15 percent of its funding for palliative care. Global Fund funding for palliative care has focused largely on HIV and tuberculosis programs. Donations from the United Kingdom and other counties help fund programs in countries such as Romania, Serbia, and Moldova.
        </p>
        <p>
         Who pays for the services at the point of care delivery also differs from country to country. In Switzerland, the Netherlands, Ireland, and the United States, patients are required to pay (part of) the service fees directly to the service provider ("out-of-pocket" payments). Optional supplementary insurance is available to cover additional service costs in the Netherlands and Ireland, but it comes at a higher insurance premium.

         A survey among pediatric oncologists from different countries revealed that in low-income countries, pediatric oncology is usually practiced in government-supported, resource-strained oncology hospitals. As many as 24 percent of clinicians in low-income countries reported out-of-pocket payment for cancer treatment, palliative care, or comfort care medications, whereas most children in high-income countries receive government-funded care at freestanding pediatric institutions [

         Although there is a critical need for palliative care services in low-income countries, palliative care is available and partially integrated into the health care system in a few places, most notably Romania and Uganda. In many other countries where there are no established or state-supported programs, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and/or volunteer community health workers have been successfully utilized to provide some palliative care services.
