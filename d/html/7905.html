         Epidemic typhus is a potentially lethal, louse-borne, exanthematous disease caused by
         <em>
          Rickettsia prowazekii
         </em>
         .
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         is one of two members of the typhus group of
         <em>
          Rickettsia
         </em>
         known to cause human illness; the other member,
         <em>
          Rickettsia typhi
         </em>
         , causes murine typhus. Scrub typhus is caused by
         <em>
          Orientia tsutsugamushi
         </em>
         . Like all rickettsiae,
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         cannot be grown on cell-free media, and specialized laboratory facilities are required to recover the organism from clinical specimens.
        </p>
        <p>
         The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of epidemic typhus will be discussed here. Topic reviews that discuss murine typhus and scrub typhus are found elsewhere. (See

         The first description of epidemic typhus was thought to be made in 1546 by an Italian physician, Girolamo Fracastoro, who separated epidemic typhus from other typhus-like infections. It remains controversial as to whether typhus was imported into Europe from the New World or vice versa [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Throughout the Middle Ages and into the early part of the 20th century, periodic epidemics of
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         infection killed millions of people. As an example, during the eight-year period from 1917 to 1925, over 25 million cases of epidemic typhus occurred in Russia, causing an estimated three million deaths [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. It has been estimated that epidemic typhus has caused more deaths than all the wars in history [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Epidemic typhus is now a rare disease, but subsequent developments illustrate that an understanding of its epidemiology, clinical features, and treatment is still important to clinicians:

         A sylvatic cycle of infection (disease transmitted from wild animals, particularly flying squirrels and their ectoparasites, with secondary transmission to humans) has been reported in the United States [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5

         More than 45,000 cases of epidemic typhus occurred in Burundi in association with civil war during the 1990s; in addition, an outbreak of epidemic typhus occurred at a youth center in Rwanda in 2012. In both cases, body louse infestation preceded outbreaks of both epidemic typhus and trench fever due to
         <em>
          Bartonella quintana

         </span>
         Epidemic typhus is a vector-borne disease with a complex epidemiology. The principal vectors are
         <em>
          Pediculosis humanus
         </em>
         (the body louse) and
         <em>
          P. humanus capitis
         </em>
         (the head louse) [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. The human louse was thought to be the sole vector of
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         and humans were thought to be the sole reservoir of infection until a report in 1975 demonstrated that
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         infection occurred in flying squirrels in the southeastern United States [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsequent studies revealed that both the squirrel flea (
         <em>
          Orchospea howardii
         </em>
         ) and the squirrel louse (
         <em>
          Neohaemotophinus sciuropteri
         </em>
         ) are vectors for the transmission of
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         among flying squirrels. Although
         <em>
          N. sciuropteri
         </em>
         is host-specific and does not feed on humans,
         <em>
          O. howardii
         </em>
         will bite humans and transmit
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         if its principal host, the flying squirrel, is unavailable [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. In one study, flying squirrels inoculated with
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         developed a rickettsemia that lasted for two to three weeks. Lice, fleas, and mites feeding on these experimentally-infected squirrels could be infected with
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         A limited number of papers about the epidemiology of
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         infection have been published in recent decades. However, the available data suggest that reporting and detection biases probably exist. Epidemic typhus is likely to be misdiagnosed or completely undiagnosed in areas of the world where poverty, famine, war, and disease occur simultaneously. As an example, seroprevalence studies of patients from North Africa and in homeless people from Marseilles, France suggest that
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         infection may be occurring far more often than is recognized [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13
         </a>
         ]. The incidence of
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         infection in homeless populations in the United States is unknown. In one study, 2 of 176 homeless people from Houston had serologic evidence of infection with
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. In another prospective serological study of febrile patients with exanthems at a single hospital in Algeria, 1 of 14 proven cases of rickettsial infection identified over a six-year time period was due to
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         . This illustrates that multiple rickettsial pathogens may coexist with
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         in the same geographic area [

         </span>
         The body louse typically spends its life on the skin or clothes of humans. Its prevalence is increased by cold weather, humidity, and poor hygiene [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Eggs are laid on clothes and hatch in about eight days. After hatching, larvae molt three times before they become adults.
        </p>
        <p>
         Lice require a blood meal during each of these three stages. During a blood meal, the louse defecates highly infective feces at the site of its feeding. Rickettsiae present in louse feces may then be introduced into abraded or injured skin or mucous membranes by either scratching or hand contamination, since skin irritation commonly occurs at the site of a louse bite. Lice feces may remain infectious for as long as 100 days; as a result, human to human transmission can occur from sharing clothes or transfer of infective lice feces from one human to another.
        </p>
        <p>
         <em>
          P. humanus
         </em>
         typically spends its entire life on the same host and does not leave unless manually removed or close contact allows transfer to a second human host. However, lice rapidly leave a dying human host and seek a blood meal on an alternate host. The cumulative effect of all these factors is that transmission of epidemic typhus typically occurs in crowded, cold, and unhygienic environments.
        </p>
        <p>
         The mechanisms of louse infection following feeding on an infected host were explored in an experimental model of human body louse infection with
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. The following findings were noted:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">

         <em>

         initially invaded the stomach epithelial cells of lice.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Rickettsiae first appeared in the feces of infected lice on the fifth day of infection.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Rickettsiae replicated in the stomach epithelial cells, causing cell rupture six to seven days postinfection. Erythrocytes entered the hemolymph of infected lice following epithelial cell rupture, causing the lice to become bright red and die within four hours.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Infected lice did not transmit infection to their progeny.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The life span of infected lice was shortened by 20 to 23 days compared to uninfected controls.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Lice are capable of serially feeding on different humans, but transfer of infected lice directly from one human to another is thought to be uncommon. One possible reason for this is the rapid death of lice following rickettsial infection, as summarized above [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. However, indirect transmission via infected lice in contaminated clothing or from crowded environmental conditions is known to occur [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. In experimental conditions,
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         can also be transmitted via aerosols, and because
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         can be infectious for prolonged periods (eg, 100 days in louse feces),
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         remains on the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list of potential bioweapons [
         <a href="#rid17">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Transmission of the sylvatic form of epidemic typhus to humans typically occurs when humans have direct contact with infected squirrels or when squirrels that are nesting in the attics or walls of homes are removed or killed and the lice inhabiting their nest are forced to seek alternate hosts. However, transmission of sylvatic typhus may occur in individuals who have no recollection or evidence of recent louse bites [
         <a href="#rid5">

         Only a few foci of epidemic typhus still exist in the world today [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. In recent decades, cases of epidemic typhus have been reported in Burundi, Rwanda, Ethiopia and in the rural highlands of South America, Asia, and Algeria [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,8,19-22
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Except for a single case reported from California, almost all cases of epidemic typhus in the United States until 2001 occurred east of the Mississippi River within the range of the eastern flying squirrel (
         <em>
          Glaucomys volans
         </em>
         ). However, in 2001, a patient from New Mexico, who presented with fever and signs and symptoms of meningitis without skin rash, was found to have acute infection with
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         using PCR amplification of the 17-kDA antigen gene and DNA sequencing of the amplified product [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. The source of his infection could not be determined. A cluster of four cases of epidemic typhus subsequently occurred between 2004 and 2006 among staff and visitors to a wilderness camp in Pennsylvania; an investigation concluded that the source of infection was flying squirrels nesting in the walls of a cabin adjacent to a specific bunk [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Of the 14 flying squirrels trapped in woodlands near the cabin, 71 percent were infected with
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         . Similar findings were reported in 2009, when an investigation of two cases of epidemic typhus in the same household in New York state found 11 flying squirrels trapped in the attic of this house, and all were seropositive to
         <em>
          R. prowazekii

         Sylvatic epidemic typhus associated with flying squirrels remains an uncommon disease in the United States. The CDC documented only 47 cases in the US from 1976 to 2010 [

         After transcutaneous entry of infective louse tissues or feces,
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         spreads throughout the body via the blood stream or lymphatics. Once inside the human host,
         <em>
          typhus rickettsiae
         </em>
         , like
         <em>
          R. rickettsii
         </em>
         , enter endothelial cells and proliferate by binary fission. (See

         The precise mechanism by which
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         produces cellular injury is still uncertain, but experimental studies suggest that a complex and multifactorial sequence of events results in endothelial injury via both cellular swelling and necrosis. Secondary immune and phagocytic responses to
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         involve both lymphocytes and macrophages, but
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         can also injure cells directly in the absence of immune and inflammatory responses. Attachment of
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         to cell membranes directly increases phospholipase activity, which in turn injures host cell membranes [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ].
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         may accumulate in vast numbers in individual endothelial cells prior to sudden "burst release", which results in death of the host cell.
        </p>
        <p>
         The consequence of the above series of cellular events is the pathologic hallmark of epidemic typhus infection: widespread lymphocytic vasculitis with increased vascular permeability, edema, and activation of humoral inflammatory and coagulation mechanisms. This rickettsia-induced vasculitis may also be accompanied by mural and intimal thrombosis and microscopic areas of hemorrhage. Involvement of the microcirculation can produce diffuse myocarditis as well as damage to muscle, spleen, kidneys, and brain. Central nervous system involvement may result in characteristic "typhus nodules" composed of perivascular infiltrates consisting of lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma and mast cells.

        <p>
         The molecular basis for Brill-Zinsser disease, defined as the recrudescence of epidemic typhus years after the initial episode, remains unclear. In particular, the mechanism by which
         <em>
          R. prowazekii

         remains latent in humans for decades has not been established [

         The rash of epidemic typhus classically begins several days after the onset of symptoms, appearing as a red macular or maculopapular eruption on the trunk that later spreads centrifugally to the extremities. The rash, which may be difficult to see in dark-skinned individuals, is classically described as sparing the palms and soles, but many exceptions to this rule occur. In severe cases, the rash may become petechial; gangrene of the distal extremities necessitating amputation is a rare complication.
        </p>
        <p>
         The rash is usually present on both the trunk and extremities but may be limited to one or the other site in some patients [

        <p>
         The onset of Brill-Zinsser disease is typically abrupt with chills, fever, headache, and malaise. Nonspecific gastrointestinal and pulmonary symptoms are also present in many patients. Because affected patients are often elderly, symptoms such as confusion, dyspnea, or lethargy may be erroneously attributed to preexisting or coexistent cardiac, cerebrovascular, or pulmonary disease [

         Eradication of human infestation with lice will prevent transmission of epidemic typhus. As noted above, people who live and work in close proximity to louse-infested individuals may secondarily acquire lice even if they regularly wash their clothes and have good hygiene. Thus, all louse-infested persons and individuals in close contact with such persons should use long-acting insecticides.

          20
         </a>
         ]. While the optimal duration of therapy is unproven, most experts recommend treating for at least seven days or until the patient has been afebrile for at least 48 hours, whichever is longer.

         However, medical facilities are often inadequate in areas of the world in which epidemic typhus is seen. An alternative to

          doxycycline

          chloramphenicol

         500 mg orally or intravenously four times daily for five days. While inferior, this regimen is effective for epidemic typhus and simultaneously covers meningococcemia and typhoid fever, infections that can mimic many or all of the clinical features of
         <em>
          R. prowazekii

         The prognosis is dependent upon a number of factors, including the age, underlying nutritional status, and health of the patient and the speed with which therapy is administered. In the preantibiotic era, the mortality rates for epidemic typhus were related to age and gender, being higher in older patients and males. In the modern era, mortality is uncommon if either

         Epidemic typhus is a potentially lethal, louse-borne, exanthematous disease caused by
         <em>
          Rickettsia prowazekii
         </em>
         . The principal vectors are
         <em>
          Pediculosis humanus
         </em>
         (the body louse) and
         <em>
          P. humanus capitis
         </em>
         (the head louse), although the squirrel flea (
         <em>
          Orchospea howardii
         </em>
         ) can transmit the sylvatic form of disease from infected flying squirrels to humans. (See

         Only a few foci of epidemic typhus still exist in the world today. In recent decades, cases of epidemic typhus have been reported in Burundi, Rwanda, Ethiopia and in the rural highlands of South America, Asia, and Algeria. A sylvatic form of
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         infection has been reported in the United States. (See

         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         infection produces two distinct clinical syndromes: an acute potentially severe infection that occurs 7 to 14 days after exposure to infected lice, and a rare recrudescent form called Brill-Zinsser disease that may occur 10 to 50 years after primary infection. Brill-Zinsser disease is generally a mild illness. (See

         The majority of patients with epidemic typhus or sylvatic typhus infection experience the abrupt onset of fever, severe headache, and malaise. Infected patients may also complain of a number of other nonspecific symptoms including cough, abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhea. (See
         <a class="local">

         The rash of epidemic typhus classically begins several days after the onset of symptoms, appearing as a red macular or maculopapular eruption on the trunk that later spreads centrifugally to the extremities. (See
         <a class="local">

         Serologic tests are the mainstay of diagnosis since isolation of
         <em>
          R. prowazekii
         </em>
         is generally impractical. Both forms of
         <em>
          R. prowazekii

         infection are associated with a fourfold rise in antibody titers between acute and convalescent specimens taken at least two weeks apart. (See

         Eradication of human infestation with lice will prevent transmission of epidemic typhus. All louse-infested persons and individuals in close contact with such persons should use long-acting insecticides. (See
