         Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA, formerly called Still's disease or systemic-onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis) is a subset of JIA. Adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) is probably the same or similar disease when it begins in patients ≥16 years of age. sJIA is classified as a subset of JIA, but the pathophysiology is most consistent with an autoinflammatory disorder.

         The treatment options for sJIA are discussed in this review. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, complications, and prognosis of sJIA are discussed separately, as are other subtypes of JIA. (See

         Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) alone are effective for some children with mild sJIA [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The traditional treatment for patients who failed NSAID therapy was glucocorticoids along with the disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD),
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/z/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">
          methotrexate
         </a>
         . However, glucocorticoids are a poor long-term therapeutic option because of associated toxicity, and methotrexate often does not change the aggressive and often permanently disabling consequences of unremitting disease. Biologic DMARDs, such as interleukin (IL) 1 or IL-6 inhibitors, were initially reserved for patients refractory to conventional therapy (NSAIDs followed by the addition of glucocorticoids with or without methotrexate). However, they are increasingly the agent of choice after failure of NSAID therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of sJIA since they are highly effective.
        </p>
        <p>
         Treatment guidelines, based upon presence or absence of active systemic features, clinician global assessment, active joint count, and presence or absence of features concerning for macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), are outlined by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. These guidelines emphasize the earlier use of biologics in children with sJIA, although specific information on appropriate dose is lacking. Another set of standardized treatment plans was developed through a consensus process by the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) based upon the most commonly used treatment approaches for sJIA [

         The choice of initial therapy depends upon the severity of the presentation, including whether the patient shows signs of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). (See

         </span>
         We suggest nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) monotherapy as the initial treatment in children with possible sJIA who have a mild-to-moderate presentation, meaning nondisabling symptoms (fever, rash, mild-moderate arthritis) without evidence of MAS. Any NSAID other than
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">
          aspirin
         </a>
         is suitable and is given at standard antiinflammatory doses. NSAIDs are especially useful for treatment of disease in the early stages, when the diagnosis may not be clear and the work-up is still in progress. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6413.html" rel="external">

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         In general, a trial of NSAIDs alone should last no more than a week or two since it is usually quickly apparent whether an additional agent is needed within this timeframe. Additional therapy is indicated in children who develop or continue to have significant symptoms despite use of NSAIDs (such as continued high fevers, rash, arthritis, serositis). The approach for patients who have not responded sufficiently to a trial of an NSAID alone during the acute phase of the illness is similar to that for patients who present with moderate-to-severe disease. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Moderate-to-severe acute disease'
         </a>
         below.)

         For patients whose initial symptoms include serious systemic manifestations such as serositis, possible early MAS, moderate-to-severe polyarthritis (with or without a trial of NSAIDs), or high fevers with a poor response to NSAIDs, we suggest starting one of the biologic agents that inhibit interleukin (IL) 1 or IL-6, such as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9246" href="/z/d/drug information/9246.html" rel="external">
          anakinra

         ,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8906" href="/z/d/drug information/8906.html" rel="external">
          canakinumab
         </a>
         , or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10208" href="/z/d/drug information/10208.html" rel="external">
          tocilizumab
         </a>
         . NSAIDs can be continued in conjunction with other agents if needed for pain control. The choice of biologic agents should be a decision that is shared with the patient/family and clinician and depends upon multiple factors such as differing routes of administration and frequency of dosing. As an example, anakinra is given as a daily injection, canakinumab as a monthly injection, and tocilizumab as an intravenous infusion every two weeks. Some pediatric rheumatologists prefer starting with a short-acting biologic such as anakinra, especially at the onset of disease, because it can be easily withdrawn if there is a question about the diagnosis or a complication such as infection, but it is not yet approved for use in this disease in the US, making it difficult to obtain at times. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Interleukin 1 inhibitors'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="local">
          'Interleukin 6 inhibitors'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Some pediatric rheumatologists prefer to start with glucocorticoids in this situation and use
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9630" href="/z/d/drug information/9630.html" rel="external">
          methotrexate
         </a>
         as a steroid-sparing agent since glucocorticoids provide rapid onset of action and almost uniform efficacy for even severely ill children. However, the biologic agents that block the effects of IL-1 and IL-6 are often more effective than nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs; eg, methotrexate) and have more favorable side-effect profiles than long-term use of glucocorticoids. In addition, glucocorticoids should not be used unless the possibility of malignancy, which may cause a similar presentation, has been excluded. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Glucocorticoids'
         </a>
         below and

         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients presenting with relatively severe symptoms or who have suspected early MAS should be treated with glucocorticoids in addition to an anti-IL-1 or IL-6 agent. Concomitant use of a biologic agent may allow relatively rapid tapering of glucocorticoids. (See
         <a class="local">

         For patients started on a biologic DMARD as part of the initial therapy, we suggest adding a glucocorticoid within a week if there is continued polyarthritis, fever, and rash. A glucocorticoid should be added sooner if there was evidence of MAS or severe serositis. Both drugs are then typically continued until disease control is established. The clinician may then decide to gradually withdraw the glucocorticoid first because of the inevitable toxicity associated with its chronic use. Withdrawal of the biologic agent may be attempted as well if the patient continues to exhibit no sign of disease since there are infrequent patients who have monophasic disease, which will remit completely after a period of months [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6
         </a>
         ]. Evidence suggests that there is a window of opportunity, and the early use of anti-IL-1 agents may change the course of disease [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Biologic DMARDs are the preferred choice for patients with refractory acute disease who were treated with an NSAID plus a glucocorticoid with or without

          methotrexate

         . Anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 agents have shown good efficacy and allowed tapering of glucocorticoids in randomized trials [

          methotrexate
         </a>
         or other DMARDs may have clinical differences that can help decide treatment. As an example, some have primarily systemic manifestations, others primarily arthritis (which can be progressive and destructive), and still others have both. Inhibitors of IL-1 and IL-6 appear to be the most effective of the biologic agents for primarily systemic disease (eg, fever, rash, and serositis) and may be effective for chronic arthritis as well. Inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and blockers of T cell costimulation (

         ) are not recommended for initial therapy or systemic disease, but one of these biologic agents or methotrexate (alone or in combination with a biologic agent) can be helpful for chronic arthritis therapy [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,11
         </a>
         ]. Any biologic can be used in combination with methotrexate, another nonbiologic DMARD, and/or glucocorticoids but should not be used in combination with another biologic. Other nonbiologic DMARDs, such as

         The agents used to treat sJIA include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, and the biologic and nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

         All of the traditional NSAIDs, and at least one of the cyclooxygenase (COX) 2-selective NSAIDs, have been used for treating JIA [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12

         ]. Although the traditional NSAID of first choice was

          aspirin
         </a>
         , it is no longer commonly used because of dosing and toxicity issues, which warrant frequent salicylate level and liver function test monitoring. None of these NSAIDs have shown any unique advantages for children with sJIA, except possibly for
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8559" href="/z/d/drug information/8559.html" rel="external">
          indomethacin
         </a>
         , which is anecdotally effective for control of recalcitrant fever.
        </p>
        <p>
         If NSAID therapy alone is effective in controlling all of the sJIA manifestations, a trial of gradually tapering the NSAID can be attempted after a period of several months of disease quiescence to see if the patient has monophasic disease and has gone into remission.
        </p>
        <p>
         Use of any of the NSAIDs is associated with a risk of hepatotoxicity, often manifested by hepatic enzyme elevation. NSAIDs are also associated with kidney toxicity, usually manifested as tubular interstitial disease with microscopic urine analysis changes, although patients can also develop edema, papillary necrosis, and hypertension.

         There are no randomized trials of glucocorticoids for the treatment of sJIA, although the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) consensus treatment plans and the 2013 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines offer general guidelines [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. Glucocorticoids should be used judiciously in sJIA to minimize their toxicity. They are typically used during the acute phase of the illness to preserve the ability to carry out activities of daily living, particularly in children who have not responded quickly to initial therapy. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Every effort must be made to minimize the dose and duration of therapy. Whenever possible, the dose of glucocorticoids should be kept below 0.5 mg/kg per day of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">
          prednisone

          methotrexate

         Some clinicians use intermittent high-dose intravenous glucocorticoids to reduce the toxicity associated with daily oral glucocorticoids or to treat severe anemia or pericarditis. The combination of glucocorticoids and NSAIDs can result in an increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity due to their additive effect.

         sJIA is associated with increased circulating levels of multiple cytokines [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ]. Anecdotal and experimental evidence supports the use of monoclonal antibodies or soluble receptors to block inflammatory cytokines in patients with sJIA. Of these, the most efficacious biologic agents, based upon results from randomized trials, are those that block interleukin (IL) 1 or IL-6 [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Many pediatric rheumatologists begin one of these agents, rather than a glucocorticoid, in patients who have failed NSAID monotherapy. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7966.html" rel="external">

         However, treatment with these particular biologics may mask some features of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and make it more difficult to diagnose. A systematic literature review that included 18 publications reported the clinical features of sJIA patients who developed MAS while treated with IL-1 (35 patients) or IL-6 inhibitors (49 patients) [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. In general, patients treated with these agents had lower levels of ferritin than historical MAS cohorts. Patients treated with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10208" href="/z/d/drug information/10208.html" rel="external">
          tocilizumab
         </a>
         (IL-6 inhibitor) were less likely to be febrile, but other features of MAS were more pronounced, including lower platelet counts, lower fibrinogen, and higher liver function tests.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients receiving biologic response modifiers have an increased risk of infection, particularly mycobacterial, viral, and fungal infections. Thus, the American Academy of Pediatrics has published guidance for clinicians using these agents [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. A thorough history is recommended to help determine infectious risk, with performance of screening tests as indicated depending upon the history and biologic agent chosen. If treatment can be safely delayed, administration of routine immunizations at least two weeks prior to starting a biologic agent is advised for inactivated or subunit vaccines and at least four weeks prior for live vaccines. Unfortunately, delaying treatment while awaiting vaccination is not feasible or safe for many children presenting with active sJIA. Administration of live vaccines is not recommended during treatment with biologic agents. An infectious disease specialist should be consulted if a live vaccine is deemed necessary while a patient is on biologic therapy. Inactivated and subunit vaccines can be given while on therapy, and an annual

         There are little published data regarding withdrawal of biologic agents in children with sJIA, and no guidelines exist, although tapering and withdrawal was successful in some patients who achieved inactive disease in the

        <p>
         The appropriate role of the various biologic agents, especially the IL-6 and IL-1 inhibitors, in the treatment of children with sJIA should become clearer as pediatric rheumatologists gain experience with these agents and their comparative effectiveness is studied [

         (anti-IL-1-beta monoclonal antibody) are beneficial in many children with sJIA. The IL-1 inhibitors, anakinra, rilonacept, and canakinumab, are administered by subcutaneous injection. Canakinumab is administered monthly and rilonacept weekly, whereas anakinra is administered daily. Because of its short half-life, the anakinra dose can be adjusted more readily or withdrawn more quickly if the patient does not respond. This is a potential advantage, especially early on in the course, when the disease is often unstable. Some features of MAS may be less pronounced in patients treated with IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors [

         </a>
         ]. Anakinra may be more effective if used early in the disease course, rather than as "rescue" therapy once other therapies have failed. As an example, an international group gathered a case series of 46 patients who had received anakinra as part of initial therapy for sJIA, including 10 treated with anakinra without glucocorticoids or other DMARDs [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Many of these patients were able to avoid glucocorticoid therapy altogether, and chronic arthritis did not develop in almost 90 percent of these patients followed for more than six months (compared with 30 to 50 percent among historical controls).

         was initiated at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day in 42 patients with new-onset sJIA, including 12 without arthritis symptoms, who had not responded to seven days of treatment with NSAIDs [

An additional two and five percent at one and three months, respectively, achieved inactive disease on a combination of anakinra and prednisolone. Only one patient with inactive disease on monotherapy was on the higher dose. Both patients with and without arthritis at disease onset responded to therapy. Drug tapering was begun in patients with inactive disease after a mean of 3.7 months of treatment, and 52 percent had inactive disease off medication at one year. Factors associated with inactive disease at one year included a high baseline neutrophil count (&gt; 9x10

         in combination with systemic glucocorticoids. One patient died of MAS, and three developed serious complications. This study demonstrates that treatment with IL-1 inhibition early in the course of disease is effective for many patients and may change the course of the disease. However, the response was not uniform, and some patients relapsed off treatment. In addition, since this was a single-arm open-label study, it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding the comparative efficacy of other treatments as initial therapy.

         remains undefined. In one series, over 40 percent of children treated with less than 1.5 mg/kg/day required dose escalation [

          27

         <a href="#rid40">
          40,41

         Citing concerns about the incidence of lymphoma and other malignancies in children treated with biologic agents, the US FDA performed a safety review of malignancies reported with TNF inhibitor use. They concluded that there may be an increased risk of lymphoma and other cancers associated with the use of these drugs in children and adolescents, but this study was based solely on case reports [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. A study published subsequently to this review that used a large administrative claims database found that children with JIA have a slightly increased risk of malignancy independent of medication usage and that medications used for JIA, including TNF inhibitors, were not significantly associated with additional malignancy risk [
         <a href="#rid48">
          48
         </a>
         ]. Study of this risk is ongoing in disease-specific pharmacosurveillance registries such as the CARRA Registry, which will be able to estimate baseline compared with exposure risks for these adverse events because they will enroll all patients with JIA, regardless of medication exposure [
         <a href="#rid49">

         In addition, there may be an increased risk of reactivation of latent tuberculosis (TB) infections, as well as of fungal infections, with the use of TNF inhibitors.

         There is an anecdotal association of initiation of any therapy in sJIA, including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), with a transiently elevated risk of life-threatening macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), a form of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Accordingly, careful monitoring for MAS after initiation of any therapy for sJIA is essential. Patients with sJIA are predisposed to developing MAS and may display features of MAS throughout their disease course, with some patients having evidence of "chronic MAS" that is refractory to treatment and carries a poor prognosis. Treatments for HLH and MAS are under investigation in clinical trials (see

         Studies are required to monitor for drug toxicities for several of the therapies used to treat sJIA. Patients with sJIA can be quite unstable, especially during the first few months of disease, and need frequent monitoring of systemic disease activity and potential complications such as MAS or pulmonary disease, aside from what is required because of specific medication toxicities. All sJIA patients should have at least the following blood tests done regularly: complete blood count, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and ferritin.

         <strong>
          Rationale for choice of a glucocorticoid or biologic
         </strong>
         – Historically, most pediatric rheumatologists have added a glucocorticoid in patients who have not responded to a trial of an NSAID alone or who have severe disease on initial presentation. However, long-term use of glucocorticoids is associated with a high frequency of side effects. Biologic agents, especially the interleukin (IL) 1 and IL-6 inhibitors, are being used more and more as single therapy at disease onset because they are effective in reducing clinical symptoms in patients with disease refractory to NSAID and glucocorticoid therapy. There are increasing data to suggest that they are also beneficial when used early in the care of children with severe sJIA (ie, instead of glucocorticoids in selected patients) once the diagnosis is confirmed. The decision to initiate therapy with a biologic agent first or in combination with glucocorticoids and the choice of biologic agent must be made by the individual treating clinician after discussion of the risks and benefits with the patient and family.

          Initial treatment of severe symptoms and for patients in whom NSAIDs were ineffective
         </strong>
         – For patients in whom a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) alone was not effective, or whose initial symptoms include high fevers, other severe systemic symptoms, and/or disabling polyarthritis, we suggest adding one of the biologic agents, such as

         ). Anakinra is initially prescribed at a dose of 2 mg/kg daily (up to 100 mg). Canakinumab is usually given as 4 mg/kg monthly in children (maximum dose 300 mg). Tocilizumab is typically given every two weeks at a dose of 12 mg/kg intravenously or 162 mg subcutaneously for children who weigh less than 30 kg and 8 mg/kg intravenously (up to 800 mg) every two weeks or 162 mg subcutaneously every week for those who weigh more.

          Refractory disease
         </strong>
         – We suggest adding a glucocorticoid if there is not a prompt response to a biologic agent (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). While the definition of a prompt response will differ from center to center, few pediatric rheumatologists would wait more than a week before adding a glucocorticoid in the face of continued polyarthritis, fever, and rash, and all would add a glucocorticoid sooner if there was evidence of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) or severe serositis. Both the glucocorticoid and the biologic agent are usually continued until disease control is established. The clinician may then decide to gradually withdraw the glucocorticoid first because of the inevitable toxicity associated with its chronic use. Withdrawal of the biologic agent may be attempted as well if the patient continues to exhibit no sign of disease. The

          Persistent chronic disease

         – Treatment of persistent chronic disease depends upon whether the patient has primarily systemic manifestations (eg, fever, rash, and serositis), primarily arthritis (which can be progressive and destructive), or both types of manifestations. Inhibitors of IL-1 and IL-6 appear to be the most effective of the biologic agents for primarily systemic disease and may be effective for chronic arthritis as well. Inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, blockers of T cell costimulation (

         – The potential toxicities of the drugs used to treat sJIA, including MAS, must be carefully balanced against the aggressive and often permanently disabling nature of unremitting disease. Thus, patients who present with severe sJIA or who are refractory to NSAIDs should be referred to an experienced pediatric rheumatologist for management, if possible. (See
