Hypernatremia due to water loss is called <strong>dehydration</strong>. This is different from <strong>hypovolemia</strong>, in which both salt and water are lost [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2307.html" rel="external">"General principles of disorders of water balance (hyponatremia and hypernatremia) and sodium balance (hypovolemia and edema)"</a>.)</p><p>Excessive water loss seldom leads to hypernatremia because the resulting increase in plasma osmolality stimulates thirst  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65195" href="/z/d/graphic/65195.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>), which leads to increased intake of fluids that lowers the serum sodium into the normal range. Thus, in patients who have access to water, hypernatremia primarily occurs in those who are unable to sense thirst or respond to thirst normally. This is most commonly seen in infants and in adults with impaired mental status, particularly older adults [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Older adult patients may also have a diminished thirst response to osmotic stimulation via an unknown mechanism [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. Adipsia due to hypothalamic disease is rare and usually coexists with arginine vasopressin deficiency; this combination often results in severe hypernatremia [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p>Less commonly, hypernatremia results from the administration of salt in excess of water, as can occur with hypertonic <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9928" href="/z/d/drug information/9928.html" rel="external">sodium bicarbonate</a> therapy during a cardiac arrest, inadvertent intravenous administration of hypertonic <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> during therapeutic abortion, or salt ingestion. Hypernatremia is also particularly common in critical care units when patients are administered large amounts of fluid, which may be hypertonic relative to their ongoing fluid losses, to correct hypovolemia or hypotension [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2376.html" rel="external">"Etiology and evaluation of hypernatremia in adults", section on 'Sodium overload'</a>.)</p><p>This topic will focus on the treatment of hypernatremia induced by water loss, which is the most common cause. The treatment of hypernatremia in patients with impaired thirst, with or without arginine vasopressin disorders, and with primary sodium overload will also be reviewed. The causes and evaluation of patients with hypernatremia and the treatment of arginine vasopressin deficiency and resistance are discussed elsewhere:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2376.html" rel="external">"Etiology and evaluation of hypernatremia in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2313.html" rel="external">"Arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus): Treatment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2382.html" rel="external">"Arginine vasopressin resistance (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus): Treatment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The evaluation and management of hypernatremia in children is presented separately.

As a result, such patients usually require hospitalization to correct the hypernatremia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2376.html" rel="external">"Etiology and evaluation of hypernatremia in adults", section on 'The importance of thirst'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1004884"><span class="h2">Initial fluid repletion regimen</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A detailed and stepwise description of how to calculate the water deficit and devise a fluid repletion regimen is presented later in this topic; those calculations provide the rationale underlying the therapeutic approach. In general, a net positive balance of 3 mL of electrolyte-free water per kilogram of lean body weight will lower the serum sodium by approximately 1 mEq/L [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Rationale for our therapeutic approach'</a> below.)</p><p>The therapeutic approach in patients with hypernatremia is presented here  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115660" href="/z/d/graphic/115660.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2255537440"><span class="h3">Patients with chronic hypernatremia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hypernatremia is chronic if it has been present for longer than 48 hours. Nearly all patients with hypernatremia will have chronic hypernatremia, even those who present with acute changes in mentation who are discovered to have hypernatremia. The initial regimen in such patients is  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115660" href="/z/d/graphic/115660.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8711" href="/z/d/drug information/8711.html" rel="external">Five percent dextrose in water</a>, intravenously, at a rate of (approximately 1.35 mL/hour x patient's weight in kg, up to a maximum of 150 mL/hour) or approximately 70 mL/hour in a 50 kg patient and 100 mL/hour in a 70 kg patient. Hypernatremic patients who are also hypovolemic will require isotonic fluids to expand the extracellular fluid volume. (See <a class="local">'Treating patients who also have hypovolemia or hypokalemia'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In clinically stable patients, chronic hypernatremia may also be corrected with oral rehydration (if level of consciousness is normal and the patient can drink adequately) or by administering water through a nasogastric tube. Although no data are available in adult patients with chronic hypernatremia, this approach was found to be safe and effective in children with hypernatremia due to gastroenteritis [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The goal of water repletion in patients with chronic hypernatremia is to lower the serum sodium by approximately 10 mEq/L in 24 hours but to avoid correcting the serum sodium by more than 12 mEq/L in 24 hours. Correction by 12 mEq/L in 24 hours is considered the maximum safe limit in infants; although exceeding this limit in adults has not been proven harmful, it has similarly not been proven beneficial. It is likely that our suggested initial regimen will lower the serum sodium by less than 10 mEq/L in 24 hours as many patients have ongoing free water losses (eg, osmotic diuresis, diarrhea, nasogastric suction) that will reduce the net positive electrolyte-free water balance, thereby slowing the rate of correction.

Acute hypernatremia is uncommon, occurring in patients with salt poisoning; in patients with arginine vasopressin disorders who acutely lose the ability to replace their water losses (eg, a patient with an arginine vasopressin disorder who undergoes surgery and does not receive adequate intravenous water); and in patients being treated for severe hyperglycemia, whose water losses from glycosuria are not adequately replaced.

Salt poisoning was due to self-ingestion in eight patients and iatrogenic sodium administration in ten patients; treatment was initiated within 12 hours from the onset of hypernatremia. Although the small sample size precluded a statistical analysis, correction rates were more rapid in the 13 patients who survived than in the five patients who died. Those who survived typically achieved a serum sodium ≤160 mEq/L within 8 hours, ≤150 mEq/L within 24 hours, and ≤145 mEq/L within 48 hours; the mean maximal correction rate in this group was 7.6 mEq/L per hour. Hyperglycemia due to rapid infusions of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8711" href="/z/d/drug information/8711.html" rel="external">5 percent dextrose in water</a> was a commonly observed, treatment-related, adverse event. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3725314473"><span class="h3">Patients with hypernatremia due to correction of hyperglycemia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As hyperglycemia and hypovolemia are corrected in a patient with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, the serum sodium concentration will rise because of an osmotic shift of water from extracellular fluid into cells and because of loss of electrolyte-free water in the urine as excess glucose is excreted. In patients with severe hyperglycemia whose serum sodium concentration is normal or high on presentation, severe hypernatremia is expected to emerge during the course of therapy.</p><p>There is no consensus on how this should be managed, and the rationale for our approach is presented below (see <a class="local">'Rate of correction in hypernatremia associated with severe hyperglycemia'</a> below):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cerebral edema has been described in children and young adults (ie, age less than 40 years) who have rapid correction of hyperglycemia and, therefore, hypertonicity. Accordingly, if hypernatremia develops as a consequence of correcting the hyperglycemia in young individuals, our goal is slow correction using the water repletion regimen described for patients with chronic hypernatremia. (See <a class="local">'Patients with chronic hypernatremia'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>However, cerebral edema has not been described in older individuals during rapid correction of hyperglycemia. Conversely, the relatively sudden onset of hypertonicity in older individuals caused either by severe hyperglycemia (due, for example, to hyperosmolar hyperglycemia) or by acute hypernatremia (due, for example, to salt poisoning) has been associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. Accordingly, if hypernatremia develops as a consequence of correcting the hyperglycemia in older individuals, our goal is rapid correction at the rate described above for patients with acute hypernatremia. (See <a class="local">'Patients with acute hypernatremia'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Because most of these patients are hypovolemic and hyperglycemic, with ongoing losses of sodium and water due to glycosuria, free water is usually administered as 0.45 percent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> rather than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8711" href="/z/d/drug information/8711.html" rel="external">5 percent dextrose in water</a>; infusion of 0.45 percent saline at 6 to 12 mL/kg per hour will provide the same amount of electrolyte-free water as 3 to 6 mL/kg per hour of 5 percent dextrose in water.</p><p></p><p>Because both serum sodium and serum glucose determine tonicity, we also recommend serial calculations of the "effective" serum osmolality (2 x Serum sodium + Serum glucose) to monitor the course in plasma tonicity.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H459117431"><span class="h2">Remeasure the sodium and modify the regimen</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The regimen for acute hypernatremia is designed to rapidly lower the serum sodium to normal (ie, 140 mEq/L) in less than 24 hours. During the rapid infusion of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8711" href="/z/d/drug information/8711.html" rel="external">5 percent dextrose in water</a> (or 0.45 percent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a>), repeated laboratory measurements are necessary every one to three hours to ensure that serum sodium concentration is falling at the desired rate, to avoid overshooting the desired endpoint, and to watch for hyperglycemia. In chronic hypernatremia, rapid infusion of free water is not necessary, and, with a slower rate of infusion, the need for frequent monitoring is much less. However, in all cases of hypernatremia, the fluid repletion regimen should be modified, if necessary, based upon the sequential measurements of serum sodium.</p><p>For the most commonly encountered patients with <strong>chronic hypernatremia</strong>, we suggest the following approach:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Remeasure the serum sodium four to six hours after the initial fluid repletion regimen is started.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If the repeat serum sodium indicates that the target rate of correction has been attained, then the frequency of measurement can be reduced in most patients to every 12 to 24 hours. However, in patients who have large, ongoing water losses due, for example, to hyperglycemia and glycosuria or arginine vasopressin resistance, the serum sodium should be measured approximately every four to six hours during the first day of therapy to ensure that the fluid repletion regimen is adequate.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If the target rate of correction has not been attained (the rate of correction is either too fast or too slow), then the infusion rate should be modified and the serum sodium should be remeasured four to six hours after the modification has taken place:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Most commonly, the rate of correction is too slow (ie, the rate of reduction in serum sodium is less than 0.25 mEq/L per hour) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. This usually results from ongoing free water losses due to an osmotic diuresis (eg, hyperglycemia in diabetic patients, urea in patients recovering from azotemia [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]), diarrhea, vomiting, or nasogastric suction, although a higher-than-estimated total body water (TBW) could also contribute. In such cases, the volume of ongoing free water loss should be estimated, and this quantity should be added to the fluid repletion regimen. Estimation of ongoing free water losses is presented below. (See <a class="local">'Replacing both ongoing water losses and the water deficit'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Less commonly, the rate of correction is too fast. In such cases, the infusion can be stopped or slowed (and the infusion rate recalculated using the updated information). Excessively rapid correction of chronic hypernatremia is of greatest concern in infants because rapid correction is common in patients with very small body size and because hypernatremic infants often develop cerebral edema and seizures during overaggressive rehydration. In these patients, it may become necessary to therapeutically increase the serum sodium concentration again to ameliorate iatrogenic brain swelling [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>]. Rapid correction of hypernatremia is much less likely to occur in adults than in infants; in adults, cerebral edema as a complication of overaggressive therapy is mostly a theoretical concern, and there is an association between slow correction rates and increased mortality [<a href="#rid17">17,20</a>]. We do not recommend re-raising the serum sodium in adults if the desired maximal correction rate has been exceeded.</p><p></p><p>Formulas designed to predict the change in serum sodium according to a given fluid regimen do <strong>not</strong> eliminate the need for careful monitoring of the serum sodium during therapy. These formulas often fail because they do not include insensible losses or urinary or gastrointestinal losses of electrolytes and water. Even formulas that include such variables are insufficiently accurate for clinical use because they cannot account for the following factors that impact the serum sodium concentration: rapid changes in fluid and electrolyte losses during therapy, internal exchanges between soluble and bound sodium stores, and shifts of water into and out of cells due to changes in intracellular osmolytes [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. We discourage the use of these formulas as the sole guide to therapy.

As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>How can vomiting or diarrhea, both of which lead to fluid loss that is isosmotic to plasma, induce hypernatremia?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Why does the addition of potassium salts (usually <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9795" href="/z/d/drug information/9795.html" rel="external">potassium chloride</a>) to an intravenous solution of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8711" href="/z/d/drug information/8711.html" rel="external">5 percent dextrose in water</a> diminish the degree to which this solution will lower the serum sodium?</p><p></p><p>Solute concentrations (osmolality) must be equal inside and outside most cells because water moves freely across most cell membranes in response to osmotic forces. Thus, although sodium is largely extracellular and potassium is largely intracellular, the two cations can be thought of as being in a single pool containing sodium, potassium, and water. As such, the sodium concentration in plasma water should equal the amount of sodium plus potassium dissolved in total body water divided by the volume of TBW [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. This theoretical relationship was validated empirically by measuring the body's content of sodium, potassium, and water using isotopes. A large fraction of the sodium measured isotopically is bound to polyanionic macromolecules (proteoglycans) in bone, cartilage, and connective tissue. Although sodium bound to proteoglycans is not free in solution, it is still exchangeable with the total sodium pool and is therefore measured isotopically. The bound portion of the sodium pool is reflected by an intercept in the equation that relates the plasma sodium concentration to exchangeable sodium plus potassium divided by total body water (TBW). Considering only the ions that are free in solution (and omitting the equation's intercept), the relationship can be described by a simple equation:</p><div class="formulaContainer"><div class="formula"><p>  Plasma [Na]  =  (Total body Na + Total body K)  ÷  TBW</p></div></div><p>This relationship applies over a wide range of plasma or serum sodium concentrations  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71817" href="/z/d/graphic/71817.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. The equation omits glucose and urea, which raise plasma osmolality when their concentrations are markedly elevated:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Glucose is an <strong>effective</strong> osmole, which, like sodium, alters the distribution of water across cell membranes. The above equation ignores glucose because it is present in a much lower molar concentration than sodium (eg, 5 mmol/L [90 mg/dL] versus 140 mmol/L). In the presence of hyperglycemia, however, the above equation is no longer valid, because glucose osmotically shifts water from cells, which expands the extracellular fluid volume and dilutes the plasma sodium concentration.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Urea is considered an <strong>ineffective</strong> osmole since it freely equilibrates across the cell membranes. When the plasma concentration of an ineffective osmole like urea changes, the intracellular concentration of the solute changes in parallel, and there is little or no water shift into or out of the cells. Thus, the above equation remains valid regardless of the blood urea concentration.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1840923"><span class="h3">Application to hypernatremia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hypernatremia is most often due to unreplaced water loss but can also be caused by the administration of intravenous hypertonic <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> or the ingestion of salt. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2376.html" rel="external">"Etiology and evaluation of hypernatremia in adults"</a>.)</p><p>The importance of sodium plus potassium as a determinant of the plasma sodium concentration has the following applications to the mechanism and treatment of hypernatremia:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fluid loss due to diarrhea is isosmotic to plasma, suggesting no direct effect on the plasma sodium concentration. However, the sodium plus potassium concentration in many forms of diarrhea (especially those due to nonsecretory etiologies) is between 40 and 100 mEq/L, with organic solutes, which do not affect the plasma sodium concentration, making up the remaining osmoles [<a href="#rid47">47,48</a>]. Unreplaced losses of this fluid will tend to raise the plasma sodium concentration since water is lost in excess of sodium plus potassium. As an example, this commonly occurs in patients treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9543" href="/z/d/drug information/9543.html" rel="external">lactulose</a> [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. By contrast, the sodium plus potassium concentration in secretory diarrheas (eg, cholera, VIPoma) is higher and may be similar to that in the plasma [<a href="#rid47">47,48</a>]. Loss of these fluids will have no direct effect on the plasma sodium concentration. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2376.html" rel="external">"Etiology and evaluation of hypernatremia in adults", section on 'Gastrointestinal losses'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The sodium plus potassium concentration in vomitus and sweat is usually much lower than 140 mEq/L [<a href="#rid50">50-52</a>]. In one study, for example, the sodium plus potassium concentration in gastric fluid averaged approximately 50 to 55 mEq/L [<a href="#rid50">50</a>]. Thus, loss of this fluid will tend to raise the plasma sodium even though the fluid is isosmotic to plasma. Hydrochloric acid accounts for most of the gap between the osmolality of gastric fluid and the contribution of sodium and potassium.</p><p></p><p>As described above, treatment of hypernatremia consists of correcting the free water deficit. Dextrose in water, which is isosmotic to plasma but electrolyte free, is most effective. In patients without diabetes mellitus, the glucose will usually be metabolized to carbon dioxide and water or stored as glycogen, neither of which contribute to osmolality. Thus, the osmotic effect is similar to the intake of free water.</p><p>However, many patients with hypernatremia have a reduced extracellular fluid volume, and some are also potassium depleted (due, for example, to vomiting or diarrhea). The administration of one-quarter or one-half isotonic <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> at the same volume will produce a smaller reduction in plasma sodium than dextrose in water. The reduction in plasma sodium will be even less if potassium is added to the saline solution. (See <a class="local">'Designing the fluid repletion regimen'</a> above.)</p><p>Thus, when considering either the etiology or treatment of hypernatremia, it is the <strong>sodium plus potassium</strong> concentration in the fluid lost or the fluid given, <strong>not the osmolality</strong>, that determines the effect on the plasma sodium concentration. In patients who are both hypernatremic and hypokalemic, the addition of potassium to the administered fluid will diminish the amount of electrolyte-free water that is given, thereby limiting the reduction in plasma sodium.

If the repeat serum sodium indicates that the target rate of correction has been attained, then the frequency of measurement can be reduced in most patients to every 12 to 24 hours. However, in patients who have large, ongoing water losses due, for example, to hyperglycemia and glycosuria or arginine vasopressin resistance, the serum sodium should be measured approximately every four hours during the first day of therapy to ensure that the fluid repletion regimen is adequate. The fluid repletion regimen should be modified, if necessary, based upon the sequential measurements of serum sodium.
