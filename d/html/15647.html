         Anemia affects one-third of the world's population, predominantly in women and children. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia [

         ]. While the prevalence of anemia is higher in Asian and African nations [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ], it remains a common condition in settings such as the United States and has important consequences for health and development. (See

         A presumptive diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is made by the combination of positive clinical risk factors and laboratory findings of a microcytic anemia, which may be mild. The diagnosis is confirmed if a trial of oral iron supplementation (3 mg/kg elemental iron per day) produces a hemoglobin (Hgb) rise of ≥1 g/dL within four weeks for children with mild anemia [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ] or ≥2 g/dL for those with moderate to severe anemia. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5925.html" rel="external">
          "Iron deficiency in infants and children &lt;12 years: Screening, prevention, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Evaluation for suspected iron deficiency anemia'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to embarking on the empiric trial of iron supplementation, every child should have a detailed dietary history; for young children, particularly those with a history of pica, we also suggest reviewing risk factors for lead exposure. Screening of blood lead levels should be performed if risk factors are identified. In some cases, including for children between three years of age and adolescence, and/or children with severe anemia (&lt;7 g/dL), additional laboratory testing beyond a complete blood count (CBC) is appropriate to ensure that the correct diagnosis has been made prior to initiating a trial of iron therapy.

          ferrous sulfate
         </a>
         , 3 mg/kg elemental iron, administered once daily. For optimal absorption, the iron should be given in the morning or between meals and with water or juice. Milk and/or dairy products should be avoided for approximately one hour before and two hours after each dose because such products limit iron absorption [

         formulation. While subjects on both arms demonstrated improvement, those receiving ferrous sulfate had a 1 g/dL greater increase in hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration over the 12-week period. Similarly, studies in adults have demonstrated efficacy, improved tolerance, and higher fractional absorption of oral iron in persons treated with relatively low doses of oral iron therapy [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8

         We do not recommend the use of transdermal iron delivery systems (patch). This modality is being studied in animal models and is commercially available, but there is no clinical evidence in humans that the transdermal route is effective or safe.

         Side effects commonly attributed to oral iron therapy include abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. However, placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that low-dose iron supplementation (eg, 3 mg/kg) and iron-fortified formulas rarely cause gastrointestinal symptoms [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10-15
         </a>
         ]. Larger doses rarely are necessary and may produce some degree of intolerance.
        </p>
        <p>
         Oral iron is best absorbed on an empty stomach when taken with water or juice. It should not be taken with milk or other dairy and calcium-containing products, as this will lessen its absorption. There are limited data on whether taking oral iron with meals lessens gastrointestinal side effects.
        </p>
        <p>
         Liquid preparations of iron occasionally cause gray staining of the teeth or gums. These effects are temporary and can be avoided or minimized by administering the iron with a syringe directed towards the back of the mouth and/or brushing the child's teeth or rinsing the mouth with water after administration of the drops. Liquid iron may also stain fingernails if the child places his or her hand in the mouth after iron administration.

         Iron therapy appears to have mixed effects on immune function and susceptibility to infection. There is no evidence that iron supplementation increases the risk for infection, with the possible exception of special populations in which malaria is endemic if initiated during high-transmission seasons. Studies in a cohort of Kenyan infants found that iron deficiency at the time of vaccination predicted decreased response, as measured by vaccine antibody titers, and that iron supplementation at the time of vaccination may improve the primary immune response [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. These findings suggest that improved iron status allows for optimal immunologic response to vaccines. (See

         All infants (&lt;12 months of age) should either be breastfed or receive iron-fortified formula. Infants should not be given low-iron formula or unmodified cow's milk. Feeding of infants with unmodified cow's milk (rather than formula or breastfeeding) may increase the risk for cow's milk protein-induced colitis with resultant intestinal blood loss. The resulting iron deficiency is exacerbated by lack of iron fortification in unmodified cow's milk. (See

         For all children 12 months of age and older, intake of cow's milk (or other milk such as almond or soy) should be limited to less than 20 oz per day. Higher intake of cow's milk in toddlers is associated with increased risk for iron deficiency [

          17,18
         </a>
         ]. When iron deficiency is first detected or suspected, the toddler's diet should be promptly evaluated and steps taken to reduce milk intake to below this threshold. If the child is still bottle-fed, discontinuation of the bottle will help to limit milk intake and encourage intake of other foods [

         All children should have follow-up laboratory testing to determine their response to therapeutic iron. This is important to monitor for adherence to therapy and to identify children who fail to demonstrate an appropriate response to therapy. Children who do not respond to oral iron therapy should be given additional support to optimize adherence, further evaluation to determine the cause of the anemia, and consideration of parenteral therapy [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20

         ]. The testing should be performed when the child is healthy, without signs of an acute or recent illness, because an infection may cause a transient decrease in Hgb.

         The timing of follow-up testing depends on the severity of the IDA:

         For patients who respond to treatment as described above, therapeutic iron should be continued for at least three months. Additional testing should be performed approximately three months after initiation of iron therapy, including a CBC, Hgb, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and red blood cell distribution width (RDW). Measurement of serum ferritin concentration also may be helpful to determine the need for further iron therapy to replenish iron stores. Many children require longer treatment courses to replenish iron stores.
        </p>
        <p>
         In general, we suggest continuing iron therapy for approximately one month after all CBC parameters have normalized (Hgb, MCV, and RDW) or upon achieving a serum ferritin value of &gt;20 ng/mL, provided that the appropriate dietary changes have been made. Early discontinuation of iron therapy and/or lack of improvement in the diet frequently lead to recurrent IDA.

         Patients who do not demonstrate an adequate rise in Hgb as described above should be reevaluated. Potential causes of recurrent or refractory IDA include ineffective treatment (nonadherence or incorrect dosing), persistent low-iron diet, an incorrect diagnosis, or ongoing blood loss or malabsorption  (

The clinician should interview the parent or caregiver to determine whether the supplement has been given at the appropriate dose and timing, whether the appropriate diet modifications have been made, and if there has been any significant intercurrent illness (which might cause a transient decrease in Hgb).

          Evaluation for other causes of anemia
         </strong>
         – The three most common causes of microcytic anemia in children are IDA, alpha or beta thalassemia trait, and anemia of chronic inflammation (also known as anemia of chronic disease)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65701" href="/z/d/graphic/65701.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ). These conditions can be assessed by measuring serum ferritin, Hgb analysis (to assess for beta thalassemia trait), and C-reactive protein (CRP), respectively. Newborn screening results should be reviewed to determine whether any abnormal Hgb were present. Elevated levels of Hgb Barts (on newborn screening) or Hgb H suggest the possibility of a form of alpha thalassemia. Alpha thalassemia trait (also known as alpha thalassemia minima) cannot be detected by Hgb analysis after the newborn period. Less common causes of mild microcytic anemia include Hgb C and Hgb E, which will be detected on Hgb analysis. (See

         In children with both thalassemia trait (alpha or beta) and iron deficiency, sufficient treatment of the iron deficiency is necessary to ensure accurate Hgb analysis results.

          Evaluate for gastrointestinal blood loss
         </strong>
         – In patients with persistent IDA despite appropriate dietary changes and iron therapy for at least three months, assessment for gastrointestinal blood loss is recommended. Test three stool samples for occult blood. If the results are positive, additional screening for common causes of gastrointestinal blood loss is appropriate, as outlined below. Of note, oral iron supplements do not cause false-positive results of the more current generation of tests for occult blood in stool (Hemoccult II, Hemoccult Sensa, and HemoQuant) [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21-23

         ] and, therefore, iron supplementation should not be stopped prior to such testing. This can be done before or after referral to a pediatric gastroenterologist. The following disorders should be considered, depending on the patient's age and characteristics (see

         Cow's milk protein-induced colitis – This is a common cause of occult or overt fecal blood loss in infants and should be considered for any infant whose diet includes cow's milk protein (through breast milk, cow's milk-based formula, or solid foods). It is most likely to be induced by feeding of unmodified cow's milk but can also occur in breastfed infants whose mother's diet includes cow's milk or in infants fed cow's milk-based formulas. The colitis generally responds to elimination of all milk protein from the diet of the infant and from the mother's diet if the infant is breastfed. (See

         Inflammatory bowel disease – Anemia is the most common extraintestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease. Patients may present initially with IDA or a combination of IDA and anemia of chronic inflammation, usually in association with other symptoms such as loose stools (with or without gross blood) and/or growth failure. Most children with inflammatory bowel disease are diagnosed in late childhood or adolescence, but a few present in early childhood or even infancy. Measurement of a CBC, iron panel, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), CRP, and serum albumin, as well as fecal occult blood and calprotectin, serve as an initial screen. However, a more detailed evaluation including endoscopy is warranted in children with clinical features suggesting inflammatory bowel disease. (See

          Consider rare causes of anemia
         </strong>
         – Extremely rare genetic mutations that interfere with iron transport result in a moderate to severe anemia that has hematologic parameters identical to IDA but is refractory to iron supplementation; this condition is termed iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24

          "Causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in adults", section on 'Inherited disorders/IRIDA'
         </a>
         ). IRIDA is unlikely in children with a history of a normal CBC and iron parameters prior to the onset of iron deficiency. We recommend performing an oral iron absorption test prior to consideration of genetic testing for IRIDA. The iron regulatory hormone hepcidin, which is elevated in patients with IRIDA, is now also a clinically available laboratory test. (See

         During the past three decades, new forms of intravenous (IV) iron therapy with good safety profiles have become available. Nonetheless, IV iron is generally considered second-line therapy for the majority of patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) due to its high cost, as well as potential for adverse effects, though rare [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. Indications for IV iron therapy include persistent anemia with oral iron intolerance, malabsorption, or nonadherence to oral iron therapy despite attempts at family/caregiver education and support. Children with ongoing or poorly controlled blood loss such as dysfunctional uterine bleeding may benefit from IV iron therapy. Those with underlying gastrointestinal disease, including conditions causing intestinal failure (eg, short bowel syndrome) or inflammatory bowel disease, may have particular difficulty tolerating oral iron and require early initiation of IV iron therapy. IV iron therapy may also benefit patients with other chronic conditions such as heart failure.

         The following four IV iron preparations are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in pediatrics. Selection among these options may depend on relative costs/insurance coverage and availability, time required for administration, and maximum permissible dose per infusion.

         is generally effective and is tolerated by most children. For optimal absorption, the iron should be given in the morning or between meals and with water or juice. Milk and/or dairy products should be avoided for approximately one hour before and two hours after each dose. (See

         Infants (&lt;12 months of age) should be fed with breast milk or iron-fortified formula. Infants should not be given low-iron formula or unmodified cow's milk.

         For patients six months and older, especially breastfed infants, ensure adequate consumption of iron in complementary foods. These include infant cereals, which are fortified with iron, foods rich in vitamin C, and pureed meats.

         For children older than 12 months of age, intake of milk (cow, almond, or soy) should be limited to less than 20 oz per day and bottle feeding should be discontinued to limit milk intake. Excessive milk intake is the primary reason for the development of IDA in this age group and can be associated with occult intestinal blood loss.

         <strong>
          Follow-up and monitoring
         </strong>
         – After beginning therapeutic iron, perform follow-up testing to determine the response, consisting of a complete blood count (CBC) or hemoglobin (Hgb). The testing should be performed when the child is healthy, approximately four weeks after beginning iron therapy for children with mild anemia or one to two weeks after beginning iron therapy in those with moderate to severe anemia. Follow-up is essential to confirm that the anemia was due to iron deficiency and to ensure that it is adequately treated. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Follow-up assessment for response'

         <strong>
          Management of responders
         </strong>
         – If the Hgb has increased by 1 g/dL, therapy is continued for at least three months, at which time, the CBC is retested. Iron therapy should be given for at least three months, and many children require longer treatment courses to replenish iron stores. In general, iron therapy should be continued for at least one month after the Hgb reaches the age-adjusted normal range. If possible, a serum ferritin concentration should be measured to check iron stores prior to discontinuation of iron therapy, with a goal threshold of ≥20 ng/mL. (See
         <a class="local">

          Further evaluation
         </strong>
         <strong>
          for nonresponders
         </strong>
         – Patients who do not demonstrate an adequate response within four weeks of initiating iron therapy should be reevaluated. Potential causes of recurrent or refractory IDA include ineffective treatment (nonadherence or incorrect dosing), ongoing low-iron diet, an incorrect diagnosis, or ongoing blood loss or malabsorption  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef101076" href="/z/d/graphic/101076.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). Our approach is as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         Interview the parent or caregiver to determine whether the iron therapy has been given at the appropriate dose and timing, whether the appropriate diet modifications have been made, and if there has been any significant intercurrent illness (which might cause a transient decrease in Hgb). The most common reason for failure is that the treatment plan was not correctly followed. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Nonresponders'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         If the patient has indeed been taking an appropriate dose of iron and has not had an intercurrent illness, assess detailed dietary history and/or perform additional laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis (eg, iron testing, if not previously performed) and rule out conditions that might simulate or complicate IDA such as thalassemia trait or anemia of chronic disease  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65701" href="/z/d/graphic/65701.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ). In addition, for children with persistent or recurrent IDA despite appropriate dietary changes and iron therapy, stool samples should be tested for occult blood. If the results are positive, additional screening should be performed for common causes of gastrointestinal blood loss, including cow's milk protein-induced colitis in infants and celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease in older children.

          Intravenous (IV) iron therapy
         </strong>
         – IV iron therapy may be warranted for patients with severe or persistent anemia who have proven oral iron intolerance, malabsorption, or nonadherence despite family/caregiver education and support to optimize oral therapy. Several forms of IV iron therapy with good safety profiles are available for use in pediatrics. Selection among these options may depend on relative costs and availability, time required for administration, and maximum permissible dose per infusion. (See
