The age at diagnosis of ovarian cancer is younger among patients with a hereditary ovarian cancer syndrome. The lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer is 1.3 percent. A detailed discussion of the epidemiology of EOC can be found separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83387.html" rel="external">"Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Incidence and risk factors", section on 'Incidence'</a>.)</p><p>An increased risk of EOC is associated with: increasing age, infertility, endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and cigarette smoking (for mucinous carcinomas  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59585" href="/d/graphic/59585.html" rel="external">table 1</a>)). Factors that are associated with a decreased risk include: previous pregnancy, history of breastfeeding, oral contraceptives, use of an intrauterine device, and tubal ligation.</p><p>Several ovarian cancer susceptibility genes have been identified, primarily <em>BRCA1, BRCA2</em>, as well as other genes in the homologous recombination pathway as well as mismatch repair genes associated with Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer). A personal or family history of breast cancer had been thought of as a risk factor for ovarian cancer; however, <em>BRCA</em> gene mutations appear to account for a significant amount of this increased risk. This is discussed in more detail below. (See <a class="local">'Testing for hereditary cancer syndromes'</a> below.)</p><p>A detailed discussion of the risk factors for EOC can be found separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83387.html" rel="external">"Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Incidence and risk factors", section on 'Probable risk factors'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H973333996"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinical presentation of EOC may be either subacute or acute. The majority of patients have stage III disease (disease that has spread throughout the peritoneal cavity and/or that involves lymph nodes) at diagnosis [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3238.html" rel="external">"Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/83387.html" rel="external">"Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Incidence and risk factors", section on 'Incidence'</a>.)</p><p>Most commonly, EOC presents in a subacute fashion (eg, pelvic or abdominal pain, bloating, gastrointestinal symptoms) in patients with either early or advanced disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78148" href="/d/graphic/78148.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). These conditions are usually evaluated in an outpatient setting. Alternatively, an adnexal mass may be discovered incidentally at the time of imaging performed for another indication. Symptoms of EOC are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5472.html" rel="external">"Early detection of epithelial ovarian cancer: Role of symptom recognition"</a>.)</p><p>Patients who present in an acute fashion are typically those with advanced disease who present with a condition that requires urgent care and evaluation (eg, pleural effusion, bowel obstruction).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6099419"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>EOC is a histologic diagnosis, based upon pathology evaluation of tissue following surgical removal of an ovary or fallopian tube or biopsies of the peritoneum. Less frequently, the diagnosis is based upon tissue or fluid obtained via image-guided biopsy, paracentesis, or thoracentesis.</p><p>The evaluation and diagnosis of EOC is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3238.html" rel="external">"Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H753398530"><span class="h1">TESTING FOR HEREDITARY CANCER SYNDROMES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All patients with a diagnosis of ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer should have a genetic risk evaluation, irrespective of their family history [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Patients with epithelial carcinoma of the ovary should be offered testing for BRCA1 or<em> </em>BRCA2 mutations as well as other familial cancer syndromes (eg, Lynch syndrome). Patients with clear cell, endometrioid, or mucinous ovarian cancer should be offered testing for DNA mismatch repair deficiency.</p><p>The presence of a familial cancer syndrome may impact treatment or posttreatment care. Surgical planning/counseling may be impacted as well. For example, patients with <em>BRCA</em> mutations have higher response rates to certain treatments, such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors [<a href="#rid7">7</a>], and patients with Lynch syndrome are at an increased risk of having a synchronous primary cancer (eg, endometrial, colon) at the time of surgical staging. These concepts are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/753.html" rel="external">"Genetic testing and management of individuals at risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2605.html" rel="external">"Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/121057.html" rel="external">"Management of ovarian cancer associated with BRCA and other genetic mutations"</a>.)</p><p>While genetic testing is recommended for all patients with EOC, not all patients have testing performed. In a retrospective study including over 8500 patients with EOC, biomarker testing was performed in only 55 percent of patients, but with higher rates (66 percent) during the last year of the study period (2020) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Medicaid insurance, lack of insurance coverage, poor performance status (ie, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] status ≥2), and nonserous histologies were associated with lower rates of biomarker testing. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6099427"><span class="h1">STAGING AND TREATMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surgical staging and cytoreduction followed by adjuvant chemotherapy is the management approach used for most patients with EOC.

However, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) prior to definitive surgery is an alternative option in selected patients (eg, stage IV disease, extensive extraperitoneal metastasis, poor performance status) with biopsy-proven müllerian malignancy  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef131639" href="/d/graphic/131639.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Patient selection and rationale for a neoadjuvant approach is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/86318.html" rel="external">"Patient selection and approach to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1103846"><span class="h2">Staging and surgical treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>EOC is surgically and pathologically staged according to the 2017 eighth edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the joint 2017 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO)/Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) classification system  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef113545" href="/d/graphic/113545.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p>Total extrafascial hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection is the standard staging procedure for EOC [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Cytology is performed of pelvic washings and the surface of the diaphragm; omentectomy is also performed. Cytoreduction (surgical "debulking"), which may include bowel or partial hepatic resection, is performed when metastases are evident. Staging is typically performed via laparotomy or laparoscopy, which may be robotically assisted. </p><p>Staging, cytoreductive operations, and other surgical treatment of EOC, as well as anesthesia for such procedures, are discussed in detail separately.

Those with advanced disease (stage III or IV) should also receive adjuvant therapy if they underwent primary surgical cytoreduction. However, patients who are unlikely to become optimally cytoreduced (ie, &lt;10 mm of residual disease at the end of surgery) or who are not good candidates for surgery due to medical comorbidities at the time of diagnosis may be considered for NACT instead. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/86318.html" rel="external">"Patient selection and approach to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer"</a>.)</p><p>The preferred chemotherapy regimen is a platinum-based combination (which may be used in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting).

However, the majority of patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer will relapse. Among those with relapsed disease, mortality is high. The five-year survival rates by stage for epithelial ovarian and fallopian tube carcinomas are shown in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef134243" href="/d/graphic/134243.html" rel="external">table 4</a>).</p><p>In an analysis of almost 1900 stage III ovarian cancer patients treated with primary surgery and six cycles of platinum/<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9735" href="/d/drug information/9735.html" rel="external">paclitaxel</a>, the major prognostic factors associated with improved outcome were younger age, low volume of residual disease, good performance status, and serous histology [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Others have reported that patients with residual tumor burden less than 1 cm in diameter without debulking did better than those who required debulking to achieve this residual tumor burden. Among patients who achieve optimal debulking, those with less advanced disease at initial surgery did better than those with more advanced disease [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. The importance of debulking is discussed elsewhere.

As an example, preliminary studies into these characteristics have found an association with relapse or survival with the decline in cancer antigen 125 after surgery and cancer cell expression of nuclear maspin expression [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. In addition, a 2013 meta-analysis found that high expression of the progesterone receptor (PR) was associated with improvement in overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.82-0.95). However, while elevated levels of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) predicted worse survival (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.05-1.89) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>], expression of estrogen receptors was not significantly associated with outcomes.</p><p>Retrospective studies have suggested that patients upstaged to stage IIIC based on nodal involvement alone may have a better prognosis than IIIC patients with gross intraabdominal disease larger than 2 cm, even if optimally cytoreduced [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>].

The average age at diagnosis of ovarian cancer in the United States is 63 years old. The age at diagnosis of ovarian cancer is younger among patients with a hereditary ovarian cancer syndrome (breast cancer susceptibility [<em>BRCA</em>] gene mutations or Lynch syndrome). The lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer is approximately 1 percent. (See <a class="local">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Histopathology</strong> – The majority of primary ovarian malignancies (95 percent) are derived from epithelial cells; the remainder arise from other ovarian cell types (germ cell tumors, sex cord-stromal tumors  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72286" href="/d/graphic/72286.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>)). Serous carcinoma, the most common histologic subtype of epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC), is similar in histology and clinical behavior to fallopian tube and peritoneal carcinomas. It has been proposed that ovarian and peritoneal carcinomas originate in the fallopian tubes.
