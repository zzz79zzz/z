         Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) refer to the sudden cessation of cardiac activity with hemodynamic collapse, typically due to sustained ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation. These events mostly occur in patients with structural heart disease (that may not have been previously diagnosed), particularly coronary heart disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         The event is referred to as SCA (or aborted SCD) if an intervention (eg, defibrillation) or spontaneous reversion restores circulation. The event is called SCD if the patient dies. However, the use of SCD to describe both fatal and nonfatal cardiac arrest persists by convention. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/963.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death", section on 'Definitions'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The cardiac diseases that lead to the genesis of the arrhythmia resulting in cardiac collapse and sudden death are varied, and the association with sudden death in some cases is poorly understood [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Identification of the patient at risk for sudden death and identification of the factors that precipitate the fatal arrhythmia continue to represent a major challenge. This topic will review the mechanisms and etiology of SCA. Treatment for SCA, the evaluation of survivors, and the outcomes of SCA are discussed separately. (See

          TYPES OF ARRHYTHMIAS LEADING TO SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The exact mechanism of collapse in an individual patient is often impossible to establish since, for the vast majority of patients who die suddenly, cardiac activity is not being monitored at the time of their collapse. As a result, the mechanism can only be inferred based upon information obtained after the process has been initiated.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, there have been many cases in which the initiating event has been witnessed or recorded [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-4
         </a>
         ]. This has usually occurred in patients being continually monitored in the coronary care unit, those with a 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) recording device, or those with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) account for the majority of episodes [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,4
         </a>
         ]. However, a bradyarrhythmia is responsible for some cases of SCD.
        </p>
        <p>
         A bradyarrhythmia and asystole were, in initial studies, less common causes of SCD, being observed in only about 10 percent of cases documented on an ambulatory monitor [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. A bradyarrhythmia is more often associated with a nonischemic cardiomyopathy [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ], while pulseless electrical activity, electromechanical dissociation, or asystole are the most common rhythms seen with a pulmonary embolism [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Other causes for pulseless electrical activity include myocardial rupture, tamponade, pneumothorax, hypoxemia, or drug overdose. In some cases, the bradyarrhythmia may result in a ventricular tachyarrhythmia as an escape mechanism.
        </p>
        <p>
         The distribution is different among patients with an ICD. Arrhythmic death accounts for 20 to 35 percent of deaths; post-shock or primary pulseless electrical activity (PEA, also called electromechanical dissociation) is a frequent cause of SCD in this setting [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/946.html" rel="external">
          "Secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy", section on 'Epidemiology'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The distribution of causes is also different with unmonitored out-of-hospital SCD. VF and pulseless VT appear to be responsible for 25 to 35 percent of episodes, although estimates vary widely. PEA accounts for as much as 25 percent of all cases of SCD.
        </p>
        <p>
         Among patients who collapse in an unmonitored setting in whom the exact time of onset and the etiologic arrhythmia are uncertain, asystole is often the first rhythm observed [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Asystole correlates with the duration of the arrest and may be the result of VF that has been present for several minutes or longer and then leads to loss of all electrical activity as a result of hypoxia, acidosis, and death of myocardial tissue  (

         In approximately 80 percent of patients with VT/VF, the sustained ventricular arrhythmia is preceded by an increase in ventricular ectopy and the development of repetitive ventricular arrhythmia, particularly runs of nonsustained VT [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. These spontaneous arrhythmias are present for a variable period of time prior to the development of VT/VF.

         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         Sustained monomorphic VT can accelerate to a rapid rate and then degenerate into VF. However, the relationship between monomorphic VT and SCD has been debated, with some studies suggesting that this arrhythmia is present in only a minority of patients with SCD [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. Thus, sustained monomorphic VT may simply be the company kept by VF or, in the appropriate setting such as recurrent coronary ischemia, it may provide a rapid wavefront that becomes fractionated, leading to VF [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ].

         </span>
         A sustained polymorphic VT can degenerate into VF. This is most often the result of underlying ischemia (ie, polymorphic VT without QT prolongation or a short QT interval of the sinus QRS complex), although it may also result from acquired or congenital QT prolongation or congenital short QT interval. A very rare cause of polymorphic VT without QT prolongation is a genetic abnormality associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic VT (a result of an abnormality of a ryanodine or calsequestrin gene).

        <p>
         In approximately one-third of cases, the tachyarrhythmia is initiated by an early R on T premature ventricular complex/contraction (PVC; also referred to a premature ventricular beats or premature ventricular depolarizations); in the remaining two-thirds, the arrhythmia is initiated by a late cycle PVC [

         VF results from multiple localized areas of microreentry without any organized electrical activity [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. The most likely mechanism is rotating spiral waves [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. This almost always occurs in the setting of underlying myocardial disease (or abnormalities in repolarization as in the long QT syndrome) that is often diffuse, resulting in heterogeneity of depolarization and the dispersion of repolarization. This disparity of electrophysiologic properties is a precondition for reentry. A triggering event is usually necessary to precipitate the arrhythmia in a vulnerable heart [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. The identification of a precipitating factor is more likely if there is less heart disease, and when there is more heart disease, a precipitating factor may be more difficult to define. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/954.html" rel="external">
          "Reentry and the development of cardiac arrhythmias"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The diversity in conduction and recovery parameters (myocardial heterogeneity) results in fragmentation of the impulse as it travels through the myocardium, producing multiple areas of localized reentry or multiple spiral wavelets of myocardial activation [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Since there is no organized electrical activity or myocardial depolarization, there is no uniform ventricular contraction resulting in failure of the heart to generate a cardiac output. With the development of global ischemia, the rate of VF decreases because of a reduction in the rotation period of the spiral waves which results from the increase in their core area [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The ECG in established VF shows high-frequency undulations or fibrillatory waves that are irregular in amplitude, morphology, and periodicity, occurring at a rate above 320/minute; organized QRS complexes are not seen  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef67777" href="/z/d/graphic/67777.html" rel="external">
          waveform 1
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. However, at the very onset of VF, the irregular fibrillatory waves may be coarse with a tall amplitude (and may resemble polymorphic VT) or may occasionally appear to be regular  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef118944" href="/z/d/graphic/118944.html" rel="external">
          waveform 2
         </a>
         ). The QRS complexes in this latter setting are indistinguishable from the T waves, and they appear to be sinusoidal in configuration. This finding may represent a brief period of an organized ventricular flutter, with a rate exceeding 260 beats per minute. In cases where the coarse fibrillatory waves resemble polymorphic VT, these initial ECG changes are collectively referred to as type I VF and may be associated with spontaneous defibrillation [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17
         </a>
         ]. Importantly, polymorphic VT may spontaneously terminate, while VF never self-terminates but only responds to defibrillation. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/983.html" rel="external">
          "Cardioversion for specific arrhythmias"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         As the duration of VF increases, progressive cellular ischemia and acidosis develop, resulting in an electrophysiologic deterioration, manifested by an increase in fibrillation cycle length and prolonged diastole duration between fibrillation action potentials [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,17,18
         </a>
         ]. During this later (type II) VF, the fibrillatory waves rapidly become finer and more irregular in amplitude, duration, and cycle length; spontaneous resolution or reversion with an antiarrhythmic drug has not been observed [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17
         </a>
         ]. Over a period of several minutes, the fibrillatory waves become so fine that there does not appear to be any electrical activity  (

         The following approximate frequency of causes of out-of-hospital SCDs have been described [

         Sixty-five to 70 percent of all SCDs are attributable to coronary heart disease (CHD) [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,20
         </a>
         ]. Most often, there is no evidence for an acute myocardial infarction, although acute ischemia may be the precipitating cause. Cardiac biomarkers are often elevated as a result of ischemia due to the arrhythmia or the result of defibrillation, making the diagnosis of an acute myocardial infarction preceding the event difficult to establish. However, the frequency of CHD is much lower in SCDs occurring under the age of 30 to 40 (eg, 24 percent under the age of 30 in a review of SCDs in the United States in 1999, and 8 percent in a series of autopsies in military recruits) [
         <a href="#rid19">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         These observations were largely made from analyses of all reported SCDs in the United States using the diagnosis on the death certificate, which is of uncertain accuracy. A similar frequency of CHD was noted in a study of 84 consecutive survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21

         ]. Immediate coronary angiography revealed clinically significant coronary disease in 60 (71 percent) of the patients, 40 of whom (48 percent of all patients) had an occluded coronary artery. The absence of an occluded coronary artery in the other 20 patients does not preclude an acute coronary syndrome (or ischemia) since absence of occlusion on early angiography is seen in 60 to 85 percent of patients with a non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome and in up to 28 percent of patients with an ST elevation MI.

         Five to 10 percent of SCDs are primary arrhythmogenic, occurring in the absence of structural heart disease (eg, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [VT]). In the absence of any structural abnormality or electrophysiologic abnormality on the ECG, these entities are often termed primary electrical disease [

         Although not specifically mentioned in most of these studies, heart failure (HF) is a relatively common cause of SCD. SCD accounts for 30 to 50 percent of deaths in patients with heart failure (HF) [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ], and the incidence of SCD appears to be increased during periods of worsening HF symptoms [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. Although the risk of both arrhythmic and nonarrhythmic death can be reduced with appropriate chronic HF therapy, the SCD risk remains elevated. Thus, virtually all SCD survivors with HF receive an ICD. A detailed discussion of arrhythmic events and the effect of medical therapy in HF patients is presented separately. (See

         The incidence of SCD increases with age in both men and women; however, at any level of multivariate risk, women are less vulnerable to sudden death than men and a higher fraction of sudden deaths in women occur in the absence of prior overt CHD  (

         A number of transient or reversible conditions may precipitate arrhythmic events and SCD. Identification of such conditions is critical both for the management of the underlying disorder and for determining the likelihood of recurrent SCD. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         In some of these cases, management of the underlying disorder is all that is necessary to reduce the risk of recurrent events. However, despite an apparently reversible trigger for SCD, many patients have a persistent risk of recurrent events (due to the presence of irreversible structural heart disease) and may benefit from implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy or, in some cases, pharmacologic therapy with an antiarrhythmic drug.

         The distribution of cardiac causes of SCD varies with age, the population studied, and geography. While coronary heart disease (CHD) is listed as the underlying cause of SCD on 62 percent of death certificates among the general population in the United States [

         Among SCD episodes that occur without warning, angiography demonstrates an occluded coronary artery in almost one-half of patients [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. Clinical and ECG changes appear to correlate poorly with coronary occlusion. Furthermore, among patients with typical ECG changes or cardiac enzyme elevations after resuscitation, it may be difficult on clinical grounds alone to determine whether an acute MI caused ventricular fibrillation (VF), or if VF resulted in myocardial injury because of the absence of coronary artery blood flow and/or the result of defibrillation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Among patients who present with an acute MI rather than SCD, the incidence of VF varies with the type of infarct and time. This topic is discussed in detail separately but will be briefly reviewed here. (See

         The largest experience with acute ST elevation MI comes from the GUSTO-1 trial of 40,895 patients who were treated with thrombolytic therapy [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40
         </a>
         ]. The overall incidence of VT or VF was 10.2 percent: 3.5 percent developed VT, 4.1 percent VF, and 2.7 percent both VT and VF. Approximately 80 to 85 percent of these arrhythmias occurred in the first 48 hours.

         The best data in non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome come from a pooled analysis of four major trials of over 25,000 patients [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. The overall incidence of VT or VF was 2.1 percent: VT occurred in 0.8 percent, VF in 1 percent, and VT and VF in 0.3 percent. The median time to arrhythmia was 78 hours, with the 25th and 75th percentiles being 16 hours and seven days.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         A peak incidence of VF within the first 48 hours after acute MI has also been noted in other reports [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42,43
         </a>
         ]. These episodes are presumably due to ischemia, while later onset VF may be related to healing of the infarct with the development of scar (and an increased risk of monomorphic VT) and associated with an increased risk of late SCD. Late SCD most often occurs in the first year, with the majority of events seen within the first few months and being due to a ventricular tachyarrhythmia [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44,45
         </a>
         ]. The risk of late VT/VF appears to be equivalent in patients with ST elevation and non-ST elevation infarctions [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
         These data do not include patients with SCD who do not survive until hospitalization. It has been estimated that more than 50 percent of deaths due to acute MI occur out of the hospital, and most episodes occur within one hour of symptom onset [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46
         </a>
         ]. Among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, the risk is greater in those with acute occlusion of the left anterior descending or left circumflex arteries (odds ratio 4.82 and 4.92, respectively, compared with those with a right coronary artery occlusion).
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, there are patients who have unstable coronary lesions that may be responsible for acute ischemic events, short of infarction, and that can cause electrical instability [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21,47,48
         </a>
         ]. The potential frequency of this effect was illustrated in a report of 84 resuscitated patients who underwent coronary angiography immediately upon admission: 76 percent had significant coronary disease, spasm, or an unstable lesion, and almost one-half had coronary occlusion [
         <a href="#rid21">

         The presence of severe coronary disease alone in a survivor of SCD does not prove a cause-and-effect relationship. Among patients who are not in the acute phase of a myocardial infarction, an appreciable risk of recurrent VT/VF may persist despite successful revascularization as a result of underlying myocardial disease and fibrosis [

         The presence of heart failure (HF), regardless of etiology, increases overall mortality and the incidence of SCD in both men and women. This was illustrated in a 38-year follow-up of patients in the Framingham Heart Study: the incidence of SCD in those with HF, compared with those without HF, was increased fivefold in both sexes, although the absolute risk in women was only one-third that of men  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58658" href="/z/d/graphic/58658.html" rel="external">

         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. The SCD death potential in men and women with HF was as great as that noted in patients with overt coronary heart disease (13.7 and 3.8 versus 12.9 and 2.4 per 1000 patients, respectively). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/968.html" rel="external">
          "Ventricular arrhythmias: Overview in patients with heart failure and cardiomyopathy"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Published series suggest a relatively consistent pattern with 30 to 50 percent of all cardiac deaths in patients with HF being categorized as sudden deaths, with or without preceding symptoms. However, it is often difficult to distinguish those dying suddenly and unexpectedly from those experiencing terminal arrhythmias in the setting of progressive hemodynamic deterioration. It has been suggested that progressive pump failure, sudden arrhythmic death, and sudden death during episodes of clinical worsening each account for approximately one-third of deaths [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. In the AIRE trial, for example, only 39 percent of sudden deaths were thought to be due to arrhythmia [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. VT degenerating into VF is the most common cause of SCD; a bradyarrhythmia or PEA is responsible in 5 to 33 percent of cases [
         <a href="#rid27">

         An acute coronary event appears to be the precipitating factor in some patients with HF. The prevalence of coronary thrombus, ruptured plaque, or myocardial infarction and its relationship to SCD was examined in an autopsy study of 171 patients with HF in the ATLAS trial [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55
         </a>
         ]. In patients with significant coronary artery disease, an acute coronary finding was found in 54 percent who died suddenly and in 32 percent who died of myocardial failure, although an acute coronary event had not been clinically diagnosed before death. In contrast, an acute coronary finding was uncommon in those without coronary disease, occurring in only 5 percent of those who died suddenly and in 10 percent of those who died of myocardial failure.

         Hypertension with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) appears to increase the risk of SCD. Myocardial hypertrophy due to hypertension is often associated with myocardial fibrosis and may be a precondition for ventricular arrhythmia. In addition, chronic subendocardial ischemia (accounting for the ST-T wave changes that are often seen) is often present with the hypertrophy and the increased oxygen demands; the subendocardium, which is the last part of the myocardium to receive blood supply, may have a reduced oxygen supply resulting in ischemia. In addition, many patients with hypertension and LVH have underlying coronary artery disease. Such patients appear to be less likely to have coronary thrombi than normotensives who had SCD [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56
         </a>
         ]. However, most such patients have severe coronary disease suggesting that the hypertrophied myocardium is more susceptible than normal myocardium to the effects of ischemia [

         SCD also occurs more commonly in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Among competitive athletes who die from SCD due to proven cardiac cause, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be one of

          58

         <strong>
          Background
         </strong>
         – Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) refer to the sudden cessation of organized cardiac electrical activity with hemodynamic collapse. The event is referred to as SCA (or aborted SCD) if an intervention (eg, defibrillation, cardioversion, antiarrhythmic drug) or spontaneous reversion restores circulation. The event is called SCD if the patient dies. However, the use of SCD to describe both fatal and nonfatal cardiac arrest persists by convention. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Mechanisms
         </strong>
         – The exact mechanism of collapse in an individual patient is often impossible to establish since, for the vast majority of patients who die suddenly, cardiac electrical activity is not being monitored at the time of their collapse. However, in studies of patients who were having cardiac electrical activity monitored at the time of their event, ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) accounted for the majority of episodes, with bradycardia or asystole accounting for nearly all of the remainder. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Arrhythmic mechanisms'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Arrhythmic mechanisms
         </strong>
         – In the majority of patients with VT/VF, sustained ventricular arrhythmia is preceded by an increase in ventricular ectopy and the development of repetitive ventricular arrhythmia, particularly runs of nonsustained VT. In approximately one-third of cases, the tachyarrhythmia is initiated by an early R on T PVC; in the remaining two-thirds, the arrhythmia is initiated by a late cycle PVC. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Arrhythmic mechanisms'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Common causes
         </strong>
         – There are many cardiac and noncardiac causes for a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia that can result in SCD  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ). Among all SCD in all age groups, the majority (65 to 70 percent) are related to coronary heart disease, with other structural cardiac disease (approximately 10 percent), arrhythmias in the absence of structural heart disease (5 to 10 percent), and noncardiac causes (15 to 25 percent) responsible for the remaining deaths.
