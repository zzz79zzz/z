         Polyradiculopathy refers to damage to multiple nerve roots sufficient to produce neurologic symptoms and signs such as pain, weakness, and sensory loss. This topic will review the signs and symptoms of polyradiculopathy by spinal region, and provide an overview of the most common etiologies. Diagnostic testing and the differential diagnosis are also discussed.

         Cervical and lumbosacral radiculopathy are discussed in greater detail separately. (See

         The main feature that distinguishes radiculopathy from other neurologic disorders is that the symptoms and signs of radiculopathy follow sensory and motor nerve root distributions  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53006" href="/z/d/graphic/53006.html" rel="external">

          table 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Because polyradiculopathy affects multiple nerve roots, it can mimic conditions such as polyneuropathy, plexopathy, and mononeuropathy multiplex, making the diagnosis quite challenging. Often, objective signs such as weakness, sensory loss, and reflex change are mild in comparison with complaints of pain and paresthesia. Although there are certainly exceptions to this rule, the subtlety of physical examination findings in polyradiculopathy is a consequence of collateral motor and sensory innervation and incomplete nerve root damage.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although precise details as to the prevalence of polyradiculopathy by spinal region are not readily available, 60 to 90 percent of single-level radiculopathies occur in the lumbosacral levels. Cervical radiculopathy accounts for most of the balance, with thoracic radiculopathy representing only a small minority of cases [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. It is likely that polyradiculopathy also follows a similar prevalence by region.

         <strong>
          Cervical polyradiculopathy
         </strong>
         – Cervical polyradiculopathy presents with neck pain radiating unilaterally or bilaterally into the arms with associated paresthesia, weakness, and sensory loss. The most common cause of cervical polyradiculopathy is degenerative cervical spondylosis, which can be accompanied by signs of cervical myelopathy such as spasticity and weakness in the lower extremities and bladder incontinence. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5271.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Thoracic polyradiculopathy
         </strong>
         – Thoracic polyradiculopathy is the least common of the polyradiculopathies, mainly because spinal stenosis and associated foraminal narrowing in this region is generally modest, even in older adults [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. Symptoms include pain and paresthesia in the chest and abdomen and, occasionally, abdominal wall weakness with herniation of abdominal contents [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>

         <strong>
          Lumbosacral polyradiculopathy
         </strong>
         – Lumbosacral polyradiculopathy accounts for the majority of polyradiculopathy cases. Central canal spinal stenosis in this region classically presents as neurogenic claudication, characterized by an aching that begins in the buttocks and descends into the knees, is brought on by walking or exercise, and is relieved by forward flexion (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7779.html" rel="external">
          "Lumbar spinal stenosis: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Symptoms'
         </a>
         ). Spinal stenosis may also affect the lateral recesses, producing compression of multiple nerve roots without claudication symptoms. Diabetic amyotrophy is another well-known, but less common cause of lumbosacral polyradiculopathy-like symptoms, although the exact localization of this disorder remains unresolved. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5268.html" rel="external">

         <strong>
          Cauda equina syndrome
         </strong>
         – A variant of lumbosacral polyradiculopathy is the cauda equina syndrome, in which the cauda equina itself is compressed within the spinal canal. The most common cause for this is a large, central disc herniation or central spinal canal stenosis [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Cauda equina syndrome is generally considered a neurologic emergency characterized by progressive lower extremity weakness, sphincter dysfunction, and saddle anesthesia. Other causes of cauda equina syndrome include epidural abscess, epidural tumor, intradural extramedullary tumor, the tethered cord syndrome, inflammatory conditions including spinal arachnoiditis, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and sarcoidosis. The cauda equina syndrome can also be caused by infection with cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, herpes zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, Lyme disease, mycoplasma, and tuberculosis. In the case of acute disk herniation, cauda equina syndrome may require urgent surgical evaluation and treatment to preserve neurologic function. (See

         The etiologies of polyradiculopathy can generally be divided into structural (or surgical) and nonstructural (or medical) categories  (

         Spinal stenosis refers to the narrowing of the spinal canal or intervertebral foramina. The majority of cases of spinal stenosis are caused by degenerative change (spondylosis), which is reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5271.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical features and diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy", section on 'Pathophysiology'

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Presenting with increasing frequency in the sixth and seventh decades, the initiating change in degenerative spinal stenosis is desiccation of the intervertebral discs. As a result of disc desiccation and loss of disc height, the posterior elements of the spine, including the facet joints and ligamentum flavum, become increasingly involved in axial load bearing. The stress placed on these structures results in compensatory bony and ligamentous hypertrophy and osteophyte formation, which narrows both the diameter of the central spinal canal and the neural foramina. Because the degenerative process occurs at multiple levels, polyradiculopathy often results.
        </p>
        <p>
         Additional causes of spinal stenosis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef81525" href="/z/d/graphic/81525.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ) include congenital conditions, such as hereditary spinal stenosis or achondroplasia, systemic conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis or Paget disease, and excess accumulation of epidural fat (epidural lipomatosis), which can be seen in patients with Cushing disorder, exogenous glucocorticoid exposure, or obesity [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-12
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The symptoms and signs of polyradiculopathy due to spinal stenosis vary according to spinal level:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         At the cervical level, symptoms of polyradiculopathy in isolation include arm pain, paresthesias, weakness, and sensory loss (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5271.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical features and diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy"
         </a>
         ). More worrisome is adjacent spinal cord dysfunction (ie, cervical myelopathy), characterized by leg weakness, gait difficulty, and incontinence of bowel or bladder. This condition is a potential neurologic emergency and may require urgent decompressive surgery. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4820.html" rel="external">
          "Cervical spondylotic myelopathy"

         Lumbar spinal stenosis may produce lower back pain radiating into the leg (similar to that which occurs in herniated nucleus pulposus) or may produce the clinical syndrome of neurogenic claudication [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Patients with neurogenic claudication characteristically experience aching that begins in the buttocks and descends to the knees, is brought on by walking or exercise, and is relieved by forward flexion. This can be distinguished from the symptoms of vascular claudication of the lower extremities, which is also characterized by pain with exercise. True vascular claudication is relieved by shorter rest periods, is not aggravated by lumbar extension, is accompanied by diminished or absent lower extremity pulses, and is often quite asymmetric. Central canal stenosis of the lumbar spine may also produce the cauda equina syndrome. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7779.html" rel="external">
          "Lumbar spinal stenosis: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical presentation'

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become the test of choice in the evaluation of spinal stenosis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59200" href="/z/d/graphic/59200.html" rel="external">
          image 1
         </a>
         ), although bony changes such as osteophyte formation are better demonstrated by computed tomography (CT). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5271.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical features and diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy", section on 'Imaging studies'

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Because the radiographic changes of spinal stenosis are so common in older patients, the history and physical examination remain critical in establishing the relevance of neuroimaging findings and determining appropriate therapy. Electrodiagnostic studies are often required to confirm the diagnosis when the clinical presentation is ambiguous. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5271.html" rel="external">

          "Closed spinal dysraphism: Pathogenesis and types", section on 'Tethered cord syndrome'
         </a>
         ). It can also produce polyradiculopathy in adults. During early development, a defect in the dura mater allows communication of the spinal cord with subcutaneous tissues, anchoring the conus medullaris and preventing the normal upward migration of the spinal cord [
         <a href="#rid14">

          15-17

         MRI usually demonstrates a low-lying termination of the conus medullaris below the inferior aspect of the L2 vertebral body  (

         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Associated structural abnormalities on MRI may include a thickened filum terminale, an intradural or extradural lipoma, a myelomeningocele, fibrous adhesions around the conus or the filum, a split cord malformation, and various types of cyst (eg, arachnoid, dermoid, enteric).
        </p>
        <p>
         Surgical treatment of tethered cord syndrome involves lumbar or sacral laminectomy with sectioning of the thickened filum terminale [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. A systematic review of 451 adult cases of tethered cord syndrome published in 2008 reported that surgery was associated with improvement in pain and motor deficits in 83 and 59 percent of patients, respectively, while sphincter and sensory deficits improved in 46 and 43 percent [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Most of the included studies were uncontrolled series or case reports, and few patients were followed beyond two years after surgery. Thus, the benefit of surgery for tethered cord syndrome is uncertain.

         Cancer arising outside the central nervous system can metastasize to any structure of the central nervous system, including the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, which are the dura mater, the arachnoid mater, and the pia mater. The last two are together called the leptomeninges. Tumor involvement of the leptomeninges is a condition termed "leptomeningeal metastases." It is also known by a variety of synonyms, including meningeal carcinomatosis, carcinomatous meningitis, and neoplastic meningitis. This disorder is reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail elsewhere. (See

         The cluster of symptoms related to leptomeningeal metastases is widespread  (

         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. Leptomeningeal metastases can cause polyradiculopathy by direct involvement of the spinal nerve roots, and radicular pain is the most common presenting symptom. The primary malignancies that most frequently produce this syndrome are leukemia, lymphoma, breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, and gastrointestinal cancers.
        </p>
        <p>
         The classic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings of leptomeningeal metastases include a high opening pressure, low glucose concentration, high protein concentration, lymphocytic pleocytosis, and positive cytology for malignant cells [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22-25
         </a>
         ]. Although most patients do not have all of these features, an entirely normal CSF examination is uncommon. Initial CSF examination reveals a mildly increased cell count in 50 to 60 percent of patients, elevated protein in a large majority, and low glucose in approximately 30 percent. In most cases, a positive cytology can be obtained with two separate samplings. However, CSF cytology is persistently negative in as much as 20 percent of patients with clinically or radiographically unequivocal leptomeningeal metastases. MRI may reveal contrast enhancement of the meninges and nerve roots in a diffuse or nodular pattern  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60153" href="/z/d/graphic/60153.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastases is straightforward in the patient with advanced cancer, multifocal signs and symptoms, typical imaging findings by MRI, and positive CSF cytology. A contrast-enhanced MRI of the symptomatic region of brain or spine should be obtained prior to obtaining CSF by lumbar puncture or ventricular tap, because CSF removal can cause iatrogenic meningeal enhancement. A positive CSF cytology establishes the diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastases. At least two CSF samples, with a combined total of 30 mL, should be evaluated. However, obtaining CSF for cytology may be unnecessary in patients with typical signs and symptoms, characteristic MRI findings, and known widespread malignancy. (See

         Patients with suspected thoracic radiculopathy should undergo EMG and nerve conduction studies to confirm the localization. Although disc herniations and spinal stenosis are uncommon at thoracic levels, MRI of the thoracic spine should be performed to exclude structural causes of radiculopathy. We suggest treatment with agents for neuropathic pain administered in the acute phase, such as tricyclic agents, dual reuptake inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine, or calcium channel alpha 2-delta ligands (

         Diabetic amyotrophy is a condition referred to by many names, including diabetic lumbosacral polyradiculoneuropathy, proximal diabetic neuropathy, diabetic lumbosacral plexopathy, and Bruns-Garland syndrome. It is not a pure lumbosacral plexopathy because it also affects the lumbosacral nerve roots and peripheral nerves. The most likely cause of diabetic amyotrophy and the clinically similar condition of idiopathic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy is ischemic injury from a nonsystemic microvasculitis [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26,27

         ]. (See

         Diabetic amyotrophy usually affects patients with type 2 diabetes of middle or older age [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26,27
         </a>
         ]. Diabetic amyotrophy may be the first symptom of diabetes, and most patients who develop the condition do not have poorly controlled diabetes. The traditional features include the acute, asymmetric, focal onset of pain followed by weakness involving the proximal leg. However, onset in the distal leg is not uncommon. Furthermore, the condition becomes more widespread and symmetric with time. In many cases, the symptoms and signs progress to affect the contralateral limb and the distal legs. There are associated symptoms including fever, weight loss, malaise, and autonomic failure. Progression occurs over months and is followed by partial recovery in most patients. (See

        <p>
         The diagnosis of diabetic amyotrophy is based upon the presence of suggestive clinical features in a patient with known or newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus. Appropriate laboratory investigations, particularly electrodiagnostic studies, and neuroimaging in select patients are useful to exclude other peripheral and central nervous system etiologies as a cause of the neurologic symptoms and signs. Abnormalities on electrodiagnostic studies typically involve the lumbar and sacral roots, the lumbosacral plexus, and the peripheral nerves [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. Nerve conduction studies show markedly reduced amplitudes of the compound muscle action potentials and sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs), while conduction velocities show only mild slowing. Needle EMG shows fibrillation potentials, decreased motor unit recruitment, and long-duration, high-amplitude motor unit action potentials. Paraspinal muscles are typically involved; this finding demonstrates that pathology must exist outside of the lumbosacral plexus. In patients who do not have diabetes, idiopathic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy is the primary consideration in the differential diagnosis. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5268.html" rel="external">

A less fulminant, more slowly progressing variant has also been described. On examination, a lumbar sensory level and lower extremity areflexia with saddle anesthesia can be demonstrated.

        <p>
         Electrophysiologic studies can help confirm the presence of polyradiculopathy and exclude a polyradiculoneuropathy; sensory action potentials are present in patients with a polyradiculopathy but are abnormal in patients with a polyradiculoneuropathy. MRI of the spine should be performed mainly to exclude structural lesions and cauda equina compression. Cauda equina root enhancement with contrast-enhanced MRI is seen in many, but not all, patients with cytomegalovirus-related polyradiculopathy. However, this finding is not specific and is seen in other inflammatory and neoplastic conditions involving the cauda equina.

         A diagnosis of polyradiculopathy can be made on purely clinical grounds in most cases. However, localization of the problem to multiple nerve roots is often challenging, because lesions of the brachial or lumbosacral plexus, peripheral nerves, or central nervous system can present similarly. The tests that are most useful in establishing a diagnosis of polyradiculopathy are the following:

         The most useful electrodiagnostic finding in patients with radiculopathy is an abnormal needle EMG. Needle EMG can provide evidence for physiologic abnormalities consistent with a radiculopathy, grade the extent and severity of injury, and determine its duration [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. One major limitation to needle EMG is in patients with polyradiculopathy predominantly affecting the dorsal roots, in whom there may be no abnormalities on needle EMG despite substantial pain.

         Needle EMG findings follow the distribution of a nerve root and include the following:

         Nerve conduction studies are routinely performed in conjunction with EMG. They are most effective in eliminating polyneuropathy, plexopathy, and compression neuropathy as diagnostic considerations. However, nerve conduction studies have several limitations in establishing the diagnosis of polyradiculopathy:

         Conventional nerve conduction studies assess a small number of spinal levels, predominantly C8-T1 in the upper extremities and L5-S1 in the lower extremities.

         Compound motor action potential (CMAP) amplitude abnormalities are relatively uncommon in radiculopathy: for patients with L5/S1 radiculopathies, CMAPs were absent from the extensor digitorum brevis or flexor digitorum brevis muscles in only 6 percent, and amplitudes were decreased in just 24.1 percent [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ]. The likelihood of finding CMAP abnormalities in patients with radiculopathy is reduced by overlapping nerve root innervation and the usually incomplete nature of root injury. For similar reasons, slowing of motor conduction velocities between proximal and distal stimulation sites is uncommon and, if present, limited in degree [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37

         Normal sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitudes favor a diagnosis of radiculopathy rather than plexopathy or polyneuropathy because nerve root injury in radiculopathy is most often proximal to the dorsal root ganglion [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. Nerve fiber degeneration therefore occurs in the axon that projects centrally from the dorsal root ganglion rather than from the one that projects peripherally. However, in inflammatory and neoplastic lesions, damage may occur distal to the dorsal root ganglion and consequently produce abnormal SNAPs. In addition, the SNAP amplitude may be reduced in a subset of patients with L5 nerve root involvement due to the dorsal root ganglia being located within the spinal canal itself [
         <a href="#rid43">

         The late responses known as the H reflex and F wave may be useful in the evaluation of polyradiculopathy.

         The H reflex is similar to a deep tendon reflex (see

          "Overview of nerve conduction studies", section on 'Late responses'
         </a>
         ). The main limitation of the H reflex test is that it is commonly obtainable only from the soleus and occasionally from the flexor carpi radialis, which restricts the number of spinal levels that it can assess. It is also somewhat nonspecific, being affected in disorders that injure the neurons anywhere along their path. However, one study that evaluated normal controls and those with an L5 or S1 radiculopathy found that the H reflex for S1 radiculopathy had a sensitivity and specificity of 50 and 91 percent, respectively [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. In a broader patient population referred for polyradiculopathy, in whom polyneuropathy, cervical monoradiculopathy, and plexopathy are the main considerations in the differential diagnosis, the sensitivity of the H reflex would likely increase while the specificity would likely decrease.

         <a href="#rid45">
          45
         </a>

         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. Although the sensitivity of F response abnormalities for radiculopathy is relatively high, the specificity is limited, as any injury along the entirety of the nerve that is being stimulated may produce prolonged F responses.

         MRI is the single best test for demonstrating structural pathology responsible for polyradiculopathy. Although spinal stenosis is readily identifiable on MRI, because degenerative changes of the spine are so common with age, the clinical history and examination are often the crucial factors in making a diagnosis of polyradiculopathy. Polyradiculopathy of infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic origin may be accompanied by abnormal contrast enhancement of the nerve roots or may be entirely normal, but when these conditions are suspected, a contrast-enhanced MRI is essential to exclude more common structural causes [

         Although most polyradiculopathies produce pain and paresthesias, pure motor presentations can mimic central nervous system conditions including cerebrovascular infarction or hemorrhage, demyelinating disease, and brain neoplasms. These conditions can be differentiated from polyradiculopathy by increased tone, hyperactive reflexes, and abnormal neuroimaging findings. (See

         Motor neuron disease is a neurodegenerative disorder of upper and lower motor neurons that can be difficult to distinguish from polyradiculopathy. Careful physical examination and electromyography (EMG) to detect abnormalities of bulbar muscles and midthoracic paraspinal muscles help to establish this diagnosis. The absence of any sensory complaints and pain is also suggestive of motor neuron disease over polyradiculopathy. (See

         Lumbosacral polyradiculopathy accounts for the majority of polyradiculopathy cases. Central canal spinal stenosis in this region classically presents as neurogenic claudication, characterized by an aching that begins in the buttocks and descends into the knees, is brought on by walking or exercise, and is relieved by forward flexion.

          Diagnosis and evaluation
         </strong>
         – A diagnosis of polyradiculopathy can be made on purely clinical grounds in most cases. However, localization of the problem to multiple nerve roots is often challenging because lesions of the brachial or lumbosacral plexus, peripheral nerves, or central nervous system can present similarly. The tests that are most useful for establishing a diagnosis of polyradiculopathy are electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the relevant spinal level with and without contrast, and lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnostic testing'

         above.)

         <strong>
          Differential diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The multiple nerve roots that are affected in polyradiculopathy may lead to widespread complaints that can be confused with a variety of neurologic, musculoskeletal, and vascular disorders. (See
