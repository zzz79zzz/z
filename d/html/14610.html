         Acute pharyngitis is one of the most common conditions treated in office practice, with millions of visits annually in the United States [

         This topic will address options for the symptomatic relief of throat pain in adults with acute pharyngitis of viral (the most common cause of infectious sore throat in adults) or bacterial etiology. One goal is to avoid overprescribing antibiotics while maintaining or enhancing rapport with patients by meeting both patient and clinician expectations about types of treatments and symptom relief.

         Most adult patients with acute pharyngitis have a viral illness for which they are seeking relief of sore throat pain, which is important for patient comfort and improves the patient’s ability to remain appropriately hydrated. A discussion of options for pain relief should accompany the evaluation for the etiology of the throat pain, which is most likely to be a self-limiting virus, less likely a bacterium requiring antibiotics (eg,
         <em>
          Streptococcus
         </em>
         or gonococcus) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ], and much less likely a very serious infection (eg, epiglottitis, peritonsillar abscess, deep space infections, or acute HIV).
        </p>
        <p>
         The evaluation of acute pharyngitis is discussed elsewhere. (See

         </span>
         Pain relief approaches for acute pharyngitis in adults include systemic oral analgesics, topical therapies, and environmental measures. These approaches have not been directly compared. Considerations when choosing among them include patient factors (eg, sore throat symptom severity, presence of concomitant symptoms, and any patient comorbidities) and therapy-related factors (eg, rapidity of onset of action, duration of effective relief, and side effect profile of each treatment). In general, we suggest a systemic oral analgesic. However, topical therapies are reasonable for patients who want to avoid systemic therapy or are at higher risk for side effects from systemic therapy. Additionally, using more than one therapy could provide the most effective symptom relief. If patients use more than one pharmacologic therapy, they should be cognizant of active ingredients in the preparations to avoid exceeding the recommended dose.

         Over-the-counter oral analgesics, including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),

          aspirin
         </a>
         , typically have a duration of effectiveness of several hours. They generally act within one to two hours to relieve sore throat symptoms due to acute pharyngitis. Oral analgesics act systemically; thus, they will address concomitant symptoms that may accompany sore throat, such as fever or headache. The choice among oral analgesics, and permissible maximum dosages, may be limited by such factors as renal or hepatic dysfunction or by current or prior gastric irritation or reflux symptoms. We typically start at a low dose and titrate up. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Choosing an oral analgesic'
         </a>
         below.)

         </span>
         Topical treatments applied locally to the throat via lozenge or spray, or via beverages or foods (eg, ice, tea, soup, and honey), are generally quicker-acting than oral analgesics, and they typically have a shorter duration of pain relief which may necessitate frequent re-dosing. There is no evidence that a particular topical lozenge or spray is superior in efficacy. The choice among them is dependent on availability and clinician or patient preference. For patients with significant sore throat pain, hydration with frozen (eg, ice or popsicles) or warmed liquids (eg, teas, soups), rather than room temperature or refrigerated fluids, may provide relief. Foods that coat the throat, including honey and hard candies, can facilitate intake of calories while temporarily relieving throat pain. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Therapies applied topically to the throat'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Nonpharmacologic environmental approaches may also be of benefit. These approaches include adjusting humidity to avoid a dry environment and avoiding exposure to irritants such as tobacco smoke. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Helpful environmental approaches'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Glucocorticoid treatment is generally not recommended due to the potential for harms balanced against the only slight improvement in rate of pain reduction as compared with oral analgesics. However, steroids may be appropriate in the exceptional patient who presents with severe throat pain and/or inability to swallow. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Limited role of glucocorticoids'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         If the patient’s only symptom is throat pain, we discourage use of multisymptom preparations (eg, combination analgesic and decongestant) containing ingredients to improve symptoms the patient is not experiencing, in order to minimize the side effect potential.

          —
         </span>
         Prescribing antibiotics when they are not indicated puts the patient at risk for antibiotic side effects and increases the community risk of bacterial resistance. Additionally, prescribing antibiotics for a sore throat of viral etiology increases the likelihood that a patient will make return visits to medical providers for similar symptoms, presumably due to "medicalization" of a typically self-limited illness [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Even when appropriately treating documented bacterial pathogens such as group A
         <em>
          Streptococcus
         </em>
         , antibiotics contribute minimally to the speed with which symptoms of pharyngitis improve [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Nonetheless, overtreatment of acute pharyngitis continues to represent a major cause of inappropriate antibiotic use.
        </p>
        <p>
         In an effort to avoid unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, we discuss the risks and benefits of antibiotic and non-antibiotic approaches, including the value of non-antibiotic pain relief; validate the patient’s goals and concerns; educate them about the expected clinical course and time to improvement; and emphasize open communication to bring worsening symptoms or lack or expected improvement to attention. This discussion may be facilitated by use of patient education material (see

        <p>
         Contrary to the belief of many clinicians that acquiring an antibiotic prescription is the most important priority for patients, the majority of those who visit a primary care clinic for acute sore throat seek advice on prognosis and symptom management [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. In a multinational survey of 5196 adults with pharyngitis from 13 different countries, &gt;80 percent of respondents visited a doctor seeking guidance about pain relief, as well as information about cause, seriousness, and expected recovery, while far fewer endorsed wanting an antibiotic [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Similarly, in an observational study of 300 visits for acute pharyngitis, over 80 percent of patients were interested in pain relief, reassurance, and information about their illness [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Only 38 percent were hoping specifically for an antibiotic prescription. Further, the subgroup of patients who considered receipt of an antibiotic very or rather important valued pain relief more than those who considered an antibiotic of little or no importance. The multivariate analysis showed that hope for pain relief remained a strong predictor of the desire to receive an antibiotic prescription, suggesting that patients believe an antibiotic offers the best approach for achieving this goal. Additionally, data from a study of pediatric visits for upper respiratory infections showed that unnecessary antibiotic usage decreased and patient satisfaction increased when education was provided both about how to decrease symptoms and about why antibiotics were not indicated [

         and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) remain the two most rigorously studied for this indication.

         Oral analgesics are readily available, and systematic reviews and randomized trials have confirmed the efficacy of each systemic analgesic studied for treating acute sore throat [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10-17

         ]. Data from randomized trials suggest that NSAIDs are more effective than

          acetaminophen

        </p>
        <p>
         Given the lack of clear evidence of clinical superiority of a particular agent, the choice of systemic analgesic may be guided by patient preference, which is often based on prior favorable experience with a particular agent. However, it is important for patients with certain comorbidities to avoid choosing an oral analgesic which could exacerbate them; for example, patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypertension, ulcer history, or significant renal insufficiency should be advised to use

         We suggest not prescribing glucocorticoids on a routine basis for the relief of pain associated with an acute sore throat, regardless of etiology. The use of glucocorticoids depends upon severity of illness and should be restricted to the exceptional patient who presents with severe throat pain and/or extreme difficulty swallowing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although there is evidence that glucocorticoid use can slightly decrease the duration of throat pain, analgesics such as NSAIDs or

         are also effective and carry significantly less risk of toxicities such as serious mood changes or hyperglycemia. For similar reasons, IDSA guidelines recommend against the use of glucocorticoids for patients with streptococcal pharyngitis [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ], and the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) does not recommend using a glucocorticoid for acute sore throat [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Others, however, have recommended a single dose of oral glucocorticoids for symptom relief of pharyngitis, emphasizing shared decision-making with the patient [

         Systematic reviews of randomized trials assessing the efficacy of glucocorticoids for pain reduction in acute pharyngitis have generally found only modest benefit (slightly quicker reduction of pain by up to approximately half a day) [

         <a href="#rid25">
          25

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         However, there were important limitations with these studies: antibiotics were coadministered in most of the trials, and use of concurrent analgesics was allowed and rarely controlled, making it difficult to isolate the pain-relieving effect of one treatment versus another. Glucocorticoid formulations given were heterogeneous, given at different doses and time intervals and by different routes of administration.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most of the trials occurred in the emergency setting, so generalizability to patients in an office setting is uncertain. In one office-based randomized controlled trial that evaluated a single dose of

         10 mg for adults who visited a primary care clinician for acute pharyngitis and were not given an immediate prescription for antibiotics, the benefit was also small [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27

        </p>
        <p>
         Although no difference in rates of adverse side effects was seen with short-term glucocorticoid use, in some studies the number of patients studied was too small to detect potentially rare but serious toxicities resulting from even such limited courses of steroids [

         Several local therapies for sore throat in the form of lozenges/drops, throat sprays, gargles, and teas are available for relief of pain related to pharyngitis. In addition, adjusting the temperature and texture of beverages and foods helps to relieve the pain of swallowing, which can limit hydration and caloric intake during acute pharyngitis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Advantages of local therapies include direct application of the pain relief intervention in high concentration to the area of inflammation and decreased risk of toxicity compared with systemic administration of certain medications. There is also a much more rapid onset of effectiveness, although duration of effectiveness may be shorter than for systemic therapies. Ease of administration is also a consideration; some therapies are easier to access quickly (lozenges, sprays), while others may require preparation (teas, gargles).
        </p>
        <p>
         We generally suggest that topical therapies be used as an adjunct or an alternative to an oral analgesic for significant sore throat pain. There is no evidence that a particular topical lozenge or spray is superior in efficacy. The choice among them is dependent on availability and clinician or patient preference. We do encourage patients to consume warm fluids, teas with honey, and soups and to try letting ice chips or popsicles melt in their mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
         Topical therapies have been studied to varying degrees. One study used scintigraphy to compare the delivery efficacy of technetium-labeled lozenges, tablets, sprays, and gargles in the mouth and throat of healthy volunteers [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28

         Adjusting the temperature and texture of foods and beverages may provide local relief of sore throat pain. While data showing benefit are quite limited, these approaches are intuitive. We typically advise these measures since they are likely to be safe with minimal adverse effect, and patients often describe relief of symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with significant sore throat pain, hydration with frozen (eg, ice or popsicles) or warmed liquids (eg, teas, soups), rather than room temperature or refrigerated fluids, may provide relief. Very cold foods can have a numbing-like effect that temporarily reduces or alleviates the pain of swallowing. Ice cubes or frozen popsicles facilitate hydration; ice cream and frozen yogurt provide caloric intake.
        </p>
        <p>
         Warm fluids and foods, including teas, soups, and soft non-irritating foods, may be better tolerated by patients with throat pain than irritating foods (eg, rough-textured or spicy foods) or fluids at room temperatures. Foods that coat the throat, including honey and hard candies, can facilitate intake of calories while temporarily relieving throat pain.

         Many teas and herbal drops are marketed in the United States for relief of sore throat pain; this is supported by a weak evidence base. These products may contain agents identified as demulcents, which have mucilaginous effects purported to relieve oral and pharyngeal mucosal irritation by forming a soothing film over mucous membranes. Commonly used demulcents in such products include honey, pectin, and

         Pain relief is one of the most important reasons for patient visits for acute pharyngitis. Contrary to provider preconceptions, receiving an antibiotic prescription is not a top priority for patients seeking care. Overtreatment of acute pharyngitis represents a major cause of inappropriate antibiotic use. (See

         In an effort to avoid unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, we discuss the risks and benefits of antibiotic and non-antibiotic approaches, including the value of non-antibiotic pain relief; validate patient’s goals and concerns; educate them about the expected clinical course and time to improvement; and emphasize open communication to bring worsening symptoms or lack or expected improvement to attention.

         Pain relief approaches for acute pharyngitis in adults include systemic oral analgesics, topical therapies, and environmental measures. Considerations when choosing among them include patient factors (eg, sore throat symptom severity, presence of concomitant symptoms, and any patient comorbidities) and therapy-related factors (eg, rapidity of onset of action, duration of effective relief, and side effect profile of each treatment) (see

         For most patients, we suggest a systemic oral analgesic (eg, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug [NSAID],

          Grade 2C

          ibuprofen

         appears to be somewhat more effective than acetaminophen, although it is uncertain if the efficacy benefit is clinically meaningful in treating pharyngitis. The choice among them depends on patient preference after taking into account the side effect profile of the treatment(s) in the context of the patient’s comorbidities. (See
         <a class="local">

          Grade 2C

         Topical therapies alone are a reasonable alternative for patients who want to avoid systemic therapy or are at higher risk for side effects from it, but their duration of effectiveness is shorter than for systemic therapies. It is also reasonable to use topical therapies in combination with systemic therapy. Topical therapies in the form of lozenges or sprays have the advantages of direct application to the affected throat area, rapid onset of action, and minimal toxicity risk. It may also be helpful for patients to consume warm fluids, teas with honey, and soups and to let ice chips or popsicles melt in their mouth. (See
