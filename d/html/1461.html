         The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), a report produced by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the World Health Organization (WHO), defines an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as "an event characterized by dyspnea and/or cough and sputum that worsens over ≤14 days, which may be accompanied by tachypnea and/or tachycardia and is often associated with increased local and systemic inflammation caused by airway infection, pollution, or other insult to the airways" [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2

         ]. This generally includes an acute change in one or more of the following cardinal symptoms:

         An important step in the initial evaluation is to determine whether the patient needs hospitalization or can be safely managed at home  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114160" href="/z/d/graphic/114160.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1

         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3
         </a>
         ]. More than 80 percent of exacerbations of COPD can be managed on an outpatient basis, sometimes after initial treatment in the office or emergency department. If the exacerbation appears life-threatening or if there are indications for ventilatory support (eg, hypoxemic or hypercapnic respiratory failure), the patient should be admitted to the intensive care unit as quickly as possible. (See
         <a class="local">

         below.)
        </p>

         Prior guidelines have also included severe airflow limitation, a history of frequent or severe exacerbations, and frailty as factors associated with increased risk for severe exacerbations. These factors may also be considered in triaging COPD patients for hospital admission.
        </p>
        <p>
         Intensive home care, which generally includes nurse visits, home oxygen, and physical therapy, may be an alternative to hospitalizations in certain locations (eg, United Kingdom, Europe) for selected patients with an exacerbation of COPD [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-9
         </a>
         ]. A meta-analysis of seven trials noted that intensive home care resulted in equivalent clinical outcomes and substantial cost savings compared to hospitalization [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. However, these trials excluded sicker patients with an impaired level of consciousness, respiratory acidosis (arterial pH &lt;7.35), acute electrocardiographic or chest radiographic changes, or coexisting medical morbidities. Although care at home is feasible in highly selected patients without these characteristics, implementation requires a dedicated support team to conduct ongoing clinical assessments and provide home care. In general, home management of the patient who satisfies criteria for hospitalization should be considered infrequently and only when optimal home care is available.

         For outpatients with a COPD exacerbation characterized by breathlessness that interferes with daily activities, systemic glucocorticoid therapy appears to have a small but beneficial effect with a reduction in rate of relapse. Patients with elevated eosinophil counts at the time of exacerbation are most likely to benefit [

          18-20

         The benefit of oral glucocorticoids in the outpatient management of COPD exacerbations was examined in a randomized trial of 147 patients discharged from the emergency department after presenting with an acute exacerbation of COPD [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21

          prednisone

         (40 mg) or placebo for 10 days. Patients who received prednisone were less likely to return to the emergency department or their clinician with increasing dyspnea within 30 days (27 versus 43 percent, p = 0.05)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60719" href="/z/d/graphic/60719.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). In addition to a lower rate of relapse (the primary end point of the study), prednisone therapy was associated with decreased dyspnea and a greater improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV

         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. Although over 90 percent of the patients in the trial were initially admitted, these findings can likely be extrapolated to the less ill outpatient population. (See

         In the STARR2 trial, patients presenting to a primary care clinic with COPD exacerbation were assigned to either an eosinophil-based triage strategy, where 14 days of systemic glucocorticoids (30 mg of oral

         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. The two strategies were found to be noninferior in the trial; glucocorticoid treatment did not improve and may have worsened respiratory symptoms and treatment failure rates in those without eosinophil elevations. However, some adverse effects may have arisen from the relatively long glucocorticoid treatment course used in this trial, and the need for point-of-care blood testing may be a significant barrier to implementation in some primary care settings. Our authors feel that further study is necessary before widespread adoption of an eosinophil-directed treatment strategy.

         Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, the cause of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-2019), can mimic or result in a COPD exacerbation. When an exacerbation of COPD occurs in the course of COVID-19, the usual guidelines for prompt initiation of systemic glucocorticoids for a COPD exacerbation should be followed, as delaying therapy can increase the risk of a life-threatening exacerbation. Patients with COPD are at increased risk for severe respiratory illness associated with COVID-19 and therefore qualify for prioritized outpatient therapy.

          11,36,37

          36

However, intravenous glucocorticoids are typically administered to patients who present with a severe exacerbation, who have not responded to oral glucocorticoids at home, who are unable to take oral medication, or who may have impaired absorption due to decreased splanchnic perfusion (eg, patients in shock).

          22,37,38
         </a>
         ]. A growing body of evidence favors using a moderate, rather than high dose of glucocorticoids, for most patients with an exacerbation of COPD. As an example, a comparative analysis of glucocorticoid dosing examined outcomes of 79,985 patients admitted to the hospital with an exacerbation of COPD, excluding those requiring intensive care [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38
         </a>
         ]. The median glucocorticoid dose administered in the first two days was 60 mg for those on oral therapy and 556 mg for intravenous therapy. The risk of treatment failure was no greater with the lower dose. As this was an observational study and did not include objective measures of airflow limitation, it is possible that less ill patients were more likely to receive oral treatment.

         On the other hand, for patients with impending or actual acute respiratory failure due to a COPD exacerbation, many clinicians use an intravenous formulation at a higher dose, such as the equivalent of

In an observational cohort study, among 17,239 patients admitted to an intensive care unit with an exacerbation of COPD, a dose of methylprednisolone of 240 mg/day or less, compared with a higher dose (methylprednisolone &gt;240 mg/day), was not associated with a mortality benefit, but was associated with slightly shorter hospital (-0.44 days; 95% CI -0.67 to -0.21) and ICU (-0.31 days; 95% CI -0.46 to -0.16) lengths of stay [

The mean cumulative prednisone dose was significantly higher in the 14-day group, but treatment-related adverse effects, such as hyperglycemia and hypertension, were not different between the groups. While this study suggests that a five-day course may be comparable to 14 days for many patients, further study is needed to determine whether some patients might do better with the longer course.

         At the end of the treatment course, glucocorticoid therapy may be discontinued rather than tapered, if the patient has substantially recovered. Alternatively, the dose is tapered over another seven days, as a trial to determine whether a longer course of glucocorticoid therapy is required. However, long-term systemic glucocorticoids should rarely be used for stable COPD if therapy is otherwise optimized. Tapering solely because of concerns about adrenal suppression is not necessary if the duration of therapy is less than three weeks (a duration too brief to cause adrenal atrophy). (See

          Noninvasive ventilation
         </strong>
         – NIV (also known as noninvasive positive pressure ventilation [NPPV]) refers to mechanical ventilation delivered through a noninvasive interface, such as a face mask, nasal mask, orofacial mask, or nasal prongs (nasal pillows). NIV reduces mortality and the intubation rate and is the preferred method of ventilatory support in many patients with an exacerbation of COPD [

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Most commonly, NIV is initiated in the emergency department, intensive care unit (ICU), or a specialized respiratory unit to enable close monitoring, although this has not been formally studied and varies among hospitals. Patients who develop acute or acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis (as characterized frequently by PaCO

          2
         </sub>
         &gt;45 mmHg [6 kPa] and pH &lt;7.35) are the subgroup who are most likely to benefit from an initial trial of NIV. Bilevel positive airway pressure is typically used. For other patients with nonhypercapnic respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation, a trial of NIV is also appropriate, although the derived benefit may be considerably less. (See

         The goals of palliative care are to prevent and relieve suffering and aid in the end-of-life care of patients with advanced disease. Some patients may have had a goals of care discussion with their physician and will have an advance directive in place. For those who do not have an advance directive, it is helpful for patients, their families, and their healthcare providers to review the patient’s understanding of their diagnosis and expected disease course, and then reflect on the patient’s goals, values, and beliefs. This information is used to inform decision-making in the context of care that is medically reasonable and appropriate. (See

         For patients with COPD, an important component of decision-making is whether intubation and mechanical ventilation are appropriate and desirable in the event of respiratory failure. When discussing a potential trial of mechanical ventilation for an exacerbation of COPD, parameters for discontinuing mechanical ventilation should be included. The potential outcomes of intubation/mechanical ventilation should be described to help the patient’s decision-making. While prognostic uncertainty and variable trajectory of illness make communication about these issues difficult [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ], it is important to incorporate this uncertainty into advance care planning.
        </p>
        <p>
         Given the high one-year mortality rate after hospitalization for a COPD exacerbation, it may be appropriate to consider a palliative care referral during or shortly after a hospitalization for COPD. Palliative care consultation can help explore the patient's understanding of their illness and prognosis, assess and manage symptoms (eg, dyspnea, anxiety, panic, depression), discuss the patient's goals of care, place of death preferences, and advance directives, and help implement end-of-life care.

         It is hoped that comprehensive discharge planning will help speed symptom resolution and reduce readmissions for COPD exacerbations.

         40 to 60 mg once daily (or the equivalent) for 5 to 14 days. A higher dose of glucocorticoids may occasionally be used in patients with impending or actual respiratory failure. In general, results with oral dosing are similar to those with intravenous dosing. (See
