Detailed descriptions of the different disorders are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2941.html" rel="external">"Overview of inherited disorders of glucose and glycogen metabolism"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6197.html" rel="external">"Metabolic myopathies caused by disorders of lipid and purine metabolism"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5151.html" rel="external">"Mitochondrial myopathies: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>An overview of the biochemistry of energy metabolism in muscle is also discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6212.html" rel="external">"Energy metabolism in muscle"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The symptoms, signs, and laboratory abnormalities resulting from a metabolic myopathy vary with the underlying defect. Most patients with a metabolic myopathy (eg, glycogen storage diseases, carnitine palmitoyltransferase deficiency) have dynamic rather than static symptoms, and therefore usually complain of exercise intolerance or muscle pain and cramps with exercise. Nevertheless, other patients may develop progressive muscular weakness that is usually proximal (mimicking inflammatory myopathy or limb girdle muscular dystrophy) but may be distal. In a smaller group of patients, both dynamic and static symptoms predominate (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59733" href="/z/d/graphic/59733.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Disorders of glycogen metabolism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Inherited disorders that result in abnormal storage of glycogen are known as glycogen storage diseases. These disorders have largely been categorized by number according to the chronology of recognition of the responsible enzyme defect (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef54417" href="/z/d/graphic/54417.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). The age of onset varies from birth to adulthood. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2941.html" rel="external">"Overview of inherited disorders of glucose and glycogen metabolism"</a>.)</p><p>In patients with defects of carbohydrate metabolism, muscle symptoms are induced by either brief isometric exercise, such as lifting heavy weights, or by less intense but sustained dynamic exercise, such as swimming, climbing stairs, or running. Acute muscle breakdown may lead to myoglobinuria, cramps, and muscle swelling.</p><p>In young children, defects in glycogenolysis may present with liver dysfunction, hepatomegaly, failure to thrive, hypoglycemia (sometimes with associated hypoglycemic seizures), gross motor delay, peripheral neuropathy, cardiac involvement, hemolytic anemia with jaundice, splenomegaly, and myoglobinuria. Intellectual disability, upper and lower motor neuron involvement with sensory loss, sphincter problems, and neurogenic bladder may also be observed.</p><p>The principal symptoms and signs, however, are those related to exercise intolerance and recurrent myoglobinuria [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Patients with defects of glycogen metabolism usually complain of easy fatigability upon exertion and, occasionally, of muscle stiffness induced by exercise. In some cases, brief rest when muscle symptoms develop can subsequently result in improved exercise tolerance, referred to as the spontaneous "second wind" [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. This occurs because of increased blood glucose levels related to mobilization of hepatic glucose [<a href="#rid3">3</a>] and/or a metabolic switch from glycogen to fatty acid and protein metabolism. "Second wind" also can be induced by the infusion of carbohydrate fuel (eg, glucose) or lipids [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>Patients with certain glycolytic defects (eg, muscle phosphofructokinase deficiency), however, are unable to achieve a spontaneous second wind [<a href="#rid5">5</a>] or have worsening of symptoms after the administration of glucose (the "out of wind phenomenon") [<a href="#rid6">6</a>] due to inability of muscle to utilize glucose as energy source in the setting of decreased availability of free fatty acids and ketones [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2941.html" rel="external">"Overview of inherited disorders of glucose and glycogen metabolism"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2907.html" rel="external">"Phosphofructokinase deficiency (glycogen storage disease VII, Tarui disease)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Disorders of lipid metabolism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The metabolic myopathies resulting from disorders of lipid metabolism include the following conditions (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6197.html" rel="external">"Metabolic myopathies caused by disorders of lipid and purine metabolism"</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Carnitine deficiency syndromes</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fatty acid transport defects</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Defects of beta-oxidation enzymes</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Neutral lipid storage disease</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lipin-1 deficiency</p><p></p><p>With disorders of lipid metabolism affecting muscle, symptoms are usually induced by infections, fever, prolonged or intense exercise, and prolonged fasting. These patients, in contrast to those with glycogen metabolism defects, do not develop true muscle cramps or contractures, and do not experience a "second wind."</p><p>There are four main clinical and laboratory features that should lead the clinician to suspect a fatty acid oxidation disorder [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Involvement of tissues dependent on fatty acid oxidation, such as the heart, muscle, and liver</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recurrent episodes of hypoketotic hypoglycemia (ketoacidosis does not occur because fatty acids cannot be converted to ketoacids in the liver)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute metabolic decompensation in association with fasting</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Alterations in plasma and tissue concentrations of carnitine</p><p></p><p>Other conditions that can lead to metabolic decompensation among patients with fatty acid oxidation defects include cold-induced shivering thermogenesis and infection with vomiting:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>With cold exposure, shivering depends heavily upon long-chain fatty acid oxidation [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>After prolonged fasting or during infections, children can become comatose and present with symptoms similar to Reye syndrome</p><p></p><p>Skeletal muscle, heart, and liver are highly dependent upon efficient fatty acid utilization. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and liver, particularly during fasting when glycogen and glucose stores have been depleted. In addition, resting muscle and exercising muscle during mild to moderate prolonged exercise derive most of the required energy from fatty acid oxidation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6212.html" rel="external">"Energy metabolism in muscle"</a>.)</p><p>Among fasting patients with fatty acid oxidation defects, the free fatty acids cannot be metabolized because of the existing metabolic block; as a result, they are stored in the cytoplasm as triglycerides, thereby resulting in progressive lipid storage myopathy with weakness, hypertrophic and/or dilated cardiomyopathy, and fatty liver. In addition, with fasting, glucose and glycogen stores are depleted and ketone bodies are not generated because of the existing metabolic block. As a result, the ratio of serum free fatty acids to ketones increases from the normal ratio of 1:1 to more than 2:1, which is highly suggestive of a block in beta-oxidation [<a href="#rid1">1,9</a>].</p><p>Serum carnitine levels vary with the different defects of lipid metabolism. With carnitine transport defects, for example, total serum carnitine is significantly reduced (eg, &lt;5 percent of normal) and the esterified fraction is normal [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. This finding is probably related to both reduced renal carnitine reabsorption, leading to carnitine leak, and defective intestinal carnitine absorption.</p><p>By comparison, in the majority of cases of intramitochondrial beta-oxidation defects, the amount of total serum carnitine is reduced to &lt;50 percent of normal, and the esterified carnitine fraction is increased to &gt;50 percent of normal (normal: 10 to 25 percent in the fed state and 30 to 50 percent during fasting) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. This occurs because the accumulating longer-chain-length acylcarnitines are reabsorbed much more easily at the renal tubular reabsorptive site than free carnitine. As a result, the free carnitine fraction will be reduced [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Lipid metabolism defects'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H400795808"><span class="h2">Mitochondrial disorders</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Exercise intolerance due to premature fatigue is a common manifestation of mitochondrial diseases [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The exercise intolerance is usually more severe than muscle weakness. In contrast to those with glycogen metabolism defects, patients with isolated mitochondrial myopathy do not develop true muscle cramps or a "second wind." Resting venous lactic acidosis is common in such patients, who are sometimes misdiagnosed as having chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5151.html" rel="external">"Mitochondrial myopathies: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Myoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with metabolic myopathies, such as those with inherited disorders of glycogenolysis, glycolysis, lipid metabolism, or purine metabolism (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61324" href="/z/d/graphic/61324.html" rel="external">table 3</a>), are at increased risk for developing myoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis. The manifestations and complications of rhabdomyolysis result from muscle cell death, with the release of intracellular muscle constituents into the circulation.</p><p>The metabolic myopathies represent a small percentage of all cases of rhabdomyolysis but are relatively common causes among patients with recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis after exertion.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a series of 475 hospitalized adults with rhabdomyolysis, the most frequent etiology was an exogenous toxin (46 percent), a category that included alcohol, illicit drugs, and prescribed drugs (eg, antipsychotics, statins, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10053" href="/z/d/drug information/10053.html" rel="external">zidovudine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9293" href="/z/d/drug information/9293.html" rel="external">colchicine</a>, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9566" href="/z/d/drug information/9566.html" rel="external">lithium</a>) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Less common causes included trauma, seizures, immobility, critical illness myopathy, exercise, heat/dehydration, and hypothermia. Multiple factors could be identified in 60 percent of cases. An underlying myopathy or metabolic muscle defect was diagnosed in only 10 percent of the patients [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. In this group, recurrences were common, the incidence of acute renal failure was low, and typically only one etiologic factor could be identified. Myoglobinuria was detected by dipstick/ultrafiltration in 19 percent of the patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a series of 191 children treated in the emergency department of a pediatric tertiary care hospital, the most common causes of rhabdomyolysis were viral myositis, trauma, and connective tissue diseases, found in 38, 26, and 5 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Among children with creatine kinase (CK) values ≥6000 int. units/L, a genetically determined metabolic myopathy or undiagnosed dermatomyositis was present in 6 of 37 (16 percent), while in children with CK levels of 1000 to 5999 int. units/L, the proportion was 10 of 154 (6 percent). The incidence of acute renal failure in children in this study (5 percent) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>] was much lower than that reported in the adult series (46 percent) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>] discussed above.</p><p></p><p>Although exercise intolerance, often dating back to childhood, is common in patients with mitochondrial defects, rhabdomyolysis with resultant myoglobinuria is rare [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. However, myoglobinuria has been reported in patients with mutations involving cytochrome b, cytochrome c oxidase, and the MELAS A3260G mutation [<a href="#rid15">15-17</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5151.html" rel="external">"Mitochondrial myopathies: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>The frequency of myoglobinuria due to a metabolic defect may vary among children and adults. In a large series of children with recurrent myoglobinuria, an enzyme abnormality could be detected in only 24 percent of the cases [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]; by comparison, a similar adult series of 77 patients found a biochemical abnormality in 47 percent [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The most common metabolic cause of recurrent myoglobinuria in both adults and children is carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 deficiency. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115918.html" rel="external">"Specific fatty acid oxidation disorders", section on 'Carnitine palmitoyltransferase type 2 deficiency'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In young children, lipin-1 deficiency, caused by mutations in the LPIN1 gene, usually presents with recurrent rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria, mostly in the setting of intercurrent infections with fever and less frequently with fasting or exercise. Episodes of rhabdomyolysis related to this disorder may be lethal in up to one-third of patients. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6197.html" rel="external">"Metabolic myopathies caused by disorders of lipid and purine metabolism", section on 'Lipin-1 deficiency'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1) mutations are the cause of several types of neuromuscular disease, including various congenital myopathies (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6150.html" rel="external">"Congenital myopathies"</a>), rhabdomyolysis with myoglobinuria induced by heat and exercise, and susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia triggered by certain anesthetic agents such as inhalation anesthetics (except <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10086" href="/z/d/drug information/10086.html" rel="external">nitrous oxide</a>) and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9952" href="/z/d/drug information/9952.html" rel="external">succinylcholine</a> [<a href="#rid20">20,21</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Myoglobinuria may occur in patients with dystrophinopathies or caveolinopathies (eg, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1C) [<a href="#rid22">22</a>] and Becker muscular dystrophy [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6190.html" rel="external">"Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6149.html" rel="external">"Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The clinical features of rhabdomyolysis include myalgias, weakness, and elevated serum muscle enzymes (including CK). Acute muscle breakdown of sufficient severity can lead to myoglobinemia and myoglobinuria. The urine acquires a brownish, cola-like color, and the supernatant is positive for heme in the absence of red blood cells in the sediment. The degree of myalgias and other symptoms varies widely, and some patients are asymptomatic. Fever, malaise, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal symptoms may be present. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5169.html" rel="external">"Rhabdomyolysis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Other manifestations include fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, many of which precede or occur in the absence of acute kidney injury and hepatic injury. Hypovolemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, and metabolic acidosis can develop. Significant hyperkalemia may result in life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias. Later complications include acute kidney injury, hypercalcemia, compartment syndrome, and, rarely, disseminated intravascular coagulation.</p><p>The diagnostic approach to myoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis is discussed in detail separately (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5169.html" rel="external">"Rhabdomyolysis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7196.html" rel="external">"Urinalysis in the diagnosis of kidney disease", section on 'Red to brown urine'</a>). Briefly, the laboratory findings that characterize rhabdomyolysis include an acute elevation in the serum CK level (typically at least five times the upper limit of normal at presentation) and other muscle enzymes, followed by a decline in these values three to five days after cessation of muscle injury. The other characteristic finding is the reddish-brown urine of myoglobinuria, but this finding is often absent because of the relative rapidity with which myoglobin is cleared.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H400795568"><span class="h1">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of a possible metabolic myopathy should be considered in patients with dynamic symptoms (eg, exercise intolerance, acute reversible weakness, rhabdomyolysis) or static symptoms (eg, fixed weakness, cardiomyopathy, neuropathy) [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p>Other, more common etiologies of myopathy (eg, toxic, traumatic, alcohol- and drug-related, endocrine, viral, and inflammatory) should be excluded by appropriate testing prior to investigating a metabolic etiology.</p><p>The evaluation needed to confirm the diagnosis of a metabolic myopathy (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71018" href="/z/d/graphic/71018.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) is guided by a constellation of findings, including the clinical presentation, the type of muscle involvement, specific laboratory abnormalities (particularly elevations in serum creatine kinase and myoglobinuria), patient age, family history, the results of histologic and pathologic examinations, and, increasingly, genetic testing [<a href="#rid25">25</a>].</p><p>The conventional approach to the diagnosis (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71018" href="/z/d/graphic/71018.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) of patients with suspected metabolic myopathies includes serum and urine metabolic testing, the forearm semi-ischemic exercise test, electromyography, muscle biopsy, and, in some cases, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, if available (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56365" href="/z/d/graphic/56365.html" rel="external">table 4</a>).

The induction of myoglobinuria by pure exertion or by toxic factors, such as infection and fever, may suggest a particular disorder. As an example, a clinical presentation with features of a Reye-like syndrome or with myoglobinuria induced by toxic factors suggests a fatty acid oxidation defect [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Myoglobin is released from damaged muscle in parallel with creatine kinase (CK). Myoglobin is a monomer that is not significantly protein-bound and is therefore rapidly excreted in the urine, often resulting in the production of red to brown urine. It appears in the urine when the plasma concentration exceeds 1.5 mg/dL. Visible changes in the urine only occur once urine levels exceed approximately 100 to 300 mg/dL, although it can be detected by the urine (orthotolidine) dipstick at concentrations of only 0.5 to 1 mg/dL. Myoglobin has a half-life of only two to three hours, much shorter than that of CK. Because of its rapid excretion and metabolism to bilirubin, serum levels may return to normal within six to eight hours.

In addition, the ratio of free carnitine to total carnitine is usually normal or low in most fatty acid metabolism defects, except for CPT1A deficiency in which the ratio is high [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. If serum acylcarnitines are elevated, the further separation and identification of the individual acylcarnitine profile could prove useful in the diagnosis of specific defects.

However, children younger than five years of age may not be cooperative with the testing protocol.</p><p>The test begins with the placement and stabilization of a needle in a superficial antecubital vein of the arm to be exercised. Resting blood samples are obtained for serum lactate, pyruvate, CK, and ammonia. The blood pressure cuff is inflated to a level just above the diastolic pressure and the patient is asked to perform one-per-second hand grips with at least 75 percent of the maximum voluntary hand grip.

Therefore, this test should be conducted with caution, and never under total ischemic conditions. It should be aborted immediately if the patient develops any symptoms.</p><p>After 1 minute of intermittent handgrip exercise, a single blood sample of CK is obtained, and sequential samples of lactate, pyruvate, and ammonia are obtained at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 minutes.

In this setting, analysis will need to be focused on specific possible biochemical defects, based upon the results of the preliminary noninvasive evaluation. In some instances, it may be possible to perform the direct enzymatic assay in cultured skin fibroblasts. This assay will be profitable diagnostically only if the enzymatic defect is expressed in this cell type.

Most patients with a metabolic myopathy have dynamic rather than static symptoms, and therefore usually complain of exercise intolerance or muscle pain and cramps. Nevertheless, other patients may develop progressive muscular weakness that is usually proximal (mimicking inflammatory myopathy or limb girdle muscular dystrophy), but is sometimes distal. In a smaller group of patients, both dynamic and static symptoms predominate (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59733" href="/z/d/graphic/59733.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).

The free fatty acids cannot be metabolized because of the existing metabolic block; as a result, they are stored in the cytoplasm as triglycerides, thereby resulting in progressive lipid storage myopathy with weakness, hypertrophic and/or dilated cardiomyopathy, and fatty liver. Symptoms are usually induced by prolonged exercise and prolonged fasting. (See <a class="local">'Disorders of lipid metabolism'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Exercise intolerance due to premature fatigue is a common manifestation of mitochondrial diseases, and the exercise intolerance is usually more severe than muscle weakness. In contrast to those with glycogen metabolism defects, patients with isolated mitochondrial myopathy do not develop true muscle cramps or a "second wind." Resting venous lactic acidosis is common in such patients. (See <a class="local">'Mitochondrial disorders'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with metabolic myopathies, such as those with inherited disorders of glycogenolysis, glycolysis, lipid metabolism, or purine metabolism (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61324" href="/z/d/graphic/61324.html" rel="external">table 3</a>), are at increased risk for developing myoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis. The metabolic myopathies represent a small percentage of all cases of rhabdomyolysis but are relatively common causes among patients with recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis after exertion. The most common metabolic cause of recurrent myoglobinuria in both adults and children is carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 deficiency.
