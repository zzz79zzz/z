Thus, it is important when reading this topic or any source of information about these substances to ensure that it correlates with the latest version of the WADA prohibited substance list. </p><p>In the past decade, the WADA list of banned performance-enhancing substances has grown to over 192 drugs and methods. In addition to androgens and other hormones, the WADA prohibited list includes stimulants, recreational drugs such as narcotics and cannabinoids, beta agonists, diuretics, and other prescription medications. In 2011, section S0 was added to the WADA list to include substances that have yet to be approved for human use, are still in clinical development, or have been discontinued (S0). In 2021, WADA introduced a new category to the prohibited list, "Substances of Abuse." Athletes found using substances in this category may be required to seek appropriate treatment, as well as serve a period of sanction.

Higher doses may lead to aggressive behavior and psychosis. Particularly during activity, stimulant use predisposes to extra exertion, which can lead to heatstroke and rhabdomyolysis [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9638" href="/d/drug information/9638.html" rel="external">Methylphenidate</a> has been shown to increase core temperature even at rest [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].

However, in rare cases, a given sporting body may define such a period differently. </p><p>There are exceptions to this proscription for some drugs in some circumstance (described below). Otherwise, all stimulants on the WADA list are banned, and substances with a similar chemical structure or similar biologic effect are also banned. In some cases, urinary cutoffs have been set, in which case a substance may be legal in small therapeutic doses.</p><p>Stimulants commonly used for performance enhancement include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Amphetamines</strong> – Amphetamines are used by athletes to increase alertness and concentration [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Although <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="99959" href="/d/drug information/99959.html" rel="external">amphetamine</a>, methamphetamine, and cocaine are primarily drugs of abuse, amphetamine salts (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9341" href="/d/drug information/9341.html" rel="external">dextroamphetamine</a>) are used for legitimate treatment of some conditions (eg, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD).

Ephedra is commonly used by athletes to promote alertness, endurance, and strength, although no studies have demonstrated a significant athletic benefit [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The alkaloids in ephedra have been identified as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9114" href="/d/drug information/9114.html" rel="external">ephedrine</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9833" href="/d/drug information/9833.html" rel="external">pseudoephedrine</a>, and phenylpropanolamine. Supplements containing ephedra may be purchased over the counter, and ephedra is included in some cough medicines, decongestants, and diet agents. Adverse effects may be significant, with one sporting fatality in 2003 attributed to the supplement. WADA prohibits urinary concentrations greater than 10 mcg/mL of ephedrine or methylephedrine. Ephedra is reviewed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1392.html" rel="external">"Overview of herbal medicine and dietary supplements", section on 'Adverse effects'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9114" href="/d/drug information/9114.html" rel="external">Ephedrine</a> – Ephedrine is heavily used among athletes to improve alertness and to accelerate weight loss, and can be obtained with relative ease on the Internet. According to a 2007 review article, ephedrine use among track and field athletes may be over 50 percent [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Among respondents to a 2004 survey of United States college hockey players, 38 percent reported using ephedrine, while 46 percent reported using <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9833" href="/d/drug information/9833.html" rel="external">pseudoephedrine</a> [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Survey results from nearly 900 male and female college athletes and non-athletes published in 2008 reported that just over 6 percent of male athletes and 4.5 percent of female athletes used ephedrine, but the surveys did not include pseudoephedrine [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. According to the 2016 WADA prohibited list, ephedrine may be used in small doses. Urinary cut off levels are listed below.

In 2013 the US FDA made the manufacture and sale of methylhexanamine illegal due to toxicity and side effects. However, DMAA continues to be found as an unacknowledged additive in many sports supplements, particularly those purchased over the Internet, and hence is the cause of many inadvertent violations of anti-doping rules.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">DMAA has numerous other names, such as dimethylpentylamine, pentylamine, geranamine, forthane, and 2-amino-4-methylhexane.

HIFs are transcription factors that mediate the cellular response to hypoxia, which develops in muscles during high intensity exercise. HIFs determine the genetic response to hypoxia, including regulation of erythropoietin production, the metabolic pathways used for energy production, angiogenesis, and iron supply. Autologous HIFs are quickly metabolized in the absence of hypoxia. HIF stabilizers may extend the activity of HIFs, resulting in higher levels of erythropoietin and increased capacity for oxygen transport. HIFs may increase the number of capillaries in skeletal muscles, thereby increasing carbohydrate metabolism and further improving oxygen carrying capacity.</p><p>HIFs are orally bioavailable small molecules developed as anti-anemia therapies.

This makes detection difficult and reinforces the importance of a good therapeutic alliance between clinician and athlete when obtaining a medical history.

Detection of non-hormonal performance enhancement use is possible when there is patient-clinician trust and supporting symptoms and signs. It can often be confirmed with urine testing or blood testing.</p><p>When an athlete presents with symptoms and signs consistent with the use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), it is important to take a thorough history and perform a standard physical examination (see <a class="local">'Symptoms and signs'</a> below). Then the clinician should discuss the possible diagnoses with the athlete, and the likely causative or contributing factors, including the possible role of PEDs. It is appropriate at this stage to ask the athlete if they have been using any such substance.</p><p>In other circumstances, a third party may raise concerns about a particular athlete or group of athletes that a clinician helps to care for or is involved with in some way. In such cases, it may be possible to mention to a particular athlete that someone has raised questions about PEDs and to ask if they are aware of such activity. It is important to be honest and frank but not accusatory. There may be situations, such as when there is a risk of significant morbidity or death, or where there is evidence of widespread misuse among a group of athletes or teams that may be sanctioned by sporting officials, where it is appropriate for information to be given to drug enforcement agencies on an anonymous basis. Most anti-doping agencies have a process for the public to provide anonymous information regarding anti-doping violations.

The Athlete Passport Management Unit (APMU) is responsible for the administration of the ABP, and ideally it works alongside WADA accredited laboratories. The APMUs are established by WADA or a regional anti-doping organization. They liaise with an expert panel, which reviews test results, interprets the longitudinal data, suggests follow-up testing, and provides an opinion on atypical passport findings to the relevant International Sporting Federation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1808745153"><span class="h2">Urine testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Athletes undergoing urine testing only must complete a doping notification form with the doping control officer. On the form, they must note any medication or supplement that they have taken in the last seven days and confirm that they accept the testing protocol. Testing protocols may vary at individual sites, but the standard method of testing in athletes is a split sample urine test and high performance liquid chromatography analysis. A split sample involves dividing the initial urine collection into two separate containers, labeled "A" and "B" samples. The samples are then sent to the certified testing laboratory, following a strict chain of custody protocols. The "A" sample is run first, and, if positive for a banned drug, the athlete is notified of the positive test and informed that the "B" sample will be run to confirm the result. The athlete and a representative are permitted to be present at the running of the "B" sample, unless they waive their right to have the B sample tested.

If authorities suspect that PEDs may have been used but current tests are inadequate for detection, in some jurisdictions urine samples may be stored and frozen for up to 10 years and then reassessed using newly developed tests. In the past several years, many athletes have received sanctions for using performance-enhancing substances when the drugs were detected in stored urine, which was subsequently tested with more accurate methods.</p><p>The length of time a banned substance remains in the body and detectable depends on a number of clinical variables, including the half-life of the drug, other medications being taken (eg, diuretics and other masking agents), and other specific pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic factors.

The blood sample collection kit includes a sterile needle, syringe and the relevant vacutainers in a sealed bag. Whole blood or plasma is used for tests to detect blood transfusions, HBOCs and ESAs and is collected in two 3 mL EDTA tubes (A and B samples).

Blood transfusion is among the most common. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) regulations (section M1) specifically ban the manipulation of blood and blood components, including the following actions:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Administration or reintroduction of any quantity of autologous, allogeneic (homologous), or heterologous blood or red blood cell products of any origin into the circulatory system.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Artificial means for enhancing the uptake, transport, or delivery of oxygen. Including, but not limited to: perfluorochemicals, efaproxiral (RSR13), and modified hemoglobin products (eg, hemoglobin-based blood substitutes and microencapsulated hemoglobin products). Supplemental oxygen is <strong>not</strong> proscribed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Any form of intravascular manipulation of the blood or blood components by physical or chemical means.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16909112"><span class="h2">Blood transfusions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Blood transfusions can be autologous (using one's own blood) or allogenic (ie, homologous; using blood from a different person) [<a href="#rid51">51</a>]. In sports requiring endurance, blood transfusions can be used to increase the number of erythrocytes and oxygen carrying capacity of the blood to improve performance and speed recovery. Blood transfusions prior to athletic competitions to enhance performance are prohibited by the WADA [<a href="#rid5">5,51</a>].<strong> </strong>Platelet-rich plasma and other platelet-derived preparations contain growth factors and are used to treat injury, but they are not prohibited by WADA, as no specific performance-enhancing effect has been demonstrated. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/230.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of overuse (persistent) tendinopathy", section on 'Autologous blood and platelet-rich plasma injection'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5493.html" rel="external">"Investigational approaches to the management of osteoarthritis", section on 'Platelet-rich plasma'</a>.)</p><p>Potential adverse effects from blood transfusions include sudden fluctuations in blood pressure, stimulation of atherosclerosis, oxidative damage to organs, impaired blood cell function, blood-borne infections, and iron deposition in organs [<a href="#rid52">52</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7948.html" rel="external">"Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for RBC transfusion in adults", section on 'Risks and complications of transfusion'</a>.)</p><p>Autologous blood transfusions cannot be detected by direct testing. Homologous transfusions can be detected through surface antigen patterns using flow cytometry, which is highly sensitive and able to detect rare antigenically distinct cells in an athlete's sample. As the life of a red blood cell is three to four months, detection can be made up to several weeks after a transfusion [<a href="#rid51">51,52</a>].</p><p>As the ability to test for exogenous erythropoietin has improved, the use of blood transfusions has increased in sport. The athlete biological passport (ABP) is designed to detect sudden or unusual increases in an athlete's hemoglobin, hematocrit, and other indices of red blood cells. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7475.html" rel="external">"Use of androgens and other hormones by athletes", section on 'Erythropoietin'</a> and <a class="local">'Athlete biological passport'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H657657155"><span class="h2">Artificial oxygen carriers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Artificial oxygen carriers, such as hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) and perfluorocarbons, bind and deliver oxygen to tissues such as skeletal muscle. They have been used in select situations involving acute blood loss such as trauma and cardiac surgery. These compounds have a short half-life, so need to be given intravenously at the time of need. All such compounds are banned under WADA regulations because of the possibility of performance enhancement. HBOCs and synthetic hemoglobin impart a red color to the urine, making detection straightforward in most cases. </p><p>Free hemoglobin is toxic, particularly to the kidneys, and thus several techniques have been developed to prevent such injury. These techniques, including polymerization, cross-linking, conjugation, and encapsulation, have led to the development of compounds referred to as HBOCs. First generation HBOCs were reported to cause vasoconstriction, which impairs oxygen release to tissues [<a href="#rid52">52,53</a>]. Third generation HBOCs involve enclosing the contents of erythrocytes (hemoglobin and particular enzymes) within artificial erythrocytes (liposomes or biodegradable nanocapsules) or modifying them using complex conjugations. These newer HBOCs appear to be highly effective oxygen donors and may cause less vasoconstriction [<a href="#rid53">53,54</a>].</p><p>Reported effects of third generation HBOCs include increased concentrations of erythropoietin, serum iron, and serum ferritin [<a href="#rid54">54,55</a>], and improved exercise capacity compared with autologous transfusion in untrained healthy males [<a href="#rid56">56</a>]. Complications from HBOCs may include gastrointestinal dysfunction, renal toxicity, hypertension, and platelet dysfunction. Reactive oxygen radicals, a byproduct of the increased amounts of oxygen formed from HBOCs, may cause the tissue damage noted in clinical trials [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]. Significant safety concerns were raised in phase II and III clinical trials of some HBOCs and this has slowed development [<a href="#rid57">57</a>]. However, there remain a number of compounds being studied in clinical trials [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. Several reports describe possession and administration of HBOCs among professional cyclists [<a href="#rid54">54</a>].</p><p>Emulsions of perfluorocarbon dissolve high concentrations of oxygen and thus can serve as effective oxygen providers to oxygen-deprived tissues. These are synthetic organic, highly fluorinated compounds, and the amount of oxygen dissolved in the emulsions correlates directly with the partial pressure of oxygen. Thus, perfluorocarbons require an environment with a high oxygen concentration to be effective, which is not easily achievable during athletic competition. Perfluorocarbons may cause back pain, fatigue, transient fevers, and clotting dysfunction [<a href="#rid52">52</a>]. There are no published reports of athletes using PFCs, and no studies have been performed on the possible ergogenic effect of PFCs during exercise.</p><p>Whether PFCs and HBOCs improve athletic performance remains a subject of debate. Neither responds to endogenous 2,3 DPG (2,3 BPG) and therefore both are probably less effective at improving oxygenation than transfusions of red blood cells. In addition, HBOCs may cause vasoconstriction, which would limit oxygen delivery to tissues, and may even impair performance [<a href="#rid52">52</a>]. Serum testing using an electrophoretic method is fast, effective, and sensitive, and is used as a screening test for anti-doping samples [<a href="#rid58">58</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1954438906"><span class="h2">Intravenous fluid</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The WADA list of prohibited methods (section M2) includes intravenous infusions, which may be used to offset dehydration during endurance events. Intravenous infusions or injections of more than 100 mL of fluid per 12-hour period, except for those legitimately received in the course of medical treatment, a surgical procedure, or diagnostic investigation, are not permitted. This rule was changed in 2019 due to the number of inadvertent violations occurring as a result of iron and other supplement infusions.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H760260509"><span class="h2">Gene doping and cell doping</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>"Gene doping" is the application of gene therapy techniques to enhance athletic performance [<a href="#rid59">59,60</a>]. In 2001, WADA declared that the "non-therapeutic use of cells, genes, genetic elements, or the modulation of genetic expression, having the capacity to enhance athletic performance, is prohibited."</p><p>Thus, neither of the following actions is permitted:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use of nucleic acids or nucleic acid analogues that may alter genomic sequences and/or alter gene expression (including gene editing, gene silencing, and gene transfer technologies) with the potential to enhance sport performance</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use of normal or genetically modified cells with the potential to enhance sport performance</p><p></p><p>Candidate genes have been identified that increase the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood through increased production of erythropoietin, vascular endothelial factor, and other angiogenic factors, and that increase strength through stimulation of type I and type II muscle fibers, insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I, and myostatin [<a href="#rid59">59,61-65</a>]. Using laboratory methods, gene doping has been demonstrated to improve endurance, strength, and tissue repair in animal models [<a href="#rid59">59,61,62</a>]. Gene transfer in mouse muscle has been shown to counteract age-related muscle atrophy [<a href="#rid66">66</a>], and to enhance the effects of training on muscle hypertrophy [<a href="#rid67">67</a>]. Inactivation of the myostatin gene resulted in marked muscle hypertrophy in mice [<a href="#rid68">68</a>].</p><p>To date, there is no evidence of gene doping by human athletes. However, WADA is sufficiently concerned to include gene doping in its official list of banned methods [<a href="#rid59">59,61,69</a>]. The potential for performance enhancement and extension of an athlete's career through improved healing capacity, along with the inherent difficulty in detection [<a href="#rid70">70,71</a>], increase the risk for this form of abuse. The potentially serious risks to the health of the athlete, and possibly others (eg, exposure to viral gene vectors), and the unfair advantage gained by cheaters, justify the need for close monitoring and an aggressive education campaign. Examples of possible health risks include inadequately regulated increases in erythropoietin expression that may cause significant polycythemia, and increases in IGF-1 or growth hormone that could stimulate production of malignant cells [<a href="#rid72">72</a>].</p><p>Although the prospects for gene doping are theoretical at present, improvements in genetic technology should be monitored closely and further research aimed at detecting genetic manipulation is warranted [<a href="#rid60">60</a>]. Monitoring may involve identifying specific substances (consistent with current methods for detection), but also patterns of changes that may occur as a response to genetic modification.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1772808334"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
