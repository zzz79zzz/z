Fertility in SLE patients does not appear to be altered by disease itself; however, a decrease in ovarian reserve can occur in women exposed to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a>. This topic will use the term “women” to refer to both women and birthing people. We encourage the reader to consider the specific counseling at treatment needs of transgender and gender-expansive individuals.</p><p>Pregnancy in women with SLE carries a higher maternal and fetal risk compared with pregnancy in healthy women. The prognosis for both mother and child is best when SLE has been quiescent for at least six months prior to the pregnancy. Disease flares during SLE pregnancy pose challenges with respect to distinguishing physiologic changes related to pregnancy from disease-related manifestations. Thus, a multidisciplinary approach with close medical, obstetric, and neonatal monitoring is necessary to optimize both maternal and fetal outcomes.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the major risks associated with pregnancy in SLE patients, as well as management recommendations. Issues related to the use of contraception in women with SLE are presented separately (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/95507.html" rel="external">"Approach to contraception in women with systemic lupus erythematosus"</a>). Issues related to pregnancy in patients with impaired renal function or with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) are also presented elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7205.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy and contraception in patients with nondialysis chronic kidney disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6813.html" rel="external">"Antiphospholipid syndrome: Obstetric implications and management in pregnancy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6402.html" rel="external">"Neonatal lupus: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H498517245"><span class="h1">PREGNANCY PLANNING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Ideally, disease should be quiescent for six months on medications compatible with pregnancy prior to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients attempting conception. Active SLE at the time of conception is a strong predictor of adverse maternal and obstetrical outcomes [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. In spite of this risk, the majority of such pregnancies still result in live births. The following studies are illustrative:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The largest observational study, including 385 pregnant lupus patients (49 percent non-Hispanic White) with inactive or mild or moderate disease at conception, found 81 percent of subjects had uncomplicated pregnancies [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Adverse pregnancy outcomes were defined as fetal or neonatal death, birth before 36 weeks gestation, placental insufficiency, hypertension, preeclampsia, and birthweight less than the fifth percentile. Among women without risk factors including antihypertensive use, thrombocytopenia, and presence of lupus anticoagulant (LA), the rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes was 7.8 percent. Adverse pregnancy rates in those with risk factors were as high as 58 percent, and fetal and neonatal mortality was 22 percent. However, the study population was limited as it excluded women with high disease activity, active lupus nephritis, uncontrolled hypertension, and diabetes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A study of 267 pregnancies in a cohort of lupus patients found that women with high disease activity compared with low disease activity in the first and second trimesters showed a threefold increase in pregnancy loss (miscarriages and perinatal mortality) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. However, overall there was no statistically significant difference in the number of live births between the women with high disease activity compared with low disease activity (77 percent versus 88 percent, respectively).</p><p></p><p>Our approach to pregnancy planning and management in SLE is generally consistent with recommendations developed by the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR; formerly known as European League Against Rheumatism) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>] and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H158720001"><span class="h2">Preconception evaluation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A preconception assessment is essential in women with SLE to determine whether pregnancy may pose an unacceptably high maternal or fetal risk, to initiate interventions to optimize disease activity, and to adjust medications to those that are least harmful to the fetus.</p><p>Women should be advised that discontinuation of medications used to control disease activity increases the risk of lupus flare and pregnancy complications. Ideally, women considering conception should be maintained on medications that are compatible with pregnancy and should continue these medications in pregnancy. Clinical features specific to pregnancy in the setting of SLE are discussed below. A more general discussion on preconception care and risk assessment in all women is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/448.html" rel="external">"The preconception office visit"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H452135627"><span class="h3">Risk assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The preconception evaluation in women with SLE should include an assessment of disease activity and major organ involvement, as well as hypercoagulability or concurrent medical disorders that may impact pregnancy. Previous obstetric outcomes should be reviewed, with particular attention paid to history of small for gestational age fetus, preeclampsia, stillbirth, miscarriage, and preterm birth. An approach to the assessment of disease activity and severity of SLE is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4675.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management and prognosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults", section on 'Assessment of disease activity'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with evidence of active SLE, especially lupus nephritis, should be advised to defer pregnancy until the disease is well controlled for at least six months. For those with renal insufficiency, counseling should include an assessment of the risk of temporary or permanent decline in renal function. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7205.html" rel="external">"Pregnancy and contraception in patients with nondialysis chronic kidney disease"</a>.)</p><p>Increased severity of maternal disease generally correlates with higher maternal and fetal risk in pregnancy. Thus, recent stroke, cardiac involvement, pulmonary hypertension, severe interstitial lung disease, and advanced renal insufficiency can portend poor pregnancy outcome for both the mother and fetus. Women with these or other worrisome medical conditions should be counseled carefully by a Maternal Fetal Medicine specialist as to their individual risk profile, with clear discussion of the morbidity and mortality risks to both mother and fetus associated with pregnancy. Alternatives such as gestational carriers and adoption should be presented. Should they elect to pursue pregnancy, they should be followed in a multidisciplinary fashion in a high-risk center [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>].</p><p>Antibodies to Ro/La should be assessed prior to pregnancy, as these antibodies may predispose to neonatal lupus (NL) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6402.html" rel="external">"Neonatal lupus: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6813.html" rel="external">"Antiphospholipid syndrome: Obstetric implications and management in pregnancy"</a>.)</p><p>Additionally, one should test for antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs), although, in the absence of clinical manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), positive aPLs can be difficult to interpret. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4678.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome", section on 'Antiphospholipid antibody testing'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H129884977"><span class="h3">Specific laboratory testing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In addition to routine preconception labs (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/448.html" rel="external">"The preconception office visit", section on 'Laboratory assessment'</a>), the following should be reviewed during the preconception evaluation (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4675.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management and prognosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults", section on 'Laboratory evaluation'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Renal function (creatinine, urinalysis with urine sediment, spot urine protein/creatinine ratio)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Complete blood count (CBC)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Liver function tests</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA) antibodies</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Complement (CH50, or C3 and C4)</p><p></p><p>As discussed above, one should test for aPLs (LA, immunoglobulin G [IgG] and IgM anticardiolipin [aCL] antibodies, and IgG and IgM anti-beta2 glycoprotein I [anti-beta2GPI] antibodies).

Although some medications used to treat SLE are potentially harmful or contraindicated during pregnancy, many are safe. Information regarding the use of immunosuppressive agents in pregnant patients with SLE can be found below, and in a separate topic (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7998.html" rel="external">"Safety of rheumatic disease medication use during pregnancy and lactation"</a>). The most commonly used medications used to treat patients with SLE are reviewed briefly below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3401004213"><span class="h4">Recommended during pregnancy</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hydroxychloroquine</strong> – For most pregnant women with SLE, we suggest continuation of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8541" href="/d/drug information/8541.html" rel="external">hydroxychloroquine</a> (HCQ) to reduce the risk of SLE flares. Several studies have demonstrated fewer disease flares and better outcomes in patients continuing HCQ during pregnancy [<a href="#rid9">9-15</a>]. As an example, a randomized trial including 20 consecutive pregnant patients with SLE found no differences between disease flare rates, but patients in the HCQ group were able to reduce the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> dose [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. In addition, the HCQ group had significantly lower disease activity scores after delivery compared with the placebo group. Findings from a larger prospective study with 257 pregnancies in 197 women also found that discontinuation of HCQ during pregnancy was associated with a higher rate of flare compared with women who either continued HCQ during pregnancy or never took it [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. In addition, high disease activity occurred in twice as many pregnancies in which HCQ was stopped compared with those who continued taking HCQ. While HCQ has long been considered safe for use in pregnancy, one study showed a small increased risk of congenital anomalies (odds ratio [OR] 1.3) with a daily dose over 400 mg daily in the first trimester, though the association was not seen when the dose was under 400 mg [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. However, no specific pattern of anomaly was identified, and other confounders such as other medications, alcohol, smoking, and illicit drug use were not accounted for in this study [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. A more detailed discussion regarding the relative safety of HCQ during pregnancy can be found elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7998.html" rel="external">"Safety of rheumatic disease medication use during pregnancy and lactation", section on 'Hydroxychloroquine'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Additionally, some data suggest a decrease in occurrence of congenital heart block in at-risk fetuses of mothers with anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies exposed to HCQ [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6402.html" rel="external">"Neonatal lupus: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Heart block'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Low-dose </strong><strong>aspirin</strong> – We initiate low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> in all women with SLE, unless contraindicated, starting from approximately 12 weeks gestation, to reduce the risk of preeclampsia and its sequelae (eg, fetal growth restriction), regardless of the presence of aPLs. This approach is consistent with the recommendation by the United States Preventive Services Task Force to use low-dose aspirin in women at high-risk of developing preeclampsia, which includes women with SLE [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Recommendations for prophylactic use of low-dose aspirin during pregnancy for prevention of preeclampsia are discussed in detail separately.

There is conflicting evidence as to whether exposure to NSAIDs during the first trimester increases the risk of spontaneous abortion; in women having difficulty conceiving, one can consider avoiding these medications during the first trimester. There is a small increased risk of oligohydramnios when NSAIDs are used beyond 20 weeks; the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that the lowest dose and shortest duration of NSAID be used between 20 and 30 weeks of gestation. Use of NSAIDs after 30 weeks of gestation may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus, as well as other complications, and should be avoided altogether from the third trimester on.

Tacrolimus use has been reported in over 200 pregnancies for varying indications. Overall pregnancy outcomes were normal; however, hypertension, preeclampsia, and preterm birth occurred more frequently than would be expected.

For this reason, early diagnosis is essential.</p><p>Risk of preeclampsia in patients with SLE is between 16 and 30 percent. In women at elevated risk of preeclampsia, including all women with SLE, low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> has been shown to reduce the absolute risk of disease by approximately 2 to 5 percent when initiated between 12 to 16 weeks gestation [<a href="#rid19">19,64</a>]. The use of low-dose aspirin for preeclampsia prophylaxis is discussed in detail separately (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6817.html" rel="external">"Preeclampsia: Prevention", section on 'Candidates'</a> and <a class="local">'Recommended during pregnancy'</a> above).

Lupus nephritis flares during pregnancy can mimic preeclampsia, presenting with increasing proteinuria, hypertension, thrombocytopenia, and a deterioration in renal function. Active lupus nephritis and preeclampsia can also occur at the same time. Evidence of lupus activity in other organs can sometimes help distinguish SLE from preeclampsia.</p><p>Laboratory testing may be, but is not always, useful in distinguishing preeclampsia from nephritis or a lupus flare:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lupus nephritis is often associated with proteinuria and/or an active urine sediment (red and white cells and cellular casts), whereas only proteinuria is seen in preeclampsia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Flares of SLE are likely to be associated with low or decreasing complement levels and increased titers of anti-dsDNA antibodies; by comparison, complement levels are usually, but not always, normal or increased in preeclampsia [<a href="#rid65">65-67</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Thrombocytopenia, elevated serum levels of liver enzymes and an elevated or rising level of uric acid are more prominent in preeclampsia than lupus nephritis. However, thrombocytopenia may also be seen in association with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and immune thrombocytopenia, each of which may complicate pregnancy in women with SLE.</p><p></p><p>The onset of these overlapping symptoms before 20 weeks of gestation is more consistent with lupus nephritis. Renal biopsy can help differentiate the two conditions, but the higher risk of complications during pregnancy limits the use in pregnancy.

Active SLE at the time of conception is a strong predictor of adverse maternal and obstetrical outcomes. In spite of this risk, the majority of such pregnancies still result in live births. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above and <a class="local">'Pregnancy planning'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Preconception evaluation</strong> – A preconception assessment is essential in women with SLE to determine whether pregnancy may pose an unacceptably high maternal or fetal risk, to initiate interventions to optimize disease activity, and to adjust medications to those with the best safety profile during pregnancy. (See <a class="local">'Preconception evaluation'</a> above and <a class="local">'Specific laboratory testing'</a> above and <a class="local">'Medications'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Specific considerations during pregnancy</strong> – Women who are primigravidas and women with a history of lupus nephritis or active nephritis are at highest risk of flare.
