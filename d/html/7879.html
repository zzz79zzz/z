It had been the therapy of choice in the United States, selected by 60 percent of thyroid specialists who responded to a survey in 2011 [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Data subsequently have shown that long-term antithyroid drug use is safe [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], and an updated analysis using insurance claims data in the United States suggests that antithyroid drugs are used as initial therapy for 60 percent of patients, while only 33 percent of patients receive radioiodine [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Radioiodine is administered orally as sodium iodide (131-I) in solution or a capsule. The radioiodine is rapidly incorporated into the thyroid, and its beta emissions result in extensive local tissue damage. The net effect is ablation of thyroid function over a period of 6 to 18 weeks.</p><p>Radioiodine for the treatment of hyperthyroidism will be reviewed here. Other treatment options for Graves' hyperthyroidism and for toxic adenoma and toxic multinodular goiter (MNG) are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7872.html" rel="external">"Graves' hyperthyroidism in nonpregnant adults: Overview of treatment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7873.html" rel="external">"Treatment of toxic adenoma and toxic multinodular goiter"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H30632249"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H30632257"><span class="h2">Graves' disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The therapeutic approach to Graves' hyperthyroidism consists of both rapid amelioration of symptoms with a beta blocker and measures aimed at decreasing thyroid hormone synthesis with either the administration of a thionamide, radioiodine ablation, or surgery [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Because all three treatment modalities are effective, the choice of therapy should involve active discussion between clinician and patient (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67833" href="/d/graphic/67833.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>Radioiodine had been the most popular treatment for hyperthyroidism in the United States [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]; however, the use of thionamides has been increasing [<a href="#rid3">3</a>], and radioiodine use in the United States has decreased. Radioiodine is also less popular outside of the United States [<a href="#rid1">1,5-7</a>]. At Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, USA) in 2019, the number of patients receiving radioiodine for hyperthyroidism was approximately 15 percent of that in 2006. The reasons for this decline include the risk of worsening thyroid eye disease despite the ameliorating effects of glucocorticoid treatment (see <a class="local">'Glucocorticoids in patients with thyroid eye disease'</a> below), controversial reports suggesting an increased risk of breast cancer (see <a class="local">'Cancer'</a> below), studies demonstrating the long-term safety of thionamides (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7876.html" rel="external">"Thionamides in the treatment of Graves' disease"</a>), and the prominence on social media of patient dissatisfaction with permanent hypothyroidism [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The choice of therapy for Graves' disease is reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7872.html" rel="external">"Graves' hyperthyroidism in nonpregnant adults: Overview of treatment", section on 'Selection of therapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H30632264"><span class="h2">Toxic adenoma or multinodular goiter</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Depending upon patient preference, either radioiodine therapy or surgery had been considered the treatment of choice for these conditions. However, patients can now be managed, if preferred or necessary for other reasons, with long-term thionamide drugs. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7873.html" rel="external">"Treatment of toxic adenoma and toxic multinodular goiter", section on 'Choice of therapy'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H30632271"><span class="h1">CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H30632279"><span class="h2">Pregnancy and breastfeeding</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pregnancy and breastfeeding are absolute contraindications to radioiodine therapy. Radioiodine should not be given for 6 to 12 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding to ensure that radioiodine will not be actively concentrated in breast tissue [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p>Fetal thyroid tissue is present by 10 to 12 weeks and would be destroyed by the radioiodine, potentially resulting in cretinism. A pregnancy test should be obtained in women of childbearing age before the administration of radioiodine.</p><p>Rarely, radioiodine is given inadvertently to a pregnant woman [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. The infant may be normal, hyperthyroid (due to a radioiodine-induced increase in maternal thyrotropin receptor antibody [TRAb] levels, which in turn affect fetal thyroid function) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>], or hypothyroid [<a href="#rid11">11</a>], depending on when during the pregnancy the exposure occurred [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Each possibility should be considered and appropriate action taken immediately after delivery. In select centers with expertise, fetal thyroid function may be assessed in utero by percutaneous umbilical vein sampling after 20 weeks of gestation [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. However, this procedure is associated with a risk of fetal loss. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7851.html" rel="external">"Overview of thyroid disease and pregnancy", section on 'Thyroid function in the fetus'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H30632286"><span class="h2">Thyroid eye disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Radioiodine therapy, compared with thionamides or surgery, is associated with a twofold increase in the development or worsening of thyroid eye disease (Graves' orbitopathy). The changes are often mild and transient, at least in patients who have mild or no eye disease before therapy, but may be more significant in patients with more severe thyroid eye disease. (See <a class="local">'Radioiodine and thyroid eye disease'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Moderate to severe thyroid eye disease</strong> – We consider moderate to severe or sight-threatening thyroid eye disease a contraindication to radioiodine therapy. Thionamides or surgery are the preferred options for such patients. While <strong>not</strong> recommended, patients who refuse surgery and who have had adverse reactions to thionamides may need to be offered radioiodine therapy with glucocorticoid coverage. (See <a class="local">'Glucocorticoids in patients with thyroid eye disease'</a> below and <a class="local">'Radioiodine and thyroid eye disease'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mild, active thyroid eye disease</strong> – Radioiodine should be used with caution in patients with active, mild thyroid eye disease and risk factors for deterioration, including smoking, a high baseline serum concentration of triiodothyronine (T3; eg, &gt;325 ng/dL [5 nmol/L]) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>], or high TRAb levels [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. While some experts do not treat such patients with radioiodine, in one randomized trial, no patient who received a course of oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> following radioiodine developed new or progressive thyroid eye disease, while 15 percent of patients who did not receive steroids had new or progressive thyroid eye disease [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Thus, in patients with mild eye disease but risk factors for progression, concurrent administration of glucocorticoids should be administered (in the absence of major contraindications) to prevent deterioration of the eye disease (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110053" href="/d/graphic/110053.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Glucocorticoids in patients with thyroid eye disease'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Alternative treatment options for hyperthyroidism in patients with moderate to severe eye disease are reviewed separately.

This slightly shorter interval to achieve euthyroidism should not be considered a reason for pretreatment in all patients, since the side effects and potential toxicity from methimazole are significant.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hyperthyroidism is controlled by 12 weeks in 97 percent of patients taking <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9627" href="/d/drug information/9627.html" rel="external">methimazole</a>, while 10 to 20 percent of patients receiving a single dose of radioiodine fail treatment altogether [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>].</p><p></p><p>There is disagreement about the benefits of thionamide pretreatment in patients planning radioiodine therapy. In a meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials, adjunctive use of thionamides administered in the week before, during, or after radioiodine therapy increased the risk of treatment failure (relative risk [RR] 1.28, 95% CI 1.07-1.52) and reduced the risk of hypothyroidism (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53-0.87) [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. However, patients who were pretreated with thionamides had a lower incidence of biochemical and clinical hyperthyroidism for several weeks after radioiodine therapy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3626419"><span class="h3">Candidates for pretreatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Radioiodine can be administered as initial therapy for hyperthyroidism (without <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9627" href="/d/drug information/9627.html" rel="external">methimazole</a> pretreatment) in most patients with hyperthyroidism, especially if they are receiving adequate therapy with a beta blocker. However, some patients, particularly older patients and others who are more susceptible to the effects of hyperthyroidism, can be first treated with methimazole until euthyroidism is achieved.</p><p>We prefer to pretreat with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9627" href="/d/drug information/9627.html" rel="external">methimazole</a> in the following patients:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Older patients (&gt;60 to 65 years) and others with comorbidities, such as coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, or pulmonary hypertension.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with severe thyrotoxicosis (eg, free T4 two to three times the upper limit of normal) who are not tolerating the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, especially if on adequate doses of beta-blocking drugs.

Radioiodine can then be administered once serum free T4 and total T3 or free T3 concentrations are in the normal range or after symptoms have subsided.</p><p>Our practice is to stop <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9627" href="/d/drug information/9627.html" rel="external">methimazole</a> three days before and then restart methimazole three days after radioiodine is given to allow better control of thyroid function post-radioiodine administration. Methimazole is then tapered or stopped as thyroid function normalizes, usually between 4 and 18 weeks following therapy, as determined by thyroid function testing and the reduction in goiter size.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Choice of thionamide</strong> – <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9627" href="/d/drug information/9627.html" rel="external">Methimazole</a> is the thionamide of choice in all patients receiving treatment prior to radioiodine. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7876.html" rel="external">"Thionamides in the treatment of Graves' disease", section on 'Choice of drug'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Controversy remains as to whether pretreatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9830" href="/d/drug information/9830.html" rel="external">propylthiouracil</a> (PTU) is more likely to result in treatment failure than pretreatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9627" href="/d/drug information/9627.html" rel="external">methimazole</a>. One meta-analysis did not find a difference between the two drugs [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. However, in two nonrandomized trials that compared PTU and methimazole and were not included in the meta-analysis, cure rates after radioiodine in patients receiving PTU were half that of patients receiving methimazole [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>When to stop</strong> – <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9627" href="/d/drug information/9627.html" rel="external">Methimazole</a> should be discontinued before radioiodine treatment in order to avoid impairing the efficacy of the radioiodine. In a randomized trial that compared stopping or continuing methimazole in 75 patients, the radioiodine treatment was successful in 61 percent of the patients in whom the drug was stopped eight days before radioiodine was administered, as compared with 44 percent in whom methimazole was not discontinued [<a href="#rid28">28</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Most studies suggest that stopping two to three days before radioiodine is optimal. As examples:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A comparison of the diagnostic and therapeutic radioiodine kinetics in 316 patients treated with radioiodine who did not receive pretreatment before therapy, or in whom it had been stopped for one to two days, found that alterations in uptake, uptake curves, and radioiodine half-life were restored to normal two days after discontinuation of the thiamazole (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9627" href="/d/drug information/9627.html" rel="external">methimazole</a> or carbimazole) and that the success rate of the treatment was 87 percent [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In a study in which thionamides were stopped two versus seven days prior to radioiodine, post-radioiodine free T4 levels were higher in the seven-day group compared with the two-day group, while the 24-hour radioiodine uptakes and the outcome at six months and one and two years were identical [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Another study found no increases in post-radioiodine thyroid hormone concentrations when carbimazole was held for only three days prior to radioiodine administration [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>When to restart</strong> – Our practice is to restart <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9627" href="/d/drug information/9627.html" rel="external">methimazole</a> three days after radioiodine is given to allow better control of thyroid function post-radioiodine administration. Resumption of thionamide therapy three to seven days after radioiodine administration has been shown to result in less post-therapy rebound hyperthyroidism [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. While a post-radioiodine increase in thyroid function will not necessarily occur, if the patient was pretreated with methimazole due to old age or cardiovascular morbidity, then we resume methimazole to avoid rebound hyperthyroidism and continue it until the radioiodine has resulted in hypothyroidism or euthyroidism.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4076375161"><span class="h3">Patients unable to take thionamides</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In selected patients with Graves' disease in whom more rapid normalization of thyroid function is essential but who are allergic to thionamides, super saturated potassium iodide (SSKI) given daily, beginning one week after radioiodine, normalizes thyroid function several weeks earlier than in patients given radioiodine alone [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].

In the past, it was controversial whether radioiodine should be given in a sufficient dose to induce hypothyroidism or a lower dose in an attempt to achieve a euthyroid state [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. However, due to the high failure rate associated with lower doses designed to leave a patient euthyroid, most experts advocate radioiodine doses that result in hypothyroidism [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>Hypothyroidism is less common initially after radioiodine treatment of toxic adenoma and toxic multinodular goiter (MNG). Areas of focal autonomy take up radioiodine well, while uptake is limited in adjacent and contralateral thyroid tissue that is suppressed by the hyperthyroid state. As a result, radioiodine tends to destroy only the autonomous areas, and most patients remain euthyroid after radioiodine administration [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. Patients who develop hypothyroidism usually do so because uptake was not suppressed in the extranodular tissue [<a href="#rid44">44</a>] or because of coexistent chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. In up to 5 percent of patients with toxic MNG, radioiodine therapy may evoke the production of TSH receptor-stimulating antibodies, causing recurrent hyperthyroidism (due to Graves' disease) several months after treatment [<a href="#rid45">45,46</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Graves' disease</strong> – When radioiodine is used to treat patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism, we suggest high-dose therapy (150 to 200 microCi/g [5.9 to 7.4 MBq/g]). This will cure the hyperthyroidism and, in most patients, induce hypothyroidism in 12 to 18 weeks. Patients should then be started on full replacement doses of T4 if goiter is absent or slightly lower doses if goiter persists. A persistent goiter suggests incomplete destruction of the gland and the possibility of persistent autonomous thyroid tissue.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines for the management of Graves' hyperthyroidism recommend a dose (typically 10 to 15 millicuries [mCi; 370 to 555 MBq]) sufficient to cause hypothyroidism, which can be accomplished equally well with either a fixed or individualized dose regimen [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For patients with Graves' disease, the dose of radioiodine is directly related to the cure rate and the incidence of hypothyroidism. As an example, in a trial of two fixed doses of radioiodine (5 versus 10 mCi equivalent to 185 versus 370 MBq) in 813 patients with hyperthyroidism, patients treated with the higher dose had a higher cure rate (85 versus 67 percent) and a higher incidence of hypothyroidism (61 versus 41 percent) [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. A high dose of radioiodine (128 to 155 microCi/g of thyroid tissue [4.7 to 5.7 MBq/g]) cures the hyperthyroidism in 90 percent of patients but eventually causes hypothyroidism in at least 80 percent, whereas 14 percent have persistent hyperthyroidism requiring additional treatment [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Administering much higher doses (&gt;200 microCi/g [7.4 MBq/g]) is not associated with higher rates of cure but may be used in patients who are being retreated after one or more treatment failures; in patients with very large goiters; or in patients who have been pretreated with thionamides, which causes mild radioresistance.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although attempting to lower thyroid function to normal with a low dose of radioiodine may appear desirable, this approach has several disadvantages. In particular, low-dose radioiodine therapy is more likely to result in treatment failure, necessitating another dose in 6 to 24 months [<a href="#rid48">48,49</a>]. In addition, less than one-third of patients are euthyroid 10 years after therapy [<a href="#rid50">50</a>].

The goal of individualized dosing is to maximize cure and avoid unnecessarily high radiation exposures in patients with high radioiodine uptake. The use of a fixed dose of radioiodine is an alternative approach. Fixed dosing simplifies the approach to treatment and is less costly than an individually calculated dose. Fixed doses of 5, 10, or 15 mCi (185, 370, or 555 MBq) are commonly given to patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism.</p><p>One prospective, randomized trial compared a fixed dose with a calculated dose and reported an inverse relationship between therapeutic success and thyroid size in the patients treated with a fixed dose [<a href="#rid52">52</a>]. Success rates ranged from 100 percent for patients with thyroid volumes ≤15 mL to only 25 percent in patients with volume ≥75 mL. In another study, a semiquantitative fixed-dose regimen (5 mCi [185 MBq] for patients with small glands, 10 mCi [370 MBq] for those with medium glands, and 15 mCi [555 MBq] for those with large glands) was as effective as more elaborately calculated individual dosing [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. These data favor an individualized approach to dosing because of the dependence of outcome on gland size.</p><p>However, other data favor a fixed approach. As an example, in a randomized trial comparing one of four dose methods (low fixed, high fixed, low calculated, high calculated) in 88 patients with Graves' disease, fixed doses of 6.4 mCi (235 MBq) or 9.4 mCi (350 MBq) were as effective as low- or high-calculated doses (80 or 120 microCi/g) [<a href="#rid54">54</a>]. After a mean follow-up of 63 months, the majority of patients (57 to 82 percent) were hypothyroid. Hyperthyroidism was present in 18 to 27 percent, and 0 to 19 percent were euthyroid.

The changes are often mild and transient, at least in patients who have mild or no eye disease before therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7827.html" rel="external">"Treatment of thyroid eye disease", section on 'Reversal of hyperthyroidism, if present'</a>.)</p><p>The exacerbation of thyroid eye disease after radioiodine is thought to be due to an increase in levels of TRAbs following radioiodine treatment that persist for up to a year [<a href="#rid61">61</a>]. In contrast, TRAb levels tend to fall after surgery and during thionamide therapy.</p><p>There have been several randomized trials of different hyperthyroidism treatments in patients with Graves' disease [<a href="#rid17">17,37,76</a>].

This study was criticized, however, because all of the patients treated with radioiodine became hypothyroid, and treatment with thyroxine was delayed for several months.

An analysis of data through 1990 representing a mean follow-up of 21 years revealed no increase in overall cancer mortality [<a href="#rid82">82,83</a>].</p><p>Prolonged follow-up demonstrated a small increase in thyroid cancer risk that was most pronounced in those patients who received radioiodine for toxic nodular goiter (the number of thyroid cancer deaths was small [29 out of a total of 2950 cancer deaths] and the standardized cancer mortality ratio was 2.77, accounting for 18 excess deaths) [<a href="#rid84">84</a>]. Since the risk of thyroid cancer is known to be slightly increased among patients with nodular goiters, it is possible that at least some of the excess thyroid cancer risk is related to underlying thyroid disease. In a 24-year extension of the Cooperative Thyrotoxicosis Therapy Follow-up Study (18,805 patients), a 100 mGy organ exposure was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.003-1.32) and stomach cancer (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.10) [<a href="#rid85">85</a>].</p><p>Another analysis of 7417 patients in the United Kingdom also found a significant increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer (nine cases versus three expected) and cancers of the small bowel [<a href="#rid86">86</a>].

In a study of 2793 Finnish patients, there was an increase in the incidence rate ratio of cancer risk per 10,000 person-years (1.2 [1.1 to 1.5]) due to cancer of the breast, stomach, and kidney [<a href="#rid87">87</a>].</p><p>The above studies compared cancer risks in hyperthyroid patients treated with radioiodine to normal populations.

Most of the excess deaths occurred during the first year after treatment. The major association at this time was with the hyperthyroidism itself (SMR approximately 25).

A slight excess in mortality was noted in the radioiodine patients compared to age- and period-specific mortality (SMR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04-1.24). However, the increased mortality risk was observed only in patients not requiring thyroid hormone therapy or prior to thyroid hormone replacement. No increased risk was seen during follow-up in patients taking thyroid hormone therapy. Patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (not receiving thyroid hormone) had excess mortality related to ischemic heart disease. These findings suggest that doses of radioiodine for the treatment of hyperthyroidism should be high enough to induce overt hypothyroidism.

We discontinue methimazole three days prior to radioiodine and restart three days after radioiodine therapy. For young and middle-aged patients who are less symptomatic, there is no need to pretreat with a thionamide, and radioiodine can be given soon after the diagnosis is made.

For patients with active, mild thyroid eye disease without risk factors for progression, the need for concurrent administration of glucocorticoids is uncertain. In the absence of major contraindications, we generally administer glucocorticoids to prevent exacerbation of thyroid eye disease. (See <a class="local">'Glucocorticoids in patients with thyroid eye disease'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Dosing</strong> – Radioiodine is administered orally as sodium iodide-131 (131-I) in solution or a capsule.

We typically administer 160 microCi/g thyroid tissue (5.9 MBq/g) for Graves' hyperthyroidism and 200 microCi/g (7.4 MBq/g) for toxic adenoma/MNG. A fixed dose of 10 to 15 mCi (370 to 555 MBq) for Graves' hyperthyroidism and 15 to 20 mCi (500 to 740 MBq) for toxic adenoma/MNG is an alternative option, although higher fixed doses should be used for larger glands.

In patients with treatment-resistant Graves' disease (persistent hyperthyroidism six months following radioiodine), we typically administer a second dose of radioiodine. If the response to the first dose of radioiodine has been minimal and a large goiter persists, a second dose can be administered earlier, eg, four months after the initial dose.
