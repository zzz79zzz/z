         Immunoglobulin molecules (antibodies) facilitate numerous cellular and humoral reactions to a variety of antigens, including those of the host (self) and foreign substances.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most antibodies in the normal immune response are polyclonal, produced by many distinct B lymphocytes, and they each have a slightly different specificity for the target antigen (binding different epitopes or binding the same epitope with different affinities). However, it is possible to produce large quantities of an antibody from a single B cell clone.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since 1985, hundreds of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been designated as drugs; new approvals continue to accrue. The World Health Organization (WHO), which is responsible for therapeutic mAb nomenclature, reported in 2017 that over 500 mAb names have been provided. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Naming conventions'

         </span>
         A uniform naming convention for mAbs has been developed and updated to facilitate global recognition of a unique name for each product.
        </p>
        <p>
         The name of the mAb specifies the proposed target, original host, modifications, and conjugation to other molecules. Naming rules from the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) expert group of the World Health Organization (WHO) were originally published in 1995 [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         INN updates from 2014, 2017, and 2021 describe the classification for mAb names [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3,4
         </a>
         ]. These consist of a prefix, two substems (reduced to one substem in the 2017 document), and a suffix  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef114279" href="/z/d/graphic/114279.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         ).

          Prefix
         </strong>
         – This is "random" and intended to provide a unique, distinct drug name.
        </p>
        <p>

         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         <strong>
          Substems (also called infixes)
         </strong>
         – These designate the target (eg, "ci" for cardiovascular, "so" for bone, "tu" for tumor) and the source (host) in which the antibody was originally produced (eg, "u" for human, "o" for mouse), as well as modifications (eg, "-xi-" for chimeric, "-zu-" for humanized).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The second substem was eliminated in 2017 [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. This only applies to mAb names created after mid-2017; names created before that time contain a substem that specifies the source of the antibody and whether it is humanized or chimeric.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Concerns that led to elimination of the second substem included the large number of antibody names being created, use of the species information as a marketing tool despite lack of scientific support for clinical value, and confusing conceptual ambiguities related to chimeric and humanized antibodies [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,5,6

          Suffix (also called stem)
         </strong>
         – For mAbs developed from 1990 to 2022, the suffix was "mab"; rare exceptions included early mAbs produced before the "mab" stem was established (muromonab-CD3 [OKT3],

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In late 2021, a collection of four suffixes was introduced to accommodate the increasing number of mAbs, to decrease sound-alikes, and to provide information about modifications to the immunoglobulin structure [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>

         mAbs are homogenous preparations of identical antibodies (or antibody fragments). Every antibody molecule in the product has the same antigen recognition site, affinity, biologic interactions, and downstream biologic effects. This distinguishes mAbs from polyclonal antibodies, which contain heterogenous protein sequences and recognize heterogeneous epitopes.

         </span>
         mAb efficacy depends on the quality of the interaction between its hypervariable region (also called complementarity-determining region [CDR]) and the target antigen. The choice of target antigen is usually based on the scientific understanding of disease mechanism and/or observation of disease-specific antibody effects in preclinical models or patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         Downstream effects are also key to efficacy and safety. Toxicity can be reduced by using antibodies that lack certain epitopes from nonhuman species, although immunogenicity of the mAb is complex and not simply a matter of the number of amino acid residues.

         Several approaches are used:

         <strong>
          Immunize an animal
         </strong>
         – An animal (typically mouse or rat) may be immunized with the target antigen. This was the most popular (and the only technically feasible) method in the early days of mAb production. Candidate B cells for producing an mAb with specificity for the target are obtained by harvesting spleen cells from the animal. Muromonab-CD3 (Orthoclone OKT3) was produced this way.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         A serious risk is that some individuals will mount an immune response to the mouse antibody sequence. Once an individual develops a human-anti-mouse antibody, they generally cannot receive additional doses of the original mAb or other murine mAbs with a similar sequence [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. Workarounds were developed to humanize the antibody or create a chimeric antibody; these are now used in most mAbs initially selected in animals. Mice engineered with human immunoglobulin loci in place of the endogenous mouse sequences have also been created. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Humanized and chimeric mAbs'
         </a>

         Humanized mice allow development of mAbs that lack mouse heavy chains and have a repertoire more similar to the human immune system. Casirivimab and imdevimab, mAbs developed to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), were generated from humanized mice [

          Obtain an existing antibody
         </strong>
         – An existing antibody can be isolated from a patient. This method is applicable to cancer therapeutics because a tumor and/or regional lymph nodes are often resected and can be used to harvest tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.

         – A library of antibodies can be purchased or constructed using molecular techniques (phage display or other combinatorial methods) and screened for binding to a target antigen. Libraries vary widely in size and diversity. With phage display, a large collection of sequences is introduced into bacteriophage (a virus that infects bacteria) to generate a single antibody or antibody fragment per clone [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13

         ]. Larger more diverse libraries are more likely to produce a product with the highest affinity and specificity.

         Once an mAb with a desired specificity has been obtained, it must be produced in large quantities. The earliest method involved create a hybridoma (cell-cell fusion) containing the antibody-producing cell and an immortalized partner cell (often a malignant B cell from multiple myeloma) that proliferates indefinitely in culture. The partner cell line must be nonproductive; otherwise, the hybridoma would also produce the myeloma antibodies.

         Candidate hybridomas must be screened for immortalization and antibody production.

         Generating therapeutically significant mAbs using traditional methods involves an immense amount of screening through vast numbers of candidates to find the few antibodies that are eventually developed into a drug. Advances in machine learning and computational power have allowed scientists to accelerate protein design to predict and improve antibody function.
        </p>
        <p>
         Neural networks termed "protein language models," which are similar to those used in generative artificial intelligence (AI), can be trained using a database of protein sequences to predict structure and potentially function.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a 2023 study, models were trained using tens of millions of existing protein sequences to engineer and generate immunoglobulins with high "fitness" to improve antigen binding [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. To identify mutations that could conceivably evolve, algorithms were used to learn patterns, and amino acid substitutions were selected and screened for improved fitness. A protein language model-guided method was used to create a tool that could predict and improve affinity maturation for seven antibodies. While traditional methods would entail random screening of tens of thousands of antibodies, remarkably, fewer than 20 variants of each antibody were found by this AI-based approach to increase binding affinities for most candidates. Some of the newly developed antibodies had up to 160-fold increased affinity, and others had improvements in thermostability and viral neutralization against Ebola virus or SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
        </p>
        <p>
         Using these computational methods can potentially accelerate antibody discovery for previously hard-to-target antigens and accelerate the laboratory evolution of candidate antibodies for therapeutic use.

         While much attention has been focused on the antigen receptor binding (CDR3) and effector cell function (Fc) modifications of antibodies, other studies have engineered variant sequences in the hinge region of Ig and have uncovered mechanisms that can improve the function of therapeutic antibodies.
        </p>
        <p>
         The hinge region links the two antigen binding sites in the Fab portion of the antibody with the Fc effector region in the heavy chain domain [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. The length of the hinge region varies among the different classes and subclasses of immunoglobulins. Hinge modifications can be used to increase or decrease the flexibility of this region.

          Longer hinge region

         <strong>
          with greater flexibility
         </strong>
         – Among the four subclasses of IgG, IgG3 has a hinge region of up to 62 amino acids, which is fourfold longer than the other IgG classes. Functions attributed to the longer IgG3 hinge region are due in large part to increased flexibility, as well as altered Fab–Fab and Fab–Fc positioning. These changes allow for two epitopes to be linked or for an epitope to be brought into closer proximity to an immune cell.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Moreover, the longer hinge region of IgG3 appears better able to engage low abundance antigens, as well as improve access to epitopes that may be in altered configurations. Clinically, IgG3 is the most frequently identified subclass of broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies. These antibodies harbor a more flexible hinge that is thought to help target less-accessible epitopes on the viral envelope.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In a 2016 study, bispecific anti-Env neutralizing antibodies were engineered by combining a flexible hinge domain of IgG3 to promote Fab domain flexibility, resulting in the hetero-bivalent binding to the Env trimer [

          Shorter hinge region with less flexibility
         </strong>
         – The hinge region can also be made less flexible to promote agonistic activities. As an example, IgG2 subtype anti-CD40 antibodies have been shown to promote agonistic activity for potential treatments in cancer immunotherapy [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Engineered sequences in IgG2 that promote disulfide shuffling in the hinge region result in a less flexible antibody with increased therapeutic activity. Importantly, the agonistic antibody activity is independent of the effector antibody Fc function, and FcgR expression in the microenvironment. These engineering strategies have potential to develop therapeutic mAbs that are not constrained by the Fc region activity and in this case promote CD40 signaling as part of an immune response.

        <p>
         In principle, the more similar an mAb is to human sequences shared among many individuals, the less likely it is to elicit an immune reaction against the mAb such as infusion reactions and reduced efficacy, although these are not easily predicted. (See

         Antigenization is an investigational approach in which an mAb can be engineered to deliver an antigen (eg, as a vaccine). This is done by replacing part of the antibody polypeptide with a fragment of a microbial antigen. Any sequence can be inserted into various portions of the antibody molecule.
        </p>
        <p>
         Antigenized mAbs are potentially useful as vaccines since they have a longer half-life compared with the isolated antigen fragment and may be better tolerated than some microbial fragments.

         Fc receptors can be engineered to bind specific receptors on subpopulations of cells or to have specific glycoprotein modifications.

          Recruitment of immune mediators
         </strong>
         – mAbs can recruit immune cells and molecules such as complement, which can promote killing of target cells. This is mediated by the Fc portion of the antibody  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56393" href="/z/d/graphic/56393.html" rel="external">
          figure 3

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Fc receptors can recruit immune effector cells to cause antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or antibody-mediated phagocytosis by monocytes/macrophages [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. Fc receptors can also promote cell death via complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), in which mAb binding to target cells results in the activation of the complement cascade.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Some antibodies have features of both ADCC and CDC, and in some cases, mAbs can be further engineered to alter their Fc binding to enhance cell death [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31,32
         </a>
         ]. Complement activation can have both agonistic and antagonistic effects on CDC and ADCC, and it is unclear which mechanisms are most responsible for eliminating malignant cells. Target cell killing can also be enhanced by using the antibody as a vehicle to deliver a toxin or cytotoxic drug directly to the target cell using an mAb-drug or mAb-toxin conjugate. (See

         mAbs are increasingly used to treat autoimmune diseases that affect females of childbearing potential, necessitating investigations of maternal and fetal safety.
        </p>
        <p>
         Experience during pregnancy is mostly limited to case reports, generally involving mAbs that have been approved for many years and therefore are of the IgG1 subclass, which can accumulate in the fetus.
        </p>
        <p>
         IgG is poorly transported from the maternal blood to the fetus early in pregnancy, but by the middle of the second trimester there is substantial increase in placental transfer of IgG1 and accumulation of maternal IgG in the fetal circulation.
        </p>
        <p>
         The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is the critical receptor at the maternal-fetal barrier responsible for the transport of IgG (especially IgG1) to the fetal circulation. FcRn is expressed on the placenta within the syncytiotrophoblast layer and promotes release of IgG into the fetal circulation via endocytosis [
         <a href="#rid54">
          54
         </a>
         ]. FcRn normally is expressed in endothelial and liver cells and is the main regulator of the half-life of IgG, via endosomal recycling. Most mAbs can be transferred to the fetus via placental FcRn, especially after the first trimester, and their effects on embryogenesis and fetal immune system development are unknown.
        </p>
        <p>
         The most studied mAbs in pregnancy are the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors. The role of TNF-alpha in embryogenesis and organogenesis has led to wide study for congenital birth defects after exposure to inhibitory mAbs. Many of the early studies were limited in differentiating outcomes between mAb drug exposure or insufficient disease control.
        </p>
        <p>
         Analysis of postmarketing surveillance databases identified 1850 pregnancies with exposure to a TNF-alpha inhibitor and found similar frequencies of spontaneous abortion, preterm labor, and low birth weight rates to the general population [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The 2016 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for use of antirheumatic drugs before and during pregnancy stated that TNF inhibitors are reasonably safe to use in the first and second trimesters [
         <a href="#rid56">
          56,57
         </a>
         ]. The American College of Rheumatology largely endorsed the use of certolizumab (which lacks an Fc receptor and does not bind the FcRn) and other IgG mAbs during the first and second trimesters [

         <strong>
          Methodologies
         </strong>
         – Several technologies are available for selecting and producing mAbs for clinical use. Modifications include generation of antibody fragments, modification of the hinge region, humanization of antibodies produced in animals, creation of bifunctional antibodies that recruit two separate antigens, and conjugation to a drug or toxin. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods for antibody design are under study and show promise in accelerating mAb discovery. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Production methods and special modifications'

         <strong>
          Mechanism of action
         </strong>
         – mAbs can modulate immunity, kill cells, and/or neutralize infectious organisms. Mechanisms include blocking a physiologic ligand-receptor interaction and recruiting immune cells and proteins (eg, phagocytes, natural killer [NK] cells, complement) that can kill the target cell. mAb can sequester plasma proteins or drugs away from their ligands. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Mechanism of action'

         <strong>
          Administration
         </strong>
         – Pay attention to the dose, route, and potential drug interactions. In certain conditions, patients may receive &gt;1 mAb. If plasmapheresis is used, the timing should minimize removal of the mAb. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Adverse effects
         </strong>
         – Adverse effects of mAbs include infusion reactions, cytokine release syndrome, immune-related effects, infections, autoimmunity, off-target effects, and interference with certain laboratory tests such as pretransfusion type and screen. (See
