         Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is characterized by preoccupation with nonexistent or slight defects in physical appearance; despite looking normal, patients believe that they look abnormal, unattractive, ugly, or deformed [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The preoccupation with perceived flaws leads to excessive repetitive behaviors (eg, checking their appearance in mirrors), which are usually difficult to control and not pleasurable. BDD is common but usually underrecognized, causes clinically significant distress and/or impaired functioning, and is often associated with suicidal ideation and behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with BDD may present to mental health or to other clinicians, such as dermatologists; plastic surgeons; ear, nose, and throat physicians; primary care physicians; pediatricians; gynecologists; and dentists. Most patients seek nonpsychiatric cosmetic treatment (most commonly dermatologic and surgical) for their perceived physical defects; administering this treatment appears to be ineffective for most patients and can pose risks for clinicians.
        </p>
        <p>
         By contrast, pharmacotherapy (ie, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9283" href="/z/d/drug information/9283.html" rel="external">
          clomipramine
         </a>
         ) and/or cognitive-behavioral therapy tailored specifically to BDD are often efficacious. However, many patients do not reveal their BDD symptoms to their clinicians due to embarrassment, and are not aware that effective treatment is available [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. When medications are prescribed, patients often do not receive at least minimally adequate doses for a sufficient duration of time [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].

         Mild to moderate body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is characterized by the following clinical features:

         No suicidal intent or self-harming behaviors are present. In addition, there is no suicidal ideation, or if suicidal thoughts are present, they do not pose an imminent risk. Suicidal ideation that does not represent an imminent risk includes passive suicidal ideation, such as thoughts that life is not worth living or that one would not mind going to sleep and not waking up.

         We suggest that acute treatment of mild to moderate BDD proceed according to the sequence described in the sections below. Patients begin with initial treatment and progress through each step until they respond. The duration of an adequate treatment trial with pharmacotherapy or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See

        </p>

         The primary treatments that we suggest for BDD, either as monotherapy or combination therapy, include:

         </span>
         For patients with mild to moderate BDD, we suggest either pharmacotherapy or CBT that is specifically tailored to BDD [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-7
         </a>
         ]. However, a reasonable alternative is pharmacotherapy plus CBT [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Randomized trials have found that pharmacotherapy or CBT is each efficacious, and no head-to-head trials have compared pharmacotherapy with CBT. Medications are usually more available than CBT, and the drugs that are used for BDD can also treat many of its comorbidities, such as unipolar major depression, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Other factors to consider in choosing a treatment regimen include patient preference, prior treatment history, pregnancy status, medication safety and side effects, and the likelihood that the patient will fully participate in and adhere to the recommended treatment [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. The use of pharmacotherapy or CBT is consistent with treatment guidelines [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ] and the results from systematic reviews [

         </span>
         Initial pharmacotherapy for BDD consists of SSRIs, based upon randomized trials  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef141049" href="/z/d/graphic/141049.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1

         <a href="#rid2">
          2,12-14
         </a>
         ]. We typically choose
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8465" href="/z/d/drug information/8465.html" rel="external">
          fluoxetine
         </a>
         ,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9886" href="/z/d/drug information/9886.html" rel="external">
          sertraline
         </a>
         , or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9046" href="/z/d/drug information/9046.html" rel="external">
          escitalopram
         </a>
         because they are generally well tolerated; in addition, escitalopram is less likely to cause drug-drug interactions than other SSRIs. If the insurance company will not reimburse for doses that exceed the highest dose approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), fluoxetine is a good choice. Nevertheless, other SSRIs are suitable as initial treatment. No head-to-head trials have compared different SSRIs with each other, and there is no compelling reason to think that one SSRI is more efficacious than another. However, our experience indicates that
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9743" href="/z/d/drug information/9743.html" rel="external">
          paroxetine
         </a>
         is often not as well tolerated as other SSRIs. In addition, we typically do not use
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8874" href="/z/d/drug information/8874.html" rel="external">
          citalopram
         </a>
         because the FDA dosing limit is now too low to usually treat BDD effectively. Treatment of BDD with SSRIs often requires high doses  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117776" href="/z/d/graphic/117776.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ), and there are concerns about the cardiac side effects of citalopram at higher doses. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14675.html" rel="external">
          "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects", section on 'Citalopram'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         SSRIs often decrease the BDD symptoms of obsessional preoccupation, compulsive behaviors, distress, and functional impairment [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6
         </a>
         ]. In addition, these medications often improve depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation and behavior, anger and hostility, somatic symptoms, and mental health-related quality of life. Monotherapy with SSRIs is as effective for patients with delusional BDD beliefs as for patients with nondelusional beliefs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence for the efficacy of SSRIs includes a 12-week randomized trial that compared
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8465" href="/z/d/drug information/8465.html" rel="external">
          fluoxetine
         </a>
         (mean dose 78 mg/day at week 12) with placebo in 67 patients with BDD [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Response (reduction of baseline symptoms ≥30 percent) occurred in more patients treated with fluoxetine than placebo (53 versus 18 percent), and functional improvement was greater with fluoxetine. The benefit of fluoxetine was independent of psychiatric comorbidity (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or personality disorder), and was comparable for patients with delusional BDD beliefs and those with nondelusional BDD beliefs. In addition, fluoxetine exerted a protective effect against worsening of suicidal ideation, compared with placebo [

         For improvement or an optimal response, the highest dose approved by the FDA is sometimes exceeded, comparable to treatment of other illnesses, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder.

         Somewhat lower initial and maximum doses may be more suitable for children and adolescents and some older adult patients. It is generally recommended that the highest dose approved by the FDA not be exceeded when treating younger youth (eg, age 10 years), and caution should be used with older adults [
         <a href="#rid11">

         </a>
         at doses greater than 30 mg/day should be assessed with an ECG as the dose is titrated up. As an example, a patient who is ultimately administered 60 mg/day should be monitored with an ECG at 40, 50, and 60 mg/day. If the ECG is normal at the final dose, subsequent ECGs are repeated only when clinically indicated; if the ECG is abnormal at any point, cardiology should be consulted. We suggest that clinicians also get an ECG at high doses of other SSRIs (eg, the maximum doses noted above).

         No fixed-dose randomized trials have compared different doses of an SSRI for BDD. However, a retrospective study evaluated medication trials in 99 patients with BDD who had received an SSRI or

         150 mg. Treatment that was minimally adequate was associated with greater improvement in BDD and less severe current BDD symptoms, compared with less adequate treatment trials.
         <sup>
         </sup>
         Similar results were observed for medication trials that were “optimal” for BDD, which lasted at least 12 weeks and if necessary, used (or for SSRIs exceeded) the highest dose approved by the FDA.

        <p>
         Doses are typically titrated up by increments that are equivalent to the starting dose, every two to three weeks to the highest FDA approved dose by week 6 to 10, if tolerated and if a lower dose does not improve symptoms [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,13
         </a>
         ]. However, for

          escitalopram
         </a>
         , we attempt to achieve a dose of 30 mg/day by week 6 to 10 (the FDA’s highest approved dose of 20 mg/day for escitalopram appears to be low relative to the highest approved doses of other SSRIs [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]). A faster titration schedule can be attempted for severely ill (eg, highly suicidal) patients in the context of more frequent monitoring for response and adverse effects. Alternatively, a slower schedule can be used for youth or older adult patients, and for patients who experience side effects, report a history of poor SSRI tolerability, or show early improvement. If patients demonstrate early improvement, or substantial improvement at any point before reaching the highest dose approved by the FDA, we generally give the current dose more time to further improve symptoms before raising the dose again. We recommend a slower dose titration when doses above the highest FDA approved doses are used (eg, increasing the dose every four weeks).
        </p>
        <p>
         Before determining whether the drug is beneficial, we suggest that patients receive an acute medication trial lasting 12 to 16 weeks [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,11,13
         </a>
         ]. For at least 4 of these weeks, clinicians should prescribe the highest dose approved by the FDA (or for
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9046" href="/z/d/drug information/9046.html" rel="external">

         , 30 mg/day) if needed and tolerated.
        </p>
        <p>
         All medications prescribed for BDD are off-label because no pharmaceutical company has pursued an FDA indication for BDD [

         CBT is the psychotherapy of choice for BDD and has been more widely studied than other psychotherapies [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,24
         </a>
         ]. Although CBT is usually administered individually face-to-face (or by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA]-compliant video if face-to-face treatment is not possible or is less preferable), patients have also been treated in a group format [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25

        </p>
        <p>
         CBT for BDD must be tailored to specifically address BDD’s unique symptoms; otherwise, it is unlikely to be helpful. Although the techniques and elements of CBT for BDD overlap with those that are used for other psychiatric disorders, BDD differs from other disorders in important ways and thus needs a somewhat different CBT approach. Two empirically supported treatment manuals are available for therapists [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27,28
         </a>
         ], one of which can be adapted for treating adolescents [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The number and frequency of individual CBT sessions in different studies has varied substantially, from 12 weekly hour-long sessions to 12 weeks of daily 90-minute sessions. Our clinical experience suggests that most patients need at least six months of weekly treatment. Patients with mild BDD may improve with fewer sessions, whereas those with more severe BDD may require longer treatment or more frequent treatment sessions. Patients generally receive a full course of therapy.

        <p>

        <p>
         CBT is a structured treatment [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. The first three to four sessions are spent setting the groundwork for therapy. This includes gaining an understanding of the patient’s BDD symptoms and other psychopathology, providing psychoeducation about BDD, and developing an individualized cognitive-behavioral model of the patient’s illness, including hypothesized mechanisms that cause and/or maintain the BDD symptoms. This model helps the patient understand how CBT may be beneficial. Treatment goals are identified, and along with the individualized model, used to create a treatment plan. It is important to incorporate the patient's values and goals into the treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another component of the introductory sessions, if needed, is motivational interviewing to address patient ambivalence about participating in treatment [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. Clinicians attempt to motivate patients to change their thoughts and behaviors by expressing empathy with patients, eliciting both their reasons to change and ambivalence about change, not arguing with patients about their ambivalence, helping patients develop an awareness of the discrepancy between their present situation and what they desire, and setting treatment goals regarding valued life activities (eg, developing relationships or advancing one’s career). Motivational interviewing may be needed after the introductory sessions to retain patients in treatment and enhance adherence.
        </p>
        <p>
         After laying this groundwork, treatment focuses upon the core elements of CBT [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. In most studies, the core elements included cognitive restructuring, exposure (eg, to avoided social situations) in combination with behavioral experiments, prevention of rituals/repetitive behaviors (eg, mirror checking), perceptual retraining/mindfulness when looking in a mirror (a five-minute exercise that helps patients see themselves holistically and nonjudgmentally; it does not involve staring in the mirror at perceived flaws), advanced cognitive strategies that identify and modify deeply held beliefs (eg, “I am worthless, and no one will ever love me”), and relapse prevention. During exposures, CBT incorporates behavioral experiments in which patients test their maladaptive beliefs (eg, “My nose is huge, and at least 70 percent of the people I see in the store will stare at me for at least five seconds because I look so bad”). Behavioral experiments are incorporated into exposures because many patients have little to no insight, and exposure without behavioral experiments may be insufficient.
        </p>
        <p>
         CBT treatment strategies that may be helpful when used in addition to the core elements include habit reversal training (behavioral therapy for reducing BDD-related skin picking or hair plucking), and a focus upon depressive symptoms if needed (eg, activity scheduling/behavioral activation and cognitive restructuring). If patients are receiving or contemplating cosmetic treatment for BDD, this also needs to be addressed. Techniques can also be modified if needed for muscle dysmorphia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Therapists need to encourage patients to do CBT exercises while not pushing patients so hard that they drop out of treatment. Exposure exercises are usually done gradually, with use of an exposure hierarchy that the patient and therapist develop together. Cognitive restructuring skills are usually learned before exposure, because using cognitive skills during exposure may make exposures more tolerable.
        </p>
        <p>
         The final sessions are devoted to relapse prevention. This includes reviewing the patient’s progress and identifying ongoing problems; reinforcing the most helpful CBT components; anticipating future stressful situations and planning responses; teaching patients to identify and monitor subsyndromal symptoms, differentiating “slips” or lapses (recurrence of BDD symptoms) from full-blown relapses of the disorder; discussing risk factors for relapse; and developing a plan that patients will follow if problems occur, including the possibility of resuming treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         After treatment ends, it is important that patients continue to practice CBT skills to decrease the risk of relapse. In addition, patients may benefit from occasional (eg, once every two months) booster sessions with therapists to help maintain acquired skills or manage recurrent symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Certain techniques should be avoided. We recommend that patients not be told to stare in the mirror at perceived appearance flaws, because doing so reinforces the BDD ritual of mirror checking, and symptoms may worsen [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Instead, patients should attempt ritual prevention to refrain from mirror checking, and they should briefly look in the mirror only when necessary, in a mindful, nonjudgmental, and holistic way (taking in all aspects of their appearance, not just disliked areas), as described above in this section.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also recommend that therapists avoid more “extreme” exposures and behavioral experiments (eg, painting big red spots on one’s face and going out in public, or holding a sign in public asking strangers to tell patients that they are ugly) [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Because patients with BDD are often suicidal, usually have little or no insight, and may potentially be aggressive, such exposures may have negative outcomes, including worsening symptoms and suicidal ideation and behavior. Many patients with BDD are too depressed and emotionally fragile to tolerate potentially embarrassing or humiliating exposures. In addition, one goal of exposures is to help patients learn that other people do not take special notice of them in a negative way or make fun of them; extreme exposures may actually elicit aversive responses from others.
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence supporting the use of CBT for patients who are acutely ill with BDD includes multiple randomized trials [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,24

         BDD may not respond satisfactorily to initial treatment with an SSRI or CBT specifically tailored for BDD; in some cases this is due to significant life stressors and/or comorbid psychopathology (eg, unipolar major depression, social anxiety disorder, or a personality disorder). If a stressor or disorder other than BDD is more salient than BDD, treatment should refocus upon the primary problem. The comorbidity of BDD is discussed separately. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         If BDD is the primary problem and has not responded to initial treatment, next-step treatment depends upon whether the patient initially received pharmacotherapy or CBT.

         Initial pharmacotherapy for BDD that yields inadequate improvement is initially managed by assessing adherence and the dose of the initial drug. For patients with good adherence to medications that are properly dosed, subsequent treatment includes either switching to a different SSRI or augmenting the initial drug, depending upon the degree to which the initial drug is beneficial and tolerable. In addition, BDD-specific CBT can be added to medication treatment if the patient is not already receiving it. The suggested doses for SSRIs, and the use of CBT, are discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See

         Assess adherence – For patients who obtain insufficient symptom relief from a 12- to 16-week SSRI trial that reaches the highest dose approved by the FDA (or for

          escitalopram
         </a>
         , 30 mg/day) for at least 4 of those weeks, clinicians should assess adherence by asking how often the patient does not take the medication. Nonadherence is common during treatment of psychiatric disorders. If adherence has been suboptimal (eg, missing 20 percent or more doses), this should be addressed with motivational interviewing [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34,35
         </a>
         ]. Improving adherence with pharmacotherapy can convert nonresponders to responders.

         </span>
         Assess the dose – If symptoms persist despite good medication adherence and the medication is well tolerated at the highest dose approved by the FDA, we suggest gradually increasing the SSRI dose (excluding
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8874" href="/z/d/drug information/8874.html" rel="external">
          citalopram
         </a>
         ). The rate of titration can be slower and/or dose increments smaller when increasing the dose above the FDA highest dose. Tolerability should be closely monitored. If clinically necessary, clinicians should use the maximum SSRI dose. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Maximum dose'

         </span>
         Choosing next step treatment – For patients who do not improve sufficiently at the maximum SSRI dose, next step treatment rests upon determining whether the drug provided any benefit and is tolerable. If symptoms do not improve even minimally with the first SSRI, either augmenting the SSRI or discontinuing it and switching to another SSRI are both reasonable options. Nevertheless, if the maximum SSRI dose is sufficiently tolerable, we generally prefer to augment the SSRI with another medication (eg, second-generation antipsychotic or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9172" href="/z/d/drug information/9172.html" rel="external">
          buspirone
         </a>
         ), especially if the SSRI provides at least some clinically meaningful benefit. Limited data, as well as our clinical experience, suggest that augmentation of an SSRI with a second medication may further improve BDD symptoms [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6,13
         </a>
         ]. Augmentation has the advantage of maintaining partial improvement of BDD symptoms, as well as other gains that might have occurred with the initial drug, such as improvement in depressive symptoms, anxiety, suicidality, anger/hostility. In addition, we suggest augmentation after multiple (eg, two) monotherapy trials fail to provide adequate relief [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ].

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         If the initial drug is poorly tolerated, we suggest discontinuing it and administering one or more trials with another SSRI (ie, monotherapy with a new SSRI)  (

         Augmenting the SSRI with another medication is usually deferred until the patient has received an adequate SSRI trial in terms of dose and duration, as SSRIs are often effective, and monotherapy reduces the risk of medication side effects and drug-drug interactions. However, for patients who are severely ill, agitated, potentially aggressive, and/or at risk of suicide, augmentation with a second-generation antipsychotic can be implemented before the patient has had an adequate trial of an SSRI.

         For patients who do not respond satisfactorily to initial treatment with CBT specifically tailored for BDD, we suggest first ascertaining whether homework adherence has been good, because nonadherence is common during treatment of psychiatric disorders. Daily practice is necessary to learn CBT skills. If adherence has been suboptimal, we suggest motivational interviewing to increase adherence; improving adherence with CBT homework can convert nonresponders to responders.
        </p>
        <p>
         If adherence has been good, but an evidence-based BDD-focused CBT treatment manual has not been used, we suggest administering CBT according to such a manual [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27,28

         ]. Other options include a more frequent schedule of visits for CBT (eg, two or three times per week rather than once per week), longer CBT sessions (eg, two to three hours), and/or a longer course of CBT (eg, nine months rather than six months).
        </p>
        <p>
         If response to CBT remains unsatisfactory despite good adherence, using a CBT treatment manual, more frequent sessions, longer sessions, and a longer course of CBT, we suggest administering one or more trials with SSRIs.

         Patients with BDD may not respond sufficiently to multiple (eg, two to three) SSRI trials, either as monotherapy or with augmentation with another drug and/or CBT. For these patients, we suggest discontinuing the SSRI and switching to monotherapy with the tricyclic

         should not exceed more than 250 mg/day because of poor tolerability at higher doses, and serum concentrations should be monitored during titration for safety (excessively high serum levels may occur in patients who slowly metabolize the drug). Combined serum concentrations of clomipramine plus desmethylclomipramine, drawn approximately 12 hours after the last dose, should not exceed 500 ng/mL to minimize adverse events.

         In addition, we recommended an ECG during titration and at the highest dose reached. If the ECG is normal, subsequent ECGs are repeated only when clinically indicated; if the initial ECG is abnormal, cardiology should be consulted.

         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. Patients were initially assigned to a study drug for eight weeks and then blindly crossed over to the other drug for eight weeks, with the order determined randomly. Improvement of symptoms was greater during treatment with clomipramine than desipramine, both at week 8 and week 16. In addition, improvement of functioning was greater with clomipramine. Clomipramine was equally effective in patients with delusional BDD beliefs and in patients with nondelusional BDD beliefs, and it was equally effective for patients with and without comorbid psychopathology (eg, depression). Side effects for the two treatments were comparable. The use of desipramine controlled for the nonspecific anxiolytic and antidepressive effects of clomipramine. In addition, desipramine is less serotonergic than clomipramine, and thus served to demonstrate the superiority of antidepressants with serotonergic properties for treating BDD.

         Although no head-to-head trials have compared

          clomipramine

         with SSRIs, clomipramine is generally reserved for use when SSRIs have not been helpful, because tolerability is usually better with SSRIs than tricyclics [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2

         </a>
         , we suggest assessing adherence and increasing the dose of the drug; however, clinicians should not exceed 250 mg/day, the highest dose approved by the FDA. Other options include discontinuing the drug and switching to an SSRI that was not previously prescribed; augmenting clomipramine with a second-generation antipsychotic,

         If supportive psychotherapy or family therapy are used, we suggest that the therapy be administered by a therapist other than the therapist who provides CBT. This enables the CBT therapist to help the patient stay on track with CBT, which is highly structured.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with excessive amounts of free unstructured time, activity scheduling/behavioral activation is recommended so patients have less time to obsess and engage in BDD rituals.
        </p>
        <p>
         Education of family members about BDD, which can be done as part of CBT or medication treatment, can also be helpful. As an example, it can be useful to explain the symptoms of the disorder, its treatment, that BDD is not vanity or selfishness, how to not accommodate BDD rituals, and how the family can support the person with BDD.

         Severely ill patients should be referred to a psychiatrist for management. Patients with recent suicidal behavior (eg, in the past week) or active suicidal ideation generally require hospitalization to stabilize safety. Those without active suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior may receive outpatient treatment, intensive outpatient treatment, partial hospital treatment, or residential treatment that is specifically tailored to BDD, depending upon the clinical urgency. Patients with severe BDD and a severe comorbid disorder (eg, substance abuse that appears triggered largely by BDD symptoms) need concurrent treatment that focuses upon both BDD and the comorbidity.

         For patients with severe BDD, we suggest initial treatment with pharmacotherapy plus cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) that is specifically tailored to BDD [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         First line pharmacotherapy for severe BDD is typically a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Choosing and administering a specific medication is discussed elsewhere in this topic, as is administration of CBT. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pharmacotherapy'
         </a>
         above and
         <a class="local">
          'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         For severe BDD with suicidal behavior or active suicidal ideation, we suggest concomitant treatment that is consistent with guidelines and manuals for suicidality. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1708.html" rel="external">
          "Suicidal ideation and behavior in adults", section on 'Management'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         If CBT that is tailored to BDD is not available, or if patients decline CBT, either pharmacotherapy plus supportive psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy alone is a reasonable alternative for many patients, or the patient can be referred to a specialized intensive treatment program for BDD. Information about supportive psychotherapy is discussed separately in the context of depression. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14687.html" rel="external">
          "Unipolar depression in adults: Supportive psychotherapy"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         If patients are too severely ill to meaningfully participate in CBT, we suggest medication plus supportive psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy alone, plus a focus on suicidality if needed, until the patient can participate in CBT. CBT requires patient motivation and work during and in between sessions. Partial response to initial medication treatment can make CBT more feasible.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some patients who have been severely ill for a long time (eg, decades) may benefit from social skills training or work training following improvement with medication and CBT.

         Severe BDD may not respond to first line treatment with an SSRI plus CBT tailored to BDD. Subsequent treatment consists of sequential pharmacotherapy trials that proceed in a manner comparable to the next step treatments used for mild to moderate BDD that is unresponsive to initial treatment. Clinicians should also evaluate the need for motivational interviewing for insufficient adherence and use of an empirically based treatment manual to improve the response to CBT. Sequential medication trials and the means for improving the effectiveness of CBT are discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, outpatients with severe BDD that does not respond to initial treatment should be evaluated for a higher level of care. Depending upon the clinical urgency, the patient may require referral to more intensive treatment in the setting of intensive outpatient treatment, partial hospital treatment, or residential treatment that provides evidence-based treatment for BDD.
        </p>

         Based upon clinical experience, electroconvulsive therapy is occasionally used for severe BDD [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,13,52,53
         </a>
         ]. Although most case series data suggest that electroconvulsive therapy is usually not effective for BDD [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,13
         </a>
         ], electroconvulsive therapy combined with a serotonergic drug and psychotherapy is sometimes used for patients with severe comorbid depression (especially if depression does not appear secondary to BDD), as well as for patients who have active suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior [
         <a href="#rid11">

         In one case report, improvement of BDD symptoms occurred with deep brain stimulation that targeted the ventral capsule/ventral striatum [

          —
         </span>
         For patients with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) who respond to acute pharmacotherapy, we suggest that they maintain the regimen for at least several (eg, 3 to 4) years, based upon limited evidence [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,13
         </a>
         ]. Many patients continue their medications longer (eg, 5 to 20 years). Patients with a severe course of illness, such as those who have made multiple suicide attempts or suffered multiple relapses or hospitalizations should continue pharmacotherapy indefinitely. In addition, patients who discontinue pharmacotherapy and experience a poor outcome (eg, suicide attempt or relapse) should resume pharmacotherapy; following stabilization, the regimen should continue indefinitely.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients who respond acutely to a regimen that includes a second-generation antipsychotic, it is reasonable after one to two years to attempt a slow taper (eg, over three to six months), and then discontinue the antipsychotic to avoid potential adverse effects. Alternatively, clinicians can maintain the antipsychotic longer with close monitoring, especially for patients who were severely ill or suicidal before treatment with the antipsychotic. The adverse effects of second-generation antipsychotics are discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14776.html" rel="external">
          "Second-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects", section on 'Adverse effects'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence supporting the use of maintenance treatment includes a randomized trial in patients with BDD (n = 58) who initially responded to open-label
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9046" href="/z/d/drug information/9046.html" rel="external">
          escitalopram

         (mean dose 26 mg/day) and were then randomly assigned to continue escitalopram or to placebo substitution [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. Randomly assigned treatment was administered for up to six months, during which relapse occurred in half as many patients who received escitalopram than placebo (18 versus 40 percent).
        </p>
        <p>
         Some patients are discouraged by the prospect of taking medications "forever." In such cases, we emphasize the long-term nature of the relationship between the clinician and patient, and that the need for maintenance treatment will periodically be reevaluated in light of the patient's progress in maintaining symptomatic and functional stability. It may also help to point out that other chronic illnesses such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and asthma often require long-term medications.

          General principles

         – Before initiating treatment for body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), we educate patients about the illness and its psychiatric treatments, as well as the likely futility of cosmetic interventions. (See

          Initial treatment
         </strong>
         – For patients with mild to moderate BDD, we suggest initial treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) that is specifically tailored for BDD, rather than other treatment regimens, such as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9283" href="/z/d/drug information/9283.html" rel="external">
          clomipramine
         </a>
         or supportive psychotherapy (

          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). However, an SSRI plus CBT is a reasonable alternative.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         For patients who receive SSRIs, we typically choose

          paroxetine
         </a>
         are reasonable alternatives. Relatively high SSRI doses are often needed to successfully treat BDD  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef117776" href="/z/d/graphic/117776.html" rel="external">
          table 1

         ). We generally do not use
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8874" href="/z/d/drug information/8874.html" rel="external">
          citalopram
         </a>
         because of concerns about the cardiac side effects of citalopram at the higher doses that are frequently required to treat BDD. (See

         For patients with mild to moderate BDD who obtain insufficient symptom relief from an optimal trial of an SSRI, we either augment the initial SSRI with a second drug or discontinue the SSRI and administer one or more monotherapy trials with other SSRIs. For patients who achieve clinically meaningful improvement with the initial SSRI, augmentation is generally preferred to switching to another SSRI. Add-on pharmacotherapy options include a second-generation antipsychotic (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8786" href="/z/d/drug information/8786.html" rel="external">

          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). A reasonable alternative for patients who obtain insufficient symptom relief from initial treatment with an SSRI, or from subsequent trials with other SSRIs, is to administer CBT adapted for BDD. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Patients initially treated with pharmacotherapy'

         Patients with mild to moderate BDD may not respond satisfactorily to CBT despite use of an empirically supported BDD-focused treatment manual, good adherence with homework, and sufficient duration and frequency of CBT. These patients are treated with more frequent sessions of CBT, longer CBT sessions, a longer course of CBT, or one or more courses of SSRIs. (See

         Severe core symptoms of BDD – For patients with severe BDD, we suggest pharmacotherapy plus CBT that is specifically tailored to BDD, rather than pharmacotherapy alone or CBT alone (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). However, if CBT is not available, is declined, or cannot be implemented because the patient is too severely ill to participate, either medication plus supportive psychotherapy or medication alone is a reasonable alternative for many patients, or the patient can be referred to a specialized intensive treatment program for BDD. (See
         <a class="local">

         Suicidal ideation or behavior – Highly suicidal patients with BDD often require a higher level of care such as hospitalization and should be treated with pharmacotherapy plus CBT that is focused upon both suicidality and BDD. Electroconvulsive therapy, combined with an SSRI and CBT, may help severely depressed BDD patients who appear at high risk of suicide. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Maintenance treatment
         </strong>
         – For patients with BDD who respond to pharmacotherapy, we suggest maintaining the regimen for at least several years (eg, three to four), rather than discontinuing treatment (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Patients with a severe course of illness (eg, multiple suicide attempts or relapses) should continue pharmacotherapy indefinitely. Patients who respond to CBT should be offered booster sessions if needed. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Maintenance treatment'
