         Abnormal liver biochemical and function tests are frequently detected in asymptomatic patients since many screening blood test panels routinely include them [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. A population-based survey in the United States conducted between 1999 and 2002 estimated that an abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was present in 8.9 percent of respondents. Although the term "liver function tests" (LFTs) is used commonly, it is imprecise and potentially misleading since many of the tests reflecting the health of the liver are not direct measures of its function. Furthermore, the commonly used liver biochemical tests may be abnormal even in patients with a healthy liver.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic review will provide an overview on the evaluation of patients with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests. Our approach is largely consistent with the 2017 American College of Gastroenterology clinical guidelines on evaluation of abnormal liver biochemistries [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Other guidelines have also been published [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Detailed discussions of the individual tests and noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis are presented separately. (See

         Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are biochemical markers of liver injury. Albumin, bilirubin, and prothrombin time are markers of hepatocellular function.
        </p>
        <p>
         Elevations of liver enzymes often reflect damage to the liver or biliary obstruction, whereas an abnormal serum albumin or prothrombin time may be seen in the setting of impaired hepatic synthetic function. The serum bilirubin in part measures the liver's ability to detoxify metabolites and transport organic anions into bile.

         In adults, normal ALT levels range from 29 to 33 units/L for males and 19 to 25 units/L for females. Levels above these values should be assessed for underlying liver disease [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. In children, median ALT levels range from 17 to 21 units/L in boys and 14 to 20 units/L in girls, with the 97th percentile (commonly used as a cutoff value) of 29 to 38 and 24 to 32 units/L, respectively [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The sensitivity and specificity of the serum aminotransferases (formerly transaminases), particularly serum ALT, for differentiating those with liver disease from those without liver disease depend on the cutoff values chosen to define an abnormal test. A population-based study from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey examined patients with known hepatitis C virus infection (n = 259) and compared them with patients at low risk of liver injury (n = 3747) to determine optimal cutoff values for ALT [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. The optimal cutoff for men was an ALT of 29 units/L and for women was an ALT of 22 units/L. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3573.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of liver biochemical tests", section on 'Serum aminotransferases'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         AST is present in the liver and other organs including cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, kidney, and brain. In children, levels decline with age, more so in girls than boys after age 11 [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. ALT is present primarily in the liver, and thus is a more specific marker of hepatocellular cell injury. ALT levels correlate with the degree of abdominal adiposity [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ], and at least two large studies have suggested that the cutoff values should be adjusted for sex and body mass index (but not age) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. However, most patients identified using the lower cutoff values have only mild liver disease or no identifiable cause of the abnormal laboratory values. Thus, the overall benefit of the proposed modifications is unclear since it would translate into a large increase in the absolute number of patients who would require evaluation for an uncertain clinical benefit [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ].

         Serum alkaline phosphatase is derived predominantly from the liver and bones. An elevated alkaline phosphatase can be fractionated to determine if it originates from the liver or bones, although in practice a liver source is usually confirmed by the simultaneous elevation of other measures of cholestasis (eg, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Confirming an elevated alkaline phosphatase is of hepatic origin'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Other sources may also contribute to serum levels of alkaline phosphatase. Women in the third trimester of pregnancy, for example, have elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels due to an influx into blood of placental alkaline phosphatase. Individuals with blood types O and B can have elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels after eating a fatty meal due to an influx of intestinal alkaline phosphatase. Infants and toddlers occasionally display transient marked elevations of alkaline phosphatase in the absence of detectable bone or liver disease. Alkaline phosphatase elevations have been noted in patients with diabetes mellitus [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. There are also reports of a benign familial occurrence of elevated serum alkaline phosphatase due to intestinal alkaline phosphatase. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3612.html" rel="external">
          "Enzymatic measures of hepatic cholestasis (alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase)", section on 'Alkaline phosphatase'

         and

          "Transient hyperphosphatasemia of infancy and early childhood"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Alkaline phosphatase levels also vary with age. Alkaline phosphatase levels are generally higher in children and adolescents because of physiologic osteoblastic activity. Levels may be up to three times higher than in healthy adults, with maximum levels in infancy and adolescence, coinciding with periods of maximum bone growth velocity  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56695" href="/z/d/graphic/56695.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Also, the normal serum alkaline phosphatase level gradually increases from age 40 to 65 years, particularly in women. The normal alkaline phosphatase level for an otherwise healthy 65-year-old woman is more than 50 percent higher than that for a healthy 30-year-old woman.

         GGT is found in hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells, as well as in the kidney, seminal vesicles, pancreas, spleen, heart, and brain. In normal full-term neonates, serum GGT activity is six to seven times the upper limit of the adult reference range; levels then decline and reach low levels by five to seven months of age [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. A gradual increase occurs in girls until age 10 and in boys through adolescence [

         5'-nucleotidase is found in the liver, intestine, brain, heart, blood vessels, and endocrine pancreas, but it is only released into serum by hepatobiliary tissue. Although its physiologic function is unknown, 5'-nucleotidase specifically catalyzes hydrolysis of nucleotides such as adenosine 5'-phosphate and inosine 5'-phosphate, in which the phosphate is attached to the 5 position of the pentose moiety.

         LDH is a cytoplasmic enzyme present in tissues throughout the body  (

          table 1
         </a>
         ). Five isoenzyme forms of LDH are present in serum and can be separated by various electrophoretic techniques. The slowest migrating band predominates in the liver [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13
         </a>
         ]. This test is not as sensitive as the serum aminotransferases in liver disease and has poor diagnostic specificity, even when isoenzyme analysis is used. It is more useful as a marker of hemolysis. It can be used in practice to distinguish ischemic hepatitis from viral hepatitis and was used in the past as a marker of myocardial infarction [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12

         The initial evaluation of a patient with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests includes obtaining a history to identify potential risk factors for liver disease and performing a physical examination to look for clues to the etiology and for signs of chronic liver disease.

         A thorough medical history is central to the evaluation of a patient with abnormal liver tests. The history should determine if the patient has had exposure to any potential hepatotoxins (including alcohol and medications), is at risk for viral hepatitis, has other disorders that are associated with liver disease, or has symptoms that may be related to the liver disease or a possible predisposing condition.

         Alcohol consumption is a common cause of liver disease, although obtaining an accurate history can be difficult. Several definitions have been proposed for what constitutes significant alcohol consumption [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. We define significant alcohol consumption as an average consumption of &gt;210 grams of alcohol per week in men or &gt;140 grams of alcohol per week in women over at least a two-year period, a definition that is consistent with a 2012 joint guideline from the American Gastroenterological Association, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, and the American College of Gastroenterology [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17

         ]. A standard drink (360 mL [12 oz] of beer, 150 mL [5 oz] of wine, or 45 mL [1.5 oz] of 80-proof spirits) contains approximately 14 grams of alcohol. (See

         Questioning about drug use should seek to identify all drugs used, the amounts ingested, and the durations of use. Drug use is not limited to prescription medications, but also includes over-the-counter medications, herbal and dietary supplements, and illicit drug use. Features that suggest drug toxicity include lack of illness prior to ingesting the drug, clinical illness or biochemical abnormalities developing after beginning the drug, and improvement after the drug is withdrawn. If an immunologic reaction is suspected, the illness will generally recur upon reintroduction of the offending substance. However, rechallenge is not advised. (See

         Risk factors for viral hepatitis include potential parenteral exposures (eg, intravenous drug use, blood transfusion prior to 1992), travel to areas endemic for hepatitis, and exposure to patients with jaundice. Hepatitis B and C are transmitted parenterally, whereas hepatitis A and E are transmitted from person to person via a fecal-oral route (often via contaminated food). Hepatitis E is uncommon in the United States, but it should be considered in patients who live in or have travelled to Asia, Africa, the Middle East, or Central America, and has been seen increasingly in Europe as a result of consumption of contaminated swine and game meat.

         The abdominal examination should focus on the size and consistency of the liver, the size of the spleen (a palpable spleen is two to threefold enlarged), and an assessment for ascites (usually by determining whether there is a fluid wave, shifting dullness, or bulging of the flanks). Patients with cirrhosis may have an enlarged left lobe of the liver (which can be felt below the xiphoid) and an enlarged spleen (which is most easily appreciated with the patient in the right lateral decubitus position).

Severe right upper quadrant tenderness with a positive Murphy's sign (respiratory arrest on inspiration while pressing on the right upper quadrant) suggests cholecystitis or, occasionally, ascending cholangitis.

         The pattern of liver test abnormalities may suggest that the underlying cause of the patient's liver disease is primarily the result of hepatocyte injury (elevated aminotransferases) or cholestasis (elevated alkaline phosphatase). In addition, the magnitude of the liver test abnormalities and the ratio of the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) may make certain diagnoses more or less likely. ALT is a more specific marker of hepatic injury as compared with AST.

         Liver test abnormalities can often be grouped into one of several patterns: the abnormalities may be acute, subacute, or chronic based on whether they have been present for less than six weeks (acute), six weeks to six months (subacute), or more than six months (chronic). Based on the pattern of elevation, liver test abnormalities may be grouped as hepatocellular, cholestatic, or isolated hyperbilirubinemia.

         Because the serum bilirubin can be prominently elevated in both hepatocellular and cholestatic conditions, it is not helpful in differentiating between the two. Common hepatocellular diseases associated with an elevated bilirubin and jaundice include viral and toxic hepatitis (including drugs, herbal therapies, and alcohol) and end-stage cirrhosis from any cause  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77337" href="/z/d/graphic/77337.html" rel="external">
          table 2

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         If both the serum aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase are elevated, the liver test abnormalities are characterized by the predominant abnormality (eg, if the serum aminotransferases are 10 times the upper limit of normal and the alkaline phosphatase is twice the upper limit of normal, the liver test abnormalities would be characterized as primarily hepatocellular). However, making this distinction is not always possible. The degree of aminotransferase elevation can occasionally help in differentiating between hepatocellular and cholestatic processes. While ALT and AST values less than eight times the upper limit of normal may be seen in either hepatocellular or cholestatic liver disease, values 25 times the upper limit of normal or higher are seen primarily in hepatocellular diseases.
        </p>
        <p>
         Abnormal tests of synthetic function may be seen with both hepatocellular injury and cholestasis. A low albumin suggests a chronic process, such as cirrhosis or cancer, while a normal albumin suggests a more acute process, such as viral hepatitis or choledocholithiasis. A prolonged prothrombin time indicates either vitamin K deficiency due to prolonged jaundice and intestinal malabsorption of vitamin K or significant hepatocellular dysfunction. The failure of the prothrombin time to correct with parenteral administration of vitamin K suggests severe hepatocellular injury. (See

         Most causes of hepatocellular injury are associated with a serum AST level that is lower than the ALT. An AST to ALT ratio of 2:1 or greater is suggestive of alcoholic liver disease, particularly in the setting of an elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. In a study of 271 patients with biopsy-confirmed liver disease, more than 90 percent of the patients in whom the AST to ALT ratio was two or greater had alcoholic liver disease [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. The percentage increased to greater than 96 percent when the ratio was greater than three. In addition, 70 percent of the patients with known alcoholic liver disease had an AST to ALT ratio greater than two. (See

        <p>
         However, the AST to ALT ratio is occasionally elevated in an alcoholic liver disease pattern in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and it is frequently elevated (although not greater than two) in patients with hepatitis C who have developed cirrhosis. In addition, patients with Wilson disease or cirrhosis due to viral hepatitis may have an AST that is greater than the ALT, although in patients with cirrhosis the ratio typically is not greater than two.

         In the setting of hepatocyte damage, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are released from hepatocytes, leading to increased serum levels. The differential diagnosis for elevated serum aminotransferases is broad and includes viral hepatitis, hepatotoxicity from drugs or toxins, alcoholic liver disease, ischemic hepatitis, and malignant infiltration. The evaluation should take into account the patient's risk factors for liver disease as well as findings from the physical examination that may point to a particular diagnosis. (See

         Patients with marked or severe elevations in their aminotransferase levels (approximately 15 times the upper limit of normal or higher) often have acute hepatitis, although in some cases, there may be underlying chronic liver disease (eg, Wilson disease or an acute exacerbation of hepatitis B virus). Massive elevations in aminotransferases (&gt;5,000 U/L) are usually due to ischemic or drug-induced hepatitis. Other causes of massive elevations in AST include rhabdomyolysis and heat stroke.

         Hemochromatosis: Serum iron and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) with calculation of transferrin saturation (serum iron/TIBC). A transferrin saturation greater than 45 percent warrants obtaining a serum ferritin. Ferritin is less useful as an initial test because it is an acute phase reactant and therefore less specific than the transferrin saturation. A serum ferritin concentration of greater than 400 ng/mL (900 pmol/L) in men and 300 ng/mL (675 pmol/L) in women further supports (but does not confirm) the diagnosis of hemochromatosis. (See

         Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: The initial evaluation to identify the presence of fatty infiltration of the liver is radiologic imaging, usually ultrasonography, or possibly computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ultrasonography has a lower sensitivity than CT or MRI but is less expensive. (See

         A liver biopsy is often considered in patients in whom all of the above testing has been unrevealing [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. However, in some settings, the best course may be expectant observation.
        </p>
        <p>
         We suggest expectant observation in patients in whom the ALT and AST levels are less than five times the upper limit of normal and no chronic liver condition has been identified by the above noninvasive testing [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. We use a conservative estimate for the upper limit of normal for aminotransferases (approximately 33 units/L for men and 25 units/L for women). In such patients, we will follow their liver biochemical and function tests every six months. This approach was supported by a preliminary study in which expectant clinical follow-up was found to be the most cost-effective strategy for managing asymptomatic patients with negative viral, metabolic, and autoimmune markers and chronically elevated aminotransferases [
         <a href="#rid35">
          35
         </a>
         ]. A second small study also found that biopsy results rarely affected the management of such patients [
         <a href="#rid36">
          36
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         We suggest a liver biopsy in patients in whom the ALT and AST are persistently greater than twice the upper limit of normal, particularly if noninvasive testing suggests that advanced liver fibrosis is unlikely [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. Occasionally, the biopsy will provide an unsuspected diagnosis or lead to a change in management [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. In most cases, however, the biopsy proves reassuring to the patient and clinician by confirming that there is no evidence of serious or advanced liver disease. (See

         Cholestasis may develop in the setting of extrahepatic or intrahepatic biliary obstruction  (

         ). In patients with cholestasis, the alkaline phosphatase is typically elevated to at least four times the upper limit of normal. The magnitude of the serum alkaline phosphatase elevation does not distinguish extrahepatic cholestasis from intrahepatic cholestasis. Lesser degrees of elevation are nonspecific and may be seen in many other types of liver disease, such as viral hepatitis, infiltrative diseases of the liver, and congestive hepatopathy. The gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) may also be elevated in the setting of cholestasis. However, elevated levels of serum GGT have been reported in a wide variety of other conditions. Patients with a predominantly cholestatic pattern typically undergo a right upper quadrant ultrasound to further characterize the cholestasis as intrahepatic or extrahepatic; the latter is suggested by biliary tract dilatation.

         </span>
         If a patient has an isolated elevation of the alkaline phosphatase, the first step in the evaluation is to confirm it is of hepatic origin, since alkaline phosphatase can come from other sources, such as bone and placenta  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78223" data-inline-graphics="78223" href="/z/d/graphic/78223.html" rel="external">

         ). If, however, there are abnormalities in other liver chemistries or markers of hepatic function, particularly an elevated bilirubin, confirmation is typically not required.
        </p>
        <p>
         To confirm that an isolated elevation in the alkaline phosphatase is coming from the liver, a GGT level or serum 5'-nucleotidase level should be obtained. These tests are usually elevated in parallel with the alkaline phosphatase in liver disorders but are not increased in bone disorders. An elevated serum alkaline phosphatase with a normal GGT or 5'-nucleotidase should prompt an evaluation for bone diseases.
        </p>
        <p>
         An elevated bone alkaline phosphatase is indicative of high bone turnover, which may be caused by several disorders including healing fractures, osteomalacia, hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, Paget disease of bone, osteogenic sarcoma, and bone metastases. We generally refer such patients to an endocrinologist for evaluation. Initial testing may include measurement of serum calcium, parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, and imaging with bone scintigraphy. (See

         Acute or chronic elevation of the alkaline phosphatase in conjunction with other liver biochemical abnormalities may be due to extrahepatic causes (eg, bile duct stones, primary sclerosing cholangitis, malignant biliary obstruction) or intrahepatic causes (eg, PBC, primary sclerosing cholangitis, infiltrative disease).

         Rarely, an elevated alkaline phosphatase level is seen because of the presence of macro-alkaline phosphatase. Macro-alkaline phosphatase is due to the formation of complexes of alkaline phosphatase with immunoglobulins, which have reduced renal clearance compared with unbound alkaline phosphatase [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37

         The presence of biliary dilatation on ultrasonography suggests extrahepatic cholestasis, whereas the absence of biliary dilatation suggests intrahepatic cholestasis. However, ultrasonography may fail to show ductal dilatation in the setting of extrahepatic cholestasis in patients with partial obstruction of the bile duct or in patients with cirrhosis or primary sclerosing cholangitis, in which scarring prevents the intrahepatic ducts from dilating.

         If ultrasonography suggests obstruction due to a stone or malignancy, or if the onset of the cholestasis was acute, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) should be carried out to confirm the diagnosis and facilitate biliary drainage. If the cholestasis is chronic or ultrasonography shows biliary dilatation without an apparent cause or in patients who are at high risk for ERCP, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or computed tomography (CT) should be obtained. In some cases, endoscopic ultrasonography may help identify an obstruction. ERCP can then be performed if there is evidence of an obstructing stone, stricture, or malignancy. If the results of ERCP or MRCP are negative for biliary tract disease, liver biopsy should be considered. (See

         The initial step in evaluating a patient with an isolated elevated hyperbilirubinemia is to fractionate the bilirubin to determine whether the hyperbilirubinemia is predominantly conjugated (direct hyperbilirubinemia) or unconjugated (indirect hyperbilirubinemia). An increase in unconjugated bilirubin in serum results from overproduction, impairment of uptake, or impaired conjugation of bilirubin. An increase in conjugated bilirubin is due to decreased excretion into the bile ductules or leakage of the pigment from hepatocytes into serum. (See

These can be divided into disorders associated with bilirubin overproduction (such as hemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis) and disorders related to impaired hepatic uptake or conjugation of bilirubin (such as Gilbert disease, Crigler-Najjar syndrome, and the effects of certain drugs). The evaluation typically involves evaluation for hemolytic anemia as well as obtaining a history to determine if the patient has Gilbert syndrome. In a patient with a history consistent with Gilbert syndrome (eg, the development of jaundice during times of stress or fasting), normal serum aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels and mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (&lt;4 mg/dL), additional testing is not required [

         Hemolysis can usually be detected by examining the peripheral blood smear or obtaining a reticulocyte count and serum haptoglobin. Hemolytic disorders that cause excessive heme production may be either inherited or acquired. Inherited disorders include spherocytosis, sickle cell disease, and deficiency of a red cell enzyme, such as pyruvate kinase or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. In these conditions, the serum bilirubin rarely exceeds 5 mg/dL (86 micromol/L). Higher levels may occur when there is coexistent renal or hepatocellular dysfunction or acute hemolysis. (See

The serum levels may fluctuate, and jaundice is often identified only during periods of illness or fasting. In an otherwise healthy adult with mildly elevated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and no evidence of hemolysis, the presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert syndrome can be made without further testing.

         An isolated elevation in conjugated bilirubin is found in two rare inherited conditions: Dubin-Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome. Dubin-Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome should be suspected in patients with mild hyperbilirubinemia (with a direct-reacting fraction of approximately 50 percent) in the absence of other abnormalities of standard liver biochemical tests. Normal levels of serum alkaline phosphatase and GGT help to distinguish these conditions from disorders associated with biliary obstruction. Differentiating between these syndromes is possible but clinically unnecessary due to their benign nature. In children, other inherited disorders caused by mutations in one of a variety of bile salt transporters may need to be considered [

         Patients with both conditions present with asymptomatic jaundice, typically in the second decade of life. The defect in Dubin-Johnson syndrome is altered hepatocyte excretion of bilirubin into the bile ducts, while Rotor syndrome is due to defective hepatic reuptake of bilirubin by hepatocytes [

         Abnormalities in tests of liver synthetic function, such as the prothrombin time and serum albumin level, are often seen in patients with chronic liver disease in conjunction with other liver test abnormalities. These patients should be evaluated according to the predominant pattern of liver test abnormalities. (See

         However, isolated abnormalities in the prothrombin time or albumin are typically due to causes other than liver disease. The evaluation of these abnormalities is discussed elsewhere. (See

         Referral to a gastroenterologist or hepatologist should be considered for patients with unexplained, persistent liver biochemical test elevations (≥2 times the upper limit of normal for aminotransferases or 1.5 times the upper limit of normal for alkaline phosphatase) and for patients who are being considered for liver biopsy. We use a conservative estimate for the upper limit of normal for aminotransferases (approximately 30 units/L for men and 20 units/L for women) since the higher limits reported by many laboratories likely underestimate the degree of aminotransferase elevation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Aminotransferases'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         If the liver tests normalize or remain mildly elevated (&lt;2 times the upper limit of normal for aminotransferases or less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal for alkaline phosphatase), expectant management is reasonable in most cases. In such patients, we would follow their liver biochemical and function tests every six months. It is reasonable to refer such patients to a gastroenterologist or hepatologist if the liver biochemical tests remain elevated without a clear explanation, if they subsequently increase, or if otherwise warranted by the specific features of the case.

          Patterns of liver test abnormalities
         </strong>
         – Liver biochemical test abnormalities can often be grouped into one of several patterns: hepatocellular, cholestatic, or isolated hyperbilirubinemia. Patients with a hepatocellular process generally have a disproportionate elevation in the serum aminotransferases compared with the alkaline phosphatase, while those with a cholestatic process have the opposite findings. The serum bilirubin can be prominently elevated in both hepatocellular and cholestatic conditions and therefore is not necessarily helpful in differentiating between the two. Abnormal tests of synthetic function may be seen with both hepatocellular injury and cholestasis. (See

         <strong>
          Patients with elevated serum aminotransferases
         </strong>
         – In the setting of hepatocyte damage, ALT and AST are released from hepatocytes, leading to increased serum levels. The differential diagnosis for elevated serum aminotransferases is broad and includes viral hepatitis, hepatotoxicity from drugs or toxins, alcoholic liver disease, hepatic ischemia, and malignant infiltration. The evaluation should take into account the patient's risk factors for liver disease as well as findings from the physical examination that may point to a particular diagnosis. The evaluation often involves testing for viral hepatitis and autoimmune disease  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef68475" href="/z/d/graphic/68475.html" rel="external">
          table 4

         ). Occasionally, a liver biopsy may be required. (See

         <strong>
          Patients with cholestasis
         </strong>
         – Cholestasis may develop in the setting of extrahepatic or intrahepatic biliary obstruction  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef99099" href="/z/d/graphic/99099.html" rel="external">
          table 5
         </a>
         ). In patients with cholestasis, the alkaline phosphatase is typically elevated to at least four times the upper limit of normal. Lesser degrees of elevation are nonspecific and may be seen in many other types of liver disease, such as viral hepatitis, infiltrative diseases of the liver, and congestive hepatopathy. Patients with a predominantly cholestatic pattern typically undergo right upper quadrant ultrasonography to further characterize the cholestasis as intrahepatic or extrahepatic. (See

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The presence of biliary dilatation on ultrasonography suggests extrahepatic cholestasis which may be due to gallstones, strictures, or malignancy. The absence of biliary dilatation suggests intrahepatic cholestasis. There are numerous possible causes of intrahepatic cholestasis  (

          Patients with isolated hyperbilirubinemia
         </strong>
         – The evaluation of isolated hyperbilirubinemia begins with determining whether the hyperbilirubinemia is predominantly conjugated (direct hyperbilirubinemia) or unconjugated (indirect hyperbilirubinemia). An increase in unconjugated bilirubin in serum results from overproduction, impairment of uptake, or impaired conjugation of bilirubin. The evaluation of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia typically involves evaluation for hemolytic anemia as well as obtaining a history to determine if the patient has Gilbert syndrome. In a patient with a history consistent with Gilbert syndrome (eg, the development of jaundice during times of stress or fasting), normal serum aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels, and mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (&lt;4 mg/dL), additional testing is not required. (See
         <a class="local">
