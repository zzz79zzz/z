AVR offers substantial improvements in symptoms and life expectancy. Medical therapy may not prolong life in patients with AS and has limited utility in treating symptoms.</p><p>In patients who are awaiting AVR, medical therapy to optimize hemodynamics in the preoperative setting may be needed. When severe symptoms are present, it may be prudent to admit the patient to the hospital and perform AVR urgently, as there is a high risk of cardiac death once severe symptoms are present.</p><p>Longer-term palliative medical management of symptomatic AS is appropriate for patients who are not candidates for aortic valve intervention due to coexisting medical conditions and in patients who decline aortic valve intervention. TAVI enables AVR in many patients with prohibitive or high operative risk for surgical AVR. However, TAVI may not be feasible in some patients due to anatomic factors or may not be appropriate in patients with a limited life expectancy due to other comorbidities or extreme frailty.</p><p>This topic will discuss medical management of patients with symptomatic AS and possible indications for aortic valvotomy. Indications for AVR, surgical and transcatheter methods of AVR, and management of asymptomatic AS are discussed separately.

However, patients with symptomatic AS in the following settings may require temporary or indefinite medical management.

Some of these patients may be candidates for TAVI, but others may not be able to undergo TAVI due to anatomic reasons (annulus size, vascular access, etc) or the potential benefit of TAVI may be low due to a high level of comorbidities or frailty.

Patients seen at centers without cardiac surgery or a TAVI program should be promptly referred to a heart valve center of excellence that performs AVR. Of concern are reports that substantial numbers of patients with symptomatic AS with reasonable estimated operative risks are not referred for aortic valve surgery [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. Patients may also experience disparities in access to TAVI and surgical AVR depending on race and socioeconomic status. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8154.html" rel="external">"Indications for valve replacement for high gradient aortic stenosis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8153.html" rel="external">"Estimating the risk of valvular procedures"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Patients awaiting valve replacement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In general, medical intervention prior to AVR should be minimized in patients with symptomatic AS. Most medical interventions that alter hemodynamic conditions carry the risk of destabilizing the patient. Patients with the onset of mild symptoms may be scheduled electively for valve replacement. However, those who develop heart failure, angina, or syncope attributed to AS should undergo expedited evaluation for valve replacement and may require hospitalization. The management of critically ill patients is discussed below.

When valve replacement is not possible or is refused by the patient, medical therapy may not prolong life and has potential harm. The goals of medical therapy are to treat concurrent cardiovascular conditions, prevent or treat superimposed diseases that often exacerbate the effects of valve obstruction, maintain optimal hemodynamic conditions, and treat symptoms. In addition, the physician should provide both the patient and family or caregiver counseling about the expected disease course, treatment options, and end-of-life preferences.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>No endocarditis prophylaxis is indicated for patients with AS without prior history of infective endocarditis.

Concomitant hypertension and AS present a "double load" to the left ventricle (LV), which may adversely affect the ventricle. [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The combination of hypertension and AS may lead to development of symptoms as an earlier stage of AS [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. However, no specific treatment regimen for patients with AS with hypertension has been established.</p><p>Various medical therapies pose a risk of destabilizing the patient with AS:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diuretics reduce preload, on which the patient may depend for maintenance of cardiac output.

These agents should be avoided or used with caution. (See <a class="local">'Critically ill patients awaiting valve replacement'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) tend to be well tolerated in patients with moderate and asymptomatic severe AS, although there are few data on management of hypertension in symptomatic patients with severe AS.</p><p>Despite these concerns, hypertension should be treated according to standard recommended therapy, with antihypertensive agents started at a low dose and gradually titrated upward as needed with appropriate clinical monitoring [<a href="#rid6">6-9</a>]. Treatment with an ACE inhibitor or ARB is often preferred given possible beneficial effects on the ventricle as well as antihypertensive effects [<a href="#rid6">6,10</a>]. Since experience in AS patients is limited, calcium channel blockers should be used with caution [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3512464176"><span class="h4">Management of heart failure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For management of patients who have had symptoms of heart failure, we suggest a combination of a diuretic and an ACE inhibitor or ARB. These should be started at low doses with gradual titration.</p><p>Treatment is improved if patients are educated and involved in following daily weights and signs of decompensation. In addition, patients should be educated about the effects of sodium intake, changes in elevation with travel, and other factors that may lead to clinical decompensation. Frequent physician or nurse visits are needed for patient monitoring.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Prevention and treatment of concurrent conditions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many adults with severe symptomatic AS have relatively stable symptoms with decompensation triggered by an intercurrent illness such as influenza, anemia, pulmonary embolism, etc. Optimal preventative care can prevent recurrent hospitalizations. These measures include pneumococcal vaccination, annual influenza vaccination, routine preventative care examinations, and treatment of any noncardiac conditions.</p><p>When clinical decompensation occurs, in addition to treating the disease process, patients may be effectively managed by supportive care during the acute illness. Medical therapy focuses on decreasing cardiac workload by reducing fever, controlling heart rate and blood pressure, correction of anemia, and administration of oxygen. Volume status should be carefully monitored with cautious replacement of fluid or gentle diuresis, as needed. With severe AS, patients are very sensitive to small changes in preload. An increase in LV volume in a non-compliant hypertrophied LV results in a rise in diastolic pressure and symptoms of pulmonary congestion. Conversely, when filling volumes are too low, the small LV does not fill adequately with a fall in forward stroke volume and signs of low output failure.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22998847"><span class="h2">Medical management in patients awaiting aortic valve replacement</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In general, medical intervention prior to AVR should be minimized in patients with severe or symptomatic AS.

This is especially true in patients with LV dysfunction, who may present with heart failure, and those with coronary disease, who may present with unstable angina. For some of these patients, palliative care may be appropriate, depending on age, comorbidities, technical factors, patient values, and other factors. Others may benefit from urgent valve replacement. It may be desirable to stabilize such patients prior to transcatheter or surgical valve replacement, but these are precisely the patients at highest risk of further decompensation with medical intervention. The limited data available are equivocal whether outcomes are improved with medical therapy or balloon aortic dilation prior to intervention, compared to proceeding directly to TAVI. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8141.html" rel="external">"Percutaneous balloon aortic valvotomy for native aortic stenosis in adults"</a>.)</p><p>The decision to proceed with TAVI versus consideration of balloon dilation is best made by a Heart Valve Team. TAVI may be appropriate in selected patients, but balloon dilation may be considered for short-term improvement in hemodynamics and clinical symptoms [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p>Although data are limited, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9707" href="/z/d/drug information/9707.html" rel="external">nitroprusside</a> may be useful in improving ventricular performance prior to surgery and thus reduce surgical risk. The use of nitroprusside was evaluated in a study of 25 patients with severe AS and depressed LV function who were not hypotensive; nitroprusside was administered during continuous hemodynamic monitoring with a pulmonary artery catheter [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. During nitroprusside treatment, there were significant increases in cardiac index (1.60 to 2.52 L/min per m<sup>2</sup>) and stroke volume (from 32 to 54 mL) and significant reduction in mean arterial pressure (81 to 69 mmHg) and systemic vascular resistance. Five patients died in the hospital and 13 underwent successful AVR.</p><p>Although no complications occurred, the use of vasodilator therapy in such patients is associated with a risk of hypotension and hemodynamic collapse, and it is unclear from this uncontrolled study whether the surgical outcomes were improved [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. This approach should be undertaken only with careful hemodynamic monitoring by experienced clinicians.</p><p>A potential alternative approach is use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9380" href="/z/d/drug information/9380.html" rel="external">dobutamine</a> in such patients, although use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9707" href="/z/d/drug information/9707.html" rel="external">nitroprusside</a> or dobutamine in critically ill patients with AS requires intensive monitoring.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h1">POSSIBLE INDICATIONS FOR AORTIC BALLOON DILATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Percutaneous aortic balloon dilation (previously termed percutaneous aortic balloon valvotomy) is a procedure in which one or more balloons are placed across the stenotic aortic valve and inflated [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. The aim is to relieve the stenosis, presumably by fracturing calcific deposits within the valve leaflets. Stretching of the annulus and separation of the calcified commissures also may contribute. Early changes after successful balloon dilation include a moderate reduction in the transvalvular pressure gradient and an often dramatic improvement in symptoms; however, the post-procedure valve area rarely exceeds 1.0 cm<sup>2</sup> [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>].</p><p>Serious complications (stroke, aortic regurgitation, myocardial infarction) occur in approximately 10 to 20 percent of patients [<a href="#rid15">15-17</a>]. Furthermore, restenosis and clinical deterioration occur in most cases within 6 to 12 months and the long-term outcome resembles the natural history of untreated AS [<a href="#rid16">16,18</a>]. Repeat balloon dilation can be performed, but most patients fail within six months [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p>Based upon these observations, the 2020 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines suggest that balloon aortic dilation may be considered as a bridge to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) or surgical AVR in patients with severe symptomatic AS, although moving directly to transcatheter AVR also is an option [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. However, balloon dilation is <strong>not</strong> a substitute for valve replacement in adults, although selected young adults without valve calcification represent an exception. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5776.html" rel="external">"Subvalvar aortic stenosis (subaortic stenosis)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/129707.html" rel="external">"Bicuspid aortic valve: Intervention for valve disease or aortopathy in adults", section on 'Balloon valvotomy'</a>.)</p><p>Although the evidence is not well established, the guidelines noted two specific settings in adults in which balloon dilation might be reasonable [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>As a bridge to transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) in hemodynamically unstable patients at high risk for morbidity and mortality with AVR. However, mortality remains high in these patients [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].

Although there are case reports suggesting success with this approach, balloon dilation can induce aortic regurgitation even with an experienced operator. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1425.html" rel="external">"Bicuspid aortic valve: Management during pregnancy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients who require urgent noncardiac surgery. However, the ACC/AHA guidelines concluded that most asymptomatic patients with severe AS can undergo urgent noncardiac surgery at relatively low risk with careful intraoperative and postoperative management, including monitoring of anesthesia and careful attention to fluid balance [<a href="#rid20">20,24,25</a>]. If preoperative correction of AS is warranted, this should be addressed by surgical AVR or TAVI, not balloon dilation [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8124.html" rel="external">"Noncardiac surgery in adults with aortic stenosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H348696781"><span class="h1">ROLE OF PALLIATIVE CARE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Given the life-limiting nature of severe AS, as well as the high symptom burden associated with severe AS, palliative care consultation is valuable in this population, particularly if the AS is associated with other significant morbidities and/or if the patient is not a candidate for surgical or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).</p><p>Palliative care focuses on quality of life in people with life-limiting conditions, is provided alongside rather than instead of active medical therapy, and is ideally not delayed until end stages of illness. It can and does include end-of-life planning and care, but is meant to be initiated earlier in the course of illness. Palliative care is partly founded on the principles of shared decision making, and its practitioners are highly skilled at ascertaining patients’ views and preferences and helping the patients and family or caregiver understand how various medical options will or will not facilitate the patient in reaching their goals of care. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14240.html" rel="external">"Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care"</a>.)</p><p>The principles of palliative care and decision making in advanced heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases also apply to patients with severe AS who have concomitant heart failure, who are older adults and frail, or who have other chronic conditions that may limit their prognosis with or without surgical or percutaneous valve replacement [<a href="#rid26">26-31</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3511.html" rel="external">"Palliative care for patients with advanced heart failure: Indications and systems of care"</a>.)</p><p>In particular, older adults with functional limitations or comorbidities for whom TAVI is being considered could benefit from consultation with palliative care providers with advanced communication skills to promote shared decision making [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. These providers can facilitate ascertainment of patients’ goals and preferences, assess patient knowledge and understanding of their disease, and discuss prognosis and foreseeable outcomes with medical options. In many of these patients, TAVI will either not be advisable, or the patients themselves will decide against it as being unlikely to help them achieve their goals. For example, if the patient’s goals are to improve cognitive function, mobility, and independence, TAVI may not help significantly with these goals.</p><p>Even with optimal care, adults with severe symptomatic inoperable AS will have exacerbations of symptoms and frequent hospitalizations. Symptoms of dyspnea and chest pain are treated as described above, within the end-of-life care parameters set by the patient. Dizziness and presyncope typically are exertional and can be avoided by decreasing physical activity and instructing the patient to stop and sit (or lie) down when symptoms occur. Palliative care includes symptomatic treatment for symptoms of dyspnea and angina. In addition, end-of-life discussions and counseling are appropriate.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

However, medical management may be required in patients who are not candidates for surgery (either due to comorbid conditions or patient preference to decline valve replacement). (See <a class="local">'Settings'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Management of critically ill patients with severe AS</strong> – In critically ill patients with severe AS, attempts to medically stabilize the patient should be undertaken with caution. These patients generally require prompt aortic valve intervention (either surgical valve replacement or transcatheter aortic valve implantation [TAVI]). In selected patients with AS, aortic balloon dilation is an option for short term improvement in hemodynamics but has largely been replaced by TAVI. (See <a class="local">'Critically ill patients awaiting valve replacement'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Palliative care</strong> – Palliative care for severe symptomatic inoperable AS includes the following (see <a class="local">'Medical management'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Prevention and treatment of concurrent cardiovascular conditions such as atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Management of adverse hemodynamic loading conditions and symptoms. Careful treatment of hypertension is appropriate. For patients with heart failure, we suggest a combination of a diuretic and an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). These should be started at low doses with gradual titration.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>End-of-life discussions and counseling.
