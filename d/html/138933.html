The recognition of shock in children in resource-limited settings is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/143443.html" rel="external">"Shock in children in resource-limited settings: Recognition"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1477804403"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2639368494"><span class="h2">Shock versus circulatory impairment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Shock is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the circulatory system fails to provide adequate oxygenation and perfusion to the body and, as a result, vital organs become hypoxic [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. For resource-limited settings, The World Health Organization Emergency Triage, Assessment and Treatment Guidelines (WHO ETAT) have established a common definition for circulatory impairment and shock for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) that uses the following physical findings [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cold extremities</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prolonged capillary refill &gt;3 seconds</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Weak/fast pulse </p><p></p><p>One or two of these findings is consistent with <strong>circulatory impairment</strong>; all three findings are needed to diagnose <strong>shock</strong>. This phased definition acknowledges that the physiology of shock exists on a spectrum and is similar in principle to the definitions of <strong>compensated</strong> versus <strong>hypotensive</strong> shock used by the Pediatric Advanced Life Support Course [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1139992682"><span class="h2">Resource-limited settings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For the purposes of this topic, resource-limited settings describe regions where access to advanced pediatric critical care and trained critical care personnel are variable or not available, and the therapies essential to successful treatment of shock cannot be reliably performed including:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Advanced airway management and respiratory support (eg, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy, bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and mechanical ventilation)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Central venous and arterial blood pressure monitoring</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Continuous infusions of inotropic medications</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2305037379"><span class="h2">Low- and low middle-income countries (LICs and LMICs)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The World Bank classifies countries for the purposes of economic and financial development services based upon national income per person or gross national income per capita as [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Low-income</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Low-middle income </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>High-middle income</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>High-income</p><p></p><p>From the standpoint of health care capability, resource-limited settings with no available intensive care are most common in low-income countries (LICs) and low-middle-income countries (LMICs). Resource-limited health care may also exist in certain parts of high-middle income countries (HMICs) and high-income countries (HICs) because of maldistribution of health care capability relative to population. Nevertheless, access to resource-abundant health care settings still remains much greater for individuals living in HMICs or HICs compared with LICs or LMICs. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H971178171"><span class="h1">APPROACH TO INITIAL STABILIZATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For children with shock in resource-limited settings, the priorities in care are the same as in resource-abundant settings.

In these facilities, fluid administration should be tailored to the specific cause of shock, the child's clinical features  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef143014" href="/d/graphic/143014.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef143095" href="/d/graphic/143095.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), and whether the child has severe anemia, severe malnutrition, or malaria. (See <a class="local">'Fluid resuscitation'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H819691762"><span class="h2">Institution-specific guidelines</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of pediatric shock at an institution-specific level can decrease variation in care patterns and minimize the harms of alternative care pathways. Given the variation in resources available as well as regional differences in the epidemiology of common comorbid conditions, establishing institutional clinical practice guidelines for the assessment and treatment of pediatric shock can improve the care of children with shock in resource-limited settings. (See <a class="local">'Guidelines'</a> below.)</p><p>Physicians from high-income countries providing health care in resource-limited settings in low- or low-middle income countries must become familiar with local guidelines for the treatment of shock. Awareness of available resources is also critical to a practitioner's approach to shock in resource-limited settings. Research has demonstrated the importance of developing guidelines and best practices for the care of children who are cared for in resource-limited settings from evidence obtained locally [<a href="#rid4">4-8</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1033771766"><span class="h2">Airway and breathing</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children with signs of shock should receive supplemental oxygen to maximize oxygen delivery and avoid hypoxemia  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60610" href="/d/graphic/60610.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). In clinical settings where patients cannot be intubated and mechanically ventilated, clinicians should provide supplemental oxygen when available to maintain an oxygen saturation of 94 to 98 percent.</p><p>For infants and children with respiratory distress, the clinician should perform suctioning and basic airway maneuvers to reestablish or maintain the airway as needed. Once the airway is open and maintained, patients with inadequate breathing require assisted ventilation using bag-mask ventilation. For patients with clinical suspicion of a highly contagious infectious disease, a HEPA filter should be used with bag-mask ventilation whenever available. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6383.html" rel="external">"Basic airway management in children"</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2698874757"><span class="h2">Circulation</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1053660243"><span class="h3">Establish venous access</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Peripheral venous access is adequate for initial resuscitation of children in shock and should be obtained rapidly. When resources allow, the clinician should place two peripheral intravenous (IV) lines. The most common type of peripheral venous access used in children is the over-the-needle cannula. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6385.html" rel="external">"Vascular (venous) access for pediatric resuscitation and other pediatric emergencies", section on 'Peripheral access'</a>.)</p><p>If peripheral venous access cannot be obtained in a timely fashion, then the clinician should place an intraosseous cannula.

After initial hypoglycemia is reversed, the clinician should continue to monitor blood glucose. Maintaining normoglycemia is desirable (eg, between 140 and 180 mg/dL [7.8 and 10 mmol/L]). Once normoglycemic, young children should receive continuous maintenance infusion of dextrose 5 to 10 percent in addition to resuscitation fluids as a reasonable option to prevent the occurrence of hypoglycemia [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1600.html" rel="external">"Glycemic control in critically ill adult and pediatric patients"</a>.)</p><p>Hypoglycemia may also be an indicator of adrenal insufficiency in predisposed children and those with refractory septic shock. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/85767.html" rel="external">"Septic shock in children in resource-abundant settings: Rapid recognition and initial resuscitation (first hour)", section on 'Patients at risk for adrenal insufficiency'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/85767.html" rel="external">"Septic shock in children in resource-abundant settings: Rapid recognition and initial resuscitation (first hour)", section on 'Patients with catecholamine-resistant shock'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3128413783"><span class="h2">Fluid resuscitation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In resource-limited settings, fluid resuscitation must be tailored to the type of shock identified by clinical findings and is often modified due to comorbidities such as malnutrition, severe anemia, and malaria.

For example, in the Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy (FEAST) study, a randomized trial of over 3,100 children (60 days to 12 years old) with severe sepsis who were treated in clinical centers located in Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania, children were randomly assigned to receive rapid fluid infusion ("boluses" of either normal <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12796" href="/d/drug information/12796.html" rel="external">saline</a> or 5 percent human albumen over one hour) versus no bolus; the vast majority of these children had severe sepsis [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].

However, the overall amount of blood delivered after eight hours was not significantly different among the groups. Of note, none of the patients in the FEAST trial had hypovolemic dehydration or trauma as the primary cause of their illness. In addition, patients with severe hypotension by the WHO definition  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef143014" href="/d/graphic/143014.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) all received 40 mL/kg of normal <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12796" href="/d/drug information/12796.html" rel="external">saline</a> or albumin. </p><p>On re-analysis of the FEAST data using all international definitions of pediatric shock, mortality was still increased in patients with severe sepsis who received bolus fluid therapy [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. The analysis also evaluated mortality among children who met the more stringent WHO definition of shock (all three clinical signs of circulatory impairment). However, only 65 children met these strict criteria, a sample size too small to provide conclusions regarding mortality due to fluid therapy in this group. Furthermore, some experienced clinicians in resource-limited settings may still give an initial, cautious fluid bolus of 10 mL/kg over 30-60 minutes to children with severe sepsis and closely monitor the clinical response. This approach applies if there is a clinical suspicion of moderate dehydration, and the child is unable to drink or drinks poorly. </p><p>Additional analysis of the FEAST cohort identified cardiovascular collapse as the primary contributor to excess deaths among children receiving fluid boluses rather than fluid overload [<a href="#rid13">13,16</a>].

However, resolution of shock and mortality were the same in both groups, and a definitive conclusion regarding the role of rapid fluid resuscitation in causing a greater need for mechanical ventilation was limited by the small sample size, lack of central randomization, and lack of blinding [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>]. Still, in light of evidence regarding potential harm from rapid fluid resuscitation in patients with severe febrile illness in resource-limited settings, we advise caution with both volume and rate of fluid administration whenever capacity for mechanical ventilation is limited, and life-threatening shock is<strong> not</strong> present.</p><p>There is no evidence that these findings can be generalized to resource-abundant settings where the baseline characteristics of the patients are significantly different and intensive monitoring, mechanical ventilation, and vasopressor support are routinely available.

Conversely, children who were febrile and assigned to lower volume transfusion had a lower 28-day mortality compared with those assigned to higher volume transfusion (2 versus 5 percent).
