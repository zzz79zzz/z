NLPHL has characteristic pathologic features, natural history, and management that distinguish it from all other categories of HL, which are collectively referred to as classic HL (cHL).</p><p>NLPHL is the label used by the World Health Organization 5<sup>th</sup> edition (WHO5) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], but it is called nodular lymphocyte-predominant B cell lymphoma (NLPBL) by the International Consensus Classification (ICC) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. </p><p>Treatment and prognosis of NLPHL are reviewed here.</p><p>Clinical presentation and diagnosis of NLPHL are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4730.html" rel="external">"Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging"</a>.)</p><p>Evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of cHL are discussed separately.

Diagnosis and staging of NLPHL are described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4730.html" rel="external">"Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging"</a>.)</p><p>Pretreatment evaluation of the patient with NLPHL is similar to that of a patient with classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and is described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4688.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of classic Hodgkin lymphoma in adults", section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Treatment stratification for NLPHL is based on disease stage and certain prognostic factors; for patients with NLPHL, we do <strong>not</strong> apply the International Prognostic Score, which is only used for cHL. (See <a class="local">'Treatment stratification'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">TREATMENT STRATIFICATION</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2402704052"><span class="h2">Overview of treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Selection of treatment must recognize the generally good prognosis of NLPHL at any stage of presentation, so management must seek to limit the risk for acute and long-term toxicity, whenever possible. (See <a class="local">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>In general, treatment of NLPHL has become less aggressive over time in order to reduce second cancers, cardiac toxicity, and other treatment-related complications while retaining effective and sustained responses. Management trends have focused on limiting radiation, adding anti-CD20 immunotherapy to chemotherapy, and judicious use of active surveillance (AS) as an alternative to immediate treatment.</p><p>Treatment of NLPHL should be stratified according to disease stage, based on the Lugano classification  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66651" href="/z/d/graphic/66651.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), and certain prognostic factors, as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Non-bulky early stage NLPHL – Patients with non-bulky (ie, &lt;10 cm) stage IA disease or non-bulky, contiguous stage IIA disease who have no significant disease-related symptoms and no mass lesions that threaten organ compromise (eg, compression of the airway or ureters). (See <a class="local">'Non-bulky early stage NLPHL'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bulky or non-contiguous early stage NLPHL – Other patients with stage I or stage II NLPHL (ie, ≥10 cm mass, non-contiguous disease, disease-related symptoms, or organ-threatening mass). (See <a class="local">'Bulky or non-contiguous early stage NLPHL'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Advanced NLPHL – Stage III or stage IV NLPHL. (See <a class="local">'Advanced NLPHL'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>No randomized trials for management of NLPHL have been performed. Outcomes data are derived from single-arm studies, subgroup analysis of Hodgkin lymphoma trials, and retrospective series. Our suggestions are consistent with management approaches of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), the International Radiation Oncology Group (ILROG), and other organizations [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Society guideline links'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Non-bulky early stage NLPHL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Non-bulky early stage disease is the largest prognostic category and accounts for more than half of patients with NLPHL [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. Criteria for this favorable category are described above. (See <a class="local">'Overview of treatment'</a> above.)</p><p>There is no consensus regarding optimal management in this setting. For patients with non-bulky early stage disease, we suggest involved-site radiation therapy (ISRT) or AS for selected patients, rather than chemoimmunotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy plus ISRT (combined modality therapy; CMT). ISRT can achieve long-term disease control with modest toxicity. Some patients will instead favor AS to avoid the cost, inconvenience, and potential acute and long-term toxicity of ISRT, but the patient should be committed to long-term follow-up and psychologically comfortable with deferring treatment. We consider the toxicity of chemoimmunotherapy or CMT to be excessive for non-bulky early stage NLPHL. </p><p>There are no randomized trials of management in this setting, and our suggestions for management are derived from results from retrospective studies that are described below. (See <a class="local">'Active surveillance'</a> below and <a class="local">'Radiation therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2628661717"><span class="h2">Bulky or non-contiguous early stage NLPHL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bulky or non-contiguous early stage NLPHL includes all patients with stage I or stage II disease who do not meet the criteria for non-bulky disease, as described above. This category accounts for approximately one-quarter of patients with NLPHL [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Overview of treatment'</a> above.)</p><p>For the rare patient with NLPHL who has B symptoms (ie, fever, drenching sweats, weight loss), we suggest a repeat biopsy to exclude the possibility of transformation or misclassification. (See <a class="local">'Importance of re-biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p>There is no consensus regarding optimal therapy, but for most patients we suggest either chemoimmunotherapy or ISRT (for patients whose distribution of disease is amenable) rather than CMT. We consider that either chemoimmunotherapy or ISRT offers a favorable balance of treatment-free remission with acceptable levels of toxicity; in contrast, we judge that the increased toxicity of CMT is not warranted in this setting. Single-agent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> or AS is acceptable for patients who cannot tolerate or do not want more aggressive treatments and for some patients with modest or no symptoms who place greater value on avoidance of toxicity than on the burden of their symptoms.</p><p>The choice of approach is guided by the features of the disease, comorbid illnesses, and patient preference. As an example, for a patient with hypertension, diabetes, and a single retroperitoneal mass that risks ureteral obstruction, we might favor ISRT to achieve a rapid response while avoiding potential cardiac events or infectious complications of chemoimmunotherapy. In contrast, for a patient with a non-contiguous, non-bulky stage IIB NLPHL with drenching sweats we might favor chemoimmunotherapy to control the systemic symptoms and avoid multiple sites for radiation. Single-agent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> or AS might be preferred for more frail patients or those with modest or no symptoms; however, for patients with NLPHL that involves the spleen, we generally avoid single-agent rituximab because of a possible association with transformation to a more aggressive histology. (See <a class="local">'Transformation'</a> below.)</p><p>No randomized trials have directly compared management approaches, but retrospective studies indicate comparable long-term survival with any of these approaches. Treatment and outcomes with chemoimmunotherapy, radiation therapy (RT), CMT, and AS are described in the sections below. (See <a class="local">'Chemoimmunotherapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Combined modality therapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Radiation therapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Rituximab'</a> below and <a class="local">'Active surveillance'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1202821901"><span class="h2">Advanced NLPHL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Advanced NLPHL comprises patients with stages III and IV disease (ie, involvement of both sides of the diaphragm, diffuse, or extranodal disease). Advanced disease accounts for less than one-quarter of patients with NLPHL [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>].</p><p>For patients with advanced NLPHL, there is a broad range of management options, and treatment should be guided by the severity of symptoms:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Symptomatic</strong> – For patients with a substantial burden of symptoms, we suggest treatment with chemoimmunotherapy rather than ISRT or CMT. For symptomatic patients with advanced NLPHL, we judge that chemoimmunotherapy provides the most favorable balance of toxicity and disease control and offers the possibility of sustained treatment-free remission. Most advanced disease (ie, above and below the diaphragm) is not amenable to ISRT alone and we consider that CMT is associated with excessive short-term and/or long-term toxicity without a demonstrated benefit. (See <a class="local">'Chemoimmunotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For symptomatic patients who do not want or cannot tolerate more aggressive treatments, either single-agent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> or rituximab plus ISRT to locally symptomatic disease is acceptable. (See <a class="local">'Rituximab'</a> below and <a class="local">'Radiation therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic</strong> – For patients with modest or no symptoms and no organ-threatening masses, we consider chemoimmunotherapy, single-agent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a>, or AS to be acceptable options; selection of the approach should be individualized to reflect patient preferences and concerns. CMT and RT alone do not offer a favorable balance of toxicity versus benefit for minimally symptomatic patients. Some experts avoid treatment with rituximab alone for patients with splenic involvement because of a possible association with transformation to more aggressive histology. (See <a class="local">'Chemoimmunotherapy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Rituximab'</a> below and <a class="local">'Active surveillance'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>No randomized studies have directly compared management approaches for advanced disease. Retrospective studies indicate that all of these approaches achieve comparable long-term survival, so the choice of approach is primarily informed by the nature and severity of symptoms, a need for a prompt response to treatment, comorbid illnesses, and short-term and long-term toxicity.</p><p>Treatment approaches and outcomes are described in the sections below.

AS is an acceptable option for patients who have no residual disease following the diagnostic biopsy and for selected asymptomatic patients who have clinically detectable disease. </p><p>AS is an acceptable approach for the patient who has modest or no symptoms from the lymphoma, no organ-threatening masses, is psychologically comfortable with deferring treatment, and is reliable and committed to long-term follow-up. AS offers the advantages of avoiding the cost, inconvenience, and potential acute and long-term toxicity of chemoimmunotherapy and/or radiation therapy (RT), but it may cause unacceptable anxiety due to awareness of the presence of a treatable malignancy. AS is particularly advantageous for children, because treatment may cause growth retardation, infertility, hypothyroidism, cardiopulmonary complications, or secondary malignancy [<a href="#rid9">9-12</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6246.html" rel="external">"Overview of Hodgkin lymphoma in children and adolescents", section on 'Late complications'</a>.)</p><p>There is no need for routine imaging of the patient undergoing AS; other aspects of monitoring are described below. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>No randomized studies have directly compared AS with treatment for NLPHL, but retrospective studies indicate that AS is associated with comparable long-term survival with less toxicity. In general, one-quarter to one-half of patients on AS will have progressive disease or relapse, but there is no evidence that the disease is less responsive or that treatment at the time of relapse is associated with inferior outcomes. For progressive or relapsed disease during AS, we suggest a repeat biopsy to determine if it represents transformation to a more aggressive histology. (See <a class="local">'Relapsed/refractory disease'</a> below.)</p><p>Studies that included AS include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A single institution study of 163 consecutive patients ≥16 years old with newly diagnosed NLPHL reported that outcomes with AS (23 percent of patients) were equivalent to outcomes with RT alone (46 percent), systemic chemotherapy alone (16 percent), combined modality therapy (CMT; 12 percent), and single-agent <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> (4 percent) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Most patients in this series were male (63 percent), had stage I or II disease (74 percent), and were asymptomatic (96 percent). Extranodal or mediastinal involvement was present in 7 and 14 percent, respectively. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">With median follow-up of 69 months (range, 4 to 512 months), overall survival (OS) for the entire study cohort was 99 percent, and only one patient died from progressive lymphoma [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Compared with patients who underwent treatment at the time of diagnosis, AS was associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS); five-year PFS for AS was 77 percent (95% CI 56-89 percent) versus 87 percent (95% CI 79-92 percent) for patients who received treatment. However, there was no disadvantage for AS with regard to OS, long-term disease control, or responsiveness to subsequent treatment. Among the 37 patients on AS (23 early stage, 14 advanced stage disease), only 27 percent developed progressive disease (eight with NLPHL and two with transformed disease), two developed secondary cancers, and none died. For patients who had treatment, 10 had disease transformation, 10 developed secondary cancers, and 7 died. It should be recognized that management was not randomly assigned and there may have been selection bias toward AS for patients who had a more favorable prognosis at the time of diagnosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a multicenter study of 164 adults with NLPHL, long-term survival did not differ between patients on AS and those who received initial treatment [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. With median follow-up of three years, 50 percent of patients with AS remained in complete remission (CR) without treatment. There was no difference with regard to 10-year OS (91 and 93 percent, respectively), but AS was associated with inferior 10-year PFS (41 versus 66 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A study of 52 patients ≤21 years old with stage IA NLPHL reported 77 percent five-year event-free survival among children who had no residual disease after lymph node resection; no patient died during the observation period [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Other studies in children have reported similar outcomes with AS after surgical resection [<a href="#rid9">9,11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H895245819"><span class="h2">Surgical resection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surgery has a role in management of NLPHL in selected settings. </p><p>Surgery alone is an acceptable option for younger patients with stage IA NLPHL whose disease was fully excised (ie, uninvolved margins) at the time of the diagnostic biopsy and for those who seek to avoid RT or other treatment. The choice of AS, RT, immunotherapy, or chemoimmunotherapy following complete resection of stage IA NLPHL must be individualized and should reflect concerns and wishes of the patient and/or family. Outcomes with AS following complete surgical resection are described above. (See <a class="local">'Active surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p>We generally suggest <strong>not</strong> performing additional surgery with the goal of achieving uninvolved margins in other settings (eg, incomplete resection, stage other than IA). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Radiation therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>RT alone is effective for early stage disease and for relief of symptoms in patients with advanced stage NLPHL. (See <a class="local">'Treatment stratification'</a> above.)</p><p>We suggest involved-site RT (ISRT) or involved-node RT with doses of 30 to 36 Gy, in order to limit toxicity of larger fields or higher doses [<a href="#rid6">6,15</a>]. Larger RT fields provide no advantage but are associated with a greater risk of short-term and/or long-term toxicity [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>]. Computed tomography (CT)-based simulation is used to determine target volumes and organs-at-risk. The clinical target volume definition should be generous, with inclusion of any sites that are suspicious of harboring microscopic disease. Intensity-modulated RT should be considered if target metrics of surrounding organs-at-risk cannot be met with 3-D conformal therapy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/89528.html" rel="external">"Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment", section on 'Intensity-modulated radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Outcomes with RT alone for early stage (I/II) NLPHL are excellent, with &gt;95 percent OS at five or more years. Short-term toxicity varies with RT site(s), volume, and dose, but may include mucositis, nausea/vomiting, radiation dermatitis, and cytopenias. Long-term effects may include organ fibrosis and second malignancies, but there is little concern about cardiac toxicity of RT with NLPHL because mediastinal involvement is uncommon. It is expected that the smaller radiation fields and lower doses of RT used with contemporary techniques will result in fewer second malignancies than in most published studies.</p><p>A retrospective study of 257 patients treated with RT alone (30.6 to 36 Gy using involved site-, involved field-, or extended field-RT) for early-stage NLPHL reported 91 percent five-year progression-free PFS and &gt;70 percent 10-year PFS; late toxicity included hypothyroidism in 3 percent, while &lt;1 percent developed either xerostomia or heart disease (after mediastinal RT) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Other, smaller studies using various doses and target volumes have reported similar outcomes and toxicity [<a href="#rid18">18,20-23</a>].</p><p>Retrospective studies that compared outcomes with RT alone versus either chemoimmunotherapy or CMT are described below.
