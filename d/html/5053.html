It is important to differentiate this normal physiologic transitional response from disorders that result in persistent or recurrent hypoglycemia, which may lead to neurologic sequelae.</p><p>This topic will discuss the normal transient neonatal low glucose levels, causes of persistent or pathologic neonatal hypoglycemia, and the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycemia. The management of neonatal hypoglycemia, including evaluation of persistent hypoglycemia and outcome of neonatal hypoglycemia, is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/101425.html" rel="external">"Management and outcome of neonatal hypoglycemia"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CHALLENGE OF DEFINING NEONATAL HYPOGLYCEMIA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Clinically significant neonatal hypoglycemia requiring intervention cannot be defined by a precise numerical blood glucose concentration because of the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Variability of neonatal blood glucose levels and response − Low blood glucose concentrations normally occur in the first hours after birth and may persist for up to several days [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Although most newborns remain asymptomatic despite very low blood glucose concentrations, some newborns become symptomatic at the same or even higher blood glucose concentrations than are observed in asymptomatic infants. This variability in the clinical response in neonates to low blood glucose concentrations is due to a number of factors that include the infant's gestational age and postnatal age, the presence of other sources of energy (eg, lactate and ketone bodies), and circumstances that affect glucose metabolism and cerebral glucose uptake and utilization.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lack of outcome data − Ideally, clinically significant neonatal hypoglycemia would be defined as the blood glucose concentration at which intervention should be initiated to avoid significant morbidity, especially neurologic sequelae. However, this definition remains elusive because the blood glucose concentration and duration of hypoglycemia associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcome has not been established [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">This was illustrated in a large prospective study of newborns (gestational age ≥35 weeks) at risk for hypoglycemia (ie, maternal diabetes, large for gestational age, fetal growth restriction, and prematurity [gestational age &lt;37 weeks]) in whom ongoing monitoring of blood glucose concentrations were performed for the first 48 hours of life and treatment was provided to maintain blood glucose concentrations greater than 47 mg/dL (2.61 mmol/L) regardless of postnatal age [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Neurodevelopmental outcome at two years of age was similar between infants in whom intervention was provided for hypoglycemia compared with those without evidence of hypoglycemia. However, at 4.5 years of age follow-up assessment demonstrated that children with treated neonatal hypoglycemia had poorer executive and visual motor functions [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Of note, despite intensive capillary blood glucose monitoring, 25 percent of the infants had glucose concentrations below the targeted level for at least five hours as detected by continuous interstitial glucose monitoring (which was masked to the clinical providers). These results do <strong>not</strong> provide a definitive threshold for treating neonatal hypoglycemia in all newborns.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, most guidelines used in clinical practice provide arbitrary treatment thresholds of blood glucose concentrations to initiate intervention despite the controversies surrounding the definition of hypoglycemia [<a href="#rid2">2,6</a>]. The goal of these guidelines is to reduce the harm due to hypoglycemia, identify newborns with a serious underlying hypoglycemia disorder, and at the same time, minimize overtreatment of newborns with normal transitional low glucose concentrations that resolve without intervention. This has resulted in guidelines that favor simplicity and ease of use over an emphasis on the physiology of normal neonatal glucose homeostasis, the normal age-related increase in glucose concentrations over the first few days of life, and the varying pathophysiological conditions that may lead to clinical hypoglycemia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/101425.html" rel="external">"Management and outcome of neonatal hypoglycemia"</a>.)</p><p>Most guidelines are based on plasma glucose concentrations; therefore, it is important to recognize that glucose concentrations measured in whole blood (often used at the point-of-care) are approximately 15 percent lower than those in plasma and may be further reduced if the hematocrit is high. In addition, when reviewing the literature and guidelines one must be careful to note whether the normal values are mean glucose values, as opposed to using a threshold range of glucose values (eg, below the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile used in the American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP] guidelines). (See <a class="local">'How glucose testing is performed'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15596030"><span class="h1">NORMAL TRANSITIONAL LOW GLUCOSE LEVELS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Transient low blood glucose concentrations in neonates are normal, as the source of glucose at delivery changes from a continuous supply from the mother to an intermittent supply from milk feeds [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. With loss of the continuous transplacental supply of glucose, plasma glucose concentration in the healthy term newborn falls during the first two hours after delivery, reaching a nadir with a median concentration of approximately 55 mg/dL, and 95 percent values in this nadir above 25 mg/dL [<a href="#rid2">2,3,8-10</a>]. Glucose concentrations increase over the first 18 hours and stabilize between 45 and 80 mg/dL (2.5 and 4.4 mmol/L) for the first 48 hours of life [<a href="#rid1">1-3,8</a>]. Mean glucose concentrations then rise more slowly to levels similar to the mean concentrations seen in older children and adults by day 4 [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. However, blood glucose levels vary widely even in individual infants. In a prospective study, low glucose concentrations (defined as &lt;47 mg/dL [2.6 mmol/L) were observed in about 40 percent of healthy term infants undergoing continuous glucose monitoring and frequent plasma glucose testing over the first 120 hours after birth [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. </p><p>Immediately after birth, the newborn infant breaks down hepatic glycogen (glycogenolysis) to produce glucose in response to increased plasma epinephrine and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13335" href="/d/drug information/13335.html" rel="external">glucagon</a> concentrations, and falling insulin levels. As a result, glycogen stores are depleted during the first 8 to 12 hours of life. At that point, the newborn needs to produce glucose (gluconeogenesis) by synthesizing glucose from lactate, glycerol, and amino acids. As feeds with adequate carbohydrate are established, maintenance of plasma glucose concentrations is no longer solely dependent on gluconeogenesis. However, if the first feeding is delayed for three to six hours after birth, approximately 10 percent of normal term newborns cannot maintain a plasma glucose concentration above 30 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS OF NEONATAL HYPOGLYCEMIA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hypoglycemia is caused by a lower rate of glucose production than glucose utilization due to either inadequate glucose supply or increased glucose utilization. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Diminished glucose supply</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H179705615"><span class="h3">Inadequate glycogen stores</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Inadequate glycogen stores can lead to a diminished supply of glucose and present in the following settings:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prematurity – Because glycogen is deposited during the third trimester of pregnancy, infants born prematurely have diminished glycogen reserves.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fetal growth restriction (FGR) – Infants with FGR, also referred to as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), may have reduced glycogen stores or may rapidly deplete their glycogen stores if the transition to extrauterine life is difficult, which increases their metabolic needs (ie, increased glucose utilization).

Excess insulin also suppresses hepatic glucose production. The infant of a diabetic mother is the most common neonatal clinical situation in which hyperinsulinism causes hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. In this setting, it is postulated that intermittent maternal hyperglycemia causes fetal hyperglycemia, which leads to hypertrophied and hyperfunctioning beta cells resulting in fetal and neonatal hyperinsulinemia. After termination of the maternal glucose supply at delivery, hypoglycemia from persistent hyperinsulinism in the newborn usually is transient and typically resolves two to four days after birth.
