Conservative care includes preventive care, and joint protection is a fundamental way to provide preventive joint care.</p><p>Joint protection for the upper limb is reviewed here. An overview of joint protection and the application of the principles of joint protection to the neck and lower limb are presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7754.html" rel="external">"Overview of joint protection"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7758.html" rel="external">"Joint protection program for the neck"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7763.html" rel="external">"Joint protection program for the lower limb"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">PRINCIPLES OF JOINT PROTECTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>These principles are derived from the simple, practical application of proper body mechanics, posture, and positioning of joints. Joint protection reduces local joint stress and preserves joint integrity. Joint protection is achieved through patient education, self-management, and problem-solving to promote behavior modification; energy conservation; exercise; and selective use of splints, adaptive devices, and modalities. Guiding patients to perform tasks in a manner that reduces stress on joints is generally preferred to prohibiting the task. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7754.html" rel="external">"Overview of joint protection"</a>.)</p><p>Principles of joint protection include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Respect pain.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Balance rest and activity.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Participate in exercise or activity to maintain strength and range of motion.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use the minimum amount of force necessary to complete the job.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Simplify work.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use good posture and body mechanics and avoid positions which induce deformity.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Distribute the load over stronger joints and/or larger surface areas.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoid maintaining the same joint position for prolonged periods.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">IDENTIFYING AGGRAVATING FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Aggravating factors may be present when pain persists beyond the expected duration for a given problem, such as bursitis or tendinitis. Such factors include habits and activities that can initiate and/or perpetuate soft tissue or joint pain and disability. The patient's routine at work, at home, and in sports should be explored as the starting point for the identification of such factors so that the patient can appropriately modify their activities as a preventive strategy. Knowledge of specific risk factors for specific sports or activities can direct prevention recommendations. For swimming, risk factors with a moderate level of certainty for shoulder pain and injury include clinical joint laxity, instability, internal/external rotation, previous history of pain and injury, and higher competitive level [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The patient's occupation can predispose to musculoskeletal issues. As an example, in a meta-analysis of dentists in India, 68.3 percent reported musculoskeletal problems [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. A systematic review of work-related musculoskeletal disorders found that females in medicine who perform surgery and procedures experience a higher incidence of upper extremity pain compared with males; contributing factors may include the design and size of procedural tools [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Findings from another systematic review and meta-analysis of working nurses suggest that psychosocial factors are associated with a higher prevalence of workplace-related upper limb musculoskeletal disorders [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>The patient should be asked questions regarding several issues regardless of the area affected, while other questions depend upon the affected region.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18701534"><span class="h2">General questions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Questions that should be addressed to most patients with persistent symptoms that may help identify aggravating factors include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Have you engaged in a new hobby, sport, or exercise?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Have you increased the frequency/intensity of any current activities?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Have you done any prolonged repetitive activity?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Has your job changed?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Have you done activities in an awkward position or for an extended length of time?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Are you under increased stress?</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5360997"><span class="h2">Questions regarding specific regions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some questions should be addressed to patients depending upon which region is affected, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Shoulder region</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Have you pulled, reached for, or carried a heavier object than usual?</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Have you had recent leg problems forcing you to use your arms more?</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Do you perform overhead activity frequently, or sleep with arms raised above your head?</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Do you do pushups?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Elbow region</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Have you driven a long way with elbow on armrest of car door?</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Have you been pushing up from bed with your elbow?</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Have you been doing computer or desk work?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hand and wrist</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Are you clenching your fist unnecessarily firmly?</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h1">GUIDELINES FOR UPPER LIMB PROTECTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We advise patients to follow a series of both general guidelines for joint protection as well as region-specific guidelines that are applicable for the use of specific joints to protect the upper limb from injury.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18701548"><span class="h2">General</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following strategies apply to a broad range of activities:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Take regular rest breaks and avoid sustained positions; as an example, take a "mini-break" and make a change of positions every 20 to 40 minutes to interrupt repetitive activities, such as window washing, vacuuming, cooking, peeling, typing, knitting, writing, computer work, or working on an assembly line. There is low-quality evidence that rest breaks have an effect on upper limb discomfort [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use proper posture/body mechanics and preventive strategies for physical activity. Examples include:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Learn the proper technique/form and specific conditioning exercises for sports such as swimming, tennis, and golf to reduce injuries. Identification of specific signs of imbalance and impaired technique by clinicians and coaches can promote injury remediation, especially in competitive athletes [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Use appropriate protective gear.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Use proper grip size for racquet sports or golf. Golfers with arthritis should try using cushion grips and the baseball grip style (no interlocking fingers), should relax the grip until just before ball impact, and can consult a professional instructor for ways to address grip problems.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Seek alternatives to interventions, such as electromyography (EMG) biofeedback, job stress management, and office workstation adjustment alone, as there is a moderate level of evidence they have no effect on work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p>There is inconsistent evidence that workspace adjustments such as an alternative computer mouse or arm support will reduce neck or shoulder musculoskeletal disorders [<a href="#rid6">6,8,9</a>]. Further high-quality studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of these interventions.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18701578"><span class="h2">Shoulder</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The use of proper posture and body mechanics is important for the protection of the shoulder. The following strategies may be beneficial:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Keep the elbow close to the body and change the angle of shoulder motion when possible.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Sleep with the arms below the level of the chest.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoid twisting and awkward positions such as reaching for objects in the back seat of a car from the front seat.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Adjust crutches properly, if they are being used, to about 5 cm below the axillae, and carry weight on the ribs and hands, not under the arms. A forearm cane may be preferred.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use the contralateral arm and hand across the front of the body to reach a car seat belt.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A swivel or wheeled chair may be useful when tasks done from a seated position are in various nearby locations.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Keep the hands below the "3 o'clock" and "9 o'clock" positions on the steering wheel when driving. If possible, use a steering wheel that tilts.</p><p></p><p>Modification in work techniques has been shown to be beneficial in reducing shoulder disorders. In a study examining three different work techniques by 40 experienced painters, doing overhead work using a pushing technique using shorter strokes and lower speed resulted in fewer shoulder disorders than other approaches [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p>Attention to a number of factors associated with increased work-related risk for shoulder disorders can be helpful in identifying problematic activities that may need to be modified in patients with symptoms of shoulder disorders. Shoulder impingement syndrome was associated with highly repetitive work, forceful exertion in work, awkward postures, and high psychosocial job demand [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Flexion/abduction of greater than 60 degrees is associated with increased risk, and repeated or sustained shoulder flexion and abduction is associated with rapid onset of muscle fatigue [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. The following factors were associated with increased risk of shoulder impingement syndrome [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Greater than 10 percent maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lifting &gt;20 kg &gt;10 times/day</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>High level of hand force &gt;one hour per day</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Highly repetitive shoulder, hand/wrist (greater than two hours per day)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hand-arm vibration</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Awkward postures such as working with hand above shoulder level or at 45 degrees of shoulder flexion over 15 percent of the day</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>High job demands</p><p></p><p>There is some evidence that the same factors, including repetitive and overhead work, may apply to nonspecific shoulder disorders [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. A systematic review found moderate evidence that shoulder elevation and shoulder load increased the incidence of specific shoulder disorders and low- to very low-quality evidence for association between hand force exertion, hand-arm vibration, psychosocial job demands, repetitive arm movements, social support, job control and security, and incidence of specific shoulder disorders [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Moderate evidence was found that arm-hand elevation and shoulder load double the risk of specific shoulder disorders [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Based on additional calculations, the "best estimate" of the doubling dose is 3636 hours of work with hands on or above the shoulder level [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Elbow and forearm</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Protection of the elbow and forearm is focused upon reducing repetitive motion, load, and force on the elbow. Advice for patients to enhance protection of the elbow and forearm includes the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use minimum force.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Avoid pressure and impact on the elbow.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Do not push against a hard surface when sitting, driving, or changing positions.</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Use elbow pads for protection if there is a risk of repeated trauma or persistent pressure over this area.</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Use the abdominal muscles to help roll over when getting out of bed.</p><p></p><p>There is conflicting evidence regarding the benefits of splinting for epicondylitis [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. While studies have found splints can be beneficial, there are also adverse effects in splinting for epicondylitis including higher rates of limited duty, more medical visits, higher cost, and longer treatment durations [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>]. However, a systematic review identified evidence that a simple elbow band worn under the lateral epicondyle was as effective as the more elaborately designed Thamert splints [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Therapeutic taping has also been found to be beneficial [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p>Exercise improves pain, range of motion, and strength for patients with lateral epicondylitis, but there is no consensus regarding the best type of exercise [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. One study found that a combination of strengthening and stretching resulted in a statistically significant increase in grip strength and that progressive strengthening and stretching reduced pain. Significant differences have not been shown between eccentric strengthening, stretching, and a concentric strengthening program. Another systematic review found that manual therapy and eccentric strength training as physical therapy treatments may have the greatest benefits [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p>The majority of literature on elbow protection is focused on medial and lateral epicondylitis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/248.html" rel="external">"Elbow tendinopathy (tennis and golf elbow)"</a>.)</p><p>A systematic review exploring work-related factors associated with specific disorders of the elbow identified the following risk factors for epicondylitis [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Lateral epicondylitis</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Handling tools &gt;1 kg</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Handling loads &gt;20 kg at least 10 times per day</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Repetitive movements &gt;two hours per day</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Low job control and low social support</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Medial epicondylitis</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Handling tools &gt;5 kg two times per minute for two or more hours per day</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Handling loads &gt;20 kg at least 10 times per day</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>High hand grip forces &gt;one hour per day</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Repetitive movements &gt;two hours per day</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Working with vibrating tools &gt;two hours per day</p><p></p><p>However, findings from a subsequent systematic review suggest that the evidence for a causal relationship between lateral elbow tendinopathy and exposure to biomechanical risk factors is still limited, and for medial elbow tendinopathy, the evidence of this relationship is insufficient [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h2">Hand and wrist</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Strategies for protection of the hand and wrist include the following guidelines, which are supported in part by experimental data, expert opinion, and clinical experience (see <a class="local">'Hand and wrist interventions'</a> below):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use the stronger larger joints.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Use the palms and forearms to carry heavy objects.</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Grasp objects with the hand and all fingers.</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Use both hands as much as possible when lifting heavy objects.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use good posture/body mechanics and avoid positions that promote deformity.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Rest the hands flat and open rather than with a tight fist.</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Be aware of hand clenching, and wear stretch gloves while driving or to bed when nocturnal hand clenching is recognized.</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Keep the hand and wrist extended for work activities.</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Adapt tools with handles designed so that the wrist is maintained in a neutral position.</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Use a wrist rest while working on a keyboard.</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Avoid uncomfortable hand positions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Use minimum force.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Use a relaxed grip on tools.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Enlarge the handles of work tools, utensils, and steering wheel.
