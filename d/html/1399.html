         The infusion of hematopoietic cells to re-establish marrow function in an individual who has had his or her bone marrow ablated with chemotherapy and/or radiation has become standard therapy for many malignant and nonmalignant diseases. The term "hematopoietic cell transplantation" (HCT) will be used throughout this review as a general term to cover transplantation of hematopoietic cells from any source (eg, bone marrow, peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3537.html" rel="external">
          "Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT): Sources of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients can develop bacterial, fungal, viral, and/or parasitic infections following HCT, particularly following allogeneic HCT  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52716" href="/z/d/graphic/52716.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Infection in such patients is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Thus, prevention of infection is a major goal involving determination of risk, careful selection of donors, infection control measures, and prophylactic and pre-emptive antimicrobial therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic review will discuss appropriate pretransplantation screening tests. An overview of the infections that can occur in association with HCT and prophylaxis against some of these infections are discussed separately.

         The pretransplantation evaluation is designed to prevent post-transplant infections by excluding unsuitable donors and by defining specific infection control policies and antimicrobial prophylaxis and therapy, which will be necessary after transplantation.

         Laboratory testing for evidence of past infectious exposures is performed to detect asymptomatic infection in the HCT donor or candidate. Some tests are recommended for all HCT donors and candidates, whereas others are appropriate in selected individuals with epidemiologic risk factors  (

        <p>
         In the 2009 guidelines for preventing infectious complications among HCT recipients, there was no consensus about whether all HCT candidates should undergo TST or IGRA prior to HCT [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. We favor screening for TB with either one of these tests in all HCT candidates with risk factors for TB. It should be noted that false-negative TST and IGRA results may occur in immunocompromised patients. (See

        <p>
         Since transplanting stem cells from a donor with latent TB poses no known risk of TB in the recipient, screening donors for latent TB is not necessary [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Potential donors with signs or symptoms of active TB should be evaluated for TB, and donation should be deferred until the TB is well controlled.

         Community respiratory virus infections are common among patients receiving HCT and are more prevalent during periods of community outbreaks [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. Accordingly, healthcare workers and visitors with symptoms of upper respiratory infection should be restricted from having contact with HCT candidates. The presence of a community respiratory virus infection in an HCT candidate is of particular concern because these viruses can progress to pneumonia following HCT. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other respiratory viruses, such as influenza, parainfluenza viruses, adenovirus, and metapneumovirus, can progress to pneumonia in HCT recipients. Because infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be asymptomatic and subsequent clinical illness can result in devastating complications, transplant centers test potential HCT recipients for this virus by polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal swab specimens prior to initiating the conditioning regimen.
        </p>
        <p>
         Any HCT candidate with signs and/or symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection should be tested promptly for the presence of community respiratory viruses. The optimal specimens for testing are nasopharyngeal aspirates, washings, and swabs. The optimal diagnostic test (viral culture, rapid antigen testing, fluorescent antibody testing, polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) varies depending on the virus. (See

         Active infections in the hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) candidate should be eliminated or suppressed prior to transplantation, whenever possible. Even asymptomatic infections can evolve into overwhelming sepsis following transplantation. Similarly, donors with active infections should be treated prior to donating cells. Infections in the donor that are contraindications to stem cell donation are discussed below. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Contraindications to stem cell donation'

        </p>
        <p>
         Decisions regarding the timing of HCT following initiation of therapy for infections in the HCT donor or candidate must be made on a case-by-case basis. Since many HCT candidates with malignant conditions have a high mortality rate if their underlying disease is not treated expeditiously with HCT, it may be appropriate to proceed to HCT even when the donor is known to have an infection that could be transmitted to the recipient [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The risks and benefits of using potentially infected donor cells must be weighed carefully in this situation.
        </p>
        <p>
         When HCT candidates have infections with pathogens that can be treated fully prior to HCT (eg, bacteremia or bacterial pneumonia), it is optimal to do so. In some cases, continuing treatment through the high-risk period is indicated. The decision of when it is safe to proceed to HCT must be made on a case-by-case basis.

         Patients with profound T cell immunodeficiency have a higher risk for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, even prior to commencing the conditioning regimen. These patients should undergo testing with CMV quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) two weeks prior to commencing the conditioning regimen and should receive anti-CMV therapy if found to have CMV viremia.

The conditioning regimen may then be started during antiviral therapy. However, ganciclovir or valganciclovir should be switched to foscarnet no longer than two days prior to starting the conditioning regimen to prevent the myelosuppressive effects of ganciclovir and valganciclovir. Foscarnet may be stopped if CMV PCR or antigenemia become undetectable and if there is no evidence of CMV disease. However, close monitoring should continue and foscarnet resumed at the first evidence of CMV reactivation or CMV disease.

         An elevated risk of death was present when rhinovirus was detected but not when influenza or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected. A possible reason for this is that most patients with RSV or influenza either received antiviral therapy or had a delay in transplantation, whereas fewer patients with rhinovirus had a delay in transplantation and therefore remained positive at conditioning.

Some donors who developed COVID-19 during stem cell mobilization had their collection stopped; others, particularly early during the pandemic when testing was not readily available, completed donation. Importantly, there was no SARS-CoV-2 transmission to recipient, no effects on recipient engraftment, no adverse events attributed to SARS-CoV-2 to the recipient, and no effects on six-month survival.

         Donors who have traveled to a malaria-endemic area should defer donation for one year following their return [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Former or current residents of endemic areas should defer donation for three years. If this is not feasible, the donor should be treated empirically for malaria prior to donation. If the donor is diagnosed with active malaria, collection of stem cells should be delayed if possible until treatment has been completed and negative confirmatory testing obtained. If this is not feasible, pre-emptive treatment of the HCT recipient is reasonable, although there is no evidence regarding the safety or efficacy of this approach.

         Blood banking standards recommend deferral for a past history of Q fever or babesiosis because these infections can be chronic and

         Following transplantation, HCT recipients typically lose immunity to pathogens against which they were previously immunized. Thus, HCT recipients should be immunized against a number of pathogens following the return of immune competence. Other strategies for preventing infections in HCT recipients include pretransplant vaccination of HCT candidates with the usual vaccines that are indicated based upon age, vaccination history, and exposure history; and vaccination of household contacts. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See

          Risk of infection after HCT
         </strong>
         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         The infusion of hematopoietic cells to re-establish marrow function in an individual who has had his or her bone marrow ablated with chemotherapy and/or radiation has become standard therapy for many malignant and nonmalignant diseases. Patients can develop bacterial, fungal, viral, and/or parasitic infections following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52716" href="/z/d/graphic/52716.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Infection in such patients is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Thus, prevention of infection is a major goal involving determination of risk, careful selection of donors, infection control measures, and prophylactic and pre-emptive antimicrobial therapy. (See
         <a class="local">

          Importance of the pre-transplant evaluation
         </strong>
         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         The pretransplantation evaluation is designed to prevent post-transplant infections by excluding unsuitable donors and by defining specific infection control policies and antimicrobial prophylaxis and therapy, which will be necessary after transplantation. The donor and recipient must have a comprehensive history for recent or past infectious disease exposure, particularly when an allogeneic HCT is considered. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pretransplant evaluation'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
         </strong>
         Laboratory testing for evidence of past infectious exposures is performed to detect asymptomatic infection in the HCT donor or candidate. Some tests are recommended for all patients, whereas others are appropriate in selected individuals with epidemiologic risk factors  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56453" href="/z/d/graphic/56453.html" rel="external">

          Treating active infections before HCT
         </strong>
         –
         <strong>
         </strong>
         Active infections in the HCT candidate should be eliminated or suppressed prior to transplantation, whenever possible. Even asymptomatic infections can evolve into invasive disease or overwhelming sepsis following transplantation. Decisions regarding the timing of HCT following initiation of therapy for infections in the HCT donor or candidate must be made on a case-by-case basis. (See
         <a class="local">

          Secondary prophylaxis

         <strong>
         </strong>
         In HCT candidates who have had infections that are likely to recrudesce following HCT, secondary prophylaxis during the period of increased risk is appropriate. Examples of such infections include invasive aspergillosis and disseminated candidiasis (hepatosplenic candidiasis). (See
