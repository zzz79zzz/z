Eating disorders are most often found in adolescent and young adult women; thus, they often come to medical attention during pregnancy when weight and eating habits are closely monitored. For some women with eating disorders, pregnancy is an opportunity for recovery (comparable to stopping tobacco or alcohol use); for other patients, pregnancy is a period of vulnerability for onset, persistence, or relapse of eating disorder symptoms.</p><p>This topic reviews pregnancy, birth, and postpartum outcomes in the context of eating disorders; the course of eating disorders during and after pregnancy; and management of eating disorders that is specific to pregnant women. Diagnosis and treatment of eating disorders in the general population are discussed separately.

The assessment can be difficult because women with eating disorders tend to conceal their abnormal eating patterns and compensatory behaviors (fasting, laxative abuse, diuretic abuse, purging, or excessive exercise) due to denial, shame, and/or guilt [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>]. Screening may help detect eating disorders.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15777.html" rel="external">"Anorexia nervosa in adults: Evaluation for medical complications and criteria for hospitalization to manage these complications", section on 'Laboratory assessment'</a>.) </p><p>Anorexia nervosa should be included in the differential diagnosis when pregnant patients present with below normal body weight. Bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder can be harder to identify than anorexia nervosa, because patients with bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder may have a normal or above normal weight [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>More detailed information about assessing patients for eating disorders is discussed elsewhere, as is the standard prenatal assessment for the general population. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14704.html" rel="external">"Anorexia nervosa in adults: Clinical features, course of illness, assessment, and diagnosis", section on 'Assessment'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14709.html" rel="external">"Bulimia nervosa in adults: Clinical features, course of illness, assessment, and diagnosis", section on 'Assessment'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/446.html" rel="external">"Prenatal care: Initial assessment"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5278781"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Diagnosis of anorexia nervosa  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91103" href="/d/graphic/91103.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), bulimia nervosa  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef91105" href="/d/graphic/91105.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), and other eating disorders is based upon the criteria in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14704.html" rel="external">"Anorexia nervosa in adults: Clinical features, course of illness, assessment, and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14709.html" rel="external">"Bulimia nervosa in adults: Clinical features, course of illness, assessment, and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2093.html" rel="external">"Eating disorders: Overview of epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H77630328"><span class="h1">METHODOLOGIC ISSUES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Evidence about the effects of eating disorders on pregnancy outcomes is based upon observational studies that vary in quality. As an example, diagnoses may be imprecise because they are derived from registry data or questionnaire self-report, rather than clinical evaluations. In addition, results are often presented for women with histories of eating disorders that may not have been active during the pregnancies that were studied. Furthermore, analyses in many studies were not adjusted for potential confounders such as maternal age, smoking, and prepregnancy body mass index. Specific eating disorders differ in their clinical features and treatment; thus, studies that examine eating disorders collectively are less informative than studies of specific disorders.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H104894568"><span class="h1">ANOREXIA NERVOSA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Estimating the prevalence of anorexia nervosa in pregnant women is complicated by the difficulty in determining low body weight in women who are gaining weight due to pregnancy [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. The best estimate comes from a community studies of pregnant women in Norway and the Netherlands, which found that in the 6 to 12 months prior to becoming pregnant, the prevalence of anorexia nervosa was 0.1 to 0.3 percent [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. The true prevalence is probably higher because patients often conceal their illness.</p><p>Although anorexia nervosa manifests with amenorrhea in approximately 70 to 90 percent of patients, fertility rates in women with a history of anorexia nervosa and women in the general population appear to be comparable [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. However, many patients receive treatment for infertility [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>].</p><p>Unplanned pregnancy is common in anorexia nervosa [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. A prospective study of women with a lifetime history of anorexia nervosa (n = 171) and women with no eating disorders (n &gt;10,000) found that unplanned pregnancy occurred in more patients with anorexia nervosa than controls (42 versus 28 percent) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Induced abortion may also be more common in patients than controls [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>Changes in body shape and the prospect of weight gain are more distressing to pregnant patients with anorexia nervosa than pregnant women without an eating disorder [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p>Pregnant women with anorexia nervosa are three times more likely to eat a vegetarian diet, compared to pregnant women with no history of eating disorders [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. However, differences in nutrient intake are generally not observed [<a href="#rid15">15,16</a>].</p><p>Smoking appears to be common in pregnant patients with anorexia nervosa [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. An observational study found that during pregnancy, women with a history of anorexia nervosa (n = 35) were more likely to smoke than women with no eating disorders (n &gt;33,000) (37 versus 9 percent) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p>Pregnant and postpartum patients with anorexia nervosa are often depressed. As an example, a community study found that the prevalence of depression in pregnant women with a history of anorexia nervosa (n = 23) and pregnant women with a history of unipolar major depression (n = 302) was comparable (39 and 37 percent) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. These prevalence rates appear to be higher than rates in the general population of women. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1722.html" rel="external">"Unipolar depression in adults: Epidemiology", section on 'Prevalence'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H332915"><span class="h2">Gestational weight gain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Weight gain in pregnant patients with anorexia nervosa varies. Using weight gain recommendations from the Institute of Medicine, a prospective study of pregnant women with anorexia nervosa (n = 32) found that at delivery, weight gain was as follows [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Inadequate – 22 percent (n = 7)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Adequate – 28 percent (n = 9)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Excessive – 50 percent (n = 16)</p><p></p><p>However, prepregnancy weight in patients was low (mean body mass index 18.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>); thus, “excessive” weight gain was probably appropriate.</p><p>Gestational weight gain at delivery appears to be greater in patients with anorexia nervosa than women without the disorder:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A prospective community study of pregnant women with a history of anorexia nervosa (n = 129) and pregnant women with no history of eating disorders (n = 3816) found that the average weight gain was greater in the women with anorexia nervosa than the controls (9 versus 8 kilograms) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a second prospective study of pregnant women with a history of anorexia nervosa (n = 30) and pregnant women with no eating disorders (n &gt;30,000), it appeared that mean gestational weight gain was greater in women with anorexia nervosa (17 versus 15 kilograms; a test for statistical significance was not conducted due to the small sample size for anorexia nervosa) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A third prospective study of women with anorexia nervosa (n = 56) found that body mass index immediately prior to pregnancy was low (mean 18.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and during pregnancy increased only to the normal range at the time of birth (mean 24.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>].</p><p></p><p>Gestational weight gain in the general population is discussed separately.

Birth weight was lower in children of mothers with anorexia nervosa than controls; however, the clinical difference was small (190 grams) and heterogeneity across studies was moderate.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Microcephaly – In a national registry study of women with active or past anorexia nervosa (n &gt;2700) and women without a history of eating disorders (n &gt;1.2 million), microcephaly occurred in more women with anorexia nervosa (relative risk 1.7, 95% CI 1.3-2.1) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p></p><p>Several studies have found that anorexia nervosa is not associated with preterm birth [<a href="#rid9">9,17,18,22,24,25</a>]. However, in a more recent and relatively large study of women with active or past anorexia nervosa (n &gt;2700) and women without a history of eating disorders (n &gt;1.2 million), preterm birth occurred more often with anorexia nervosa (relative risk 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.8) [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p>It is not clear if anorexia nervosa is associated with small for gestational age births, due to conflicting results across studies. In a national registry study of births (n = 244) in women with a lifetime history of anorexia nervosa and births (n &gt;43,000) in women without a history of eating disorders, the probability of small for gestational age was nearly three times greater in women with anorexia nervosa (odds ratio 2.7, 95% CI 1.4-5.1) [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. A second registry study with over 2 million participants showed that the risk of small for gestational age was greater in those with anorexia nervosa than those without (relative risk 1.5, 95% CI 1.4-1.7) [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. However, other studies have failed to show an association between anorexia nervosa and small for gestational age [<a href="#rid9">9,18,24,28</a>].</p><p>It is also unclear whether anorexia nervosa in pregnant women is associated with stillbirth and neonatal death, due to conflicting results across different studies [<a href="#rid24">24,25,27</a>].</p><p>Pregnant women with a history of anorexia nervosa do not appear to be at increased risk for:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Miscarriage [<a href="#rid17">17,22,29</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Preeclampsia [<a href="#rid9">9,21,22,24,28</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Caesarean delivery [<a href="#rid9">9,18,22,24</a>]</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Large for gestational age [<a href="#rid18">18,21,24</a>]</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4406825"><span class="h2">Postpartum outcomes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cessation of breastfeeding within six months of delivery occurs more often in women with a history of anorexia nervosa than women with no history of eating disorders [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].

Contraceptive techniques are discussed separately.
