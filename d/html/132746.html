The frequency of serious complications depends upon the valve type and position and other clinical risk factors. Prosthetic valve complications include embolic events, bleeding, valve obstruction (due to thrombosis or pannus), infective endocarditis, structural deterioration (particularly for bioprosthetic valves), paravalvular or transvalvular regurgitation, hemolytic anemia, and patient-prosthesis mismatch. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8134.html" rel="external">"Overview of the management of patients with prosthetic heart valves"</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review antithrombotic therapy following surgical bioprosthetic valve replacement or surgical valve repair [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].

For patients with a surgical bioprosthetic valve, the risk of thromboembolism varies depending upon time after implantation (risk is highest immediately after implantation and declines with time to a lower long-term risk after 90 days), valve position (higher risk with mitral versus aortic valves), and presence of risk factors such as atrial fibrillation (AF) or low left ventricular ejection fraction.</p><p>After surgical bioprosthetic valve replacement, the risk of thromboembolism is highest during the first three to six months (particularly the first 30 days) [<a href="#rid1">1-5</a>]; this applies even with exclusion of events in the first 24 hours [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>]. The period of highest risk is relatively short, which limits the absolute risk of thromboembolism in the early postoperative period, as illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Aortic valve</strong> – In an early series of 424 adults (mean age 64 years) undergoing bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement (approximately one-third treated postoperatively with vitamin K antagonist [VKA]), the rate of thromboembolic events during the first 10 days was 1.1 percent (a linearized rate of 41 percent per year), during days 11 to 90 the rate was 3.6 percent per year, and after 90 days the rate was 1.9 percent per year [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. A high rate of thromboembolic events (5 percent) was also identified during the first 90 days in a later series of 861 adults (mean age 70 years) in sinus rhythm after bioprosthetic aortic valve implantation (with or without VKA therapy) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A meta-analysis identified a long-term annual thromboembolic rate of 0.87 percent per year in 5837 adults (mean age 64.6 years) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The long-term risk may be lower in a younger population, as suggested by a study with an incidence rate of 0.53 percent per year in a population of 2686 adults with mean age 50.7 years [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mitral valve</strong> – In a series of 326 patients undergoing bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement (approximately 80 percent receiving VKA), the rate of thromboembolic events was 1.5 percent during the first 10 days (equivalent to 55 percent per year), during 11 to 90 days it was 10 percent per year, and after 90 days it was 2.4 percent per year [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. In a later series that included 216 patients with a bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement for mitral regurgitation (41 percent taking <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> for &gt;3 months), the rate of ischemic stroke was 4.6 percent during the first 30 days (equivalent to 60 percent per year), 1.5 percent per year during days 31 to 180, and 0.9 percent per year after the first 180 days [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Tricuspid and pulmonic valves</strong> – Limited data are available on the risk of thromboembolism in patients with tricuspid or pulmonic bioprosthetic valves, and interpretation is difficult since many patients with these valves also have prosthetic mitral and/or aortic valves and other comorbidities. A systematic review identified eight thromboembolic events in 470 patients with bioprosthetic tricuspid valves (1.7 percent) versus 42 events in 464 patients with mechanical tricuspid valves (9.1 percent) in nine studies, but the period of follow-up ranged up to 20 years or more [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p></p><p>The effects of antithrombotic therapy on thromboembolic risk are discussed below.

However, some retrospective data suggest that symptomatic BPVT is frequently missed, and the incidence rate may be as high 2 percent within the first two years [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>].</p><p>Clinical manifestations include exertional dyspnea and increased transvalvular gradients, as discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/113815.html" rel="external">"Bioprosthetic valve thrombosis, thromboembolism, and obstruction: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/111633.html" rel="external">"Bioprosthetic valve thrombosis, thromboembolism, and obstruction: Management"</a>.)</p><p>The time of presentation of obstructive BPVT ranges from days to greater than five years after surgical implantation, as illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A retrospective pathology study conducted at the Mayo Clinic, with 397 bioprosthetic valves explanted due to dysfunction, found that 46 cases (11.6 percent) were caused by BPVT [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. The majority (65 percent) of cases of BPVT were identified more than 12 months after implantation; 15 percent of cases occurred more than five years after implantation. BPVT was identified on explanted aortic, mitral, pulmonic, and tricuspid valves.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A partially overlapping study conducted at the Mayo Clinic identified 32 cases of clinically diagnosed BPVT [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. The peak incidence of BPVT occurred at 13 to 24 months after implantation.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H159747412"><span class="h4">Subclinical bioprosthetic valve thrombosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Subclinical BPVT is a relatively common finding in research imaging studies (using four-dimensional computed tomography [CT] or echocardiography), but the clinical significance of asymptomatic BPVT has not been determined [<a href="#rid10">10-17</a>]. Subclinical valve thrombosis appears to be dynamic, progressing and regressing over the course of months [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Incidence</strong> – Imaging studies have identified high incidences of subclinical BPVT manifested as hypoattenuated leaflet thickening (HALT) and reduced leaflet motion [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. An imaging substudy of the Evolut Low Risk trial found similar rates of HALT with transcatheter and surgical valves at one month (17.3 versus 16.5 percent) and one year (30.9 and 28.4 percent) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Other studies have identified higher rates of evidence of BPVT with transcatheter than with surgically implanted bioprosthetic aortic valves, but it is unclear whether these differences were caused by differences in prosthetic valves, antithrombotic therapy, or other clinical characteristics [<a href="#rid16">16,19,20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Effect of anticoagulation</strong> – Anticoagulation appears to reduce the frequency of subclinical BPVT. Higher rates of subclinical BPVT have been observed among patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy (eg, 15 percent) than among patients receiving anticoagulants (eg, 4 percent with a VKA, 3 percent with a direct oral anticoagulant [DOAC]) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Resolution of subclinical leaflet thrombosis has been observed in some patients treated with anticoagulants (VKA or DOAC) [<a href="#rid16">16,21</a>], but regression has also been observed in some patients not treated with anticoagulant therapy [<a href="#rid17">17,18</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical significance</strong> – The clinical significance of subclinical BPVT is unclear, although associations with elevated bioprosthetic valve gradients and risk of TIAs, recurrent BPVT, and early valve degeneration have been observed [<a href="#rid16">16,20,21</a>]. In a study of subclinical BPVT, aortic valve gradients of greater than 20 mmHg and increases in aortic valve gradients of more than 10 mmHg were more frequent among 88 patients with subclinical BPVT than among 632 patients with normal leaflet motion (14 versus 1 percent) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Subclinical thrombosis was associated with significantly increased rates of TIAs (4.18 versus 0.6 per 100 person-years) and strokes or TIAs (7.85 versus 2.36 per 100 person-years) but not a significantly increased rate of stroke (4.12 versus 1.92 per 100 person-years). Similarly, in the PARTNER 3 cardiac CT substudy, the pooled thromboembolic endpoint of stroke, TIA, and thromboembolic events was more frequently seen in patients with HALT (8.6 versus 1.6 percent at 30 days) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p></p><p>Further investigation is required to determine contributing factors, clinical significance, and appropriate management of subclinical BPVT for surgical and transcatheter valves.
