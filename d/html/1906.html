         The use of tunneled catheters for hemodialysis vascular access is associated with a relatively high incidence of complications, the most frequent of which is catheter dysfunction or low flow, which can lead to thrombotic complications. Catheter dysfunction is a major problem, with between 17 and 33 percent of chronic hemodialysis catheters requiring removal due to blood flow that is inadequate for hemodialysis [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-4
         </a>
         ]. The exact incidence of catheter dysfunction (generally expressed as cases per 1000 catheter-days) is not known for certain but is estimated to be between 0.5 and 3.42 episodes/1000 catheter-days, depending on the definition used [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ]. As a surrogate marker, the use of intraluminal thrombolysis to restore flow has been reported in the range of 1.8 to 8.0 administrations/1000 catheter-days [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,7-10
         </a>
         ]. The incidence of catheter dysfunction is increased for subclavian vein compared with the internal jugular vein access sites [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ], the presence of catheter malposition [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ], prior catheter-related thrombosis [
         <a href="#rid11">

          13
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The consequences of catheter dysfunction include inadequate dialysis (by definition) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ], increased risk of sepsis [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ], and shortened use-life of the dialysis catheter. If catheter dysfunction progresses to thrombosis, there is a requirement for the extra procedure of catheter removal or exchange. This has a negative impact on the patient's quality of life, adversely affects the dialysis schedule, and adds additional cost to the patient's therapy.

         Malfunction of chronic hemodialysis catheters, including catheter-related dysfunction and thrombosis, is reviewed. Preventing catheter malfunction relies on proper catheter care, which is discussed separately. (See

         Catheter dysfunction leading to inadequate dialysis has been defined based solely upon blood flow measurement. However, there is concern that using the blood flow rate as the only criterion can be misleading and has the potential to result in a significant number of unnecessary interventions [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15,16
         </a>
         ]. Other factors besides blood flow rate that are important for determining the adequacy of hemodialysis include the weight of the patient, recirculation, ultrafiltration variables, duration of hemodialysis, and frequency of hemodialysis. In a review of 259 patients in which the relationship between catheter blood flow rate and hemodialysis adequacy was assessed, mean blood flows of 250, 275, and 300 mL/min did not reliably predict inadequate dialysis [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. As a result of these considerations, catheter dysfunction has been more accurately defined as failure to attain and maintain an extracorporeal blood flow sufficient to perform hemodialysis without significantly lengthening treatment [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Nevertheless, decreasing catheter blood flow rate is a common problem frequently necessitating intervention.

          Measuring catheter blood flow

         The value recorded for blood flow rate during hemodialysis is typically the blood pump speed (based on pump revolutions per minute). However, this reading is not a true indicator of the actual blood flow to the catheter.
        </p>
        <p>
         Measurement of blood flow rate depends on having a standardized volumetric blood pump segment of the dialysis tubing. This is the basis for two problems that can occur [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         First, the pump relies on the elasticity of the pump segment to expand and refill as the rollers turn. However, despite the manufacturers' efforts to use tubing materials with minimal hysteresis (ie, failure to return to original size at no load), there is some flattening of the pump segment during dialysis as the tubing warms, which slightly reduces blood flow later in the dialysis treatment [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Second, the relationship between prepump (arterial) pressure and blood flow rate is curvilinear. As the prepump pressure increases, blood flow rate decreases. There is a potential for prepump pressure to become more negative with increasing flow demands. The pump segment can be partially collapsed if the prepump pressure becomes excessive (becomes more negative). Refilling of this segment is less complete as prepump pressure increases and its reflection of true volumetric flow becomes progressively more inaccurate [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. To prevent errors caused by excessive negative pressure, it is recommended that the prepump pressure be monitored and that alarms are set to detect when it drops below -240 to -260 mmHg [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Nevertheless, a blood flow rate problem that is likely to result in catheter dysfunction is generally progressive. So, to be of maximum value in detecting catheter dysfunction, blood flow rate should be trended over time. Available catheter designs allow a blood flow rate of &gt;400 mL/min to be achieved at an acceptable prepump pressure; waiting until the blood flow rate declines to 300 mL/min may be inappropriate, missing the opportunity to detect catheter dysfunction earlier [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         For the purposes of trending, it has been recommended that blood flow rate (from the blood pump indicator) should be measured at a standard prepump pressure (eg, -250 mmHg) with each hemodialysis session five minutes after the start of the session. A baseline blood flow rate should be established for a newly placed catheter, and the blood flow rate should be recorded for each treatment to detect changes. A decline of &lt;10 percent at the same negative prepump pressure may result from a variety of factors and should not cause concern, but a change of &gt;10 percent, particularly if progressive (indicating a progressive increase in resistance), should be taken as an indication of impending catheter dysfunction [
         <a href="#rid17">

         Catheter dysfunction can be described according to symptoms (asymptomatic, symptomatic), and timing relative to catheter placement (early, late). Catheter thrombosis, the most common cause of late dysfunction, is also classified by the location of the thrombus (extrinsic, intrinsic). Symptoms usually relate to the presence of catheter-related deep vein thrombosis (DVT). (See

          Early catheter dysfunction
         </strong>
         – Early catheter dysfunction is defined as a catheter that never functioned adequately after placement due to no blood flow, intermittent flow, or a blood flow rate insufficient to provide dialysis without significantly lengthening the hemodialysis treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In general, early catheter dysfunction is related to technical problems with placement or catheter positioning, and these ideally should have been recognized and corrected at the time of catheter placement. Technical problems include an improperly positioned catheter, kinked catheter, or a catheter that is constricted by the exit-site suture(s). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1843.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         If the catheter has been recently exchanged for a previously malfunctioning catheter, placement of the new catheter into a preexisting fibrin sheath must also be considered as a possible cause of catheter malfunction. (See

         Severe obesity frequently complicates catheter placement. When a patient with obesity is upright, the weight and depth of the chest wall can pull on a catheter that was apparently properly positioned when the patient was supine, leading to a catheter that has retracted into the more distal superior vena cava, making it less functional [

         A catheter may have been placed into the wrong vessel. As an example, placement of a catheter into the azygous vein is not unusual due to the frequency of central vein stenosis/thrombosis, which can lead to enlargement of the azygous vein. Malposition of the catheter into the azygous vein should be suspected if the catheter runs obliquely toward the midline in the anteroposterior view (

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The main cause of late catheter dysfunction is thrombotic occlusion, either partial or complete, which can also provide a substrate for bacterial growth and catheter-related infection [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>

         <a href="#rid22">
          22,23
         </a>
         ]. Late dysfunction can occur very early after initially successful use of the catheter or after a prolonged period of continuous use. In a review of 721 hemodialysis patients, thrombus formation was one of four parameters independently related to inadequate dialysis dose delivery [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>

         Catheter-related venous thrombosis is classified as a type of late catheter dysfunction. Catheter-related central venous thrombosis can occur in any vein through which the catheter traverses, including the subclavian, jugular, or brachiocephalic vein, or the vena cava. More than one venous structure can be involved as thrombus propagates (eg, axillary vein extension from a subclavian venous thrombosis). Catheter-related central venous thrombosis is common among patients with hemodialysis catheters.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most thrombi associated with hemodialysis catheters are small and asymptomatic. However, catheter-related venous thrombosis can incite an acute inflammatory reaction, causing symptoms with clinical features of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis, which should prompt a diagnostic evaluation. Symptoms of venous thromboembolism include pain and tenderness overlying the location of the catheter, such as at the base of the neck for a jugular catheter, in the supraclavicular fossa or shoulder area for a subclavian catheter, or in the groin for a femoral catheter.

         Some patients present with an acute onset of upper extremity swelling that can be striking in appearance. Alternatively, edema of the arm and hand may only be present only when the arm is being used vigorously. For some patients, extremity edema is only a subjective symptom, presenting as a feeling of fullness in the fingers or difficulty with finger rings feeling "too tight." In other patients, signs and symptoms of embolization, either to the pulmonary circulation or paradoxically to the systemic arterial bed, may be the first clue; however, embolization in association with hemodialysis catheters is rare [

         In the presence of a central venous catheter, signs and symptoms of acute thrombophlebitis are diagnostic. When there is catheter dysfunction, imaging evaluation (venography performed through the catheter site) yields the diagnosis [

          25
         </a>
         ]. While venography may be more sensitive for demonstrating the presence of a thrombus, duplex ultrasound is noninvasive, inexpensive, generally more readily available, and relatively easily performed, though can be operator dependent. (See

         Based on recommendations for treatment of venous thromboembolism, anticoagulation is the mainstay of treatment for patients with acute catheter-related deep venous thrombosis, provided there are no contraindications [

          26

         ]. Anticoagulation should be continued for a period of at least three months after catheter removal to prevent extension of the thrombus and to allow the thrombus to organize. For those who cannot be anticoagulated, catheter removal alone may be sufficient to resolve symptoms. Specific therapeutic regimens are discussed in detail separately. (See

         When symptomatic venous thrombosis is present (extremity swelling, thromboembolism), the catheter should be removed, if possible. For cases in which potential sites for vascular access are depleted or extremely limited, it may be possible to preserve the catheter. Available clinical practice guidelines (non-hemodialysis catheters) suggest that a catheter that is functioning and for which there is ongoing need does not need to be removed [

         Catheter-related atrial thrombus (CRAT) can lead to late hemodialysis catheter dysfunction. Although a distinction is not made in some reports, two types of CRAT are described: mural thrombus and catheter tip thrombus.

         ) is the most common type of CRAT. Mural thrombus is thought to be caused by mechanical trauma to the atrial wall from catheter tip movement relative to the beating heart [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. Endothelial damage results in activation of the coagulation cascade, platelet aggregation, and thrombus formation at the point of contact. The catheter tip is generally embedded within the thrombus, and when recognized, the diagnosis is generally made during the evaluation of catheter dysfunction.

         <strong>
          Catheter-tip thrombus
         </strong>
         — Catheter tip thrombus is thought to be due to the elongation of intraluminal thrombus or thrombus associated with the side holes of the catheter as a result of the fluid dynamics of the right atrium [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. This proposed etiology is strengthened by the fact that positioning the catheter tip in the right atrium is highly associated with CRAT.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Although well-recognized as a complication of central venous catheters, the true incidence of CRAT is not known. The literature concerning CRAT consists of anecdotal single-case reports, small series reports, and compilations of cases derived from the literature. Reliable epidemiological data are not available [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26,29
         </a>
         ]. In a postmortem study, the incidence of atrial mural thrombus associated with 42 central venous catheters was 29 percent, all of which had been asymptomatic [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. In a study of 50 hemodialysis patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiography, a catheter tip thrombus was seen in nine (18 percent) cases, all of which are asymptomatic [

         The majority of CRAT are small, cause no symptoms, and are recognized only incidentally by either transthoracic or transesophageal ultrasonography. Since it is unusual to perform an imaging study when a dialysis catheter is removed or exchanged, the incidence of CRAT is probably much higher than has been reported. Unless a patient becomes symptomatic, CRAT is generally not suspected. In a report of 213,236 chronic hemodialysis catheter procedures, among the 80 percent that were either catheter exchange or removal, symptoms leading to a diagnosis of pulmonary embolus were documented in only two cases [
         <a href="#rid32">
          32
         </a>
         ]. This study points to the rarity of symptomatic CRAT. Nevertheless, when CRAT does occur, the consequences can be serious, including the possibility of death.
        </p>
        <p>
         A high index of suspicion for CRAT is needed to make the diagnosis. CRAT should be suspected when a hemodialysis patient with a central venous catheter presents with one or more of the following clinical presentations:

         While CRAT does not represent the most common cause of many of these clinical manifestations, it should be included in the differential diagnosis, and the presence of CRAT should be sought during the diagnostic evaluation using echocardiography, which should be considered for early diagnosis to reduce morbidity and mortality. The feature of CRAT that most closely corresponds to a fatal outcome is the presence of more serious symptoms [

         Determination of thrombus size requires imaging. Many of these cases are first detected when echocardiography is performed. For accurate determination of CRAT size, transesophageal echocardiography has better sensitivity and specificity than transthoracic echocardiography. In addition, three-dimensional echocardiography can provide higher resolution of the size, point of attachment, and mobility of the thrombus [

Older publications frequently to do not take into account newer developments in the management of this problem. In addition, the ongoing need for dialysis treatments and the associated comorbidities commonly represented in the dialysis patient exert a unique influence on management. Individualized care is important.

         CDT involves local-regional administration of a thrombolytic agent or physical aspiration of the thrombus, or both. CDT is increasingly used for the treatment of all types of atrial thrombus and for pulmonary embolism. The outcomes achieved by treating these problems suggest that CDT can be used as the initial therapy for the management of intermediate and large diameter CRAT (

          Catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis

         — CDT has been widely used in the treatment of pulmonary embolism, and there are some reports of its use in the treatment of right atrial thrombus not associated with a central venous catheter. Only sporadic cases of CDT to treat CRAT have been reported [

However, judging from the success reported for pulmonary embolism and an increased level of safety associated with this modality, CDT appears to be the preferred approach for the management of CRAT. In one case report, the dimensions of a CRAT decreased from 30 x 16 x 22 mm to 10 x 8 x 5 mm (96 percent reduction) after an 18-hour infusion of low-dose tissue plasminogen activator [

         In most instances when thrombolytic therapy is used, the agent is administered by continuous infusion over a period of hours via a catheter placed fluoroscopically near the thrombus. This approach has several advantages compared with systemic administration. Local intra-thrombus delivery of the thrombolytic agent results in a more rapid permeation of the thrombus, allowing for shorter infusion times and lower incidence of complications [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38,39

          Ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis
         </strong>
         — USAT has been used primarily in the treatment of pulmonary embolism, with some reports of use in the treatment of right atrial thrombus [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41-44
         </a>
         ]. USAT provides the attributes of CDT with addition of an acoustic field generated by an ultrasonic catheter core. The theory behind the device is that ultrasound serves to accelerate the lytic process. By shortening the time required for dissolution of the thrombus, the required dose of thrombolytic agent will also be reduced, lessening the risk of bleeding complications. However, in a study that compared USAT with CDT in the treatment of pulmonary embolism (36 and 27 cases, respectively), no significant differences were reported for clinical or hemodynamic outcomes, procedural complication rates, or total dose of thrombolytic agent, even though the duration of the treatment in the CDT group was significantly longer compared with the USAT group [

          46-48

         ]. To perform suction thrombectomy, percutaneous venous access via the common femoral vein is first obtained. Then, a specialized large bore catheter (eg, AngioVac with a 26 Fr sheath) is introduced into the atrium that uses mechanical suction to aspirate the thrombus. Although there are no reports using this modality specifically for the treatment of CRAT, treatment of other types of right atrial thrombus have reported a high level of success with relative freedom from complications, suggesting that it may be applicable in the treatment of CRAT [

         In published reports, anticoagulation is used to manage CRAT larger than 2 cm in diameter in patients who will not undergo intervention to remove thrombus, or for those with residual thrombus after intervention (

          52,53

         For some patients, anticoagulation may be contraindicated. Some patients have absolute contraindications to anticoagulation, but for others, the contraindication is relative [

Because of these issues, chronic anticoagulation must be individualized with careful attention to benefit versus risks. Strategies used to minimize the risk of bleeding associated with the use of anticoagulants in hemodialysis patients include minimizing heparin use with dialysis, use of citrate locks for catheters, and tight blood pressure control. If clinically reasonable, concurrent antithrombotic agents such as antiplatelet agents and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents should be discontinued, and prophylaxis for gastrointestinal bleeding should be prescribed [

         ), direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), factor Xa inhibitors, and direct thrombin inhibitors. Among these, the agent most widely used in hemodialysis patients with CRAT has been warfarin. Although warfarin has demonstrated benefits, it has a narrow therapeutic window and requires frequent monitoring in the dialysis patient. Maintaining an optimal international normalized ratio in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is challenging [
         <a href="#rid63">

         Systemic thrombolysis involves peripheral administration of an initial loading dose of the thrombolytic agent followed by continuous infusion over a period of hours.

         <a href="#rid76">
          76
         </a>

         Comparing the various treatment options that have been used to treat CRAT is difficult. No systematic studies based upon a standardized protocol have been conducted. All reports have been affected by many variables that have influenced the management strategy used. Moreover, hemodialysis patients represent a heterogeneous group with variable comorbidities. In the presence of so many confounding variables, compiling cases from multiple published reports can give misleading results. Nevertheless, comparisons have been made. The most common approach for comparing modalities for the treatment of CRAT is to examine mortality rates in symptomatic cases.

         The two types of CRAT, mural thrombus and catheter tip thrombus, can generally be managed in a similar fashion with only a few differences. Detailed imaging is required to determine the type, size, and points of thrombus attachment. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical features and diagnosis'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The treatment strategy selected for the treatment of CRAT should be individualized, taking into consideration the patient's comorbidities, the urgency of the situation, and the available clinical expertise (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef129054" href="/z/d/graphic/129054.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). In the absence of a body of high-quality clinical evidence to guide management, recommendations for treatment are necessarily opinion-based, much of which have been the product of experience dealing with pulmonary embolism and right atrial thrombus that are not catheter related. This experience, along with reported cases involving CRAT, suggests that a catheter-directed approach is effective and associated with a low risk of complications. The lower risk is related to the agent used and method of administration, which reduce the overall duration of time required for thrombus resolution. As such, for patients without indications for surgery, we suggest CDT rather than anticoagulation alone or systemic thrombolysis.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, since the presence of the catheter is integral to the pathogenesis of CRAT, catheter removal is important in management. The timing of catheter removal is determined by thrombus diameter and type of thrombus. Failure to remove the catheter is associated with CRAT recurrence and mortality, due to either pulmonary embolism or septic complications [
         <a href="#rid76">
          76,83,84
         </a>
         ]. If the patient continues to require a catheter, a new catheter can be inserted, but the tip should be positioned in a different location, either the superior vena cava or inferior vena cava. If the patient is a suitable candidate, the placement of an early cannulation graft [
         <a href="#rid85">
          85-87

Patients in whom anticoagulation, systemic thrombolysis, and surgery are all contraindicated should be monitored; patients who fall into this category would be expected to have a limited longevity, potentially receiving palliative dialysis. Treatment failures following CDT can be managed with either anticoagulation or surgery according to the clinical situation and clinical judgment.

         For mural thrombus, the catheter can be removed as CDT is initiated since the thrombus is attached to the atrial wall and the risk of embolization is low. After resolution of thrombus, follow-up imaging to rule out recurrence should be obtained 7 to 10 days after completion of treatment for mural thrombus. Since the cause of the thrombus (the catheter) is no longer present and in view of the associated risk, chronic anticoagulation is not necessary unless indicated for another condition.

As it develops, it eventually covers the inlet and outlet holes of a catheter, interfering with the blood flow, leading to ineffective dialysis. This problem generally occurs weeks or months after catheter placement, but it has been observed as early as 48 hours after catheter placement.

         All central venous catheters likely become encased in a layer of fibrin within a few days of insertion. It starts as early as 24 hours after insertion of the catheter [

         When the vein is cannulated, the endothelium is injured, and a thrombus forms around the catheter at the insertion site. This becomes organized and is eventually converted to fibroepithelial tissue. The term "fibrin sheath" refers to a sleeve that surrounds the intravenous portion of the catheter. Animal studies have suggested that this sheath is actually not composed entirely of fibrin [
         <a href="#rid89">
          89-91
         </a>
         ]. Fibrin continues to be deposited at the leading edge of this tissue and consequently becomes organized. In this manner, a sleeve migrates down the catheter to form a sheath composed of thrombus, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and collagen, forming a layer about 1 mm thick around the outside of the catheter.

         The fibrin sheath is only loosely attached to the catheter. When a catheter is removed, angiography performed through the partially retracted catheter can demonstrate a "wind sock" of residual fibrin sleeve. The reported incidence for fibrin sheath has ranged from 13 to 76 percent [

         Although not considered part of the fibrin sheath, the fibroepithelial sleeve surrounding the catheter begins peripherally at the catheter exit site, continues through the subcutaneous tunnel, and is continuous with the intravenous portion of the catheter.

        <p>
         It remains unknown whether a fibrin sheath can lead to or contribute to the formation of a stenotic lesion within the vein. Histology studies of human autopsy material of long-term catheters have shown the development of vein wall thickening and bridges from the vein wall to the fibrin sheath covering the catheter [
         <a href="#rid95">
          95

         Catheter dysfunction is common and can have serious consequences if not addressed in a timely fashion. Once recognized, intrinsic catheter dysfunction should be addressed immediately; delayed treatment results in inadequate dialysis and excessive catheter manipulation, which can lead to catheter-related bacteremia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since intrinsic catheter dysfunction is usually first recognized in the dialysis clinic, successful management allows the patient to continue receiving their scheduled dialysis treatment, which has great value. Management should be initiated using "bedside maneuvers," which includes repositioning the patient (placing in a Trendelenburg position) or using a "forceful

         If bedside maneuvers are unsuccessful, reversing the catheter lumens may allow for completion of the hemodialysis treatment. Intraluminal lytic enzyme has the potential for providing a more prolonged benefit if the problem is related to an intrinsic catheter thrombosis. If the problem cannot be successfully resolved within the dialysis facility or if the treatment applied does not have an effect of sufficient duration, then the case should be referred to a vascular specialist for diagnostic imaging and possible intervention [

The force that can be generated with a syringe is inversely proportional to the diameter of the syringe (or more precisely related to the ratio of the diameter of the plunger to the syringe outlet opening). Thus, a small (but not too small) syringe should be used, and it should include a Luer lock to prevent detachment during the procedure.

         Each dialysis clinic should have a protocol in place for the use of a lytic agent to manage intrinsic thrombus. Such therapy can be accomplished with minimal disruption to the patient's dialysis schedule. The question arises as to how many times intraluminal lytic therapy should be used before the patient is referred for a catheter exchange. The critical points are the patient's need for dialysis on a timely basis and the risks of excessive catheter manipulation. A catheter that is not able to provide the blood flow necessary for adequate dialysis according to the patient's prescription must not be tolerated. All catheter flow problems must be resolved in a timely fashion, and the emphasis for managing catheter dysfunction should shift to intervention at a relatively early stage of dysfunction.

Failure to achieve blood flow after a second dose occurred in more patients for urokinase compared with alteplase (7 versus 1 patient), but the difference was not significant.

         The results obtained with continuous infusion of lytic therapy are no better than those obtained with intermittent intraluminal enzyme instillation.

         If intrinsic thrombus cannot be successfully resolved within the dialysis facility or if the treatment applied does not have an effect of sufficient duration, the patient should be referred to a vascular specialist for diagnostic evaluation. Appropriate treatment should then be based upon the findings of this evaluation. Treatment of extrinsic thrombus is discussed above.

Sheaths were present in 33 (70 percent) of the 47 patients. In 18 patients who were randomly assigned to disruption, the median time to repeat dysfunction was 373 days, compared with 97.5 days in patients who did not undergo disruption (p = 0.22), and the median time to repeat catheter exchange was 411 and 198 days, respectively (p = 0.17). Fourteen patients had no sheaths, and their median times to repeat dysfunction and repeat exchange were 849 and 879 days, respectively [

         Fibrin sheath disruption can be accomplished by using several different devices; however, the most frequently used technique involves the use of an angioplasty balloon [

          103-105

         ]. The size of the balloon used has varied from 8 to 12 mm in diameter. By using an angioplasty balloon, it is possible to not only disrupt the fibrin sheath but also dilate any associated venous stenosis.

        <p>
         When the fibrin sheath is left behind, even if disrupted, the question as to what becomes of this material once the catheter is removed has been raised. In an early study that involved catheters that have been in place for a relatively short period of time (mean of 27 days, range of 3 to 111 days), it was found that while the fibrin sheath was adherent to the vessel wall in most cases, in a few cases it was observed to embolize [
         <a href="#rid106">
          106
         </a>
         ]. In 3 of 60 cases, the patients were symptomatic, and lung scans confirmed the occurrence of a pulmonary embolus. In another series of 25 cases [

          94
         </a>
         ] in which the temporary dialysis catheter had also been in place for only a short period (mean of 29 days, range of 12 to 48 days), fibrin sheath embolization did not occur in any patient. The material remained adherent to the vein at the catheter insertion site.

          Monitoring and indications of dysfunction

         – Routine monitoring of parameters suggesting the presence of dysfunction should be performed for all patients who are dialyzing with a central venous catheter. Catheter dysfunction leading to inadequate dialysis has been defined based solely upon blood flow measurement, but trends and other factors are important for determining the adequacy of hemodialysis.

          Catheter-related atrial thrombus
         </strong>
         – Catheter-related atrial thrombus (CRAT) includes mural thrombus and catheter tip thrombus, both of which can lead to late hemodialysis catheter dysfunction. Most CRAT do not cause symptoms and are diagnosed incidentally on cardiac imaging studies. CRAT requires a high index of suspicion and should be considered in hemodialysis patients with cardiac problems (eg, tricuspid regurgitation, right heart failure, cardiac arrest, embolism [pulmonary, systemic], unknown source of infection). CRAT is generally managed according to thrombus size and location individualized according to patient's comorbidities, the urgency of the situation, and the available clinical expertise (

         For large thrombus &gt;6 cm, surgery may be indicated for symptomatic patients or those with other contributing indications but is individualized based on the clinical situation. For the patient who is clinically stable without signs and symptoms of cardiac dysfunction, CDT can be attempted first. For those who undergo surgery, the catheter is removed along with the thrombus.

          Intrinsic catheter dysfunction
         </strong>
         – Intrinsic catheter dysfunction (intraluminal thrombus, catheter tip thrombus, fibrin sheath) is a major cause of catheter loss and should be addressed when identified. Initial management includes using "bedside maneuvers," such as repositioning the patient (placing in a Trendelenburg position), using a "forceful

         flush," or instillation or intraluminal instillation of lytic enzymes. (See

         flushes and intraluminal lytic enzyme instillation if flushing is not effective. Intraluminal tissue plasminogen activator (tPA; 1 to 2 mg) is effective in many patients but provides only a short-term benefit, and more definitive therapy should be sought when this measure is employed. Infusion of urokinase or tPA is more difficult and expensive. (See
