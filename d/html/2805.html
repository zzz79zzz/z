As many as 80 percent of patients with solid tumors will develop painful bone metastases to the spine, pelvis, and extremities during the course of their illness [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>The goals of palliative treatment of bone metastases are pain relief, preservation of function, and maintenance of skeletal integrity. When bone pain is limited to a single or limited number of sites, local field external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to the painful sites can provide pain relief in approximately 60 to 85 percent of cases, with complete pain response reported in 15 to 58 percent [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. If symptomatic lesions are widespread, radiopharmaceuticals or hemibody radiation may provide useful palliative alternatives. Although treatment can be effective for patients with mild, moderate, or severe pain, early intervention may be useful in maintaining quality of life and minimizing the side effects of analgesic medications [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>The use of RT for palliation of painful bone metastases will be reviewed here. Overviews of the clinical presentation and diagnosis of bone metastases and of the treatment approaches for bone metastases are presented separately, as are other aspects of cancer pain management, including the management of patients with epidural spinal cord compression, the use of image-guided thermal ablation for patients with pain from bone metastases that persists or recurs after RT, and management of patients with pathologic or impending pathologic fractures, including the role of kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty for patients with pathologic vertebral fractures. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91912.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of bone metastasis in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/115410.html" rel="external">"Overview of therapeutic approaches for adult patients with bone metastasis from solid tumors"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2792.html" rel="external">"Cancer pain management: General principles and risk management for patients receiving opioids"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2820.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prognosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83808.html" rel="external">"Image-guided ablation of skeletal metastases"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83811.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and evaluation of complete and impending pathologic fractures in patients with metastatic bone disease, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/132146.html" rel="external">"Management of complete and impending pathologic fractures in patients with metastatic bone disease, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1650404200"><span class="h1">SUPPORTIVE CARE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For all patients with painful bone metastases, supportive care should include adequate analgesia and the use of osteoclast inhibitors to enhance analgesia and to reduce the risk of skeletal-related events (including the need for radiation or surgery to bone, pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia of malignancy).</p><p>Opioid therapy is the first-line approach for moderate or severe pain in populations with active cancer, including those with symptomatic bone metastases. Patients with multifocal bone pain usually are managed with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID), unless they have a specific contraindication to use of these agents, in conjunction with an opioid and usually with an adjuvant analgesic (ie, osteoclast inhibitors, glucocorticoids) used specifically for bone pain. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2814.html" rel="external">"Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2815.html" rel="external">"Cancer pain management: Role of adjuvant analgesics (coanalgesics)", section on 'Patients with bone pain'</a>.)</p><p>Osteoclast inhibitors (including bisphosphonates and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="15575" href="/z/d/drug information/15575.html" rel="external">denosumab</a>) are indicated for the management of metastatic bone disease for most patients with solid tumors. Osteoclast inhibitors slow or reverse the progression of skeletal metastases and reduce the likelihood of skeletal-related events. In addition, they also have some analgesic benefit, although it is modest.</p><p>The vast majority of the data regarding the benefits of osteoclast inhibitors for prostate cancer were generated in the castration-resistant state; hence, for males with bone metastases from prostate cancer, the use of osteoclast inhibitors is generally restricted to those with castration-resistant disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/17128.html" rel="external">"Bone metastases in advanced prostate cancer: Management", section on 'Castration-resistant disease'</a>.)</p><p>For patients in whom skeletal-related events are unlikely (eg, those with minimal bone tumor burden) and for those with a limited expected survival (eg, in the setting of widespread and progressive visceral metastases), treatment with osteoclast inhibitors should be considered on a case-by-case basis. This subject, as well as other adjuvant analgesics, is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2801.html" rel="external">"Osteoclast inhibitors for patients with bone metastases from breast, prostate, and other solid tumors"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2815.html" rel="external">"Cancer pain management: Role of adjuvant analgesics (coanalgesics)", section on 'Patients with bone pain'</a>.)</p><p>Finally, prophylactic antiemetics are very useful when treating metastases in the lumbar spine or pelvic bones when the radiation field includes the stomach or intestines.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1828169137"><span class="h1">PATIENTS WITH A SINGLE OR LIMITED NUMBER OF PAINFUL BONE METASTASES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h2">External beam radiation therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with multiple painful bone metastases or oligometastatic disease with an estimated survival of less than six months, we recommend external beam RT (EBRT). RT is effective in partially or completely relieving pain in a majority of patients with bone metastases, although a transient worsening of pain may occur in some patients [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. This typically occurs in the first few days after RT, and the pain generally lasts one to two days.</p><p>The role of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for painful bone metastases is evolving, and SBRT may be preferred over EBRT in specific settings:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>One setting in which SBRT may be preferred over EBRT is in the definitive treatment of patients with symptomatic bone metastases from relatively radioresistant neoplasms (eg, renal cell cancer, melanoma, sarcoma), especially in the setting of vertebral metastases with epidural extension but no high-grade epidural spinal cord compression. This subject is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2820.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prognosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression", section on 'Stereotactic body radiotherapy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Another setting in which SBRT may be considered is in patients with oligometastatic bone metastases (1 to 5 metastases), who have an estimated survival of greater than six months and for whom SBRT can be safely delivered. Nomograms to assist in estimating survival in patients with metastatic cancer referred for RT for bone metastases are available [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Stereotactic radiation therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1325549791"><span class="h3">Single-dose versus fractionated treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most patients with uncomplicated painful bone metastases (ie, without a substantial soft tissue component or fracture/impending fracture), we suggest using a single fraction of 8 Gy to the involved area. This approach provides equal palliation with improved patient convenience and cost-effectiveness compared with fractionated schedules, although retreatment is needed more frequently. For patients with a relatively long life expectancy (such as six months or more), a fractionated regimen (such as 30 Gy in 10 fractions or 20 Gy in five fractions) is a reasonable alternative because of the reduced need for retreatment.</p><p>This recommendation is in keeping with evidence-based guidelines from the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), which support single-fraction EBRT at a dose of 8 Gy to provide palliation for relief of pain from bone metastases [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. This approach is more convenient and cost-effective compared with fractionated schedules, and there is no evidence that the use of a single-fraction regimen is associated with an increase in acute or late toxicity. However, retreatment is necessary in a higher number of those initially treated with a single fraction compared with those initially managed with a fractionated regimen (approximately 20 versus 8 percent).</p><p>The similar effectiveness of a single fraction of 8 Gy compared with longer fractionated courses has been shown in multiple large randomized trials [<a href="#rid7">7-10</a>] and several meta-analyses [<a href="#rid11">11-14</a>], all of which concluded that single-fraction RT results in similar rates of pain control and treatment-related toxicity compared with multiple-fraction RT, but a higher rate of retreatment. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a Dutch multicenter trial, 1171 patients with painful bone metastases were randomly assigned to 8 Gy in a single dose or to 24 Gy in six fractions [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. The palliative benefit was similar in both groups (overall pain relief in 72 and 69 percent of patients, respectively), as were the time to response (median three weeks in both groups) and the rates of treatment-related toxicity. However, retreatment was required by significantly more patients treated with a single fraction (25 versus 7 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trial 9714, 949 patients with prostate or breast cancer and painful bone metastases were randomly assigned to 8 Gy in a single fraction or to 30 Gy in 10 fractions [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Patients with evidence of cauda equina syndrome or epidural spinal cord compression were excluded. There were no significant differences in the rates for complete and partial pain relief (overall 66 percent in each group), the use of narcotics, or the incidence of subsequent pathologic fractures. However, patients treated with a single fraction were twice as likely to require retreatment (18 versus 9 percent).</p><p></p><p>Despite these data, a year 2015 assessment of national practice suggests marked underutilization of single-fraction treatment approaches [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H434025621"><span class="h3">Dose of single-fraction radiation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A single 8 Gy dose of RT is more effective than lower doses at providing pain relief [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>In a representative multicenter trial, 651 patients with painful bone metastases were randomly assigned to treatment with either 8 or 4 Gy as a single dose [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. The main tumor types represented in the trial were breast, lung, and prostate cancer (35, 35, and 17 percent, respectively). The overall response rate was higher at 4, 8, and 52 weeks with the 8 Gy dose of radiation (83 versus 71, 91 versus 83, and 93 versus 82 percent, respectively). The retreatment rate was significantly lower in those given 8 Gy (14 versus 22 percent).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3642747151"><span class="h3">Time course of relief and incidence of pain flare</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The majority of patients receiving a single fraction of EBRT for a painful bone metastasis derive pain relief, and relief is often rapid. This was shown in an analysis of data from the National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) symptom control trial SC.23, which examined the benefit of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a> to prevent pain flare in patients receiving EBRT [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. A total of 122 out of 298 patients (41 percent) had a beneficial response by day 10, while an additional 116 patients (39 percent) responded by day 42. These data provide support for the view that a single dose of RT should be offered to all patients with painful bone metastases, even those with poor expected survival.</p><p>A transient worsening of pain ("pain flare") occurs in approximately 30 to 40 percent of patients undergoing RT for a painful bone metastasis [<a href="#rid4">4,19</a>]. This typically occurs in the first few days after RT, and the flare in pain generally lasts one to two days.</p><p>Treatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a> may reduce the frequency or severity of pain flare, although the data are somewhat contradictory:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a double-blind trial, in which 298 patients with painful bone metastases were randomly assigned to either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a> (8 mg daily for five days beginning one hour before a single dose of 8 Gy radiation) or placebo, the incidence of pain flare was decreased with dexamethasone compared with placebo (26 versus 35 percent, p = 0.05) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Similarly, benefit was suggested in a trial of 120 patients with symptomatic vertebral metastases treated with 30 Gy in three fractions; those randomly assigned to a single dose of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9639" href="/z/d/drug information/9639.html" rel="external">methylprednisolone</a> prior to treatment had a lower incidence of pain flare (6.6 versus 20 percent in the placebo group, relative risk reduction 72 percent) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>On the other hand, a Dutch trial that randomized 295 patients with painful bone metastases from a solid tumor to multiday <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a> (8 mg before RT, followed by three daily doses), single-dose dexamethasone (8 mg dexamethasone followed by three days of placebo), or placebo daily for four days, the pain flare incidence was 38, 27, and 39 percent for the three groups, respectively [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Although the incidence of pain flare was not significantly different, patients receiving four days of dexamethasone reported lower mean pain scores on days 2 through 5 than did those receiving a single daily dose of dexamethasone or placebo.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A systematic review of four clinical trials (including two of the three described above) and one prospective cohort study concluded that a short course of a glucocorticoid (eg, oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9334" href="/z/d/drug information/9334.html" rel="external">dexamethasone</a> 8 mg once daily from day 1 through day 5) was effective in preventing pain flare during radiation therapy for bone metastases [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. The overall incidence of pain flare was significantly less in the prophylaxis group (21 versus 37 percent, 43 percent relative risk reduction). When the analysis was limited to the two placebo-controlled phase III trials [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>], the risk for pain flare was 21 versus 31 percent (relative risk 0.67, 95% CI 0.48-0.93).</p><p></p><p>While the administration of a short course of glucocorticoids may decrease flare, this benefit must be carefully weighed against the risks of toxicity (hyperglycemia, gastrointestinal irritation, and insomnia). We do prescribe glucocorticoids to patients with epidural spinal cord compression. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2820.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prognosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression", section on 'Glucocorticoids'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1359926420"><span class="h3">Need for surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surgical fixation may be indicated prior to EBRT to decrease pain and facilitate rehabilitation in symptomatic bone metastases causing a pathologic fracture involving the long bones or other weight-bearing bones. In other cases, prophylactic fixation to prevent pathologic fractures, or surgical stabilization of an unstable spine may be recommended prior to EBRT for an impending fracture.</p><p>Mirels scoring system was developed to address the void in objective criteria for predicting fracture risk in the setting of metastatic disease to long bones, and it is outlined in the table and discussed in more detail separately  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90456" href="/z/d/graphic/90456.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. In general, we request orthopedic consultation for patients with long bone metastases and a Mirels score of 8 or higher. A separate assessment, the Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS), has been developed for vertebral metastases  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef80396" href="/z/d/graphic/80396.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).

(See <a class="local">'Time course of relief and incidence of pain flare'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Indications for SBRT</strong> – In our view, stereotactic body RT (SBRT) should be reserved mostly for patients who have persistent or recurrent bone pain after a standard course of EBRT. This view is in keeping with evidence-based guidelines on palliative RT for bone metastases from the American Society for Radiation Oncology.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">One setting in which SBRT may be preferred over EBRT is in the definitive treatment of patients with symptomatic bone metastases from relatively radioresistant neoplasms (eg, renal cell cancer, melanoma, sarcoma), especially in the setting of vertebral metastases with epidural extension but no high-grade epidural spinal cord compression. For patients with oligometastatic bone disease, a controlled primary site, and a long estimated life expectancy, SBRT is also a reasonable approach. (See <a class="local">'Stereotactic radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Need for surgery</strong> – Surgical consultation for fixation should be obtained prior to the institution of RT for high-risk bone metastases involving the long bones or other weight-bearing bones to treat or prevent a pathologic fracture. In general, we request orthopedic consultation for patients with a Mirels score of 8 or higher  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90456" href="/z/d/graphic/90456.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Need for surgery'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/132146.html" rel="external">"Management of complete and impending pathologic fractures in patients with metastatic bone disease, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma", section on 'Management principles'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Persistent or recurrent pain</strong> – Options for patients who have persistent or recurrent bone pain following treatment with EBRT include repeat irradiation with fractionated treatment (especially if single-fraction EBRT was initially used), SBRT, image-guided local thermal ablation, kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty for vertebral compression fractures, or radiopharmaceuticals. (See <a class="local">'Treatment of recurrent or persistent pain'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Reirradiation may be indicated if there is an incomplete response to initial treatment or if severe pain recurs and the patient's overall condition permits. Clinical trials data suggest that acceptable regimens include a single fraction of 8 Gy or a brief fractionated regimen of 20 Gy, although the latter can be associated with higher acute toxicity. For selected patients with a good performance status and recurrence in the spine, SBRT is another option, where available. (See <a class="local">'Stereotactic radiation therapy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Safety and efficacy of reirradiation'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diffuse bone metastases</strong> – Some patients with multiple bone metastases have diffuse pain that is not easily managed by focal radiation. There are two options in such circumstances: systemic administration of a bone-targeted radioisotope, and hemibody irradiation. (See <a class="local">'Patients with diffuse bone pain'</a> above.)</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li><a class="nounderline abstract_t">Nielsen OS.
