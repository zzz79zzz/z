Although not yet approved for clinical use in the United States, branched and fenestrated endovascular aortic devices have been developed to allow perfusion into specific aortic branches depending upon the level of repair (eg, renal artery, internal iliac artery). These advanced devices allow endovascular management of juxtarenal and potentially suprarenal aneurysms, and preservation of hypogastric flow when an adequate landing zone in the common iliac artery is not present.</p><p>The placement of aortic endovascular grafts is associated with device-related complications, which can include component separation, stent-graft buckling, and migration over time. Secondary intervention is frequently needed [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. Although the long-term outcomes of the later-generation devices are favorable, lifelong surveillance is required to monitor for delayed graft-related adverse events.</p><p>The specific devices available for endovascular repair of the abdominal aorta will be reviewed here. The indications for, placement of, and complications of these devices are discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15203.html" rel="external">"Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16918.html" rel="external">"Complications of endovascular abdominal aortic repair"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1191837832"><span class="h1">AORTIC ANATOMY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The aorta is the major arterial conduit conveying blood from the heart to the systemic circulation. It originates immediately beyond the aortic valve ascending initially, then curving to form the aortic arch, and finally descending caudally adjacent to the spine. The descending thoracic aorta continues through the hiatus of the diaphragm to become the abdominal aorta, which extends into the retroperitoneum to its bifurcation into the common iliac arteries at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra. The abdominal aorta lies slightly left of the midline to accommodate the inferior vena cava, which is in close apposition. The branches of the abdominal aorta (superior to inferior) (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51087" href="/z/d/graphic/51087.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) include the left and right inferior phrenic arteries, left and right middle suprarenal arteries, the celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery, left and right renal arteries in addition to occasional accessory renal arteries, left and right gonadal arteries, inferior mesenteric artery, the paired lumbar arteries (L1-L4), and middle sacral artery. The abdominal aorta bifurcates into the left and right common iliac arteries, which most often arise at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra. The common iliac artery bifurcates into the external iliac and internal iliac arteries at the pelvic inlet. The internal iliac artery has superior and inferior divisions that supply the pelvic viscera and muscles. The external iliac artery passes beneath the inguinal ligament to become the common femoral artery [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1191837912"><span class="h1">BASIC PRINCIPLES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Endovascular aneurysm repair refers to the insertion of endovascular graft components (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50772" href="/z/d/graphic/50772.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>), usually via a femoral approach. The endovascular graft is constructed by the in vivo delivery and deployment of the device components in an established order determined by the specific anatomy of the patient. Upon deployment, the endograft expands, contacting the aortic wall proximally and the iliac vessels distally, excluding the aneurysmal aortic sac from blood flow and pressure.</p><p>Although there are significant variations in endovascular graft design, three types of components are common to all: a delivery system, main body device, and device (limb) extensions.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H620227127"><span class="h2">Delivery system</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The various endograft components are typically delivered through the femoral artery, either by direct surgical cut-down or percutaneously. If the femoral artery is too small to accommodate the delivery system, access can be obtained by suturing a synthetic graft of appropriate diameter (often 10 mm) to the common iliac artery to create an iliac conduit through a retroperitoneal incision. The size of the delivery system varies depending upon the device diameter required to provide proper endograft fixation. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H620227120"><span class="h2">Main device</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The main body device for the abdominal aorta is usually bifurcated. Endovascular grafts rely primarily upon outward radial force in the proximal graft to maintain the positioning of the graft. Fixation systems may also include barbs or a suprarenal uncovered extension. Bifurcated abdominal aortic grafts require adjunctive placement of iliac artery limbs to complete the graft and seal. The iliac limbs on the main body device vary in length depending upon whether the graft is a two- or three-component graft. Two-component grafts have one short and one long iliac limb. Three-component devices have one short limb and one limb of variable length. </p><p>Endovascular grafts for the abdominal aorta are generally bifurcated; however, some situations require the use of a unibody (ie, not bifurcated) graft, also known as an aorta-uni-iliac (AUI) device. These grafts are used in patients with severe unilateral iliac artery stenosis or occlusion. AUI devices can also be used for the treatment of some ruptured aneurysms. A bifurcated-to-unilateral graft conversion kit can be used in the situation when contralateral iliac artery access or contralateral gate cannulation is difficult or impossible. This kit effectively turns a bifurcated main body graft into a unilateral graft by covering or occluding one of the iliac limbs proximally. After deployment of an AUI device, a plug may be inserted into the contralateral iliac artery to prevent retrograde flow of blood into the aneurysm sac, if needed. The contralateral extremity typically requires a femoro-femoral crossover bypass for perfusion. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15203.html" rel="external">"Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm", section on 'Choice of graft'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15203.html" rel="external">"Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm", section on 'Endograft placement'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H620227113"><span class="h2">Extensions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>One or more extension devices may be needed to provide a complete proximal or distal seal. Following the deployment of the main device and any necessary contralateral limbs or extensions, an aortogram is performed to assure that the endograft has completely excluded the aneurysm from the circulation. The term "endoleak" was coined to describe the persistence of blood flow into the aneurysm. If additional ballooning of the device does not firmly appose the graft to the aortic wall and eliminate a type I endoleak, placement of additional proximal aortic or iliac extensions may be needed. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1191828485"><span class="h1">ABDOMINAL DEVICES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The use of abdominal endovascular devices has become the first-line approach to manage many aortic pathologies. The main indication for these devices in the abdominal aorta is treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Endovascular repair of the abdominal aorta has also been used to treat isolated infrarenal aortic dissection, traumatic aortic injuries, and aortic atheroembolism [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. Endovascular grafts for the abdominal aorta are generally modular, bifurcated devices; however, an aorta-uni-iliac (AUI) device or bifurcated-to-unilateral graft conversion kit may be needed. (See <a class="local">'Main device'</a> above.)</p><p>Controlled comparisons of abdominal aortic stent-grafts have not been performed. Devices available to treat the abdominal aorta include the AFX2, Alto, Aorfix, Endurant, Excluder, Incraft, Treovance, and Zenith grafts (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67461" href="/z/d/graphic/67461.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Several investigational devices are in early clinical testing phases. The essential features of the grafts approved for use in the United States and clinical data supporting them are discussed below. The features of these grafts are summarized in the table (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67461" href="/z/d/graphic/67461.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Withdrawn/investigational devices'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1191829346"><span class="h2">AFX2</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The AFX endovascular graft was initially approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011, and over time, the manufacturer changed to the device based on the higher incidence of type III endoleak seen with the early versions. The AFX2 next-generation system replaced the original AFX graft in 2016. </p><p>The AFX2 system (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67461" href="/z/d/graphic/67461.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) is a modular bifurcated graft composed of ePTFE supported by a self-expanding internal cobalt-chromium alloy skeleton. The main body of the endograft has symmetric iliac limbs. The proximal graft has a bare stent for active fixation, and the bifurcation of the graft rests on the aortic bifurcation for anatomic distal fixation. </p><p>The main device is available in diameters ranging from 22 to 28 mm in lengths ranging from 6 to 10 cm with limbs measuring 13 or 16 mm in diameter and lengths from 3 to 5.5 cm [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The limb extensions range from 16 to 20 mm in diameter in lengths from 5.5 to 8.8 cm. The main device is delivered in a 21-French (7 mm) sheath, and the contralateral limb is delivered through a 17- or 19-French (5.67, 6.33 mm) sheath.</p><p>The FDA has evaluated information that suggests a higher-than-expected risk of type III endoleaks occurring with the AFX endovascular grafts with Duraply graft material (ie, AFX with Duraply or AFX2). The FDA recommends that health care providers consider using available alternative treatment options for AAA patients rather than using the AFX2 device [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. In December 2022, the FDA issued an updated safety communication that included information about new labeling and a required postmarket study for the AFX2 Endovascular AAA System to better inform patients and health care providers of the risk of Type III endoleaks [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. In addition, the FDA emphasized the importance of at least yearly, lifelong follow-up with a health care provider for all patients who had their AAA treated with any AFX endovascular graft to monitor for Type III endoleaks. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1377583392"><span class="h2">Alto</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Alto stent-graft system is based on the Ovation iX graft, which was recalled, as their next-generation polymer-based abdominal stent-graft system. It was approved for use in the United States in March 2020. </p><p>The Alto stent-graft system requires an aortic landing zone for the sealing ring 7 mm below the inferior renal artery, and an inner wall diameter of ≥16 mm and ≤30 mm. The required distal iliac landing zone is at least 10 mm in length, with an inner wall diameter of ≥8 mm and ≤25 mm. Some of the primary modifications to the Ovation iX graft include locating the sealing ring 7 mm below the renal arteries, inclusion of webbing between the aortic body legs at the bifurcation, and incorporation of an integrated balloon into the delivery system. </p><p>The ELEVATE (Expanding Patient Applicability with Polymer Sealing Ovation Alto Stent Graft) investigational device exemption clinical study completed the enrollment of 75 patients in 2018. On follow-up, 95 percent of patients (58 out of 61) did not have device- or aneurysm-related complication at the one-year follow-up. The trial aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the Alto graft in patients with AAA at 12 months. A prospective multicenter multinational postapproval study will collect confirmatory safety and effectiveness data with a five-year follow-up. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H632285723"><span class="h2">Aorfix</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Aorfix AAA endograft is a bifurcated woven polyester graft supported by a nitinol skeleton. Active fixation is provided by proximal nitinol hooks. The graft is intended to treat angulated aortic necks for up to 90 degrees and tortuous iliac anatomy. The proximal portion of the main graft body is fish-mouthed (rather than circular) in shape, and when positioned properly, the surface area of the potentially achievable seal-zone is increased in the anterior-to-posterior dimension. Because of this feature, the distance from the superior mesenteric artery to the lowest renal artery needs to be at least 15 mm in length to prevent inadvertent coverage of the superior mesenteric artery orifice during graft deployment. The Aorfix graft was approved for clinical use and available in Europe and later approved for use in the US, supported by data from the PYTHAGORAS trial. Short-term and mid-term data from European trials have confirmed the safety of the device and its suitability for treating hostile aorto-iliac anatomy [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The five-year outcomes of the PYTHAGORAS trial reported on 218 patients, 151 of whom were categorized in the highly angulated neck group. There were no reported type I or III endoleak. Freedom from aneurysm-related mortality was 96 percent; freedom of aneurysm-related rupture was 99 percent; and freedom of device-related secondary intervention was 83 percent. The PYTHAGORAS trial of the High Angle Aorfix Bifurcated Stent Graft was completed in July 2020 [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1191829362"><span class="h2">Endurant</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Endurant endograft (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67461" href="/z/d/graphic/67461.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) is a modular, bifurcated device composed of a multifilament polyester fabric with an external self-expanding support structure of M-shaped electro-polished nitinol stents. Proximally, it has a suprarenal nitinol stent with anchoring pins for suprarenal fixation. The graft design is intended to treat aneurysms with more challenging anatomy (eg, neck angulation).</p><p>The main device is available in diameters that range from 23 to 36 mm for the main body and 13 to 20 mm for the ipsilateral limb and in lengths of 12.4, 14.5 and 16.6 cm [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The contralateral iliac stent component ranges from 10 to 28 mm in diameter with 8.2-, 9.3-, and 12.4-cm lengths. The internal diameter of the delivery sheath for the bifurcated grafts is 18 or 20 French (6.0, 6.67 mm), and the sheaths for other components range from 14 to 16 French (4.67 to 5.33 mm). </p><p>A single-arm, multicenter trial evaluating the safety and performance of the Endurant graft was conducted at 26 sites in the United States and enrolled 150 patients between April 2008 and May 2009 [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The technical success rate was 99.3 percent. One failure was due to inability to cannulate the contralateral gate, and one patient ruptured during the procedure but was still treated successfully. The perioperative mortality (30-day) rate was zero, and the incidence of major adverse events was 4 percent. At one-year follow-up there were no migrations, ruptures, open conversions, or graft-related endoleaks (type I or III). Ten aneurysm-related reinterventions were performed during the first year of follow-up, mostly for graft limb thrombosis or stenosis (five) or type II endoleak (two). Aneurysm sac diameter decreased &gt;5 mm at one year in 47 percent of patients and remained stable in 53 percent. No instances of sac growth were reported. Late deaths occurred in 4.7 percent of patients but were not related to the aneurysm repair. The ENGAGE registry, which has enrolled 1262 patients from 2009 to 2011 at 39 sites around the world, has reported similar outcomes at 30 days (all patients) and at one year for 500 patients [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>A European trial enrolled 80 patients between November 2007 and August 2008, 71 of whom had moderate infrarenal aortic neck angulation and 9 with a high degree of angulation (60° to 75°) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The device was successfully delivered and deployed in all cases. At one-year follow-up, all-cause mortality was 5 percent, with potentially one device-related death. Serious adverse events were comparable between the high- and moderate-angulation groups. There were no device migrations, stent fractures, aortic ruptures, or conversions to open repair. Maximal aneurysm diameter decreased &gt;5 mm in 43 percent of cases. Three secondary endovascular procedures were performed for outflow vessel stenosis, graft limb occlusion, and iliac extension, resulting in a secondary patency rate of 100 percent. No re-interventions were required in the high-angulation group. </p><p>Five-year outcomes of the Endurant stent-graft regulatory trial in the United States demonstrated that this device appeared to be durable with limited adverse events [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Using Kaplan-Meier estimates, freedom from AAA-related mortality was 99.2 percent; all-cause mortality was 18 percent. There were no endograft migrations, fractures, or conversions to open repair. Endoleaks were identified in 7/83 patients (8.4 percent) and included type II endoleaks (6), and one endoleak of indeterminate origin. Maximum AAA diameter increased by 5 mm in 5/83 (6 percent) patients. Eighteen secondary interventions were required in 15 patients (11 percent): 12 for endoleak, 4 for limb occlusion, 1 for stenosis, and 1 for thromboembolism.</p><p>The five-year outcomes of the Endurant stent-graft reported from the ENGAGE registry demonstrated the sustained safety, effectiveness, and durability of the device [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. The ENGAGE registry included a total of 1263 patients with AAA enrolled from 2009 to 2011 at 79 centers across 30 countries. Freedom from aneurysm-related mortality, aneurysm rupture, secondary procedures, and conversion to open repair at five years was 97.8, 98.6, 84.3, and 97.9 percent, respectively. The five-year freedom from type IA endoleaks was 95.2 percent and for type III endoleaks 97.4 percent. </p><p>The performance of the Endurant stent-graft in short aortic necks was reported in patients treated with the Endurant graft in conjunction with the Heli-FX EndoAnchor implant [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. The outcomes at one year in a cohort of 70 patients reported type IA endoleaks in four patients, of which three resolved spontaneously by the 12-month follow-up. There was an additional type IA endoleak through the 12-month follow-up that has not resulted in AAA enlargement nor required a secondary procedure. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for freedom from secondary endovascular procedures and all-cause mortality was 95.4 and 92.7 percent through one year, respectively. This approach may be an option in patients with hostile anatomy and comorbidities precluding other repair options, but longer-term follow-up is required. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4115763504"><span class="h2">Excluder</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H686874292"><span class="h3">Standard graft</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Excluder device (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67461" href="/z/d/graphic/67461.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) is a self-expanding modular bifurcated two-component graft made of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) material bonded to a nitinol exoskeleton and covered with a reinforcing sleeve of ePTFE/fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) composite film. The proximal graft and ipsilateral limb have scalloped flares lined with graft material.

Compared with the control group, the Excluder group had less blood loss, shorter length of hospital stay, and decreased length of recovery. At one-year and two-year follow-up, the Excluder group had a significantly lower incidence of major complications (33 versus 67 percent). There were no significant differences between the groups in survival rate at two-year follow-up. In the Excluder group, the incidence of aneurysm-related death was 2.6 percent, but there were no late aneurysm ruptures at four-year follow-up [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. </p><p>Aneurysm sac enlargement, defined as ≥5 mm change from baseline size, occurred in 3 and 36 percent of patients at one and five years, respectively, after graft placement in the Excluder 98-03 Pivotal Trial, the majority occurring without any apparent endoleaks [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. This phenomenon led the company to release an updated version of the Excluder device in July 2004. The new device incorporated the additional low-permeability layer (FEP) to reduce exudation of fluid flow across the graft material. Following these improvements, minimal aneurysm sac expansion and significant aneurysm sac regression have been found after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms using the new Excluder device at one year [<a href="#rid24">24</a>] and with longer follow-up at 5 and 10 years [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>].

However, there were significantly more renal artery stenosis/occlusions (15/67 [22 percent] versus 3/134 [2 percent]) and renal-related reinterventions (12/67 [18 percent] versus 4/134 [3 percent]) in patients treated by FEVAR.</p><p>FEVAR appears to have similar outcomes compared with standard, open infrarenal AAA repair and improved outcomes compared with complex, open AAA repair. A review of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program targeted vascular module identified 181 open, complex AAA repairs with 220 ZFEN repairs [<a href="#rid90">90</a>]. Compared with ZFEN, open, complex AAA repair was associated with higher risk of perioperative mortality (odds ratio [OR] 4.9, 95% CI 1.4-18), postoperative renal dysfunction (OR 13, 95% CI 3.6-49), and overall complication rates (OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.3-7.5). Compared with standard, infrarenal EVAR, ZFEN had comparable rates of perioperative mortality (1.8 versus 0.8 percent), renal dysfunction (1.4 versus 0.7 percent), and any complications (11 versus 7.7 percent). There was no significant difference for perioperative mortality, postoperative renal dysfunction, or any complication between infrarenal EVAR and ZFEN. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H620227567"><span class="h2">Branched grafts</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Branched grafts have a separate smaller side-arm graft sutured to the basic endovascular graft for deployment into a vessel to preserve flow into it.

(See <a class="local">'Fenestrated grafts'</a> above.)</p><p>Branched abdominal aortic grafts have been used in patients with suprarenal and juxtarenal aortic aneurysms, and common iliac artery aneurysms [<a href="#rid91">91</a>].

They are only available as part of clinical trials or an Investigational Device Exemption; they are not commercially available in the US. </p><p>Branched grafts to the visceral vessels allow endovascular repair of more extensive aortic disease. The use of visceral branch devices in endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15203.html" rel="external">"Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm", section on 'Advanced devices and techniques'</a>.)</p><p>Iliac branched grafts are intended to preserve flow into the internal iliac artery during endovascular repair (abdominal aortic aneurysm or iliac artery aneurysm) that requires extension beyond the internal iliac artery orifice. The PRESERVE study evaluated the safety and efficacy of the Zenith Iliac Branch Device. The Gore Excluder Iliac Branch Endoprosthesis is the first off-the-shelf aortic branch solution approved in the United States and is fully designed to preserve blood flow to external and internal iliac arteries. The use of iliac branch devices is discussed in detail elsewhere.

However, although the primary comparison in the endovascular aneurysm repair trials was between endovascular and open surgical repair, comparisons between the Talent and Zenith devices in the EVAR trials failed to find significant device-specific differences [<a href="#rid92">92</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15188.html" rel="external">"Management of asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm", section on 'Open versus endovascular aneurysm repair'</a>.)</p><p>Comparisons between different grafts have also been made in observational studies. One study that included 703 patients who underwent endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair at a single institution over a six-year period found no significant differences for important outcomes. The devices used were Ancure (no longer available), AneuRx, Excluder, Talent, and Zenith. The outcomes included aneurysm-related death, conversion to open repair, need for secondary intervention, device migration, freedom from aortic rupture, and detection of type I or III endoleaks [<a href="#rid93">93</a>]. Adhering to the device manufacturer's criteria for anatomic suitability appears to be the more important issue. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16918.html" rel="external">"Complications of endovascular abdominal aortic repair", section on 'Endograft-related complications'</a>.)</p><p>Because the graft design does not appear to have a major impact on outcomes of straightforward endovascular aneurysm repair, most operators choose one endograft for routine use, reserving others for one or more features that might be more suited to a specific patient anatomy [<a href="#rid92">92,93</a>]. The operator should become familiar with specific advantages inherent to endograft designs (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67461" href="/z/d/graphic/67461.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). A device with a lower profile is more advantageous in the patient with narrow access vessels, whereas a device with better conformability and active fixation would be more helpful in the patient with challenging aortic neck anatomy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1320073770"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Endovascular aortic repair requires that specific anatomic criteria be fulfilled, and, for those with appropriate anatomy, this technique has become a preferred approach and allows the treatment of patients who might not otherwise be candidates for aortic repair. (See <a class="local">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Endovascular aortic repair involves the insertion of endovascular graft components, usually via a femoral approach. The endovascular graft modular components are built in vivo by the delivery and deployment of these components in an established order. Upon deployment, the endograft expands, contacting the aortic wall proximally and aorta or iliac vessels distally to exclude the native, dilated portion of the aortic wall from aortic blood flow and pressure. (See <a class="local">'Basic principles'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Although there are significant variations in endovascular graft design, three types of components are common to all: the delivery system, main body device, and device extensions. Devices that are commercially available in the United States to treat the abdominal aorta include the AFX2, Alto, Aorfix, Endurant, Excluder, Incraft, Treovance, and Zenith Flex. The characteristics for each graft are described above. (See <a class="local">'Abdominal devices'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When aortic disease is more extensive and involves branch vessels, the complexity of the repair and risk of complications increases. Approaches to manage more complicated anatomy include debranching procedures and the use of fenestrated and branched endografts. These endografts preserve blood flow into specific aortic branches depending upon the level of repair but are available only for investigational use in the United States. (See <a class="local">'Advanced devices'</a> above.).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Several trials have compared endovascular aneurysm repair with open surgical repair using a variety of endografts for the treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. These trials have consistently demonstrated significantly reduced perioperative (30-day) morbidity and mortality (1 to 2 versus 3 to 5 percent) for endovascular compared with open surgical repair; however, long-term mortality is not significantly different. Secondary intervention is frequently needed in patients who receive an abdominal endograft. As such, these devices require lifelong surveillance; the long-term outcomes for these devices continue to be studied. (See <a class="local">'EVAR randomized trials'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The few comparisons that are available for specific endograft designs for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm have found no significant differences between devices for important outcomes. Because the graft design does not appear to have a major impact on the outcomes of straightforward endovascular aneurysm repair, most operators choose one endograft for routine use, reserving others for one or more features that might be better suited to a specific patient.
