         Bronchoscopy is an endoscopic procedure that visualizes the tracheobronchial tree by placing an optical instrument inside the airways. The value of bronchoscopy has grown in its diagnostic and therapeutic capacity such that the clinician needs to be aware of the available technology and the associated clinical applications.

         An overview of flexible bronchoscopy and accessory procedures that can be performed during flexible bronchoscopy are reviewed here. The procedure, indications, contraindications, and complications of flexible bronchoscopy are described separately. (See

         <strong>
          Flexible bronchoscopy
         </strong>
         – Flexible bronchoscopy is also known as standard white light bronchoscopy. It is typically performed using conscious sedation and is a smaller, more flexible piece of equipment that permits access to the lower airways such as the third order of bronchi  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104076" href="/z/d/graphic/104076.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Consequently, it is more widely used than rigid bronchoscopy for both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Flexible bronchoscopy'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Rigid bronchoscopy
         </strong>
         – Rigid bronchoscopy also uses a white light source to visualize the airways. However, compared with flexible bronchoscopy, it is a larger, more rigid piece of equipment that can only access the proximal airways. It requires general anesthesia and is usually used for interventional procedures for which flexible bronchoscopy cannot be performed. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Rigid bronchoscopy'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Virtual bronchoscopy
         </strong>
         – Virtual bronchoscopy is a noninvasive form of bronchoscopy. It is not an endoscopic procedure but rather an imaging modality that reconstructs the airways in a three-dimensional (3D) manner producing images that appear similar to those visualized during invasive bronchoscopy. Unlike flexible and rigid bronchoscopy, it cannot be used to acquire samples. Its use is limited to centers with expertise. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Virtual bronchoscopy'

         <strong>
          Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy
         </strong>
         – In this technology, a small location-sensing catheter is inserted into the airways and maneuvered with robotic assistance to reach peripheral target lesions, using both direct visual and virtual computer guidance, primarily to obtain tissue diagnosis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Robotic bronchoscopy'

         Standard white light flexible bronchoscopy is the most common type of bronchoscopy. It contains optical fibers or a small camera at the distal end to transmit images, a working channel, and a light source  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67231" href="/z/d/graphic/67231.html" rel="external">
          figure 2

          figure 3
         </a>
         ), which together allow the operator to visualize the endobronchial tree [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ] (see
         <a class="local">
          'Equipment and procedure'
         </a>
         below). Unlike the rigid bronchoscope, the flexible bronchoscope has a mechanism to flex or extend its distal end (anteriorly or posteriorly), which facilitates insertion through curved airways and enhances its ability to reach distal airways. All other forms of bronchoscopy listed in the sections below are variants of this form of bronchoscopy. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Endobronchial ultrasound'

         Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) involves a flexible bronchoscopy with an ultrasound probe. Commonly used, the linear EBUS bronchoscope is a hybrid scope that has an ultrasound probe built at the distal end; it allows the airways to be visualized similar to a standard bronchoscope, and additionally allows the structures surrounding the airways to be visualized (eg, lymph nodes, blood vessels, or lung masses). It provides real-time ultrasound images of the tissue adjacent to the airway, facilitating transbronchial needle aspiration of enlarged lymph nodes or masses.

         There are also miniature ultrasound probes that can be introduced through a flexible bronchoscope, known as radial EBUS. Detailed discussion of EBUS probes is provided separately. (See

         ENB uses a special catheter with a sensor probe that is inserted through the working channel of a regular flexible bronchoscope.

         In VNB, first an airway path is planned to the target lesion using a computerized 3D reconstruction of the patient's computed tomographic (CT) chest images. An ultrathin bronchoscope (see

There is no electromagnetic guidance. This allows peripheral lung masses or abnormal areas to be sampled even if they cannot be accessed by a regular bronchoscope directly. (See

         Rigid bronchoscopy is a procedure in which a large straight metal tube with a beveled distal end is inserted into the trachea through the mouth (or the tracheostomy stoma)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68008" href="/z/d/graphic/68008.html" rel="external">

         ). Instruments including a telescope with a light source (with or without video monitoring), forceps, suction catheters, and even flexible bronchoscopes can be placed through the beveled tube. Patients can also be simultaneously ventilated through the rigid system  (

         Virtual bronchoscopy is not widely available and it remains largely investigational [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-8
         </a>
         ]. Virtual bronchoscopy consists of 3D computer-generated images of the tracheobronchial tree that allow "fly-through" visualization of airways  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78262" href="/z/d/graphic/78262.html" rel="external">
          figure 4
         </a>
         ). The airways are imaged using imaging hardware, usually helical (spiral) CT hardware, that allows the rapid acquisition of volumetric data of the entire airway in a relatively short time. These data are then analyzed by software to reconstruct 3D and endoluminal views of the airways [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Compared with rigid and flexible bronchoscopy, virtual bronchoscopy has the advantage of being noninvasive, and being able to define the airways out to the seventh generation  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104076" href="/z/d/graphic/104076.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). As an example, it may be able to provide important information about the condition of the distal airway beyond an obstruction when a flexible bronchoscope cannot pass an obstructing airway lesion. It also provides important information about the location of structures outside of the airways (eg, lymph nodes or blood vessels).
        </p>
        <p>
         The major limitation of virtual bronchoscopy is its inability to sample lesions such that it can only be used prior to rigid or flexible bronchoscopy in order to plan a procedure.
        </p>
        <p>
         While most modalities use CT to provide virtual images of the airways, some reports describe virtual positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) bronchoscopy as a staging tool for lung cancer [

         In this technology, instead of manually driving a bronchoscope in the airway, a robotic articulated arm is used to maneuver a bronchoscope or catheter to reach target lesions in the periphery of the lungs. Radial EBUS, fluoroscopy, or cone-beam CT can be used for secondary confirmation of placement in addition to direct vision.
        </p>

          14
         </a>
         ]. The Auris Monarch system was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018 and uses electromagnetic guidance and direct visualization of airways with an ultrathin bronchoscope to pass a lockable 6 mm diameter outer sheath to reach peripheral target lesions. Tissue sampling is obtained under direct vision. The Intuitive ION system, approved by the FDA in 2019, uses a 3.5 mm diameter shape-sensing flexible catheter with a vision probe inside to reach the peripheral lesions. Tissue sampling is performed under virtual and fluoroscopic guidance.
        </p>
        <p>
         The benefit of the robotic system is that the catheter can be locked in place to avoid distortion or warping during tissue sampling to improve diagnostic yield, which ranges from 69.1 percent with the Monarch system [

         The light source of the conventional flexible bronchoscope typically transmits a broad-spectrum white light from the working tip. The image processor can adjust the intensity, color, and brightness of the light and/or the acquired image, as well as store images or videos.

        <p>
         Narrow-spectrum light sources are available, which improve the detection of mucosal variations (principle of confocal bronchoscopy) and can activate native fluorochromes (principle of fluorescence bronchoscopy) or dyes (principle of photodynamic therapy) that destroy malignant cells. (See

         Images are processed in real time so that the operator can appreciate their location and appropriately target lesions for biopsy or therapy. The image of the illuminated airway is transmitted to the operator in one of two ways, fiberoptic transmission or digitized video transmission:

         Most bronchoscopes utilize a miniature charge-coupled device camera located at the working tip, which captures real-time images and then transmits them to a video processor for presentation on video monitors. Compared with older fiberoptic bronchoscopes, the resulting image is of high resolution, sharper, and magnified, with a wider field of vision.

         </span>
         Older bronchoscopes used fiberoptic transmission which is why flexible bronchoscopy is sometimes called fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The image of the airway is viewed by an operator peering directly into an eyepiece at the proximal end of the scope, located on the control handle. Image quality is related to the number and condition of the fragile fiberoptic bundle, which is prone to damage with use. Attachments are available that can transmit the image from the eyepiece to a video monitor via the image processor.

         Health care workers are at risk of being exposed to infectious organisms from the patient during bronchoscopy. Universal barrier protection including gown, gloves, masks, and eye shields during bronchoscopy is routine. Full barrier protection should also be used by personnel cleaning the scopes. (See

         Additional protection is warranted when patients who are at high risk of tuberculosis or have active tuberculosis are undergoing bronchoscopy [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. In suspected cases of mycobacterial infection or possible airborne transmission, fit-tested N-95 masks should be worn by everyone present in the room during the procedure. It is a common practice to obtain three sets of negative sputum culture for acid-fast bacilli prior to doing a bronchoscopy in a suspected case of tuberculosis. (See

        <p>
         Immediately after the completion of the procedure in the bronchoscopy suite, it is a good practice for the operator to suction

          saline
         </a>
         through the bronchoscope to prevent sludge from forming in the working channel. Cleaning begins as soon as the bronchoscopy is completed. In the cleaning area, the bronchoscope should then be inspected for damage, since breaches on the surface of the bronchoscope may develop concretions of debris that cannot be disinfected [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. All suction ports and attachments should be removed and attachments that cannot be properly cleaned (eg, suction port cap) should be either sterilized or disposed. The internal channels should be thoroughly brushed, since sludge and concretions can develop within the channels. A leak test is routinely performed to determine the integrity of the working channel  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef95523" href="/z/d/graphic/95523.html" rel="external">
          movie 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         The bronchoscope can be disinfected manually or with an automated endoscope reprocessor  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95521" href="/z/d/graphic/95521.html" rel="external">
          picture 7
         </a>
         ). It is usually soaked for about 20 to 30 minutes in disinfectant solution. Common disinfectants include glutaraldehyde, peracetic acid, ortho-phthalaldehyde, or a hydrogen peroxide formulation. Following disinfection, the bronchoscope is thoroughly rinsed with sterile water or filtered tap water and 70 percent alcohol, since any retained disinfectants may cause mucositis in subsequent patients. The inner channel can be dried by insufflating air into the working ports. After cleaning, the bronchoscopes are hung upright to prevent the accumulation of moisture  (

          picture 8

         Since bronchoscopy is an aerosol-generating procedure, precautions must be taken to optimize the safety of health care workers with strict barrier techniques (eg, personal protective equipment [PPE] with impermeable gown, N-95 mask, eye cover, cap, gloves, shoe covers). A powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) is not mandatory.
        </p>
        <p>
         Elective procedures can be delayed for two to three weeks since the onset of symptoms or confirmation of COVID-19 infection. A negative test is not mandatory after three weeks. However, urgent time-sensitive bronchoscopies (eg, airway management, control of hemoptysis, or diagnosis and staging of lung cancer) can be performed using strict barrier techniques without any untoward effects on the operators.
        </p>
        <p>
         While bronchoscopy suites are equipped with negative airflow, bronchoscopies on COVID-19-infected patients can be performed at bedside in the intensive care unit or COVID units in intubated patients, where negative airflow is not available. A simple diagnostic bronchoalveolar lavage can be performed on mechanically ventilated patients by one operator [

        </p>
        <p>
         Other recommendations include limiting the number of staff participating in bronchoscopy, use of disposable bronchoscopes when feasible, donning appropriate PPE for an aerosol-generating procedure, and performance in an airborne isolation room [

         Flexible bronchoscopy should be performed by experienced operators because this maximizes the quality of the bronchoscopic examination, the quality of sample collection, and patient safety. It is typically performed by pulmonologists, thoracic surgeons, critical care clinicians, anesthesiologists, and otolaryngologists.

         In addition to the dexterity and skills, the operator needs to have thorough knowledge of the indications, contraindications, alternate options, risks, potential complications, and their immediate management. Basic maneuvers can be learned from an expert by training on a simulator or by practicing on an airway model [

          27-29

         Bronchoscopy is an endoscopic procedure that visualizes the tracheobronchial tree by placing an optical instrument inside the airways. There are many types of bronchoscopy (flexible, rigid, robotic, or virtual), among which flexible bronchoscopy is the most common  (

         ). The traditional white light flexible bronchoscope can examine the oropharynx, vocal cords, and trachea, and airways to the third order of bronchi can be visualized  (

         ). Diagnostic samples may be obtained (from airways and lung parenchyma) and airway lesions can be treated with a variety of accessory equipment that can be used with the flexible bronchoscope. Other variants of the flexible bronchoscope exist, each with their own unique features for visualization and sampling of the tracheobronchial tree (eg, endobronchial ultrasound). (See

         Patients should be selected for flexible bronchoscopy only after carefully weighing the indications and contraindications. (See

         Standard bronchoscopy equipment typically consists of the bronchoscope and an image processor with a light source. The bronchoscope contains optical fibers or a small camera at the distal end, to transmit images, and a working channel. Images are processed in real time so that the operator can appropriately target lesions for biopsy or therapy. The working channel can be used to insert diagnostic and therapeutic instruments or to apply suction to remove secretions from the airways. (See

         The complications of bronchoscopy are largely those associated with procedural sedation and the interventions associated with bronchoscopy (eg, biopsy). Since bronchoscopy is performed in a monitored setting, all patients need to be recovered from sedation (or anesthesia) and followed for complications. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/105799.html" rel="external">

         Full protection barrier (masks, gloves, gown, and eye-shields) should be worn by all personnel. The bronchoscope should be cleaned and disinfected after each procedure to prevent the transmission of infection and a leak test should be routinely performed to determine the integrity of the working channel. All personnel should wear lead aprons with neck shields if fluoroscopy is planned during the procedure. Additional precaution is needed to perform bronchoscopy in patients with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection. (See
         <a class="local">

         Flexible bronchoscopy should be performed by experienced operators to maximize the quality of the procedure and to assure patient safety. (See
