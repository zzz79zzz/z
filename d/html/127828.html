COVID-19 is associated with multiple psychiatric problems in several groups, including clinicians who care for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, patients with COVID-19, and patients who had psychiatric disorders predating infection [<a href="#rid4">4-8</a>]. Although the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have declared that COVID-19 is no longer a public health emergency, the virus continues to circulate and new variants are emerging [<a href="#rid9">9-12</a>].</p><p>This topic addresses the epidemiology, course of illness, and management of psychiatric illnesses that are associated with the COVID-19. Other topics discuss COVID-19 per se and related issues arising in different specialties, such as cardiology, obstetrics and gynecology, and oncology.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1713774482"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The subsections below describe the prevalence of mental health sequelae associated with COVID-19 in health care workers, patients with COVID-19, individuals in quarantine, and the general population.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H998007290"><span class="h2">Health care workers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Psychiatric symptoms and disorders can occur in clinicians exposed to COVID-19 through their occupations [<a href="#rid4">4,5,13-16</a>]. As an example, a meta-analysis of 33 studies found that the global point prevalence of clinically significant anxiety symptoms among practicing physicians (n &gt;30,000) during the first year of the pandemic (2020 to 2021) was 26 percent, and for depression was 21 percent [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. These rates appear to be greater than the prepandemic rates in the general global population.</p><p>A review of 59 studies of viral outbreaks, including the COVID-19 pandemic, identified multiple risk factors and protective factors for psychiatric problems in health care workers [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Risk factors – The most consistent risk factor across studies was increased contact with infected patients. Other consistent predictors were a prior history of psychiatric symptoms/disorders and/or general medical illnesses, spending a prolonged time in quarantine, perceived lack of organizational support, and perceived social stigma directed towards health care workers.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Protective factors – Across studies, the factor that most consistently decreased the risk of adverse psychiatric outcomes in health care workers was access to personal protective equipment. Other consistent protective factors included having supportive peers, access to psychiatric interventions, and trust in the institution’s infection control measures, as well as receiving clear communication from supervisors and adequate time off from work.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3487563666"><span class="h2">Patients with COVID-19</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Multiple studies consistently indicate that patients who survive COVID-19 are at increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, sleep disorders, and substance use disorders.</p><p>The risk of psychiatric disorders in patients with COVID-19 is greater than the risk in patients with other respiratory illnesses. A retrospective study of administrative health care data sets identified patients with either COVID-19 (n &gt;236,000) or influenza (n &gt;105,000) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. After controlling for potential confounding factors by matching the different groups on baseline characteristics (eg, age and comorbidities), the analyses found that in the six months after COVID-19, several psychiatric disorders occurred in more patients with COVID-19 than influenza, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anxiety disorders – 17.4 percent of patients with COVID-19</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unipolar depression or bipolar disorder – 13.7 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Substance use disorder – 6.6 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Insomnia – 5.4 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Psychotic disorder – 1.4 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dementia – 0.7 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Delirium – 0.1 percent</p><p></p><p>In addition, patients who survive acute COVID-19 are at increased risk for onset of new, incident psychiatric symptoms and disorders [<a href="#rid20">20-25</a>]. As an example:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A one-year, retrospective study of administrative health care data examined the risk of incident psychiatric disorders in patients who survived COVID-19 for 30 days (n &gt;150,000) and patients without COVID-19 (n &gt;5,600,000) [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. After adjusting for potential confounding factors (eg, age, smoking status, and general medical comorbidities), the analyses found that infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was associated with an increased risk of a psychiatric diagnosis (hazard ratio 1.46, 95% CI 1.40-1.52). Specific symptoms and disorders that were observed more often in patients with COVID-19 included:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Cognitive impairment</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Anxiety disorders</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Depressive disorders</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Sleep disorders</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Substance use disorders</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A retrospective study of administrative health care data sets identified patients with COVID-19 (n &gt;44,000), influenza (n &gt;26,000), or other respiratory infections (n &gt;44,000), who had no prior history of a psychiatric diagnosis [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. After controlling for potential confounding factors, the analyses found that a subsequent, first lifetime psychiatric diagnosis occurred in more patients with COVID-19 than the other two groups (6 versus 3 and 3 percent). The most frequent psychiatric disorders following COVID-19 were anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and insomnia, as well as dementia in patients age 65 years or more.</p><p></p><p>Other studies have also found that COVID-19 is associated with cognitive impairment. As an example, neuropsychological testing of individuals on two occasions approximately three years apart found that decline in attention and executive function was greater in those who developed COVID-19 between tests than controls who were not infected [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. The effect was larger at older ages.</p><p>Following a diagnosis of COVID-19, the increased risk of psychopathology persists for varying lengths of time across different psychiatric symptoms and disorders. A two-year retrospective study identified patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 (n &gt;1.2 million) and an equal number of patients with other respiratory infections, and used propensity scoring to match the two groups on 82 potential confounders observed at baseline (eg, sociodemographic factors, comorbidities, and exposure to medications) [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. For the first six months of follow-up after onset of infection, patients with COVID-19 experienced more psychopathology than patients with other infections. However, during follow-up beyond the initial six months, the increased risk of anxiety disorders, insomnia, and mood disorders subsequently dissipated, such that the risk in the two groups was equal. By contrast, COVID-19 was associated with a greater risk of cognitive impairment and psychotic disorders during the entire two-year follow-up.</p><p>The association between COVID-19 and psychiatric disorders seems to be bidirectional, such that survivors of COVID-19 are at increased risk of psychiatric sequelae, and patients with psychiatric disorders are at increased risk for COVID-19 [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Course of illness'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H420381564"><span class="h3">Patients critically ill with COVID-19</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Multiple studies have established the association between critical illness and the subsequent manifestation of psychiatric symptoms and disorders [<a href="#rid22">22,29-31</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/88330.html" rel="external">"Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) in adults: Clinical features and diagnostic evaluation"</a>.)</p><p>Patients who are critically ill with COVID-19 are also at risk for persistent psychiatric illness, including new, incident disorders: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a national registry study that included patients without a psychiatric disorder (n &gt;3.6 million) [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>New onset of psychiatric disorders was substantially greater in those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and required hospitalization, compared with those who tested negative (hazard ratio 2.5, 95% CI 2.1-3.1).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Onset of psychiatric disorders in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and patients hospitalized for other respiratory infections was comparable.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a meta-analysis of 13 observational studies that included nearly 1100 individuals with severe COVID-19 infection, the estimated pooled prevalence of PTSD at 4 to 16 weeks postdiagnosis was 16 percent [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. This may exceed the rate in the general population.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2840415446"><span class="h2">Individuals in quarantine</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Psychiatric symptoms and disorders that occurred in quarantined adults during the COVID-19 pandemic included anxiety and depression [<a href="#rid34">34,35</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In an online survey of university students (n &gt;69,000) who were quarantined during the pandemic for an unspecified duration, high levels of anxiety were reported by 28 percent, severe depression by 16 percent, severe traumatic stress by 22 percent, and suicidal ideation by 11 percent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among nearly 7900 adolescents in quarantine during the pandemic for four months, an online survey found that anxiety occurred in 22 percent and depression in 25 percent [<a href="#rid36">36</a>].</p><p></p><p>In the two surveys, one common risk factor for psychiatric symptoms was problems with basic needs (food or housing). This is consistent with a review that concluded quarantines adversely affected mental health by disrupting pragmatic daily tasks such as earning a salary and accessing food [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2695337015"><span class="h2">General population</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Multiple cross-sectional, self-report online surveys in 2020 suggested that the prevalence of clinically significant psychiatric symptoms during the pandemic may have exceeded the baseline prevalence [<a href="#rid37">37-42</a>]. However, the situation appears to be more nuanced. Higher quality studies indicate that on one hand, the general public’s mental health before and during the pandemic was generally comparable [<a href="#rid43">43-45</a>]. On the other hand, the mental health of some subgroups in the general population deteriorated, and surveillance of individuals within these subgroups is warranted.</p><p>A systematic review identified higher quality studies that assessed mental health both before the COVID-19 pandemic (in 2018 and 2019) and during the pandemic (January 2020 or later) in 134 general population cohorts [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. Within each study, prepandemic and pandemic assessments were conducted in 90 percent or more of the same participants, or statistical methods were used to account for missing data. The primary findings from a series of meta-analyses were as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>General adult population – Before and during the pandemic:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Overall mental health was comparable</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Anxiety symptoms were comparable</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Depressive symptoms worsened slightly during the pandemic</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Subgroups that were adversely affected by the pandemic, with modest worsening of overall mental health, anxiety, and/or depression, included the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Females</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Individuals with pre-existing psychiatric disorders</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Older adults</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Parents or caregivers</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Sexual minority groups</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>University students</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For most of the meta-analyses, heterogeneity across studies was large [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. This suggests that although the adverse psychiatric effects of the pandemic at the population level were on average limited, the effects were greater for subsets of individuals. Another study limitation is that there were relatively few data for some subgroups, such as health care professionals and people with low socioeconomic status, who may have been more vulnerable and suffered more severe effects from the pandemic. In addition, the timing of assessments during the pandemic may also have influenced the observed effects upon mental health, such that deterioration at the start of the pandemic may have subsequently stabilized [<a href="#rid44">44</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>General pediatric population – Among children and adolescents in the general population, overall mental health, anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms before and during the pandemic were each comparable [<a href="#rid46">46</a>].</p><p></p><p>Older individuals (eg, ≥70 years), immunocompromised patients, and patients with chronic disease may also experience increased anxiety and depression related to COVID-19 [<a href="#rid47">47,48</a>]. In addition, individuals living in settings with armed conflicts and humanitarian crises (eg, refugees and internally displaced people) are at risk for psychiatric symptoms and disorders [<a href="#rid49">49</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2877184495"><span class="h1">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pathogenesis of psychiatric symptoms and disorders that arise from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may involve biologic and psychosocial factors.</p><p>Multiple studies suggest that COVID-19 may indirectly affect central nervous system function through the associated inflammatory immune response [<a href="#rid22">22,50,51</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Positron emission tomography of specific brain regions was conducted in 20 patients with persistent depression and cognitive symptoms following acute COVID-19 and in 20 healthy controls [<a href="#rid52">52</a>].

A study obtained two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans approximately three years apart in 386 individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between scans but did not require hospitalization, and 384 controls who were not infected [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. From the first to the second scan, individuals infected with the virus demonstrated more tissue abnormalities and modestly greater reduction in gray matter thickness and global brain size; the effects were larger at older ages.

Patient preference usually dictates whether visits are conducted by video or phone. Advantages of telepsychiatry include improved access for patients and the opportunity to see the patient's home, although some patients find this intrusive. Telepsychiatry also enables clinicians and patients to see each other’s face without masks, which may feel more intimate. While some patients may feel more relaxed and be forthcoming, others may find it harder to effectively "connect" and establish trust with the clinician. Other potential disadvantages include difficulty observing nonverbal patient cues and hearing patients, technical disruptions such as frozen screens, as well as patients lacking privacy and problems with distractions. In addition, clinicians may feel isolated from colleagues or detached from patients.</p><p>Techniques that improve telepsychiatry include starting each visit by asking whether patients have enough privacy; if not, suggestions are offered such as using headphones or a car (not driving) or rescheduling the visit [<a href="#rid80">80</a>]. For video visits, it may be helpful for clinicians to use the same place in the office or home to provide consistency and reassurance for patients. Contingency plans should be in place to manage clinical problems that arise or technical issues with one’s equipment. Other strategies to address common barriers to successful conversations over telephone or video are presented in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef128198" href="/d/graphic/128198.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p>Patients vary in their willingness to use telepsychiatry.

For patients who view psychiatric telehealth as inferior to in-person treatment, it may help to suggest that they experiment and try it [<a href="#rid80">80</a>]. If patients are dissatisfied or do not improve, they can switch to face-to-face treatment. Nevertheless, treatment conducted exclusively by telepsychiatry may not be feasible for patient populations who require solely in-person treatment or a hybrid approach, such as those who have complex needs, or are older or at higher risk for poor outcomes [<a href="#rid84">84</a>].</p><p>Some software platforms permit more than two people to meet and enable family involvement and group therapy.

As an example, the global point prevalence of clinically significant anxiety symptoms among physicians during the first year of the pandemic was 26 percent, and for depression was 21 percent. (See <a class="local">'Health care workers'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Patients with COVID-19</strong> – Patients who survive acute COVID-19 are at increased risk for psychiatric symptoms and disorders, including anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, sleep disorders, and substance use disorders.

However, modest worsening of overall mental health, anxiety, and/or depression occurred in different subgroups, including females, older adults, parents or caregivers, and individuals with pre-existing psychiatric disorders.
