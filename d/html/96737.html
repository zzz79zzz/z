         Chest pain is a common presenting complaint in children. Although the etiology is benign in most cases, this symptom may lead to school absences and/or restriction of activities and causes considerable anxiety in patients and their families or caregivers. A thorough history and physical examination usually can determine the cause and identify patients who require acute intervention and those who can be managed with reassurance and continued follow-up. Laboratory testing is necessary only in a small number of patients [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In the absence of associated symptoms of illness, positive findings on physical examination related to the cardiac or respiratory systems, or symptoms during exertion, a serious organic cause is unlikely.

         Nontraumatic chest pain is a common symptom in children and adolescents and is a frequent complaint in patients seeking primary, emergent, or subspecialty care [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2-6
         </a>
         ]. In the majority of pediatric patients, chest pain is
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         caused by a serious medical condition. However, potentially life-threatening cardiac conditions (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, or myocardial ischemia) and serious pulmonary conditions (eg, acute chest syndrome in patients with sickle cell disease, spontaneous pneumothorax, or pulmonary embolus) are found in 1 to 6 percent of pediatric patients with chest pain depending upon the setting.
        </p>
        <p>
         Chest pain causes considerable anxiety in patients and their families or caregivers. Because of its association with fatal heart disease in adults, this symptom is viewed as a harbinger of serious cardiac disease in approximately half of patients seeking medical attention [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,7,8
         </a>
         ]. This interpretation is more common after the occurrence of sudden death involving an athlete in the community or at the professional level. As an example, in a series of 100 adolescent patients seen in a general pediatric clinic, nearly all of whom had no serious illness, 44 percent thought they were having a heart attack or were worried about heart disease (12 percent) or cancer (12 percent) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Pediatric chest pain also has important functional consequences because it may result in restriction of activities and school absences. In the review of 100 adolescents noted above, restriction of activities was reported in 69 percent of patients and 41 percent had absences from school because of pain [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. In another pediatric emergency-based survey of 336 children younger than 18 years of age with chest pain, 27 percent reported missing school because of the pain [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Thus, it is important for clinicians to address patient and caregiver concerns during evaluation.

         </span>
         Causes of chest pain in children vary among reports and depend in part upon whether patients were seen in an emergency department with acute symptoms or in a pediatric or cardiology setting with a more chronic complaint [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-4,7,8,10-16
         </a>
         ]. In all settings, patients typically have no serious underlying condition  (

         Heart disease is more likely if chest pain occurs during exertion or is associated with palpitations, syncope with exertion, or decreased exercise tolerance [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Patients with known congenital heart disease, heart transplant, substance abuse, or prior Kawasaki disease are at heightened risk for myocardial ischemia. A positive family history of cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrhythmia, or sudden death in close relatives before the age of 50 years should also raise suspicion. In addition to a suggestive history, most patients with heart disease will have an abnormal cardiac examination or electrocardiogram  (

          table 2

         ) and may present with chest pain on exertion. Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the main pulmonary artery usually presents in infancy, but can become symptomatic later in childhood. In that disorder, left ventricular ischemia usually results in cardiomyopathy and mitral regurgitation. Origin of a coronary artery from the contralateral sinus of Valsalva and coursing of the anomalously positioned coronary artery between the aorta and pulmonary artery can be associated with exertional chest pain. In these patients, the pain is caused by compression of the coronary artery between the distended great arteries with the increased cardiac index associated with exercise with the following anatomic variants (see

         Although uncommon, children and adolescents with predisposing conditions, such as hyperlipidemia, prior Kawasaki disease with coronary artery aneurysms or stenoses, or collagen vascular disease (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus) can develop classic angina consisting of crushing or squeezing substernal chest pain with radiation to the jaw or left arm and associated with diaphoresis, nausea and vomiting, difficulty breathing, or altered mental status. An electrocardiogram (ECG) obtained while the patient has pain often shows ST wave elevation or depression  (

         Coronary vasospasm (variant angina) and myocardial infarction are rare causes of chest pain in children and adolescents. Coronary vasospasm is associated with angina, transient ischemic changes on ECG during episodes of pain, cardiac enzyme elevation, and ST-segment elevation on ambulatory ECG monitoring. Variant angina with myocardial infarction has been described after recreational use of cocaine, amphetamines, bath salts (methcathinones), marijuana, and synthetic cannabinoids in adolescents. (See

         Pericarditis may be of infectious origin (eg, nonspecific viral, bacterial, tuberculous, or secondary to human immunodeficiency virus), associated with open heart surgery (postpericardiotomy syndrome), or complicate an underlying condition such as collagen vascular disorder, uremia, neoplasm, or trauma. The diagnosis of acute pericarditis is usually suspected based upon a history of characteristic pleuritic chest pain, and confirmed if a pericardial friction rub is present. Pericarditis should also be suspected in a patient with persistent fever and new, unexplained cardiomegaly. Additional testing, which typically includes blood work, chest radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography, can support the diagnosis. The electrocardiogram is usually the most helpful test in the evaluation of patients with suspected acute pericarditis. Echocardiography can identify the presence and size of a pericardial effusion, potential presence of cardiac tamponade, and assess coexisting myocarditis by determining myocardial function. (See

         Pneumothorax typically causes acute onset of sharp chest pain that is worsened by inspiration. A large pneumothorax may present with decreased chest excursion, diminished breath sounds, hyperresonant percussion, and decreased vocal fremitus on the affected side. Other signs of respiratory compromise may include tachypnea, increased work of breathing, and cyanosis. (See

         Because the mediastinum is less mobile in older adolescents in whom spontaneous pneumothorax is most common, tension pneumothorax does not typically occur.

         As in adults, pulmonary embolism (PE) or infarction can manifest with pleuritic chest pain, tachypnea, cough, tachycardia, acute dyspnea, and sudden collapse. Most commonly, however, the clinical manifestations of PE in children, especially younger ones, are not specific and often mimic the clinical symptoms of the underlying disease. For this reason and because infants and young children cannot verbalize their symptoms, PE should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cardiorespiratory deterioration in all critically ill children. Risk factors for PE in children include immobility, oral contraceptive use, pregnancy termination, ventriculoatrial shunts for hydrocephalus, central venous catheters, solid tumors, heart disease, infection, dehydration, hypercoagulable states, low cardiac output, and obesity. Tachycardia, hypoxia, and an abnormal ECG may be present. (See

Depending upon the specific type of tumor, associated findings may include weight loss, bone pain or limp, recurrent fevers, excessive bruising or bleeding, abdominal or neck masses, fatigue, or pallor. Pediatric cancers that may involve the thorax include soft tissue sarcomas, primitive neuroectodermal tumors, Ewing sarcoma, neuroblastoma, lymphomas, and leukemias.

         A specific diagnosis cannot be established in a substantial proportion of cases (21 to 52 percent); these are considered idiopathic. Similar to most patients with chest pain, those with idiopathic pain usually have no serious underlying medical condition. As an example, in one cohort study of approximately 1800 pediatric patients presenting for evaluation of chest pain to a specialty clinic whose etiology was idiopathic, none had a missed diagnosis resulting in cardiac death during 18,000 patient-years of follow-up [

         Among children with a primary complaint of chest pain, conditions affecting the chest wall account for up to 31 percent of all patients and two-thirds of patients with an identified condition. Thus, it is the most frequent specific diagnosis for chest pain in children [

          2,4,7
         </a>
         ]. Musculoskeletal pain can be traumatic or nontraumatic, although nontraumatic chest pain as an isolated complaint is more common. Occasionally, the clinician elicits a recent history of strenuous exercise of the chest muscles (eg, weightlifting or push-ups) that has subsequently resulted in muscle soreness. Serious thoracic trauma is readily identified by history and physical examination in most patients and may result in chest wall or lung injury. (See

         Respiratory disorders, including pneumonia and asthma, are common causes of acute pediatric chest pain. Children with pneumonia usually have fever, cough, and tachypnea. Rales or tubular breath sounds may be present on lung examination. Less commonly, the chest pain can arise from sites of pleuritis or pleural effusion. (See

The pain lasts anywhere from minutes to hours, and resolves either spontaneously or with antacids. It usually occurs after meals, awakens patients from sleep, and may be exacerbated by emotional stress. GERD-related chest pain is not well described by young children. Young or nonverbal children may be observed pounding their chest. GERD is common in children with autism, and may be manifested only by unexplained or self-injurious behaviors. (See

A careful history and physical examination are essential to diagnosing an esophageal foreign body and preventing complications. Initial imaging consists of anteroposterior and lateral chest radiographs to confirm the findings and to localize the site of radio-opaque foreign bodies.

The most common motility disorders were diffuse esophageal spasm and achalasia, which occurred in seven and four patients, respectively. Thus, referral to a gastroenterologist may be indicated in selected children with chronic chest pain (eg, children whose pain is not due to another etiology, is causing significant distress, and does not resolve or improve with presumptive treatment).

         Less commonly, disorders of the stomach, pancreas, small intestine, gall bladder, or biliary tract may present with chest pain. Conditions affecting the stomach and bowel include ulcer and irritable bowel. Cholecystitis may cause symptoms that suggest angina in adults, but is rare in healthy children. Biliary (eg, gallstones) and pancreatic disorders are also uncommon. In these conditions, abdominal pain or tenderness usually accompanies the chest pain. Refer to appropriate topics.

         The breast can be a source of chest pain in adolescent patients, although it typically accounts for less than 5 percent of complaints. Pain may be a presenting symptom in males with gynecomastia. These patients also may have anxiety about the size of their breasts. (See

          Tietze syndrome
         </strong>
         – Tietze syndrome has been defined as a benign, painful, nonsuppurative localized swelling of the costosternal, sternoclavicular, or costochondral joints, most often involving the area of the second and third ribs. Only one area is usually involved, and young adults are more commonly affected. Tietze syndrome is rare and should be differentiated from more diffuse forms of myofascial chest pain (costochondritis) in which no areas of localized swelling are detected on examination. The cause of Tietze syndrome is unknown, but antecedent upper respiratory infections and excessive coughing have been described in some patients. (See

          Pleurodynia

         – Pleurodynia refers to an acute illness with marked paroxysmal spasms of the muscles of the chest and abdomen and fever. It most commonly occurs in association with group B coxsackie viruses. In children, characteristic vesicular stomatitis and rash on the palms and soles of the feet are often present as well  (

          Neurologic disorders
         </strong>
         — Chest pain rarely is caused by a neurologic disorder that affects one or more costal nerves. As an example, herpes zoster in a dermatomal distribution on the chest can cause pain, which may be manifest before lesions appear (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5289.html" rel="external">
          "Postherpetic neuralgia"
         </a>

          Mitral valve prolapse

         — Although identified as a cause of chest pain in the past, whether patients with mitral valve prolapse have chest pain more frequently than normal children is unclear. In one study of 119 children, 18 percent had atypical chest pain [

         <a href="#rid39">
          39

          Epidemiology and etiology

         – Nontraumatic chest pain is a common symptom in children and adolescents and is a frequent complaint in patients seeking primary, emergency, or subspecialty care. In the majority of pediatric patients, chest pain is
         <strong>

          Life-threatening conditions

         – Life-threatening conditions including cardiac disease, spontaneous pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, and pulmonary hypertension account for 1 to 6 percent of pediatric patients with nontraumatic chest pain depending upon the setting and can frequently be identified based upon clinical findings  (
