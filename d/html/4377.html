Affected patients have a poorer prognosis than those with SSc who are free of pulmonary involvement.</p><p>The spectrum of pulmonary complications of SSc and an approach to their evaluation will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis of SSc-associated ILD and PAH are discussed separately.

The type of cutaneous involvement correlates with the risk for different types of lung involvement, although substantial overlap exists. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7539.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Diffuse cutaneous SSc is characterized by extensive skin involvement with extension of skin sclerosis proximal to the wrists (particularly over the proximal limbs and trunk but commonly sparing the upper back). Approximately one third of patients with SSc have diffuse skin involvement. Patients with diffuse skin involvement due to SSc have a greater likelihood of developing interstitial lung disease (ILD; and also cardiac and renal disease), compared with those who have limited cutaneous SSc [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Limited cutaneous SSc is characterized by skin sclerosis restricted to the hands, distal extremities, and, to a lesser extent, to the face and neck. Patients with limited cutaneous SSc generally have prominent vascular manifestations and may have CREST syndrome (<strong>C</strong>alcinosis cutis, <strong>R</strong>aynaud phenomenon, <strong>E</strong>sophageal dysmotility, <strong>S</strong>clerodactyly, and <strong>T</strong>elangiectasia). A subset may develop ILD [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">TYPES OF PULMONARY INVOLVEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common forms of SSc lung involvement, which may occur separately or together, are interstitial lung disease and pulmonary vascular disease. Other pulmonary complications include pulmonary thromboembolic disease, pleural disease, aspiration pneumonitis, airways disease, drug-induced pneumonitis, and lung cancer. More than one of these processes may be present in a given patient.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H94894881"><span class="h2">Interstitial lung disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a common complication of diffuse cutaneous SSc (approximately 50 percent), but can also occur in patients with limited cutaneous SSc (approximately 25 percent) [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. ILD may be apparent at the time of or soon after the diagnosis of SSc or, less commonly, may develop many years after the onset of skin disease; rarely does it precede the recognition of SSc. SSc-associated ILD typically presents with the subacute onset of dyspnea on exertion and sometimes nonproductive cough. The radiographic, and pathologic features of SSc-associated ILD are typically those of fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) or, less commonly, usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) or pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis [<a href="#rid2">2,5,6</a>]. The clinical and laboratory features and diagnosis of ILD in patients with SSc are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4368.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and diagnosis of interstitial lung disease in systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4302.html" rel="external">"Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias: Classification and pathology"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H94894909"><span class="h2">Pulmonary vascular disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is the most common pulmonary vascular disease in SSc, but patients can also develop thromboembolic disease, pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis, or pulmonary veno-occlusive disease.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H544415602"><span class="h3">Pulmonary hypertension</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several different forms of PH occur in SSc, and the classification is based on the cause of elevated pulmonary artery pressures. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that is due to diseases that localize to the small muscular pulmonary arterioles is classified as group 1 (includes idiopathic and rheumatic disease-associated); PH caused by myocardial dysfunction is group 2; and PH due to hypoxemia from advanced ILD is group 3  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66348" href="/d/graphic/66348.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). SSc-associated PAH is pathologically indistinguishable from idiopathic PAH. PAH is the most common of the types of PH in SSc. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8251.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary arterial hypertension in systemic sclerosis (scleroderma): Definition, risk factors, and screening", section on 'Classification'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8249.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension of unclear etiology in adults", section on 'Postdiagnostic testing and classification'</a>.)</p><p>The exact prevalence of PAH in patients with SSc is unknown, but is estimated to be 10 to 15 percent. Patients with long-standing SSc are at greatest risk for developing PAH; limited cutaneous disease has long been thought to be a risk factor for PAH, particularly in association with the CREST syndrome (<strong>C</strong>alcinosis cutis, <strong>R</strong>aynaud phenomenon, <strong>E</strong>sophageal dysmotility, <strong>S</strong>clerodactyly, and <strong>T</strong>elangiectasia). However, PAH also occurs in patients with diffuse cutaneous disease. Anticentromere antibodies are associated with a higher likelihood of PAH. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8251.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary arterial hypertension in systemic sclerosis (scleroderma): Definition, risk factors, and screening", section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Among patients with SSc and PAH, dyspnea on exertion is the most common initial symptom, but early PAH can be asymptomatic. Patients with advanced PAH may have chest pain due to right ventricular angina, and near-syncope or syncope on exertion due to reduced cardiac reserve. Patients with PH due to ILD typically have profound dyspnea on exertion and a history of ILD. Those with PH due to left heart dysfunction may have other features of myocardial dysfunction such as peripheral edema, palpitations, or syncope. The clinical features of PH associated with SSc are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8249.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension of unclear etiology in adults", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7542.html" rel="external">"Overview of the treatment and prognosis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H544415656"><span class="h3">Thromboembolic disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The risk of pulmonary thromboembolism appears to be increased in patients with SSc compared with the healthy adult population. In a population-based cohort study that included 1895 patients with SSc and 7580 healthy controls, the risk of developing pulmonary thromboembolism was significantly higher in SSc (hazard ratio 7.00; 95% CI 2.64-18.5) after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H544415672"><span class="h3">Pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis and veno-occlusive disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Rare cases have been reported of pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH) and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) in patients with SSc [<a href="#rid8">8-11</a>]. PCH and PVOD may actually be part of a spectrum of one disease rather than two separate entities. A retrospective, histopathologic analysis of explanted lungs showed a frequent finding of PVOD in patients (15 of 18 subjects) with SSc-PH-ILD [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. The clinical and imaging manifestations of PVOD are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8269.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical evaluation, and diagnosis of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis in adults"</a>.)</p><p>PVOD and/or PCH should be suspected in a patient with elevated pulmonary artery pressures and normal or low pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) when imaging studies suggest pulmonary edema. In general, pulse oxygen saturation is lower during a six-minute walk test and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) is higher (typically &gt;45 mmHg) in PVOD than PAH. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8269.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical evaluation, and diagnosis of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H352080950"><span class="h2">Pleural effusion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Pleural effusions have been reported in both diffuse and limited cutaneous scleroderma, but are uncommon (less than 10 percent) and often asymptomatic [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. Among patients with SSc, potential causes of a pleural effusion include pleuritis, heart failure, pericarditis (with tamponade), pneumonia, PCH-PVOD and cancer. Depending on the etiology, the presentation varies from acute onset of pleuritic chest pain (pleuritis) to progressive shortness of breath (heart failure) to an asymptomatic pleural effusion discovered on imaging or at autopsy [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. On physical examination, a pleural friction rub may be heard in patients with SSc-associated pleuritis.</p><p>SSc-associated pleuritis is typically associated with an exudative, lymphocytic effusion [<a href="#rid14">14,15</a>]. No particular association with autoantibodies has been identified [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. When both pleuritis and pericarditis are present, other potential causes include overlap with another rheumatic disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus and drug-induced pleuritis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6704.html" rel="external">"Pleural fluid eosinophilia", section on 'Drugs'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4681.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults", section on 'Chest wall pain'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H352080956"><span class="h2">Spontaneous pneumothorax</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Spontaneous pneumothorax is rare in SSc and usually occurs in patients with ILD [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Rupture of a subpleural bleb is the suspected cause [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. As is typical for secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, the onset of symptoms (eg, shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain) is acute and the diagnosis is made by a chest radiograph. The management of SSc-associated spontaneous pneumothorax is determined by the size of the pneumothorax, response to initial drainage, and the type and severity of underlying lung disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6691.html" rel="external">"Treatment of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H94894849"><span class="h2">Recurrent aspiration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Esophageal dysmotility and chronic gastroesophageal reflux, which are present in the majority of patients with SSc, can lead to aspiration of pharyngeal and gastric contents [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>]. The exact role of recurrent episodes of aspiration in lung disease in SSc is not known, but such episodes may contribute to centrilobular fibrosis and possibly worsening of SSc-associated ILD. One series described six patients with SSc and centrilobular fibrosis (ground glass or consolidative opacities in a patchy centrilobular distribution on high-resolution computed tomography [HRCT]) that was associated with intrabronchial basophilic material consistent with aspirated food or medication; coexisting esophageal abnormalities were noted in all patients [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. In case series, the severity of esophageal disease, assessed by symptoms, pH monitoring, or esophageal manometry, as well as the widest esophageal diameter [<a href="#rid21">21</a>] correlated with abnormalities in pulmonary function tests and/or HRCT, suggesting that recurrent episodes of micro-aspiration may contribute to lung injury in SSc-associated ILD [<a href="#rid19">19,22,23</a>]. Similarly, it is hypothesized that chronic micro-aspiration may contribute to progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

In a series of 46 patients with SSc, airflow limitation (decreased forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity [FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC] with a reduction in FEV<sub>1</sub> below 80 percent predicted) was noted in 5 of 34 nonsmokers (15 percent) and 4 of 12 current or ex-smokers (33 percent) [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].

(See <a class="local">'Interstitial lung disease'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4368.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and diagnosis of interstitial lung disease in systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Features of SSc-associated PH</strong> – PH is suggested by exertional dyspnea, chest pain, presyncope, or syncope, especially in patients with long-standing limited cutaneous scleroderma. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is typically associated with a reduced DLCO (&lt;60 percent predicted) that is decreased out of proportion to the lung volumes (eg, ratio of FVC/DLCO percent predicted &gt;1.6) or a fall in DLCO ≥20 percent in one year. (See <a class="local">'Influence of diffuse cutaneous and limited cutaneous disease'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8251.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary arterial hypertension in systemic sclerosis (scleroderma): Definition, risk factors, and screening"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis and classification of PH</strong> – When PH is suspected after screening evaluation including elevated estimated pulmonary artery pressures (eg, greater than 35 to 40 mmHg) on Doppler echocardiography, we proceed to right-heart catheterization (RHC) for formal diagnosis and classification. The PH classification and subsequent treatment is influenced by the presence, imaging characteristics, and severity of concomitant ILD.
