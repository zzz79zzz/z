Each year, approximately 1.5 million patients in the United States receive LTOT [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>In this topic, the potential benefits and indications for LTOT and practical issues including reimbursement, documentation of need, and the process of prescribing LTOT are reviewed. High-flow nasal cannula, portable oxygen delivery, and oxygen conserving devices are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6394.html" rel="external">"Continuous oxygen delivery systems for the acute care of infants, children, and adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1442.html" rel="external">"Portable oxygen delivery and oxygen conserving devices"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">BENEFITS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Five randomized trials have evaluated the effect of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) on mortality in patients with COPD.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Two of the trials, the Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy Trial (NOTT) and the Medical Research Council (MRC) trial, demonstrated improved survival among patients that received LTOT (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82598" href="/z/d/graphic/82598.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67353" href="/z/d/graphic/67353.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>), including correlation between survival and the average daily duration of oxygen use [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In contrast, three trials (nocturnal oxygen therapy [NOT], supplemental oxygen for moderate hypoxemia, and Long-Term Oxygen Therapy Trial [LOTT]), found no effect of LTOT on survival [<a href="#rid4">4,16</a>]. In NOT, oxygen supplementation did not improve mean pulmonary artery pressures, and in LOTT there were no between-group differences in time to first hospitalization, six-minute walk distance, or respiratory quality of life.</p><p></p><p>An important difference between these trials was the inclusion criteria [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. The trials that demonstrated a survival benefit included patients with more severe resting hypoxemia (arterial oxygen tension [PaO<sub>2</sub>] ≤60 mmHg [7.98 kPa]) or SpO<sub>2</sub> ≤88 percent than the trials that showed no benefit (PaO<sub>2</sub> &lt;69 mmHg [9.18 kPa]), indicating that individuals with less severe hypoxemia may not derive a survival benefit from LTOT. One meta-analysis specifically examined the mortality benefit of nocturnal or continuous supplemental oxygen in 1002 patients with various definitions of moderate hypoxemia (PaO2 56 mmHg to 69 mmHg, SpO2 89 to 93 percent, exertional desaturations between 80 and 90 percent, and/or isolated nocturnal desaturations below 88 percent) [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Compared with placebo, long-term oxygen supplementation showed a small or absent benefit over three years of follow-up (20 versus 22 percent, relative risk 0.91, 95% CI 0.72-1.15) without evidence of heterogeneity among the studies.</p><p>LTOT may improve outcome measures other than mortality, including quality of life, cardiovascular morbidity, depression, cognitive function, exercise capacity, and frequency of hospitalization [<a href="#rid3">3,5-9,18-22</a>]. Improved quality of life was demonstrated in a prospective study that measured health related quality of life (using the St. Georges respiratory questionnaire [SGRQ]) before and after six months of LTOT delivered via a concentrator [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Prior to therapy, health related quality of life was worse among the patients with COPD who had hypoxemia (and had already been receiving LTOT for at least six months via a cylinder), compared to patients with COPD who were not hypoxemic. After six months of LTOT, health-related quality of life had improved and was similar in both groups. This suggests that LTOT may improve quality of life and the improvement is related, at least in part, to the time spent using supplemental oxygen, which also relates to the delivery system(s) used. The effect of combining concentrators and portable devices to improve mobility and further enhance quality of life has yet to be determined. Prescribing oxygen during exertion with highly portable lightweight devices without the support of a pulmonary rehabilitation program may or may not lead to a more active lifestyle, which also impacts quality of life.</p><p>All of the studies described above evaluated the impact of LTOT used during rest and exertion. Controlled trials have also evaluated the impact of supplemental oxygen when used during exertion only. Among patients who have COPD with a resting PaO<sub>2</sub> &gt;60 mmHg (ie, are unlikely to derive a mortality benefit from LTOT), supplemental oxygen improved dyspnea and the distance walked during a five-minute walk test compared to supplemental air [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. However, the results of this study do not support general application of long-term oxygen in this patient population. In a separate study, recovery time following exertion was shorter among the patients who received short burst oxygen [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">ADVERSE EFFECTS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Excess supplemental oxygen increases mortality among acutely ill hospitalized patients, so guidelines suggest specific target ranges in these patients to avoid the adverse effects of excess supplemental oxygen [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. By following the recommendations for a target range for SpO<sub>2</sub> of 90 to 92 percent [<a href="#rid25">25</a>], tissue hypoxia may be prevented while minimizing any deleterious effects associated with oxygen therapy [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>]. More definitive studies are required to better understand how enriched oxygen interacts with cells in the body, under a variety of different circumstances, especially when long-term oxygenation is required. Ideal oxygen targets are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Oxygen flow rate'</a> below.)</p><p>Limited evidence suggests that low grade oxidative injury may occur with LTOT, but the clinical significance is uncertain and it should not preclude administration of LTOT when indicated. In one recent survey of patients on LTOT, adverse effects with the highest reported prevalence were reduced mobility or physical activity (70.9 percent), dry mouth (69.5 percent), congestion or nasal drip (61.6 percent), increased tiredness (57.0 percent), and dry nose (53.0 percent) [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. However, reductions in mobility, physical activity, and poor sleep hygiene are associated with COPD disease progression and the additional impact of LTOT-induced oxidative injury on adverse effects needs further elucidation. These and other adverse effects of oxygen are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1622.html" rel="external">"Adverse effects of supplemental oxygen"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1622.html" rel="external">"Adverse effects of supplemental oxygen", section on 'Adults on long-term oxygen'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Indications for continuous long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) for patients with chronic lung disease include (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76543" href="/z/d/graphic/76543.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid12">12,14,15,29,30</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>) less than or equal to 55 mmHg (7.32 kPa), or a pulse oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) less than or equal to 88 percent</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>PaO<sub>2</sub> less than or equal to 59 mmHg (7.85 kPa), or an SpO<sub>2</sub> less than or equal to 89 percent, if there is evidence of cor pulmonale, right heart failure, or erythrocytosis (hematocrit &gt;55 percent)</p><p></p><p>For patients with normal awake oxygenation, oxygen may be prescribed during sleep if any of the following occur during sleep: the PaO<sub>2</sub> is 55 mmHg or less, the SpO<sub>2</sub> is 88 percent or less, the PaO<sub>2</sub> decreases more than 10 mmHg (1.33 kPa), and/or the SpO<sub>2</sub> decreases more than 5 percent with signs or symptoms of nocturnal hypoxemia (eg, impaired cognitive function, morning headaches, restlessness, or insomnia). In this setting, portable oxygen would not be covered. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7680.html" rel="external">"Sleep-related breathing disorders in COPD"</a>.)</p><p>Oxygen may be prescribed during exercise if there is a reduction of PaO<sub>2</sub> to 55 mmHg or less, or of SpO<sub>2</sub> to 88 percent or less during exercise. Additionally, oxygen may be warranted during exercise even in those patients who do not significantly desaturate during exercise, if they have dyspnea and ventilatory abnormalities during exercise that suggest supplemental oxygen may permit greater exertion [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. This is supported by studies that found that hyperoxia increases exercise endurance in a dose-dependent manner, up to an inspired oxygen fraction of 50 percent or a flow rate of 6 L/min [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].</p><p>The use of supplemental oxygen in the palliative treatment of dyspnea in non-hypoxemic patients is not well supported by the literature. A randomized trial and systematic reviews have found that supplemental oxygen provides no symptomatic benefit beyond room air for patients with dyspnea, but not hypoxemia, due to advanced heart failure or end stage cancer. At this advanced stage, pharmacological management assumes a central role [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14238.html" rel="external">"Assessment and management of dyspnea in palliative care", section on 'Non-hypoxemic patients'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">PRESCRIBING OXYGEN</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Responsibilities of the clinician prescribing long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) include (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77321" href="/z/d/graphic/77321.html" rel="external">table 2</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Determine the need for LTOT and goal for therapy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ascertain the oxygen flow rate for each condition (ie, the required flow rate may be different during sleep, exercise and sedentary wakefulness)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assure the selection of a qualified durable medical equipment supplier</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Complete the Certification of Medical Necessity (eg, CMS 484) for Medicare patients</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Provide a prescription for ambulatory oxygen if required</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Test patients using the portable oxygen system (typically with an oxygen conserving device) provided during typical exercise to assure adequate oxygenation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reassess the need for LTOT for prescription renewal and/or modification</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Educate patients about goals of therapy and safety issues [<a href="#rid34">34,35</a>]</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Determining need</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) should be prescribed only when there is evidence of persistent hypoxemia in a clinically stable patient who is receiving otherwise optimal medical management. Patients who are clinically unstable or whose medical management is not optimized should be prescribed oxygen therapy and reassessed later for their long-term oxygen needs.</p><p>There are specific requirements for determining a patient's need for LTOT that must be met for LTOT in order to be reimbursed:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Arterial blood gas analysis or measurement of pulse oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub> by pulse oximetry) must be performed by a physician or by a qualified laboratory. The intent of this requirement is to prevent the oxygen provider from also being involved in certifying the medical necessity, since this could represent a conflict of interest.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The arterial blood gas or SpO<sub>2</sub> measurement must be obtained within two days of discharge if the oxygen is prescribed at the time of hospital discharge. When arterial blood gas and oximetry studies are both used to document need for supplemental oxygen and the results are conflicting, arterial blood gas results become the preferred source for documentation of medical necessity.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h2">Oxygen flow rate</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although not required by payers, we believe that arterial blood gas measurements should be the standard for consideration of accuracy and to fully assess the arterial tension of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) and acid base status. Performed along with pulse oximetry, ABGs will help to confirm the accuracy of the SpO<sub>2</sub> measurement.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Flow rate during rest</strong> – The flow of oxygen needed to correct hypoxemia should be determined by measurement of PaO<sub>2</sub> or SpO<sub>2</sub> when LTOT is initiated (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73572" href="/z/d/graphic/73572.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). The threshold PaO<sub>2</sub> or SpO<sub>2</sub> that optimally improves survival and quality of life is not known. A PaO<sub>2</sub> of 60 to 65 mmHg (7.98 to 8.65 kPa) or SpO<sub>2</sub> of 90 to 92 percent is generally considered to be an acceptable target [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. This represents clinically "adequate" correction of hypoxemia for most patients and is unlikely to cause significant CO<sub>2</sub> retention. High flow oxygen may cause CO<sub>2</sub> retention and possible oxygen toxicity [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Based on studies in hospitalized patents, efforts should be made to avoid SpO<sub>2</sub> &gt;96 percent [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Adverse effects'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1458.html" rel="external">"The evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of the adult patient with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">One of the early studies that demonstrated increased survival among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who received LTOT raised the mean PaO<sub>2</sub> to 71.3 mmHg (9.48 kPa) [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. In the Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy Trial (NOTT), the investigators attempted to maintain the PaO<sub>2</sub> between 60 and 80 mmHg (7.98 to 10.64 kPa) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Flow rate during exercise/exertion</strong> – It is common for patients with COPD who qualify for LTOT and experience hypoxemia at rest to desaturate further during usual activities of daily living, such as walking. As a result, higher oxygen flows are often necessary during exertion. It is therefore important to determine the exercise oxygen prescription while the patient is walking and to include this information in the oxygen prescription. The difference in oxygen flow necessary to correct hypoxemia at rest and during exercise may be magnified when some of the oxygen conserving devices are being used, especially those that utilize an oxygen pulsing device delivering oxygen intermittently [<a href="#rid37">37,38</a>]. An additional consideration is the use of hyperoxia to improve ventilation, reduce dyspnea, and enable the patient to exercise longer or at higher intensity during training programs [<a href="#rid31">31,39</a>]. Therefore, not only should patients be evaluated for desaturation (hypoxemia), but other outcomes such as dyspnea and exercise improvement during exercise on various O<sub>2</sub> liter flows regardless of a desaturation response. (See <a class="local">'Exercise training'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">With increased availability of finger pulse oximeters, it is commonly recommended that patients titrate their own oxygen flow setting to a target SpO<sub>2</sub>. Considering that some inexpensive oximeters may provide inaccurate readings, it is important that the oximeter purchased is accurate and calibrated against arterial blood gases. This is easily accomplished by having the patient bring the oximeter with them to the clinic and validating against clinic measures (eg, the clinics oximeter or preferably arterial blood gas measures).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Flow rate during sleep</strong> – Among patients prescribed LTOT for daytime hypoxemia, clinicians should determine if higher flows of oxygen are necessary to prevent nocturnal oxygen desaturation. The importance of nocturnal desaturation is uncertain since some persons have oxyhemoglobin desaturation during sleep without daytime sequelae. Nevertheless, most clinicians managing patients who qualify for LTOT because of daytime hypoxemia adjust the flow rate to prevent hypoxemia during sleep. As an example, the oxygen flow was routinely increased by one L/min during sleep in the NOTT trial [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p>Some patients who do not qualify for oxygen when awake may require oxygen therapy during sleep. As many as 30 percent of patients with COPD who have no daytime hypoxemia experience desaturation during sleep [<a href="#rid40">40,41</a>]. In those patients with COPD who have cor pulmonale, right heart failure, or erythrocytosis without evidence of hypoxemia while awake, any period of prolonged desaturation during sleep may potentially be detrimental. Thus, nocturnal monitoring of hypoxemic events and titration of supplemental oxygen are advised. Some patients may have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in addition to their COPD, as a cause of nocturnal desaturation. Overnight polysomnography can help clarify whether OSA is playing a role, and affected patients should be treated for their OSA. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8262.html" rel="external">"Pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease and/or hypoxemia (group 3 pulmonary hypertension): Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnostic evaluation in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7706.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Equipment selection</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinician should also be familiar with the durable medical equipment (DME) providers in the area and encourage the use of those providers who are willing and able to provide the best service and equipment (particularly portable) and to fill the prescription appropriately.</p><p>Every attempt should be made to provide portable or wearable oxygen systems in support of patients striving for an active lifestyle [<a href="#rid34">34,35</a>]. For highly active and mobile patients, the clinician should order ambulatory liquid oxygen, a lightweight aluminum or fiber-wrapped ambulatory cylinder, or a portable oxygen concentrator. Oxygen concentrators are typically less expensive than other forms of LTOT.</p><p>Each of these systems may be combined with an oxygen conserving device or transtracheal catheter to substantially increase the functional time and reduce the size and weight of the unit that the patient carries [<a href="#rid34">34,35</a>]. This requires the clinician to order portable oxygen with or without an oxygen conserving technology, in addition to a stationary LTOT system, although in some cases a portable oxygen concentrator will serve as the stationary as well as the portable system. The proper prescription depends on the individual needs of the patient. The DME supplier might not provide patients with the best available technology unless the clinician has the knowledge and ability to prescribe it. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1442.html" rel="external">"Portable oxygen delivery and oxygen conserving devices"</a>.)</p><p>Portable oxygen is reimbursed if the Medicare patient is mobile in the home and regularly goes beyond the limits of a stationary oxygen delivery system with 50 feet of tubing. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), in the United States, does not consider travel outside of the home in making this determination and also does not recognize a distinction between portable and ambulatory oxygen. The distinction made by the pulmonary community is that ambulatory oxygen delivery systems should weigh less than 10 pounds (4.5 kg) and be easily carried by the patient [<a href="#rid42">42</a>]. This 10 pounds limit is high enough to encompass the use of several portable oxygen concentrators; several portable gas, concentrator, and liquid systems weigh less than 5 pounds. These units should be provided for patients who are highly mobile and active.</p><p>Patients who are ambulatory outside the home and require &gt;3 L/minute of continuous flow oxygen may benefit from liquid oxygen [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Portable liquid oxygen devices provide continuous-flow oxygen up to 15 L/minute via a lighter and longer-duration device than oxygen concentrators.</p><p>Twenty-pound E cylinders with their two-wheeled strollers cannot be carried by the patient and are difficult to maneuver on stairs and on public or private vehicles of transportation. These E cylinders may be prescribed for patients who are less mobile and leave the home only occasionally, or who require the higher storage capability of these cylinders. Additionally, E-cylinders are typically placed in the patient's home as an emergency backup in the event the primary O<sub>2</sub> delivery system fails.</p><p>Oxygen is reimbursed on a prospective payment basis by CMS, and there is no Medicare requirement concerning the type of equipment being provided by the home oxygen supplier. CMS considers all oxygen delivery systems to be equal and "modality neutral" for the purpose of reimbursement. For patients who require portable systems, there is a small additional reimbursement for a "portable add on" device, which must be ordered by the clinician. The portable device provided to the patient will be tested during ambulation by an independent respiratory therapist or physician to assure adequate oxygenation during activity by that device.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Certification of medical necessity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Medicare and most third party carriers will cover home oxygen and oxygen equipment under durable medical equipment benefits when oxygen is considered reasonable and necessary for patients with significant hypoxemia who satisfy all medical documentation, laboratory evidence, and health conditions specified by the Social Security Administration [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The need for oxygen must be determined after optimal medical management is implemented (eg, medical and physical therapy directed at secretions, bronchospasm, and infection).</p><p>The clinician or a member of his or her staff must complete a Certification of Medical Necessity (CMN) and only the clinician can sign the form (<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cms.gov%2FMedicare%2FCMS-Forms%2FCMS-Forms%2Fdownloads%2Fcms484.pdf&amp;token=Rti1NBSWdX%2F%2FH%2FlCKGrzlL2E4vW1%2FdtHixiX4jRUwEeVlcoOLn1Mmee%2Br17y43TswGuHq8DTSDXoNS%2FGqITABVxenr9ddA%2B7SgXL8hjz6I4%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=1445" target="_blank">Certificate of Medical Necessity CMS form 484</a>). The requirement for the clinician to sign the CMS Form 484 was recommended by the Office of the Inspector General of the United States after a five–state survey indicated that the clinician's knowledge of home oxygen therapy and involvement in writing the prescription were often inadequate [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. In many cases, the home oxygen supplier was determining the need for therapy and also supplying the equipment without adequate clinician input. This requirement is intended to assure the clinician's involvement in the prescribing and administration of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT). Further, the same form CMS-484 is used for recertification [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. </p><p>In addition to the CMN, a separate written prescription must be provided to the home oxygen supplier when oxygen is ordered and prior to completion of form 484 (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56045" href="/z/d/graphic/56045.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Ongoing assessment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>With the aid of the durable medical equipment (DME) provider, the clinician should monitor the use of the oxygen by the patient and the environment in which the oxygen is being used.

Some patients may discontinue LTOT because they feel that they are doing better, do not want to become "addicted" to oxygen, or do not want to be seen using their supplemental oxygen. Reassurance can be provided regarding the benefits of LTOT in the setting of hypoxemia and the absence of "addiction" to oxygen. Patients sometimes adjust their oxygen use or flow rate based on symptoms. As the presence or absence of dyspnea is not a good substitute for measurement of pulse oxygen saturation, patients should be encouraged to use LTOT as prescribed.</p><p>Oxygen should not be continued if the patient is unwilling to use it, and advanced ambulatory equipment should not be supplied if the patient is unwilling or unable to be physically active. All patients receiving LTOT must be recertified every 12 months; retesting of PaO<sub>2</sub> or SpO<sub>2</sub> is not required by Medicare but may be required by other third party payers.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h1">REIMBURSEMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the United States, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) does not pay for oxygen as medication. Rather, CMS classifies oxygen and oxygen delivery equipment as durable medical equipment (DME); this definition allows oxygen to be reimbursed as a form of "medical equipment." As a result, a specific Certificate of Medical Necessity (CMN, CMS <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cms.gov%2FMedicare%2FCMS-Forms%2FCMS-Forms%2FDownloads%2FCMS484.pdf&amp;token=Rti1NBSWdX%2F%2FH%2FlCKGrzlL2E4vW1%2FdtHixiX4jRUwEeoPw5nr7SuGoMV64u0gF8OvQAgYhCGvFLPuLTrrvHaE68AtSQsFLDSFqHlsS1NKKs%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=1445" target="_blank">484.5</a>) must be completed by the clinician in order for oxygen therapy to be reimbursed at a level of 80 percent of the Medicare allowable charge. The patient or the supplemental insurance provider is responsible for the remaining 20 percent of the cost. For patients not requiring oxygen at rest but prescribed ambulatory oxygen, the clinician must document three SpO<sub>2</sub> readings: on room air at rest, with exercise, and on the prescribed oxygen setting during exertion.</p><p>Most third party payers also utilize the requirements for medical necessity established by CMS. These requirements are based primarily on the parameters for entry into the multicenter Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy Trial (NOTT) sponsored by the National Institutes of Health [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Indications and guidelines for therapy have been further refined by six national consensus conferences on long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) [<a href="#rid34">34,42,46-49</a>] and the 2020 American Thoracic Society guidelines [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. These guidelines apply not only to hypoxemic patients with COPD, but also to patients whose hypoxemia is due to other disorders, such as chronic interstitial lung disease, chest wall disease, lung cancer, and cardiac disease [<a href="#rid14">14,50</a>].</p><p>Within these guidelines, it is the clinician's responsibility to be involved in selection of appropriate equipment and provision of an individualized prescription that must be transmitted to the DME provider (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56045" href="/z/d/graphic/56045.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>). The prescription must contain several required elements including a specified diagnosis of the disease requiring supplemental oxygen, liter oxygen flow and any changes that may be required for sleep, exercise or other condition, frequency and duration of use, and/or the issuance of portable oxygen devices. "Oxygen PRN" or "Oxygen as needed" do not qualify. The clinician is now instructed not to sign the CMS form (<a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cms.gov%2FMedicare%2FCMS-Forms%2FCMS-Forms%2FDownloads%2FCMS484.pdf&amp;token=Rti1NBSWdX%2F%2FH%2FlCKGrzlL2E4vW1%2FdtHixiX4jRUwEeoPw5nr7SuGoMV64u0gF8OvQAgYhCGvFLPuLTrrvHaE68AtSQsFLDSFqHlsS1NKKs%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=1445" target="_blank">484.5</a>) unless the provider has correctly restated the prescription in Section C.
