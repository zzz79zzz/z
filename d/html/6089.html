There is a long list of causes of microscopic hematuria, most of which are benign, especially in children with isolated asymptomatic microscopic hematuria. The challenge that faces the clinician is to identify the child in whom hematuria is caused by significant underlying disease and avoid unnecessary testing in those individuals with a benign condition.</p><p>The etiology and evaluation of microscopic hematuria in children will be reviewed here. The evaluation of children with gross hematuria is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6108.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of gross hematuria in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">DETECTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hematuria is defined by the presence of an increased number of red blood cells (RBCs) in the urine. Hematuria can either be visible to the naked eye (gross) or apparent only upon urinalysis (microscopic). Microscopic hematuria may be discovered as an incidental finding on an urinalysis prompted by urinary or other symptoms.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Urinary dipstick</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common screening test for hematuria is the urinary dipstick test for blood. Dipsticks for hemoglobin are as sensitive as the urine sediment examination, but result in more false-positive tests. In comparison, false-negative dipstick tests are unusual; as a result, a negative dipstick reliably excludes abnormal hematuria.</p><p>The reagent strip that detects blood utilizes hydrogen peroxide, which catalyzes a chemical reaction between hemoglobin (or myoglobin) and the chromogen tetramethylbenzidine. Different shades of blue-green are produced according to the concentration of hemoglobin in the urine sample. These strips can detect 5 to 10 intact RBCs/microL, which roughly corresponds to a finding on microscopic examination of two to five RBCs per high-power field from the sediment of a centrifuged 10 to 15 mL urine sample.</p><p>False-negative results can occur in the presence of formalin (used in preservatives) or high urinary concentration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C). False-positive results may occur with alkaline urine (ie, pH greater than 9) or contamination with oxidizing agents used to clean the perineum.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Microscopic examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A positive dipstick for hematuria is confirmed by a microscopic examination of the sediment of 10 to 15 mL of centrifuged fresh urine. Microscopic hematuria is defined as the presence of more than five RBCs per high-power field (40x magnification) [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>The microscopic examination is the gold standard for the detection of microscopic hematuria. The procedures for obtaining and processing urine samples in children are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6339.html" rel="external">"Urine collection techniques in infants and children with suspected urinary tract infection"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Glomerular versus nonglomerular bleeding</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Urinalysis including microscopic examination may identify a potential site of bleeding (glomerular versus nonglomerular) and aid in determining the underlying cause. The identification of the glomeruli as the source of blood is important both prognostically and to optimize the subsequent diagnostic evaluation.</p><p>Signs of glomerular bleeding in children with microscopic hematuria include the following  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef65786" href="/z/d/graphic/65786.html" rel="external">table 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Red cell casts (pathognomonic for glomerular disease)  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55778" href="/z/d/graphic/55778.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Protein excretion greater than 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> at a time when there is no gross bleeding. It is optimal to obtain a first morning sample to determine the protein to creatinine ratio because it excludes orthostatic proteinuria, a normal variant. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6091.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of proteinuria in children", section on 'Measurement of urinary protein'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>RBCs having a dysmorphic appearance [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p>Although helpful if present, the absence of these findings does not exclude glomerular disease.</p><p>Morphologic study of urinary RBCs, particularly with a phase-contrast microscope, may be helpful in distinguishing glomerular from nonglomerular bleeding. The presence of more than 30 percent dysmorphic RBCs or of more than 5 percent of a specific form named an "acanthocyte" is highly suggestive of glomerular hematuria  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62064" href="/z/d/graphic/62064.html" rel="external">picture 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef130438" href="/z/d/graphic/130438.html" rel="external">picture 3</a>). However, confident identification of such cells requires expertise in urinalysis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7208.html" rel="external">"Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults", section on 'Glomerular versus nonglomerular bleeding'</a>.)</p><p>In nonglomerular hematuria, microscopic examination demonstrates urinary RBCs with a uniform normal size and shape  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80282" href="/z/d/graphic/80282.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>). However, hypercalciuria, a nonglomerular cause of hematuria, can be associated with dysmorphic RBCs, but not red cell casts.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several population-based studies of unselected school-age children have shown that the prevalence rate for microscopic hematuria detected in a single urine sample is 3 to 4 percent, which falls to 1 percent or less for two or more positive samples [<a href="#rid4">4-6</a>]. Among the 1 percent of children with two or more positive urines for hematuria, only one-third have persistent hematuria, defined as a positive repeat test after six months [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>].</p><p>The combination of hematuria and proteinuria is less common, with a prevalence rate of less than 0.7 percent in unselected school-age children in a single urine sample [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H173801352"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Microscopic hematuria in children can be persistent or transient in nature.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H883674495"><span class="h2">Persistent hematuria</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common causes of persistent microscopic hematuria include glomerulopathies, hypercalciuria, and nutcracker syndrome [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3053.html" rel="external">"Isolated and persistent glomerular hematuria in adults"</a>.)</p><p>The hematuria in these disorders persists for variable periods. The causes of transient hematuria are different. (See <a class="local">'Transient hematuria'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H43199775"><span class="h3">IgA nephropathy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy is diagnosed by kidney biopsy with mesangial IgA deposits on immunofluorescence study  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58102" href="/z/d/graphic/58102.html" rel="external">picture 5</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69895" href="/z/d/graphic/69895.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>). Patients often have persistent microscopic hematuria with episodes of gross hematuria that is precipitated by an upper respiratory tract or gastrointestinal illness. There is typically a negative family history of kidney disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3112.html" rel="external">"IgA nephropathy: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H43199790"><span class="h3">Alport syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Alport syndrome is a hereditary disorder often associated with high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), ocular abnormalities (eg, anterior lenticonus), and progressive kidney failure  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68942 graphicRef79434" href="/z/d/graphic/68942.html" rel="external">picture 7A-B</a>). The genetic abnormality in these patients involves the genes coding for type IV collagen. Classic X-linked Alport syndrome typically affects males. Hemizygous carrier females can also have hematuria, but less frequently have progressive kidney disease. There are also autosomal recessive and dominant forms which affect both males and females. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6093.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of Alport syndrome (hereditary nephritis)"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6086.html" rel="external">"Genetics, pathogenesis, and pathology of Alport syndrome (hereditary nephritis)"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H43199797"><span class="h3">Thin basement membrane disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We usually discover thin basement membrane (TBM) disease, also called benign familial hematuria, in affected children when hematuria is detected in a first-degree family member during evaluation. Often, we make the diagnosis in children with a family history of hematuria and no history of progressive kidney disease. </p><p>Although rarely indicated, kidney biopsy reveals an isolated thinning of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) on electron microscopy  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55486" href="/z/d/graphic/55486.html" rel="external">picture 8</a>). </p><p>TBM disease is an autosomal dominant condition involving genes for type IV collagen. In many cases, it is the heterozygous form of autosomal recessive Alport syndrome. At our institution, children with TBM disease undergo genetic screening, as there is a high likelihood that these children have pathogenic variants in the genes for type IV collagen. This approach is supported by a study of 97 children with persistent microscopic hematuria, 28 (29 percent) of whom were found to have pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in type IV collagen genes [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3038.html" rel="external">"Thin basement membrane nephropathy (benign familial hematuria)"</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H43199804"><span class="h3">Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although the clinical presentation of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis varies from asymptomatic, microscopic hematuria to the full-blown acute nephritic syndrome, asymptomatic microscopic hematuria is the most common clinical finding. There is usually an antecedent history of a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) skin or throat infection. The diagnosis is based on transient lowering of complement C3 levels +/- positivity of anti-factor B antibodies [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Hematuria generally resolves within three to six months after the presentation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6118.html" rel="external">"Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H43199821"><span class="h3">Hypercalciuria</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hypercalciuria, defined in children as a urine calcium/creatinine ratio &gt;0.2 (mg/mg) in children older than six years of age, has been associated with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria. In studies performed in the United States, the prevalence has ranged from as low as 11 percent in the northeast [<a href="#rid9">9</a>] to as high as 35 percent in the south [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. Thus, the association between hypercalciuria and hematuria may be more common in areas where there is a higher prevalence of nephrolithiasis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6123.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in children: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H813764027"><span class="h3">Nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children with nephrolithiasis typically present with abdominal pain and gross hematuria. However, asymptomatic patients with nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis occasionally will present with microscopic hematuria. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6123.html" rel="external">"Kidney stones in children: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6125.html" rel="external">"Nephrocalcinosis in neonates"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7209.html" rel="external">"Nephrocalcinosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H43199828"><span class="h3">Nutcracker syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Nutcracker syndrome results from the compression of the left renal vein between the aorta and proximal superior mesenteric artery. It is detected by Doppler ultrasonographic assessment of left renal vein diameter and peak velocity or by computer tomography [<a href="#rid12">12-14</a>]. In addition, nutcracker syndrome can be associated with a ratio &gt;0.6 between the aortomesenteric angle (the angle between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery) in upright and supine positions. </p><p>Nutcracker syndrome often presents in children with asymptomatic hematuria, but may be associated with left flank pain [<a href="#rid12">12,13,15</a>]. Nutcracker syndrome can also cause orthostatic proteinuria in children  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108965" href="/z/d/graphic/108965.html" rel="external">image 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108966" href="/z/d/graphic/108966.html" rel="external">image 2</a>). These findings are supported by a systematic review of 423 children with nutcracker syndrome and a mean age of 12 years, which reported hematuria as the most common presenting symptom (55.5%), followed by proteinuria (49.9%) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Flank pain was only detected in 19.1% of patients. Another systematic review of 159 patients ≤17 years of age with nutcracker syndrome reported that two-thirds of the patients were asymptomatic [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. A left-sided varicocele was noted in one-third of affected boys. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3111.html" rel="external">"Orthostatic (postural) proteinuria", section on 'Left renal vein entrapment'</a>.)</p><p>These patients are usually managed conservatively with a focus on weight gain to increase retroperitoneal fat, which leads to decompression of the left renal vein due to a change in the position of the left kidney [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. If symptoms of significant left flank pain persist, reported interventions include endovascular stenting or open surgery with left renal vein transposition but repeated interventions may be necessary [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H43199854"><span class="h2">Transient hematuria</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The distribution of causes of transient hematuria is much larger and includes urinary tract infection (UTI) (which is typically accompanied by dysuria and pyuria), trauma, fever, and exercise. The supporting data are presented separately in the adult section  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108356" href="/z/d/graphic/108356.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7208.html" rel="external">"Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults", section on 'Transient or persistent hematuria'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3109.html" rel="external">"Exercise-induced hematuria"</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H173801409"><span class="h1">EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnostic evaluation depends upon the clinical presentation, which falls into the following three clinical settings:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Asymptomatic isolated microscopic hematuria</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria with proteinuria</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Symptomatic microscopic hematuria</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Asymptomatic isolated microscopic hematuria</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Asymptomatic isolated microscopic hematuria is the most common presentation of microscopic hematuria. It is usually transient and is generally not associated with significant clinical disease. As a result, our approach starts with initial observation with repeated examination and urinalyses to determine if there is persistent hematuria  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef56645" href="/z/d/graphic/56645.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>).(See <a class="local">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p>This approach is supported by the landmark 1979 study of an unselected population of 8954 children who were screened for hematuria. Among the 28 patients (0.3 percent) with two or more urine samples that tested positive for blood, extensive evaluation was performed including kidney biopsy and intravenous pyelogram [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. A cause was found in only five: two with immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy, one with thin basement membrane (TBM) disease, and two with uretero-pelvic stenosis.</p><p>In addition, retrospective reviews of patients referred to tertiary centers for evaluation of asymptomatic isolated microscopic hematuria demonstrated standard laboratory and imaging evaluations were unnecessary, as they typically failed to detect any abnormality. This was illustrated by the following two observations:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a study of 325 children, serum creatinine and electrolyte concentrations were normal in all 254 patients who were tested [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. No clinically significant findings were detected in the 283 patients who underwent ultrasonography. Hypercalciuria was present in 11 percent of the 263 patients whose urine was tested for urinary calcium/creatinine ratio. (See <a class="local">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In another series of 342 children, evaluation included complete blood count, urinalysis, serum creatinine, complement component 3 (C3), and ultrasonography or intravenous pyelography [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. No diagnosis was made in 80 percent of patients. Among those with positive findings, the most common was hypercalciuria in the absence of stone disease in 16 percent of the total group.</p><p></p><p>These findings have led to recommendations for observation of children with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria with normal physical examinations. Extensive diagnostic evaluation including laboratory testing is reserved only in children with proteinuria, hypertension, or gross hematuria [<a href="#rid9">9,20,21</a>].</p><p>The following is our recommended approach to children with asymptomatic isolated microscopic hematuria based upon the available literature  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef56645" href="/z/d/graphic/56645.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1,2,4,5,9,22</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Evaluation including blood pressure measurement and a urinalysis should be performed weekly for two weeks.
