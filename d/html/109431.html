The hallmarks of vascular injury and its sequelae include difficulty obtaining immediate proximal control and adequate exposure, repairing injury in the face of contamination, managing the consequences of ischemia to critical end organs, and providing long-term surveillance to follow-up for patency. </p><p>The general principles for identifying and managing abdominal vascular injury are reviewed here. The initial management of the patient with blunt or penetrating abdominal injury that might result in vascular injury is reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/348.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of blunt abdominal trauma in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/356.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of abdominal stab wounds in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/352.html" rel="external">"Initial evaluation and management of abdominal gunshot wounds in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1438331699"><span class="h1">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The approach to the patient differs in many respects depending upon the mechanism of injury (ie, blunt versus penetrating). Blunt abdominal trauma can result in diffuse arterial injury while injuries related to penetrating mechanisms occur along the trajectory of the projectile(s). But whereas a knife will only cause direct tissue injury to the location(s) through which it has traveled, gunshot wounds can also cause a significant blast effect in the surrounding tissues. </p><p>Blunt injury to the abdominal aorta is much less common compared with blunt injury to the thoracic aorta, occurring in &lt;0.1 percent of blunt injury patients [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Blunt injuries to the aorta may arise from compression between a seat belt and the spinal column (ie, seat belt aorta), which may be associated with other compression injuries (ie, seat belt syndrome) such as vertebral (Chance) fracture, solid organ (kidney, spleen), intestinal or pancreatic injuries, and abdominal wall injury (rectus abdominis rupture, abdominal wall disruption) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Injury to the duodenum or pancreas can be also result in injuries to the superior mesenteric artery, superior mesenteric vein, inferior vena cava, or portal vein, particularly in the setting of penetrating trauma. Blunt mechanisms can result in intimal injuries to these vessels but rarely result in full-thickness injury or transection. </p><p>Penetrating injuries to the solid organs (ie, spleen, liver, and kidneys) can significantly destroy the major arterial supply and venous drainage. Blunt forces cause vascular injuries usually by stretching of the arteries causing intimal tears, with larger tears at risk for thrombosis and/or embolization downstream to the end organ. However, this is rare, occurring more commonly with the renal arteries. The vasculature within solid organs can be significantly disrupted by either mechanism, producing significant lacerations, pseudoaneurysms, or arteriovenous (AV) fistulas. </p><p>Pelvic fracture can be associated with iliac vessel injury with potential bleeding from branches of the internal iliac arteries and veins. However, bleeding causing hemodynamic instability in the setting of pelvic fracture is most commonly due to hemorrhage from the pelvic venous plexus. Transpelvic gunshot wounds can cause partial- or full-thickness injuries to the aortoiliac vessels depending upon the trajectory and blast effect. Contamination from associated rectal injuries complicates repair options. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2715602736"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H191271327"><span class="h2">Initial findings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinical features associated with abdominal vascular injury are generally nonspecific and can include abdominal distention/pain, back/flank pain, signs of end-organ ischemia (eg, abdominal pain), or signs of ongoing blood loss (eg, hypotension, tachycardia, diaphoresis). </p><p>Abdominal distention related to blood loss into the abdominal cavity (ie, hemoperitoneum) from vascular injury is usually associated with hemodynamic instability. Findings of abdominal bruising (eg, seat belt sign), flank bruising (Grey-Turner sign) or scrotal ecchymosis are also nonspecific. Seat belt sign may be associated with "seat belt aorta," with aortic injury that can range from intimal tear to aortic rupture [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Flank or scrotal ecchymosis may indicate retroperitoneal bleeding. If retroperitoneal injury is associated with violation of the retroperitoneum such as with penetrating injury, significant hemorrhage will freely enter into the peritoneal cavity, rapidly leading to shock. Blunt injuries often remain contained in the retroperitoneum, but free anterior rupture can also occur. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15588.html" rel="external">"Overview of the diagnosis and initial management of traumatic retroperitoneal injury"</a>.)</p><p>Minor intimal injury or low-grade solid organ parenchymal injury is not appreciated on clinical examination, but a high degree of suspicion based on mechanism of injury and physical exam may provide clues to its presence. As examples, splenic or hepatic injury may be suspected, depending on the side impacted in motor vehicle accident, and diminished or absent femoral pulses or scrotal hematoma can suggest bleeding from the pelvis. Such findings warrant further investigation. </p><p>A diagnosis of abdominal vascular injury is typically heralded by finding free fluid on focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) in the emergency department. However, injuries limited to the retroperitoneum have no or only a small amount of free blood in the intraperitoneal cavity. Significant retroperitoneal venous injuries, such those involving the retrohepatic inferior vena cava, can be subtle, with patients presenting initially with no signs or only with transient hypotension that is responsive to resuscitation. Such patients are at high risk for sudden cardiovascular collapse. </p><p>In hemodynamically unstable patients, the type and location of abdominal vascular injury is definitively determined in the operating room in the context of damage control surgery. For hemodynamically stable patients, advanced vascular imaging is usually needed to confirm suspected vascular injury. (See <a class="local">'Abdominal/retroperitoneal exploration'</a> below and <a class="local">'Advanced vascular imaging'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2389531922"><span class="h2">Delayed presentations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The incidence and timing of delayed presentations are unknown, as these are overall rare. Subtle injury to the abdominal aorta can be asymptomatic and found incidentally on admission imaging. Traumatic intimal tears can manifest as intimal flaps, which can be complicated by thromboembolism and distal ischemia to extremities. (See <a class="local">'Hemodynamically stable'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/112120.html" rel="external">"Embolism to the lower extremities"</a>.)</p><p>Unless an injury to the superior mesenteric artery has caused complete occlusion, mesenteric ischemia does not typically present acutely. Delayed presentations may be related to thrombosis or progression of a dissection. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2559.html" rel="external">"Overview of intestinal ischemia in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/96754.html" rel="external">"Acute mesenteric arterial occlusion"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/91220.html" rel="external">"Mesenteric venous thrombosis in adults"</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1308364985"><span class="h2">Advanced vascular imaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Suspected abdominal vascular injury in a hemodynamically stable patient requires advanced vascular imaging. It is not uncommon to need more than one imaging modality to diagnose abdominal vascular injury. The choice depends upon the patient's clinical condition, physical examination findings, and availability. </p><p>Computed tomographic (CT) angiography with intravascular contrast is widely available and the most sensitive initial study to evaluate for abdominal vascular injury in the hemodynamically stable patient [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. CT angiography relies on contrast extravasation to demonstrate active bleeding. Thus, abdominal vascular injury cannot be reliably ruled out without the use of contrast. CT angiography has a very low risk for renal toxicity and should generally not be withheld if there is a significant risk of detecting abdominal vascular injury [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Surveillance of vascular injuries can be safely performed using repeat CT angiography within 24 to 72 hours. If iodinated contrast cannot be safely administered (eg, severe allergy, renal dysfunction) and noncontrast CT is performed, vascular injury may be suspected if hematoma is seen in the area of concern. </p><p>It is important to remember that patients with potentially significant vascular injury who appear hemodynamically stable and who are taken for CT angiography are at high risk for rapid hemodynamic decompensation. A decision to proceed to the CT scanner depends upon resources, time, and distance required to travel to the scanner. At the very least, placing a common femoral arterial catheter for more sensitive hemodynamic monitoring prior to leaving the resuscitation suite is wise. An additional benefit to this practice is the ability to rapidly upsize the arterial catheter for resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA). In institutions where REBOA is part of clinical practice, the catheter may be inserted prior to CT, allowing for rapid balloon inflation in the event of hemodynamic collapse. (See <a class="local">'Role of REBOA'</a> below.)</p><p>Conventional catheter-based aortography, which has been used for decades to identify vascular injury, has certain advantages over CT angiography. Aortography is a dynamic study permitting direct visualization of flow through the vessels in real time, particularly in areas of injury causing potential stenosis. In comparison, CT angiography is a static study and represents the presence of contrast at one point in time (or several, depending on phases). The contrast column and visualization of vasculature depends upon cardiac output, contrast concentration, and the timing of the scan. The presence of contrast above and below an area of injury on CT angiography does not guarantee a lesion is not flow-limiting. </p><p>Catheter-based aortography also allows the option for treatment once a diagnosis has been made. Aortography can be performed through common femoral, brachial, or radial access depending upon the location of the suspected injury and anticipated ease of access. </p><p>Aortography unfortunately requires a large contrast load and results in increased radiation exposure to the operator, staff, and patient. Further disadvantages to conventional catheter-based angiography include the inability to distinguish small intimal tears or lesions (more likely to be seen with CT angiography) that would prompt medical therapies and surveillance, rather than intervention. Such minimal injuries are more likely to be missed if imaging quality is suboptimal; some portable C-arm units are inferior to fixed, high-resolution fluoroscopy units in many anatomic areas. </p><p>Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is most sensitive for detecting lesions within the vessel lumen (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef117744" href="/d/graphic/117744.html" rel="external">image 1</a>) as all layers of the vessel can be seen. IVUS is found to be more sensitive than CT angiography or conventional catheter-based angiography for identifying these lesions [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. IVUS is very useful for diagnosing aortic injury and aiding stent-graft placement [<a href="#rid6">6</a>], particularly if a CT angiogram was not performed prior to intervention. </p><p>Duplex ultrasound for emergency diagnosis of abdominal aortic injury is not common, and limitations are largely due to patient anatomy and operator-dependent expertise in abdominal ultrasound imaging, as well as availability. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2913801857"><span class="h2">Vascular injury grading</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The overall severity of injury is reflected in the abdominal vascular injury scale (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118852" href="/d/graphic/118852.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). The injury grades correlate with increasing morbidity and mortality, which are lower for smaller vessels, and for venous injury compared to arterial injuries of the same size.</p><p>The management of a specific arterial injury depends on the extent of the damage to the vessel. Injury grading is best illustrated for blunt thoracic aortic injury [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. Such a scheme can be extended to serve as a framework for managing other arterial injuries, particularly the abdominal aorta, but possibly others as well. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15234.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of blunt thoracic aortic injury"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Type I: Intimal injury</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Type II: Intramural hematoma</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Type III: Pseudoaneurysm</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Type IV: Rupture (eg, periaortic hematoma, free rupture)</p><p></p><p>Minimal injuries, which have become more prevalent with the use of high-resolution CT angiography, include isolated intimal (type I) defects without extravasation. </p><p>Abdominal aortic injuries can be classified by anatomic zone, which is also used to designate placement of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116317" href="/d/graphic/116317.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Zone I: from the diaphragm to the superior mesenteric artery</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Zone II: from the superior mesenteric artery to the renal arteries</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Zone III: below the renal arteries to the bifurcation</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H92903426"><span class="h1">APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3741660600"><span class="h2">Hemodynamically unstable</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hemodynamically unstable patients who are at high risk for major abdominal vascular injury should be taken to a hybrid operating room, or alternatively, an operating room equipped with a radiolucent imaging table and vascular C-arm to maximize the options for managing the injury.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1642770109"><span class="h3">Role of REBOA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The role of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) in patients with abdominal hemorrhage and hemodynamic instability is one of temporization and augmentation, providing time for thoughtful, prompt intervention and treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16863.html" rel="external">"Endovascular methods for aortic control in trauma"</a>.)</p><p>In the event of arrest from hemorrhage from a <strong>subdiaphragmatic</strong> source, REBOA can be used in place of resuscitative thoracotomy and aortic cross-clamping. REBOA is contraindicated when there is high suspicion for thoracic aortic injury. Clinical investigations of REBOA suggest a potential survival benefit, particularly in patients who are hypotensive but not yet in cardiac arrest [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. However, complications from REBOA are significant and can include vascular injury, balloon rupture and loss of hemorrhage control, and distal ischemia, which can result in amputation [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Guidewires and catheters, when placed blindly in the resuscitation area, have the potential to migrate out of a large arterial injury [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Tactile feedback and imaging help determine if this occurs. The duration of occlusion, systemic complications, and the role of intermittent or partial aortic occlusion are some of the ongoing investigations. The precise role of REBOA has yet to be elucidated. </p><p>In patients with hemodynamic instability, REBOA can be used to provide proximal control prior to or during abdominal exploration, or as an adjunct to pelvic stabilization, pelvic packing, and/or angioembolization. The balloon can be inserted and inflated in zone I at the distal thoracic aorta (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef118199" href="/d/graphic/118199.html" rel="external">image 2</a>) for presumed abdominal injury and in zone III at the aortic bifurcation (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef118200" href="/d/graphic/118200.html" rel="external">image 3</a>) for patients for patients with pelvic or junctional bleeding (ie, groin region) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The ability to perform this procedure at the bedside in the resuscitation area is one of its greatest advantages as an adjunct to other hemorrhage control measures. Another distinct advantage is the ability to obtain access and achieve aortic control early in the shock phase, ideally prior to the onset of arrest or irreversible shock. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4004141417"><span class="h3">Abdominal/retroperitoneal exploration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For hemodynamically unstable patients, abdominal exploration is performed in the context of damage control surgery, and the goals are to first contain hemorrhage, limit contamination, and maintain flow to vital organs and the extremities (ie, temporary shunting as needed). </p><p>Patient preparation should include the abdomen and both groins to near-circumferential mid-thigh. Midline incisions should stop proximal to the pubic symphysis in the event that a femoral-femoral bypass is required to revascularize the lower extremity. Once the abdomen is opened, bleeding due to intra-abdominal vascular injury is systematically explored following initial packing procedures. Damage control principles with vascular shunting are warranted in patients with complete physiologic devastation and competing injuries, and should be considered for any vascular injury that can accommodate a shunt or temporary stent-graft, including the aorta, mesenteric, and iliofemoral arteries as long as patency and distal perfusion can be monitored [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Prior to repair of specific arterial injuries, any shunts that have been placed are removed once appropriate exposure and proximal and distal control have been achieved. Management of specifically identified injuries is discussed below. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15148.html" rel="external">"Overview of damage control surgery and resuscitation in patients sustaining severe injury", section on 'Damage control laparotomy'</a> and <a class="local">'Repair of specific vascular injuries'</a> below.)</p><p>Whether to explore the retroperitoneum depends upon the mechanism of injury and the affected retroperitoneal zone (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110393" href="/d/graphic/110393.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15588.html" rel="external">"Overview of the diagnosis and initial management of traumatic retroperitoneal injury", section on 'Retroperitoneal zones'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15588.html" rel="external">"Overview of the diagnosis and initial management of traumatic retroperitoneal injury", section on 'Surgical approach by zone'</a>):</p><p>In summary:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hematoma in retroperitoneal zone I, which contains the aorta, inferior vena cava, celiac axis, and the origin of the mesenteric arteries, should be explored. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hematoma in retroperitoneal zone II (contains the renal vessels and renal parenchyma) and zone III (contains the iliac vessels) hematomas due to <strong>blunt</strong> mechanisms should be explored only if the hematoma is expanding, pulsatile, or there is evidence of distal ischemia (eg, no palpable femoral pulse). In general, penetrating mechanisms should be explored if the hematoma is expanding. Some isolated penetrating injuries to the kidneys can be managed nonoperatively if the patient is stable and the hematoma is not expanding.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hematoma in retroperitoneal zone III due to penetrating mechanisms should also be explored [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. </p><p></p><p>In the setting of contamination, temporary endovascular repair should at least be considered for injuries requiring repair with synthetic grafts, even if complete exposure and hemorrhage control has already occurred. This includes aortoiliac and mesenteric injury.</p><p>An alternative to exploration for vascular injury in the setting of nonexpanding retroperitoneal hematoma in all zones is arteriography, with the understanding that while this approach can be used to diagnose and treat arterial injury, major venous injuries will not be diagnosed. This is most efficiently achieved in the operating room where the patient in undergoing exploration (ie, hybrid room, or fluoroscopy with C-arm). In this manner, arteriography can be performed immediately after the damage control operation without delay or patient transport.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3017407305"><span class="h2">Hemodynamically stable</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Hemodynamically stable patients with vascular injury should be evaluated for treatment based on the degree of injury and prognosis (eg, intimal tear, small pseudoaneurysm). When abdominal vascular injury is not life-threatening (ie, the injury is not causing severe hemorrhage or ischemia), and other injuries are more significant and require urgent treatment, management of the vascular injury can be deferred. Intimal tears can be treated with antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation if deemed significant. Frequent assessment of distal perfusion and imaging surveillance is recommended. Medical management of vascular injury in the setting of severe multiple trauma requires consideration of competing injuries (eg, traumatic brain injury), which may contraindicate antithrombotic therapy.

A vein retractor can be used to mobilize the renal vein superiorly to clamp the aorta just below the renal arteries. Alternatively, aortic balloon occlusion can be used and the balloon repositioned as needed with the position confirmed with palpation and visual inspection. </p><p>Small defects or injuries in the aortic wall can be repaired primarily with polypropylene (eg, Prolene) suture while larger defects may require patching with autologous or synthetic material. Significant defects to the aorta may require complete interposition repair with a synthetic graft. Attention should be paid to the diameter of the final lumen to ensure that minimal to no narrowing has occurred. Large changes in the caliber of the aorta can result in dissection flaps and/or thrombus formation, as well as increased tension on the anastomosis. </p><p>Injuries to this infrarenal aorta can be repaired primarily with synthetic graft materials [<a href="#rid20">20</a>] or may be amenable to endovascular stent repair if there is an acceptable proximal landing zone below the main renal arteries (ie, not in close proximity to origins of visceral vessels) (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76498" href="/d/graphic/76498.html" rel="external">image 4</a>). Advantages of endovascular repair include management of injuries that are difficult to expose by conventional means, and the ability to fix the vessel from within, which is helpful in cases with gross contamination, which can jeopardize aortic grafts due to risk of infection. </p><p>Rarely, an aortic injury occurs where the proximal and distal landing zones place branch vessels at risk, and while a stent-graft is an excellent and minimally invasive treatment option, fenestrated and branched aortic stent-grafts are generally not available in emergency circumstances since these are generally custom-designed devices.

Small lesions noted on computed tomographic (CT) angiography without hematoma or thrombosis can be managed with antiplatelet therapy and surveillance. Larger lesions at the origin seen on CT angiography can be treated with endovascular therapy if a guidewire appropriately sized for the device platform can be passed beyond the injury. Patients who have significant hemorrhage due to celiac injury at the time of exploration can should be treated with primary repair, if possible, but most patients tolerate celiac artery ligation if needed [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].

The segmental renal arteries are end arteries, and their ligation will result in distal renal ischemia (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef115656" href="/d/graphic/115656.html" rel="external">image 7</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef114620" href="/d/graphic/114620.html" rel="external">image 8</a>); however, ligation is preferred over nephrectomy.

The ureters should be identified to avoid injury. Proximal vascular control can be achieved with clamps, vessel loops, or balloon occlusion through the injury or remotely through the common femoral artery. Distal external iliac artery injuries may require dissection and distal control by dividing the inguinal ligament for optimal exposure. Shunting vascular injuries in patients with complete physiologic devastation and competing injuries is warranted [<a href="#rid14">14</a>] so long as patency and distal perfusion is monitored in short intervals. For injuries to the common iliac arteries, temporary balloon control (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef118202" href="/d/graphic/118202.html" rel="external">picture 4</a>) followed by stent-grafting is an option, particularly when there is abdominal contamination. </p><p>When common iliac artery injuries have caused complete transection and loss of significant length, interposition grafts can be used for repair. Reversed great saphenous vein is usually inadequate in caliber to be a substitute for the common iliac, and spliced veins are too time consuming. For iliac vein interposition, the femoral vein is a more appropriate size match and can be time consuming to harvest but can be used when the patient's physiology allows. However, most patients with this injury type are in profound shock or may have other serious injuries, necessitating a damage control approach to revascularization. A biologic or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE; eg, Gore-Tex) graft, covered with omentum, is expedient. Deep femoral vein becomes a better option when returning to operating room for definitive repair, particularly if a field has become contaminated. Biologic grafts such as bovine carotid (eg, Artegraft) or cadaveric vein (eg, CryoVein) are other options. There are no data regarding long-term patency of these biologics. </p><p>For injuries to the external iliac arteries, stent-grafts are adequate if short in length. Stenting near the inguinal ligament increases the risk of stent failure due to the range of motion in that area but is less of an issue with self-expanding grafts compared with balloon-expandable stents. Options for open repair include the above grafts, as well as ligation of the distal ipsilateral hypogastric and primary anastomosis to the native external iliac artery (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef118203" href="/d/graphic/118203.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>).

Hemostatic agents and gentle pressure or some simple sutures can be effective as this is a low-pressure vessel. For large injuries, care must be taken to prevent significant luminal narrowing leading to thromboembolic events, including complete occlusion. For patients in extremis, ligation of the infrarenal IVC can be considered.
