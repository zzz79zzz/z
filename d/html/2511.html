         Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is an inherited form of diffuse-type gastric cancer (DGC), a highly invasive tumor that is characterized by late presentation and a poor prognosis. HDGC is defined by the presence of a pathogenic germline variant in the cadherin 1 (
         <em>
          CDH1)
         </em>
         or alpha-1 catenin (also known as alpha-E-catenin;
         <em>
          CTNNA1)
         </em>
         gene in either an isolated individual with DGC, or in a family with one or more DGC cases in first-degree or second-degree relatives [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Lobular breast cancer and nonsyndromic cleft lip/palate are also part of the HDGC syndrome. The term hereditary lobular breast cancer (HLBC) has been proposed as the presence of a pathogenic germline CDH1 variant in either an isolated individual with LBC, or a family with one or more LBC cases in first-degree or second-degree relatives, but no known DGC in either situation.
        </p>
        <p>
         These pathogenic variants are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The lifetime risk of gastric cancer in individuals from families with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in
         <em>
          CDH1
         </em>
         is very high, and diagnosis has been made in individuals in their teens and early 20s. As a result, prophylactic total gastrectomy (PTG) is usually advised, generally between ages 20 and 30. Recommendations are less clear for those with pathogenic or likely pathogenic
         <em>
          CTNNA1
         </em>
         variants, as penetrance is uncertain.

        <p>
         This topic will provide a detailed overview of HDGC, focusing on the identification of high-risk families and genetic counseling and testing. The pathology and molecular pathogenesis of this disorder and technical aspects of PTG for patients with HDGC are presented separately. (See

         HDGC is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with high penetrance. The pathogenic germline variants occur in one of two genes,
         <em>
          CDH1
         </em>
         and
         <em>

         Germline truncating pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants of the cadherin 1 (
         <em>
          CDH1
         </em>
         ) gene, located on chromosome 16q22.1, were originally described in three Maori families from New Zealand that were predisposed to DGC. Subsequently, germline
         <em>
          CDH1
         </em>
         pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants have been identified in approximately 15 to 50 percent of affected kindreds that meet the historic clinical criteria for HDGC, initially defined by the International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium (IGCLC) [
         <a href="#rid2">

         The wide range of
         <em>
          CDH1
         </em>
         pathogenic variant estimates has to do with both the background incidence of gastric cancer and the criteria that have been used to define the syndrome:

         </span>
         For the most part, the frequency of detection of pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants varies inversely with the background incidence of gastric cancer. Thus, detection rates for a
         <em>
          CDH1
         </em>
         pathogenic and likely pathogenic variant in families meeting the historic HDGC criteria [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2

         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ], lower in moderate-incidence countries like Germany (25 percent), and lowest in high-incidence countries like Portugal and Italy (22.2 percent) [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>

         <a href="#rid4">
          4

         <a href="#rid2">

         <em>

         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. However, across 144 HDGC probands who lacked a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant, other potential candidate pathogenic variants were identified in 16 (11 percent), including those in
         <em>
          CTNNA1
         </em>
         (the gene for alpha-catenin),
         <em>
          BRCA2

         (the gene associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome),
         <em>

         variants from clinical testing have been deposited into ClinVar, a freely accessible, public archive of variants and associated phenotypes with supporting evidence [

          10

         <em>

         </em>
         variants have been expertly curated through the
         <em>

         variant curation expert panel of ClinGen, a partnered resource that curates the clinical relevance of genes and variants and archives the results of interpretation by recognized expert panels and providers of practice guidelines [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Efforts of the ClinGen expert working group have been to create specific
         <em>
          CDH1
         </em>
         variant calling guidelines to standardize variant calling and review variants according to these guidelines in order to improve patient care [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, new molecular assays such as clinical RNA studies have been shown to help elucidate variant pathogenicity in

         [

         Previously, over 155 different germline
         <em>
          CDH1
         </em>
         pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants had been identified through testing of families meeting HDGC criteria; however, variants in
         <em>
          CDH1
         </em>
         continue to be identified in individuals through broad panel testing of probands without clear HDGC phenotypes, thus impacting variant classifications [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,8,12
         </a>
         ]. As such, some variants, like missense variants, that may previously have had pathogenic assertions in the literature based on functional evidence are being reexamined according to updated specifications for variant calling in
         <em>
          CDH1
         </em>
         [
         <a href="#rid12">

         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         The majority of HDGC-associated pathogenic variants are single nucleotide substitutions leading to truncating pathogenic variants or splice site variants; less commonly, there are insertions or deletions of several base-pairs leading to frameshifts with protein truncation. Approximately 5 percent of familial cases are due to structural variants including large rearrangements and large deletions involving multiple exons of the gene [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,14
         </a>
         ]. All germline pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants are evenly distributed along the gene and lead to functional haploinsufficiency of the cadherin 1 (also known as E-cadherin) protein.

         <em>

         is a tumor suppressor gene, and therefore a somatic second hit is required for initiation of tumor formation. The triggers and molecular mechanisms by which the second allele of the
         <em>
          CDH1
         </em>
         gene is inactivated appear to be diverse, and include promoter hypermethylation, mutation, and loss of heterozygosity. The end result is loss of expression of the cell adhesion molecule cadherin 1. This topic is discussed in more detail elsewhere [

         by age 80 years are 37 to 42 percent for males and 25 to 33 percent for females. These estimates are derived from

         pathogenic and likely pathogenic variant-positive kindreds identified through commercial testing for hereditary cancer risk using multigene panel testing, unselected for HDGC clinical criteria [

         The wide range of penetrance estimates in different clinical scenarios underscores the need for consideration of personal and family history in determining management plans.

         The average age of onset of gastric cancer is 38 years, although it ranges from 14 to 82 years. Prophylactic gastrectomy is often advised as early as age 20. (See
         <a class="local">

        </p>
        <p>
         The gastric cancers that develop in these individuals are often multifocal and located beneath an intact mucosal surface, making endoscopic identification difficult. (See

         Histologically, individual tumor cells are seen to invade the surrounding tissues, and there is no gland formation. In most cases, intracellular mucin is abundant, and it pushes aside the nucleus of the individual cells, resulting in the so-called signet ring carcinoma. (See

         Although lobular breast cancers can occur in individuals with HDGC, the term hereditary lobular breast cancer (HLBC) has been defined by the presence of a pathogenic germline
         <em>
          CDH1

         variant in either an isolated individual with LBC, or a family with one or more LBC cases in first-degree or second-degree relatives, but no known DGC in either situation [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         <em>
          CDH1
         </em>
         pathogenic variants can cosegregate with invasive LBC in the absence of diffuse gastric cancer [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ], rates of occult gastric carcinoma in such individuals who elect risk-reducing total gastrectomy are high (94 percent in one series [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29
         </a>
         ]), and prophylactic gastrectomy is a consideration despite the lack of a family history. However, in such cases, uncertainty remains about the features that lead to progression of occult cancer cells to clinically impactful disease. Referral to centers with experience in this setting is critical for cases such as these where guidelines recommending prophylactic total gastrectomy are not easily applied. (See

         The optimal breast cancer screening strategy in females with either HDGC or HLBC is unclear; however, guidelines suggest that these females be managed similarly to other high-risk breast cancer conditions with annual breast magnetic resonance imaging (which can be combined with mammography) starting at age 30, and the option of risk-reducing mastectomy can be discussed in consideration of personal and family history [

         A blood sample from an affected family member is the best substrate for index testing [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. Testing can also be achieved on DNA extracted from saliva. If an affected family member is not able to be tested, another option is testing a sample from an unaffected relative who might be an obligate carrier. Although HDGC is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and most patients who inherit the pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant will have the disease, 30 to 60 percent of carriers will not develop clinically significant disease; therefore an unaffected obligate carrier can be identified. As an example, suppose that the index case had two unaffected parents. If there is evidence of affected members on one side of the family (for example, a maternal aunt was affected), then it is most likely that the pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was inherited from an unaffected carrier mother, and she would be the most likely candidate for testing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another option is to test DNA from archived paraffin blocks from an affected family member. This is often impractical and should only be considered as a last resort.
        </p>
        <p>
         Clinical genetic testing is usually accomplished by sequencing of all coding regions of the gene, including intron-exon boundaries [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,19,20
         </a>
         ]. As noted above, several different types of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants can be found in HDGC families by sequencing, including nonsynonymous (nonsense), indels (in-frame /frameshift), and splice site variants. It is not known whether there are any genotypic/phenotype correlations and, in particular, if any of the specific pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in
         <em>
          CDH1
         </em>
         are associated with a different risk of gastric cancer. Once a family pathogenic variant has been identified, it is simple to set up a pathogenic variant-specific assay to assess the carrier status of family members. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Molecular genetics'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Some intragenic deletions have been discovered in families where no pathogenic variant was evident by sequencing [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Thus, screening for large genomic deletions with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, next-generation sequencing assays, or alternative methods is also required for definitive diagnosis of a
         <em>
          CDH1
         </em>
         pathogenic variant.

         The optimal age to screen individuals from affected families is unclear. Rare cases of DGC have been reported in affected families before the age of 18, but the overall risk of cancer before age 20 is very low (less than 1 percent) [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,23
         </a>

         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. However, decisions as to the age at which to institute testing should also take into account the earliest age of cancer onset in the individual family.

         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. While the mean age of onset of DGC is approximately 38, there are certain kindreds where the mean age of onset is much younger. Some suggest consideration of total gastrectomy in carriers at an age of five years younger than the youngest family member who developed gastric cancer [

         The timing of surgery may also vary according to the preferences and physical as well as psychological fitness of the individual. Some patients who receive a recommendation for prophylactic gastrectomy may understandably decide to postpone or refuse the procedure due to young age, fertility concerns, or fear of surgery with accompanying complications. However, it is entirely possible for females to have a successful pregnancy after prophylactic gastrectomy.

         However, all patients undergoing surveillance rather than prophylactic gastrectomy should be counseled as to the focal nature of these endoscopically invisible lesions and the possibility that they will not be detected by the surveillance procedure.

         Total gastrectomy with perigastric (ie, D1) lymph node dissection is indicated in patients with invasive signet ring cell carcinoma on gastric biopsy. However, IGCLC guidance states that patients with a positive biopsy finding of superficial gastric cancer who still wish to forego gastrectomy because of age or comorbidity could have endoscopy repeated more frequently (ie, at six-month intervals) [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         have any of the following high-risk features on biopsy: deeper than T1a invasion on endoscopy, erosion, a disturbed vascular and pit pattern, or histopathologic signs of invasion into or beyond the muscularis mucosa.

         Almost all
         <em>

Superficial deposits that lack high-risk features can also remain indolent for years, with a low rate of progression to more advanced (&gt;T1a) tumors, based on prospective observational data of patients who underwent endoscopic screening and surveillance for HDGC [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41

          HDGC endoscopic protocol
         </strong>
         – Surveillance endoscopy should ideally be performed in a center with a special interest in and experience with HDGC. The optimal frequency of endoscopy is not known. Based upon clinical experience, it is recommended that individuals be offered annual endoscopy [

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Endoscopy should be performed using a white light high-definition endoscope, in a dedicated session of at least 30 minutes to allow for careful inspection of the mucosa on repeated inflation and deflation and for collection of biopsies. The mucosa should be thoroughly washed before examination with a combination of mucolytics (
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9317" href="/z/d/drug information/9317.html" rel="external">

          simethicone
         </a>
         ) mixed with sterile water. Careful inspection of the mucosa with photo documentation of any abnormal areas and an assessment of distensibility on inflation are important. A nondistensible stomach should raise suspicion for a submucosal infiltrative process such as linitis plastica. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/119517.html" rel="external">

         Any endoscopically visible lesions (including pale areas, which may harbor microscopic foci of abnormal cells) should be biopsied. In addition, due to the tiny foci of signet ring cells, which can only be recognized by microscopic analysis, multiple random biopsies are required to maximize the likelihood of identifying them [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46-48
         </a>
         ]. A minimum of 30 biopsies is recommended, with 5 biopsies taken from each of the following anatomic zones: prepyloric area, antrum, transitional zone, body, fundus, and cardia [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. The biopsies may be taken using standard forceps, ideally with a "spike," as this will sample the lamina propria in which the signet ring cells may be present [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>

         However, even with the most sophisticated techniques, early detection with direct endoscopic visualization is extremely difficult. The cancerous infiltrates are small and widely distributed, making them difficult to identify even with random biopsies [
         <a href="#rid40">
          40,49
         </a>
         ]. Prospective cohort studies with long-term follow-up demonstrate that a systematic approach to random biopsies is more likely to identify signet ring cell carcinoma than biopsies targeted to endoscopic findings alone [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41,48
         </a>
         ]. Nevertheless, other studies suggest that random biopsies can still miss early-stage disease compared with prophylactic total gastrectomy [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50-53

          9,22

As noted above, in one series of 44 such individuals with hereditary LBC but no family history of DGC, preclinical early occult carcinoma cells were present within the PTG specimens of most individuals (14 of 16 patients) with only one additional patient having had clinical signs of gastric cancer on preoperative endoscopy.

         variants, it is unclear whether and when these small foci of signet ring cancers will ever progress to fulminant DGC. While guidelines still recommend gastrectomy after age 20 but before age 30 for those with pathogenic

         To address the lack of prospective data available, multicenter collaborative initiatives such as the Prospective Registry of MultiPlex Testing (PROMPT), have been developed to collect prospective data regarding the phenotypes associated with germline pathogenic variant findings identified from multiplex gene panels.

          Definition and molecular genetics
         </strong>
         – Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is defined by the presence of a pathogenic germline variant in the cadherin 1 (
         <em>
          CDH1)
         </em>
         or alpha-1 catenin (
         <em>
          CTNNA1)
         </em>
         genes in either an isolated individual with DGC, or in a family with one or more DGC cases in first-degree or second-degree relatives; these patients are also at risk for lobular breast cancer (LBC). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Molecular genetics'
         </a>
         above.)

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Lobular breast cancer and nonsyndromic cleft lip/palate are also part of the HDGC syndrome. The term hereditary lobular breast cancer (HLBC) has been proposed as the presence of a pathogenic germline
         <em>
          CDH1
         </em>
         variant in either an isolated individual with LBC or a family with one or more LBC cases in first-degree or second-degree relatives, but no known DGC in either situation.

          Genetic testing

          Grade 1A
         </a>

         Annual surveillance endoscopy with random biopsies may be considered for patients who are diagnosed as carriers before age 20, and for individuals over the age of 20 who receive a recommendation for prophylactic gastrectomy but who decide to defer, postpone, or refuse the procedure. For patients who are found to have invasive signet ring cancer on gastric biopsy, total gastrectomy with lymph node dissection is indicated.

However, if the biopsy corresponds to a visual abnormality such as an erosion, then the patient is likely to have a more advanced cancer than T1a and should be strongly counselled for oncologic surgery.

         <em>

         variants should undergo yearly surveillance endoscopy in an expert center. Any finding of signet ring cells or DGC in endoscopic biopsy should prompt a total gastrectomy. Breast cancer risk assessment should also be individualized. (See
