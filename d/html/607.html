Management of ASD is individualized according to age and specific needs [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. It requires a multidisciplinary lifespan approach that makes use of the individual's strengths to address their challenges.</p><p>Behavioral, developmental, and educational interventions target the core symptoms of ASD with the objective of improving overall function. Intensive behavioral and educational interventions are the primary component of treatment programs for children and adolescents with ASD [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The interventions typically are carried out by special education personnel or trained therapists.</p><p>Adult advocates with autism have raised concerns that autism is conceptualized as a medical disorder rather than a form of neurodiversity. This underscores the importance of remaining sensitive to the way that language may impact individuals. The adult advocacy group favors using person-first versus identity-first language when discussing autism. Similarly, the term "treatment" when referring to autism may imply that autism is a disease that requires treatment rather than part of a person's general makeup and identity.</p><p>This topic alternates between person-first and identity-first language when summarizing the evidence-based interventions to date. This terminology may change over time, and providers should be sensitive to this when talking with their patients and families. Interventions discussed in this topic focus on therapies that aim to increase a child's or adolescent's overall functioning when they are experiencing challenges.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Goals of therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although treatment programs for children and adolescents with ASD vary, they generally focus on similar objectives. The overarching goals of treatment are to:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Maximize functioning</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Move the child toward independence</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Improve the quality of life for the child and family</p><p></p><p>Specific goals are to [<a href="#rid1">1,3,4</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Improve social functioning and play skills</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Improve communication skills (both functional and spontaneous)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Improve adaptive skills</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Decrease nonfunctional or negative behaviors</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Promote academic functioning and cognition</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Effectiveness</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Practical and ethical factors have made it challenging to evaluate intervention programs for ASD in randomized controlled trials [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Choosing an appropriate outcome measure is particularly challenging, given the heterogeneity of presentations with the autism spectrum. Instruments that are typically used for diagnosis may not demonstrate incremental improvements in core deficits. The strength of the literature on behavioral and educational interventions for ASD is mixed but stresses the importance of early intervention [<a href="#rid2">2,6,7</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/608.html" rel="external">"Autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents: Overview of management", section on 'Early intervention'</a>.)</p><p>Systematic reviews of small randomized trials and nonrandomized controlled trials have found that certain behavioral and education treatment strategies are associated with improvements in the core symptoms of ASD (behavior, language skills, and peer interaction) and intelligence quotient (IQ; intelligence test scores) [<a href="#rid6">6-22</a>]. However, the methodologic limitations of the individual studies make it difficult to be certain about the effectiveness of particular programs [<a href="#rid8">8,18,20</a>]. Methodologic limitations include the lack of outcome measures that are sensitive to changes in autism symptomatology and the inability to measure or control pretreatment factors, such as environmental context, other treatments, comorbid conditions, etc [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Questions remain regarding the optimal age at initiation of treatment, language and cognitive skills necessary for certain treatment modalities, intensity of treatment (ie, number of hours per week), magnitude and type of benefit, and whether certain programs are better than others for certain children [<a href="#rid6">6,18,23-27</a>]. There is limited evidence regarding treatment programs for adolescents with ASD.</p><p>The National Research Council, one of the four agencies that make up the National Academies including the Institute of Medicine, recommends that educational services begin as soon as a child is suspected of having an ASD [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. The services should include a minimum of 25 hours a week, 12 months per year, in which the child is engaged in systematically planned and developmentally appropriate educational activity toward identified objectives. (See <a class="local">'Attributes of successful programs'</a> below.)</p><p>Most research has focused on the treatment of preschool and school-aged children. There is emerging information about treatment of ASD in adolescents and children younger than two years [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Programs for toddlers'</a> below and <a class="local">'Programs for older children and adolescents'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h2">Attributes of successful programs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Despite the lack of evidence from randomized controlled trials, there is growing evidence from observational studies and systematic reviews and a general consensus in the professional community that children with ASD should participate in therapeutic programs as early as possible [<a href="#rid1">1,2,6,7,29</a>].</p><p>Core features of successful autism educational programs identified in observational studies and systematic reviews include [<a href="#rid1">1,2,6,7,27</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A high staff-to-student ratio (1:1 or 1:2)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Individualized programming for each child</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Family involvement</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Teachers with special expertise in working with children with autism</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A minimum of 25 hours per week of services</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Functional analysis of behavior problems</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ongoing program evaluation and adjustment</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Close monitoring and modification as the child's needs change</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A curriculum emphasizing attention, imitation, communication, play, social interaction, regulation, and self-advocacy</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A highly supportive teaching environment</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Predictability and structure</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Transition planning</p><p></p><p>The components of the educational program for an individual child with ASD will vary depending upon the child's chronologic age, developmental level, specific strengths and weaknesses, and family needs [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. However, minimal intensity (ie, 25 hours per week) is critical to effective intervention [<a href="#rid1">1,6</a>].</p><p>To better understand the child's learning environment and program, the pediatric health care provider can ask the following questions:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>How many days a week does the child attend and how much time does he or she spend in each setting?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>How many students and providers are in each setting?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>What therapies is the child receiving? For how long? Are the therapies provided individually or in group settings?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Are there any home-based therapies?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Who is providing the therapies? Who is overseeing the program? What are their qualifications?</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Is parent training included in the program to expand the impact of the intervention?</p><p></p><p>The responses to these questions, in conjunction with information about the child's functioning, can be used to help families determine if the program is appropriate. A tool for evaluating the quality of Individual Education Programs for children with ASD that incorporates the requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and the National Research Council's recommendations for children with autism is available in the full text of reference [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Classroom environment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The classroom placement should be guided by the child's individualized goals and objectives and the supports that are necessary to achieve them [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Different schools may have different models. The goal is to promote independent functioning and, if appropriate, transition to a regular classroom with support.</p><p>Children who require a lot of support may be placed in a small classroom with a high teacher-to-student ratio and other children with similar behavioral profiles. They may receive all of their therapies in the classroom or be taken to a small therapy room. They may spend the entire day in the small classroom or part of the day in a classroom with more typically developing peers. If they spend part of the day with typically developing peers, they may require part- or full-time support from an aide or behavioral therapist in that setting.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">INTERVENTIONAL MODELS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Children with ASD generally require a combination of therapies and interventions to address their individual constellation of symptoms. Approaches can be broadly categorized according to conceptual models; however, there is no uniformly agreed upon classification system. The availability of programs varies by region; access to interventions may affect the choice of programming.</p><p>Because most of the interventions use more than one treatment approach, it may be helpful to consider the various techniques as part of an intervention system that [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Has a variety of components, including:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Behavioral (behavioral modification and shaping using behavioral therapy and principles)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Structured teaching (modifying the environment to provide optimal outcome)</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Developmental/relationship-based (promoting reciprocal social interaction, joint attention, and shared emotion)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Targets specific domains (eg, social, language, cognitive)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>May occur in various settings (eg, naturalistic versus structured)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Involves the parents, particularly when interventions are provided in the home</p><p></p><p>A systematic review found insufficient evidence to suggest that any particular interventional model is superior to another [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. However, there is moderate evidence that greater intensity (in hours per week) and greater duration (in months) of treatment lead to better outcomes. A 2014 systematic review found evidence that early behavioral, developmental/relationship-based interventions can improve outcomes in many areas in young children [<a href="#rid32">32</a>].</p><p>Some of the commonly used therapies in treatment programs for children with ASD are described below.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h2">Intensive behavioral interventions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Intensive behavioral interventions seek to target the defining symptoms of ASD (ie, deficits in social communication/interaction and restricted, repetitive interests, behaviors, and activities) [<a href="#rid2">2,14</a>]. They are based upon the principles of behavior modification. One such intensive behavioral intervention, Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), seeks to reinforce desirable behaviors and decrease undesirable behaviors [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. The goals of ABA are to teach new skills and generalize learned skills by breaking them down into their simplest elements. The skills are taught through repeated reward-based trials.</p><p>To maximize success, intensive behavioral programs should have a low student-to-therapist ratio. They may be delivered in a variety of settings (eg, home, self-contained classroom, inclusive classroom, community) [<a href="#rid14">14,33</a>].</p><p>Examples of specific intensive behavior intervention programs include [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Discrete trial training (DTT), which is the most structured form of intensive behavior therapy; it was developed by Ivar Lovaas.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Contemporary ABA programs, which occur in more naturalistic settings; they include pivotal response training (PRT), language paradigms, and incidental teaching (teaching as events occur in the context of the natural environment).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI).</p><p></p><p>These intensive behavioral programs have some evidence of effectiveness in randomized and observational studies [<a href="#rid3">3,34-36</a>]. However, many other interventions use behavioral principles including identifying a target behavior, and using behavioral modification and shaping as part of the treatment.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Effectiveness</strong> – Intensive behavioral intervention programs have a larger body of supportive evidence than other types of interventions [<a href="#rid3">3,34</a>]. One reason for this is that ABA methodology requires collection and analysis of detailed data about the child's response to therapy. When performed in the manner in which it was developed, ABA includes intensive data collection, which provides appropriate monitoring of efficacy of individual treatment programs and promotes change in programs and goals when needed. However, in practice, not all interventions are applied as initially intentioned, which may affect their effectiveness.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Intensive behavioral intervention programs for ASD have been evaluated in systematic reviews of randomized trials and cohort studies, most of which had methodologic limitations [<a href="#rid1">1,9-16,18,20,32,35</a>]. With evidence of benefit from several well-controlled studies, the National Autism Center's National Standards Report, Phases 1 and 2, systematic reviews of the peer-reviewed behavioral and educational literature (1957 to 2007 and 2007 to 2012) considers intensive behavioral intervention to be an "established" treatment [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The Phase 2 review added review of evidence for treatments of adults (1987 to 2012) [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Intensive behavior programs may improve core symptoms of ASD and maladaptive behaviors but should not be expected to lead to typical function [<a href="#rid9">9,10,13-15,18,35,38</a>]. The studies revealing the most gains for intensive behavior programs included a high level of intervention (eg, 30 to 40 hours per week of intensive one-on-one services for two or more years and starting before the age of five years) [<a href="#rid9">9,39</a>]. However, the evidence is insufficient to provide a general recommendation that all children with ASD require this level of intervention. The most significant improvements generally are seen within the first 12 months of treatment [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Pretreatment variables that are associated with improved outcomes include the presence of joint attention, functional play skills, higher cognitive abilities, and decreased severity of autism symptoms [<a href="#rid40">40-42</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although research is ongoing, it is unclear whether one type of intensive behavioral intervention is better than another, how to determine which children with ASD will respond maximally to intensive behavioral interventions, and whether intensive behavior programs should be recommended over other types of treatment programs [<a href="#rid9">9,11,16,18</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Compared with other interventions</strong> – Although ABA methods appear to be efficacious when compared with control interventions (eg, special education), it is not clear that ABA is superior to other behavioral therapy methods [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. There are very few studies comparing ABA with other treatment models, and those studies have methodologic limitations. Those performed comparing ABA with a Developmental Individual Difference Relationship-based Model (Floortime) and Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) found no difference in efficacy [<a href="#rid43">43,44</a>]. (See <a class="local">'TEACCH/Structured Teaching method'</a> below and <a class="local">'Developmental and relationship models'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ABA for older children</strong> – There is some controversy about the use of ABA for older children, and there are few studies to guide recommendations for this age group [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The studies tend to be smaller both in duration and in numbers [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. Children requiring ABA at an older age may be more impaired than children who no longer require ABA. In such children, ABA may be used to target specific needs rather than broad deficits, limiting the generalizability of study results.

They include the Denver model; Developmental Individual Difference Relationship-based approach (DIR or Floortime); Relationship-Development Intervention (RDI); Reciprocal interaction; Incidental teaching; PRT; and Responsive Teaching (RT).</p><p>Developmental therapies often are used in clinical practice. However, the evidence is inconclusive [<a href="#rid9">9,12,14</a>]. The variety of approaches to developmental therapies makes it difficult to interpret, compare, and generalize results.

The Social Communication/Emotional Regulation/Transactional Support (SCERTS) program is an example, although it is sometimes classified as a relationship-based model. The SCERTS program provides individualized, collaborative programming that addresses social communication deficits and interfering behaviors to help the child increase his or her competence and independence using various strategies supported in the literature.</p><p>The Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) uses a combination of intensive ABA programming and developmental- and relationship-based approaches, and includes parents as therapists. A randomized trial comparing the ESDM program with interventions commonly available in the community demonstrated significant language, cognitive, and adaptive functioning gains in 48 toddlers over a two-year period [<a href="#rid60">60</a>]. These gains were sustained in the two years after the intervention was discontinued [<a href="#rid61">61</a>]. In addition, during the two-year follow-up period, core symptoms of ASD and adaptive behavior improved in the ESDM group compared with the community intervention group. Although this trial suggests that this particular combination of ABA and relationship-developmental model is efficacious in young children, it is not clear that the results can be generalized to other specific models or combinations of models [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. A subsequent study demonstrated long-term improvements over two year follow-up for participants who received ESDM compared with community treatment for both core ASD symptoms and individual developmental domains including cognition, adaptive skills, and behavior [<a href="#rid61">61</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h2">Parental role</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Parental and family involvement is an important aspect of the treatment program for children with ASD [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Some therapies may be provided in the home, especially for younger children, and parent training may be part of the intervention. Training parents in specific behavior management strategies may be more effective than providing parents with general education about ASD. In a 24-week randomized trial in which the parents of children with ASD were randomly assigned to receive specific behavior training for the management of maladaptive behaviors or general ASD education (eg, developmental changes in ASD, treatment options, advocacy, etc), more children in the parent-training group had a positive response on the Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale, as assessed by a clinician blinded to the intervention (68.5 versus 39.6 percent) [<a href="#rid62">62</a>]. Disruptive and noncompliant behaviors improved in both groups immediately after the intervention, with slightly greater improvements in the parent-training groups (a difference of 3.9 points on the 45-point Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability subscale and a difference of 0.7 points on the 9-point Home Situations Questionnaire-ASD). However, the clinical significance of these small improvements, assessed by parents who were not blind to the intervention, is unclear.</p><p>Parent-mediated interventions may help families interact with their child, promote development, and increase parental satisfaction, empowerment, and mental health [<a href="#rid15">15,63-65</a>].

Six-year follow-up of approximately 80 percent of the participants in one of the included trials, which compared a 12-month parent-mediated social communication intervention with treatment as usual in 152 preschool-aged children with ASD [<a href="#rid63">63</a>], found sustained improvements in severity of autism symptoms, social communication, and restricted/repetitive behaviors in the treatment group [<a href="#rid66">66</a>]. However, the clinical significance of the modest reported changes in symptom severity is unclear. In addition, the changes in restricted and repetitive behaviors were based on unblinded parent report.

The use of a specific augmentative communication system called PECS, or Picture Exchange Communication System (a system through which an individual is taught to use pictures to communicate), is common in clinical practice. It can be helpful in improving communication initiation. Systematic reviews of the effectiveness of PECS have generally found it to be beneficial [<a href="#rid1">1,12,14,48</a>]. More flexible communication systems incorporating photographs, pictures, scene arrays, and video and voice output are now available through personal computers and mobile devices. These are used increasingly to promote communication in children with ASD.</p><p>Parents may be concerned that use of augmentative strategies inhibits the development of communication and language skills, but this is not the case [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].

As part of this theory, sensory integration dysfunction is treated through the introduction of intensive sensory inputs using specific equipment and techniques. Such treatment typically is provided by occupational therapists.</p><p>Sensory integration therapy is often used for children with ASD because many of their behaviors are thought to be related to deficiencies in the sensory system (hyperresponsiveness or hyporesponsiveness).
