These movements range from classic ball throwing, as performed by baseball pitchers or cricket bowlers, to throwing implements other than balls, such as a javelin, to throwing-like actions that do not involve a ball directly, such as a tennis serve or volleyball spike. All such movements involve complex biomechanics and great stresses being placed on the musculoskeletal system. Improper biomechanics, excessive stress beyond the capacity of an individual's musculoskeletal system, or cumulative trauma from throwing too frequently can cause injury. Differences in the mechanics of non-classic throwers make such athletes susceptible to other injuries not discussed in this topic.</p><p>The clinical presentation of throwing related injuries and an approach to diagnosing them are reviewed here. Throwing biomechanics, treatment of specific injuries, and physical examination of the shoulder are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95726.html" rel="external">"Throwing injuries: Biomechanics and mechanism of injury"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/96744.html" rel="external">"Throwing injuries of the upper extremity: Treatment, follow-up care, and prevention"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13814.html" rel="external">"Physical examination of the shoulder"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15144047"><span class="h1">PRESENTATION, EXAMINATION, AND RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS OF SPECIFIC INJURIES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H58516049"><span class="h2">Shoulder injuries</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Specific shoulder injuries incurred by the throwing athlete are described below, but the clinician should keep in mind that the structures described here are intimately related and more than one may be involved in producing shoulder pain in the throwing athlete [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. With repetitive throwing, a number of anatomic adaptations develop that can produce pathologic changes in movement, ultimately resulting in structural damage. Key findings for common and important throwing injuries of the shoulder and elbow are summarized in the following table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef100275" href="/z/d/graphic/100275.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and flow charts  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef142729" href="/z/d/graphic/142729.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef142891" href="/z/d/graphic/142891.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p>Excessive throwing in youth may cause a decrease in humeral derotation, a normal part of skeletal maturation. This manifests in the older throwing athlete as increased proximal humeral retroversion, with increased shoulder external rotation and decreased internal rotation [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. With repetitive microtrauma, beyond the athlete's ability to heal, proximal humeral epiphysiolysis (stress fracture or Little League shoulder) can develop.</p><p>Decreased internal rotation is caused by tightening of the posterior capsule and muscular tightness over time. Once the total loss of motion exceeds 20 degrees (loss of internal rotation far exceeds gains due to increased external rotation), some secondary anterior translation of the humeral head will occur during the cocking phase. The result is "Dead arm syndrome" and internal impingement involving pinching of the posterior capsule and labrum. Prolonged tension on the posterior inferior glenohumeral ligament and/or repetitive pinching of the posterior inferior labrum and glenoid can cause a Bennett lesion.</p><p>In the cocking phase of throwing (90 degrees of abduction and maximal external rotation), substantial torsional forces are exerted on the long head of biceps, which produce traction on the posterior superior labrum, possibly creating a labral tear. Labral pathology can progress and lead to further alteration in glenohumeral motion with increasing pain and instability, mechanical sensations, and worsening performance.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H78248358"><span class="h3">Transient subluxation ("Dead arm syndrome")</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although the phrase "Dead arm syndrome" has been used to describe any malady that causes the throwing athlete to lose effectiveness, the term refers more precisely to a syndrome that involves the sudden onset of pain during the late cocking or acceleration phases of throwing [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Episodes are most commonly associated with transient glenohumeral subluxation. Underlying causes include superior labrum anterior posterior (SLAP) lesions and rotator cuff pathology. The shift in humeral head position may cause pinching of the anterior capsule, transient stretching of the brachial plexus, or stretching of the infraspinatus. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13815.html" rel="external">"Superior labrum anterior to posterior (SLAP) tears"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/240.html" rel="external">"Subacromial (shoulder) impingement syndrome"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/239.html" rel="external">"Rotator cuff tendinopathy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/241.html" rel="external">"Presentation and diagnosis of rotator cuff tears"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/232.html" rel="external">"Multidirectional instability of the shoulder"</a>.)</p><p>Pitchers with dead arm syndrome complain of a sudden onset of pain accompanied by loss of throwing velocity during late cocking or acceleration [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. They often describe associated episodes of shoulder instability. The shoulder apprehension test is typically positive  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69882" href="/z/d/graphic/69882.html" rel="external">picture 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef82884" href="/z/d/graphic/82884.html" rel="external">movie 1</a>) [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>] as is the Jobe's relocation test [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>Diagnostic imaging may reveal labral or rotator cuff pathology, but because these episodes of instability generally occur only during throwing the transient subluxation itself cannot be captured, even with a dynamic ultrasound examination [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H78248365"><span class="h3">Rotator cuff injuries</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The rotator cuff muscles are the most important structures for stabilizing the humeral head and keeping it centered within the glenoid during throwing. Rotator cuff weakness allows the humeral head to sublux, which can lead to shoulder impingement, capsular stretching, or labral tearing.</p><p>Players with rotator cuff injury often complain of lateral shoulder pain at rest and shoulder pain with overhead motions during activities of daily living. However, depending upon the muscles involved and the site of injury, pain may manifest at other parts of the shoulder and be provoked by other movements. Pain often increases when the patient lies on the affected shoulder or side. Throwers may complain of pain in the posterior-superior shoulder at terminal cocking, particularly if they have internal impingement associated with an undersurface rotator cuff tear. On examination, patients typically manifest pain with shoulder abduction of between 70 to 120 degrees, or with maximal external rotation. They often demonstrate weakness in one or more of the rotator cuff muscles (most often the supraspinatus), particularly with higher-grade rotator cuff tears. Although athletes may demonstrate less weakness than expected because of stronger secondary muscles (eg, deltoid, superior trapezius), the strength tests used to assess the individual rotator cuff muscles are generally effective at minimizing the contribution of secondary muscles [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13814.html" rel="external">"Physical examination of the shoulder", section on 'Examination for rotator cuff pathology'</a>.)</p><p>Tests that may reproduce the pain include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Jobe test of the supraspinatus  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74738" href="/z/d/graphic/74738.html" rel="external">picture 2</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hawkins Kennedy and Neer anterior shoulder impingement tests  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60425" href="/z/d/graphic/60425.html" rel="external">picture 3</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76237" href="/z/d/graphic/76237.html" rel="external">picture 4</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef82879" href="/z/d/graphic/82879.html" rel="external">movie 2</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Gerber push-off test of the subscapularis  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71635" href="/z/d/graphic/71635.html" rel="external">picture 5</a>)</p><p></p><p>The diagnosis of rotator cuff injury can be confirmed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound. However, the presence of a rotator cuff tear on MRI does not necessarily indicate causation, as studies have found that 21 to 52 percent of asymptomatic professional baseball pitchers have rotator cuff tears on MRI [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>]. With experienced operators, ultrasound is as accurate as MRI for identifying full thickness rotator cuff injuries; partial thickness articular surface tears can be difficult to diagnose with either modality. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/239.html" rel="external">"Rotator cuff tendinopathy", section on 'Diagnostic imaging'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/241.html" rel="external">"Presentation and diagnosis of rotator cuff tears", section on 'Imaging studies'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94710.html" rel="external">"Musculoskeletal ultrasound of the shoulder"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H78248372"><span class="h3">Labral tears</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most common labral injury in throwers is the superior labrum anterior to posterior (SLAP) tear. The exact mechanism of injury is unknown, but may be related to the repeated compressive and shear forces placed on the labrum during throwing. Scapular dysfunction may contribute to the injury. The mechanics, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of SLAP tears are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13815.html" rel="external">"Superior labrum anterior to posterior (SLAP) tears"</a>.)</p><p>Athletes with labral tears typically complain of pain deep within the shoulder joint when throwing but often not with general activities of daily living. Pitchers may complain that their throwing arm feels weak or "dead." Other complaints include popping, clicking, or catching within the shoulder, particularly with overhead motions. Pain may be reproduced by provocative maneuvers, including the following.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anterior glide test  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef98589" href="/z/d/graphic/98589.html" rel="external">movie 3</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Compression-rotation test  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef82890" href="/z/d/graphic/82890.html" rel="external">movie 4</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Active compression (O'Brien's) test  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97123" href="/z/d/graphic/97123.html" rel="external">picture 6</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Crank test  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef82885" href="/z/d/graphic/82885.html" rel="external">movie 5</a>)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Modified dynamic labral shear test  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef82892" href="/z/d/graphic/82892.html" rel="external">movie 6</a>)</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that the specificity and sensitivity of these and other tests designed to elicit pain from SLAP injuries are limited. Therefore, different clinicians may prefer different tests, and all clinical findings must be interpreted in light of the history and other clinical findings [<a href="#rid12">12-15</a>]. When clinically indicated, advanced imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13815.html" rel="external">"Superior labrum anterior to posterior (SLAP) tears", section on 'Diagnostic imaging'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H78248379"><span class="h3">Glenohumeral internal rotation deficiency (GIRD)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>During the deceleration phase of throwing, the posterior capsule is placed under tension. With repeated throwing, such repetitive stress of the posterior capsule causes microtrauma, which leads to thickening of the capsule, and ultimately reduced internal rotation of the glenohumeral joint, or GIRD. Due to the increased thickness of the capsule and resulting tightness, the humeral head is forced anteriorly and superiorly, pinching the rotator cuff and the superior labrum. In addition, repeated anterior-superior translation of the humeral head stresses the posteroinferior glenohumeral ligament, which may result in a Bennett lesion (discussed immediately below). </p><p>An athlete with symptomatic GIRD typically complains of pain deep in the posterior shoulder. However, GIRD does not necessarily cause symptoms, as shown in a study of asymptomatic professional pitchers in which GIRD of greater than 25 degrees was present in 44 percent [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. On examination, there is loss of internal rotation compared with the non-throwing shoulder of at least 20 degrees in symptomatic pitchers [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. This loss of internal rotation relative to the non-throwing shoulder is a more useful assessment than a reduction based on absolute measurements (ie, degrees of rotation).</p><p>Nevertheless, some researchers have found that a shoulder with less than 180 degrees total arc of internal plus external rotation with the shoulder abducted to 90 degrees is at high risk for symptomatic GIRD [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Examiners must account for the typical changes in external rotation and total glenohumeral range of motion when determining the extent of motion loss in throwing athletes [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. The easiest way to measure this is to place the patient supine with the shoulder abducted to 90 degrees and the elbow in 90 degrees of flexion, and then compare the total arc of motion from maximum internal rotation  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101369" href="/z/d/graphic/101369.html" rel="external">picture 7</a>) to maximum external rotation  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101370" href="/z/d/graphic/101370.html" rel="external">picture 8</a>) in the throwing shoulder to the non-throwing shoulder  (<a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef101371" href="/z/d/graphic/101371.html" rel="external">movie 7</a>). A loss of at least 20 degrees is considered abnormal [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>Traditionally, the presence of GIRD in a throwing athlete was thought to be associated with a significant risk for developing pain and subsequent shoulder injury [<a href="#rid5">5,17</a>]. Subsequent data suggests that GIRD may not place the shoulder at risk for more severe types of shoulder injury, at least in professional pitchers [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Such risk may be more closely related to decreased total arc of motion, or possibly decreased external rotation [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>]. Our understanding of these conditions is evolving, but treatments that decrease GIRD or that restore total arc may prevent the development of shoulder injuries.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H78248386"><span class="h3">Bennett lesion</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A Bennett lesion is mineralization that develops at the posteroinferior glenoid in throwing athletes  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef101384" href="/z/d/graphic/101384.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). The underlying pathogenesis is thought to involve repetitive capsular traction at the attachment of the posteroinferior glenohumeral ligament [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Bennett lesions are usually asymptomatic. However, they may cause posterior shoulder pain in the throwing athlete, although the exact mechanism is unknown [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. When present, posterior shoulder pain develops at the end of external rotation with the shoulder abducted to 90 degrees. Tests of labral pathology are often positive. Bennett lesions are best seen on plain radiograph using a Stryker-Notch view, computed tomography (CT) scan, or MRI.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H78248393"><span class="h3">Proximal humeral epiphysiolysis (Little League shoulder)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Repetitive loading of the humerus with the torque and distraction forces of throwing can cause microtrauma and irritation of the proximal humeral physis, which is substantially weaker than the surrounding bone. According to high speed motion analysis studies, youth pitchers can generate substantial forces at the shoulder [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p>Little League shoulder typically presents in baseball pitchers between 11 and 16 years old, with a peak incidence at 13 years. The athlete usually complains of progressively worsening, non-focal shoulder pain with throwing. Palpation reveals tenderness over the lateral proximal humerus in the area of the patient's growth plate [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of proximal humeral epiphysiolysis is made by radiograph. Widening of the proximal humeral physis is seen best on plain radiograph using an anteroposterior view of the shoulder with the arm in external rotation  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef101372" href="/z/d/graphic/101372.html" rel="external">image 2</a>). However, such changes may be found in asymptomatic pitchers; thus, clinical correlation with symptoms is important [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Widening may be subtle and comparative radiographs of the opposite shoulder may be helpful to confirm the diagnosis.</p><p>Diagnostic musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSK US) is commonly used to help diagnose this condition in clinical settings with experienced ultrasonographers [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Although widening of the growth plate is difficult to quantify, MSK US demonstrates increased hypo-echoic swelling surrounding the affected shoulder that is not seen on the contralateral side. When a definitive diagnosis must be made in a timely fashion in patients with normal plain radiographs but a suspicious history and examination, MRI is useful for confirming the diagnosis [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H78248400"><span class="h3">SICK scapula syndrome and scapular dyskinesis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The SICK scapula syndrome refers to <strong>s</strong>capular malposition, <strong>i</strong>nferior medial border prominence, <strong>c</strong>oracoid pain and malposition, and dys<strong>k</strong>inesis of scapular movement  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100581" href="/z/d/graphic/100581.html" rel="external">picture 9</a>) [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. The key features of this condition are asymmetric scapular positioning and altered motion in the throwing shoulder compared with the non-throwing shoulder. These changes lead to impingement of the rotator cuff and compression of the labrum.</p><p>The patient with scapular dysfunction usually complains of insidious anterior shoulder pain, typically in the area of the coracoid process. Inspection shows the affected scapula to be lower than the uninvolved scapula and to have a prominent inferior medial border  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100583" href="/z/d/graphic/100583.html" rel="external">picture 10</a>). In addition, the scapula may be laterally displaced and abducted compared with the opposite side  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100582" href="/z/d/graphic/100582.html" rel="external">picture 11</a>). Scapular prominence (ie, winging) is not dramatic, and the presence of such winging suggests injury of the long thoracic nerve  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68399" href="/z/d/graphic/68399.html" rel="external">picture 12</a>).</p><p>Close observation of the scapula reveals one of several distinct abnormal movement patterns. Scapular dyskinesis patterns include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Type I – Inferior medial scapular border is prominent at rest.

With repetitive throwing, a number of anatomic adaptations develop that can produce pathologic changes in movement, ultimately resulting in structural damage. Repetitive throwing causes increased proximal humeral retroversion in the shoulder that manifests as increased external rotation and decreased internal rotation. There is some evidence that this increased retroversion in the shoulder can result in increased risk for elbow, as well as shoulder, injury [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Key findings for common and important throwing injuries of the shoulder and elbow are summarized in the following table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef100275" href="/z/d/graphic/100275.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and flow charts  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef142729" href="/z/d/graphic/142729.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef142891" href="/z/d/graphic/142891.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H78248407"><span class="h3">Ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) injury</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Traditionally, UCL injuries were thought to occur in older, high-level pitchers who throw at high velocities. However, data from small observational studies suggest that this injury is occurring at increasing rates in high-school-aged pitchers [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Important risk factors include throwing at relatively high velocity, which increases the forces exerted at the elbow, insufficient recovery time, and overuse, which is reflected in the high number of pitchers who experienced elbow discomfort prior to sustaining the acute injury [<a href="#rid30">30,31</a>]. Forces exerted across the UCL are similar with fastballs and curveballs but lower with slower pitches, such as change-ups.</p><p>Of course, all such risks are relative and depend in part on individual anatomy (eg, size of the UCL) and throwing mechanics. Factors that increase valgus elbow loads during throwing include late trunk rotation, reduced shoulder external rotation, increased elbow flexion, use of a sidearm delivery [<a href="#rid32">32</a>], decreased shoulder rotation arc, and decreased shoulder flexion [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Players whose throwing motion produces greater elbow valgus loads and shoulder external rotation torque are at increased risk for elbow injuries [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p>Complete UCL tears usually present as acute injuries, but in many cases they result in part from accumulated microtrauma that has gradually weakened the ligament. A fastball thrown at 80 miles/hour (130 km/hour) generates approximately 64 Newton-meters (Nm) of torque, of which approximately half is transmitted to the UCL [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Cadaver studies suggest that the UCL is at increased risk for rupturing when subjected to torque greater than 32 Nm. Thus, in theory, any pitch thrown at 80 miles/hour (130 km/hour) or faster has the potential to injure the UCL. Professional baseball pitchers can generate up to 120 Nm of torque [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]; fortunately, the muscles around the elbow are able to dissipate enough energy that acute failure of the UCL is relatively rare. Because elbow torque averages only 18 to 28 Nm, UCL injury is much less common in this age group [<a href="#rid35">35,36</a>]. However, muscle fatigue increases the force transmitted to the UCL, and the likelihood of injury. Chronic repetitive stress on the UCL with inadequate recovery time has been associated with an increased risk of elbow injury in these younger athletes and may be responsible for the increasing numbers of UCL surgeries among youth athletes [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].</p><p>The pitcher with a UCL sprain (mild or partial tear) typically complains of medial elbow pain that increases during the acceleration phase of throwing. On examination, the athlete is tender directly over the UCL, and stress testing of the UCL causes pain and demonstrates laxity. Such tests include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Valgus stress testing  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101373" href="/z/d/graphic/101373.html" rel="external">picture 15</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef101374" href="/z/d/graphic/101374.html" rel="external">movie 9</a>) – With the patient's elbow passively flexed to about 30 degrees and their forearm in neutral position (ie, not pronated or supinated) [<a href="#rid38">38</a>], the clinician applies a valgus stress to the elbow. A soft endpoint or joint widening 2 mm or greater compared with the other elbow marks a positive test.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Moving stress test – The examiner places a valgus stress on the patient's fully flexed elbow and maintains that stress while quickly moving the elbow into full extension [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].

A positive test reproduces the elbow pain in the olecranon fossa and at the posteromedial elbow. Maximal pain typically occurs with the elbow flexed between 30 degrees and terminal extension  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101378" href="/z/d/graphic/101378.html" rel="external">picture 16</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Milking maneuver  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68632" href="/z/d/graphic/68632.html" rel="external">picture 17</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef101380" href="/z/d/graphic/101380.html" rel="external">movie 11</a>) – With the elbow flexed to 90 degrees and maximally supinated, the examiner grasps the patient's thumb and applies valgus stress by pulling on the thumb. A positive test is marked by a soft endpoint or increased joint widening compared to the opposite side.</p><p></p><p>MRI arthrogram has high sensitivity and specificity and remains the test of choice to confirm UCL sprain [<a href="#rid40">40</a>], but radiologists and other clinicians with extensive experience viewing UCL injuries on plain MRI can identify most UCL injures using this technique, which can be useful for helping to determine which injuries are amenable to nonoperative treatment [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. In experienced hands, ultrasound may be useful for identifying partial UCL tears and chronic degeneration of the ligament, in addition to diagnosing gross tears [<a href="#rid40">40,42-44</a>].

Severe sprains may manifest changes on ultrasound or MRI.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H78248421"><span class="h3">Valgus extension overload (VEO) syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>This term had been used to describe any injury caused by repetitive valgus stress of a thrower's elbow. The term now refers primarily to injuries caused by compression of the posteromedial ulnohumeral articulation.

Excessive valgus forces and UCL laxity predispose athletes to VEO syndrome [<a href="#rid45">45,46</a>]. The cumulative effects of this trauma can cause osteophytes to develop on the olecranon and chondromalacia of the posteromedial humeral trochlea and olecranon fossa.</p><p>Typically, athletes with VEO complain of pain in the posterior elbow when the ball is released. On examination, the patient experiences pain when a valgus stress is applied to the elbow while it is repeatedly moved between 30 degrees of flexion and terminal extension  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101378" href="/z/d/graphic/101378.html" rel="external">picture 16</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_movie graphicRef101376" href="/z/d/graphic/101376.html" rel="external">movie 10</a>) [<a href="#rid47">47</a>].

The athlete may have pain with resisted elbow extension, but the triceps tendon is nontender. The patient may lack full elbow extension. Valgus stress testing causes pain in the olecranon if the olecranon is engaged in the olecranon fossa (ie, elbow is flexed to 90 degrees or less) [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. Plain radiographs may show a fracture line or sclerotic changes [<a href="#rid50">50</a>].

The onset of pain is typically insidious, as the athlete complains of progressively worsening pain as the number of pitches thrown increases. Palpation reveals tenderness at or just proximal to the insertion of the triceps tendon on the olecranon and pain increases with resisted elbow extension. Plain radiographs may be normal or reveal an osteophyte in the distal tendon.

Athletes with laxity of the ulnar collateral ligament are at increased risk for stretching the nerve. A second cause of ulnar neuropathy is repeated subluxation of the ulnar nerve in the region of the medial epicondyle during elbow extension and flexion. Athletes with ulnar neuropathy describe an electrical sensation running up and down the forearm when they throw. The subluxed nerve can be palpated posterior to the medial epicondyle with the elbow in a maximally flexed position. The athlete may have a positive Tinel's sign  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53954" href="/z/d/graphic/53954.html" rel="external">picture 18</a>).

It is caused by a focal lesion in the subchondral bone of the capitellum and its overlying articular cartilage. Typically the condition develops in the anterior central capitellum. Patients present with a swollen elbow and complain of a dull, achy pain that is aggravated by throwing and other activities. Radiographs often show a fragmented capitellar ossification center. The syndrome has three stages: first, osteonecrosis of the capitellar growth center; second, regeneration; and third, recalcification.

Osteochondral defects of the elbow occur most often in the capitellum from repeated compression of the radiocapitellar joint during throwing. The athlete usually complains of lateral elbow pain with throwing and may have episodes of locking. Common examination findings include crepitus, joint effusion, and tenderness of radiocapitellar joint. Occasionally, a loss of terminal extension is found. However, the patient may have a completely unremarkable examination. The diagnosis is made with plain radiographs.

This growth plate typically closes by the mid-teens and Little League elbow is thus most commonly seen in 9 to 14-year-old pitchers. The injuries to which young pitchers are most susceptible vary by age and adolescent pitchers (generally 12 to 14 year olds, who are at the peak of their adolescent growth spurt) may sustain avulsion fractures of the medial epicondyle  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97475" href="/z/d/graphic/97475.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>), rather than apophysitis  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef55341" href="/z/d/graphic/55341.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6524.html" rel="external">"Elbow injuries in active children or skeletally immature adolescents: Approach", section on 'Medial elbow pain'</a>.)</p><p>During the cocking and acceleration phases of throwing, the elbow experiences valgus and distraction forces. These repetitive stresses result in microtrauma and irritation of the physis. Symptoms of medial epicondyle apophysitis usually begin insidiously in the young thrower. The young pitcher complains of progressively worsening pain as the number of pitches thrown increases. The medial elbow is tender and pain is elicited with valgus stress of the elbow. Radiographic studies are often normal with apophysitis [<a href="#rid53">53</a>]. Because of the irregularity of the epiphysis, contralateral comparison views may be helpful in the diagnosis of avulsion fractures.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3957810522"><span class="h3">Lateral plica syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While lateral elbow joint-line pain is relatively rare among throwing athletes, sometimes a plica (fold of the synovium  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef142096" href="/z/d/graphic/142096.html" rel="external">image 10</a>)) causes an intermittent catching sensation at the lateral elbow, which may be accompanied by pain. The clinical examination is often unremarkable. In some cases, a click may be felt when palpating the joint line while the elbow is passively flexed and extended in combination with pronation-supination of the forearm, or pain may be present at terminal elbow extension [<a href="#rid54">54</a>]. A posterolateral radiocapitellar plica test may be useful [<a href="#rid55">55</a>]. A positive test is marked by pain with compression of the posterolateral radiocapitellar joint, with the elbow held in extension. Pain decreases as the elbow is moved from extension to greater than 90 degrees of flexion, with the forearm pronated during the maneuver.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H58516139"><span class="h2">Axillary-subclavian vein thrombosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Paget-Schroetter syndrome refers to thrombosis of the axillary-subclavian vein  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61941" href="/z/d/graphic/61941.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) associated with repetitive activity of the affected upper extremity [<a href="#rid56">56</a>]. The pathogenesis involves repetitive trauma to the endothelium of the vein. Often the patient has anatomic variants associated with thoracic outlet syndrome, such as a cervical rib, congenital bands, hypertrophy of the scalenes, or abnormal insertion of costoclavicular ligament. These anatomic variations are thought to decrease the normal mobility of the subclavian vein, increasing its susceptibility to trauma from arm activity. Repetitive trauma leads to intimal hyperplasia, inflammation, and fibrosis. Arm use also leads to activation of the coagulation cascade. Athletes with underlying genetic thrombophilic conditions, such as factor V Leiden, are at higher risk. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/17036.html" rel="external">"Overview of thoracic central venous obstruction"</a>.)</p><p>The typical presentation involves discomfort and swelling of the dominant arm.

The history determines the initial differential diagnosis, which in turn directs further evaluation, including the selection of appropriate special examination maneuvers and diagnostic imaging. Questions that help characterize the injury include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Where does it hurt?</strong> Injuries to the throwing athlete can occur almost anywhere but are most common in the shoulder and the elbow.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>How did the injury occur?</strong> Classically, sports injuries are divided into acute and chronic injuries. However, many "acute" injuries are more accurately described as acute injuries to a chronically damaged structure. Nonetheless, for purposes of the diagnostic work-up, we consider an injury acute if the patient attributes it to a single specific incident. If the patient describes a vague or longer time period during which symptoms developed, the injury is more likely chronic. However, even if the patient specifies an exact moment when the injury occurred, the clinician should ask about pain that preceded said incident, as this may represent an "acute-on-chronic" injury.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Did you feel or hear a "pop"?</strong> A pop suggests an acute injury, often involving a tendon or ligament.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Did swelling develop soon after the injury?</strong> Immediate swelling occurs from bleeding into the joint or soft tissues and suggests acute injury. Mild soft tissue swelling following activity may occur with either acute or chronic injury.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>What position do you play?</strong> Among baseball players, pitchers and catchers are at the highest risk for overuse injury [<a href="#rid57">57</a>]. Injuries in position players are more likely to be acute. However, keep in mind that many younger athletes play multiple positions. A youth player may consider themselves primarily a position player but still pitch on occasion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>How would you describe the pain? </strong>Grinding pain often stems from an intra-articular source. Burning, "electric," or radiating pain is more likely to be neurologic.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>What is the typical pain pattern? </strong>Pain the goes away after warming up but returns either late during activity or after activity is often related to overuse. Pitchers may not complain of pain but instead say it takes longer to loosen up.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Do you have night pain? </strong>While the large majority of throwing injuries do not cause night pain, some exceptions include complete rotator cuff tears, larger osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) lesions and stress fractures. However, the night pain associated with these injuries, when present, tends to be equal to or less than the daytime pain. If pain is worse at night, clinicians should consider systemic illness or more serious pathology, such as a bone tumor.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Do you experience any associated symptoms, such as locking, catching, or instability in a joint? </strong>True locking episodes, in which a mechanical obstacle (eg, torn cartilage) prevents movement, indicates articular pathology. Clicking and catching also suggest articular pathology, although extra-articular causes may be responsible. Clinicians should ask the patient to describe what happens, as non-mechanical causes such as severe pain may account for the inability to move. Patients with true locking often describe being able to use certain motions or manipulations to "unlock" the joint.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Complaints of joint instability may be due to subluxation or weakness of the joint stabilizers.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Do you have any numbness or tingling? </strong>Pain or paresthesias radiating down the arm or to the neck raise suspicion for a neurologic injury.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>How often do you throw, and how much rest do you get? </strong>The frequency of pitching games, number of pitches thrown, and days of rest between pitching games and overall are important risk factors for injury. Does the athlete throw when the arm is fatigued? It is important to account for the totality of throwing, including all pitches during competition, warm-ups, team practices, and informal throwing with parents, friends, and during other activities (eg, against a wall). It is often helpful to learn the number of teams a pitcher plays on and whether the athlete is participating in throwing "showcases" (tournaments where scouts from higher level teams come to assess potential players), as participation in such events appears to be associated with a higher risk of developing overuse injuries. Does the thrower have an off season? It is important, particularly in youth athletes, to determine how much time during the year is spent in non-throwing activities since year round throwers are at much higher risk for throwing-related injuries. Asking this question also helps reinforce the importance of rest in the minds of the patient and their parents.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>For youth pitchers:</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>What types of pitches do you throw? </strong>Contrary to classic teaching, throwing curveballs is no harder on the arm than throwing fastballs [<a href="#rid36">36,37,58</a>]. Nevertheless, pitchers working on a new pitch may recently have increased the total number of pitches they are throwing.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>How hard do you throw? </strong>If a pitcher knows exactly how hard he or she can throw, it is likely that some adult involved with their team has a radar gun. Youth pitchers who consistently attempt to maximize their velocity often do so at the expense of placement and mechanics and are at higher risk for injury.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>During which part of throwing do symptoms occur?</strong> Certain injuries are more likely to occur or become symptomatic during different phases of throwing (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/95726.html" rel="external">"Throwing injuries: Biomechanics and mechanism of injury"</a>). This assessment is particularly useful for acute injuries. With chronic injuries, the athlete may alter his or her throwing motion to compensate and thus the mechanics seen by the clinician do not reflect those that contributed to the injury.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other important questions</strong>:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>History of previous injury or surgery, particularly if it involves the extremity under evaluation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>History of other activities including work, sports, and hobbies that might cause arm or shoulder fatigue—eg, weightlifting, swimming, painting, or other work requiring repetitive overhead motions, lifting, or carrying.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Past medical history – Especially of thyroid disease, connective tissue disorders, autoimmune disease, diabetes, and infectious disease that is recent or involved the upper extremity being evaluated (eg, septic arthritis).

Nevertheless, a general assessment of mobility and strength should be performed. Since throwing is initiated by the lower extremities, it is important to examine both lower extremities and the trunk, before moving on to the upper extremities. In general, the throwing side should be compared with the non-throwing side, with special attention paid to joints whose arcs-of-motion are unequal. A video analysis of the athlete's throwing motion may be useful in diagnosing the injury.</p><p>Critical areas to examine in the thrower include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Rotator cuff strength (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13814.html" rel="external">"Physical examination of the shoulder", section on 'Examination for rotator cuff pathology'</a>); overall shoulder mobility and strength, including internal and external rotation</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Posterior shoulder capsule laxity/tightness (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13814.html" rel="external">"Physical examination of the shoulder", section on 'Special tests for shoulder instability'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13814.html" rel="external">"Physical examination of the shoulder", section on 'Range of motion'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Elbow mobility (including flexion, extension, supination, pronation) and ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) laxity (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/247.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of elbow pain in adults", section on 'Range of motion'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Scapular position and motion (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/13814.html" rel="external">"Physical examination of the shoulder", section on 'Scapulothoracic motion and strength'</a>)</p><p></p><p>The general physical examination should include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Observation</strong>: Look for evidence of acute injury such as swelling, ecchymosis, deformity</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Assessment of alignment and motion</strong> with patient standing, including:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Evaluation of ankle, knee, hip, and trunk – Typically, most of the force necessary for throwing in sport is generated by the lower extremities and transferred to the upper extremity via the trunk. Asymmetry or restriction of motion at any part of the kinetic chain outside the upper extremity may put the thrower at risk for injury. Motion restriction or weakness in a lower extremity may cause an athlete to generate force primarily from the shoulder resulting in overuse injury. The examiner should note any asymmetries in the patient's posture and stance, restrictions in spine motion, and atrophy of the lower extremity musculature.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Evaluation of elbow-carrying angle – The normal carrying angle is 5 to 10 degrees in males and 10 to 15 degrees in females, with the dominant arm having a slightly larger carrying angle compared to the non-dominant side  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101435" href="/z/d/graphic/101435.html" rel="external">picture 19</a>). A smaller carrying angle may be due to bone spurs or soft tissue restrictions. A larger carrying angle may be due to the increased size of the medial epicondyle. This can occur with traction apophysitis, which causes the anterior capsule of the elbow to become tight, producing a loss of terminal elbow extension.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Evaluation of shoulder and scapula position – Many pitchers manifest altered glenohumeral rotation.

Loss of motion, particularly rotational movement, may cause inefficient transfer of energy from the lower extremities to the trunk, leading to loss of velocity and alterations in throwing mechanics.
