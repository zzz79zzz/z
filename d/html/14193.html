This represented a decline of 7 percent from 2014 and was the lowest recorded rate since abortion was legalized in 1973. Birthrates have also declined in almost all states from 2017 to 2014, indicating that fewer people became pregnant, not that more individuals chose (or were required) to give birth over having an abortion. Approximately half of all pregnancies were unintended and 40 percent of these were terminated [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The number of intended pregnancies that were terminated has increased due to advances in prenatal testing for fetal abnormalities [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>].</p><p>Although the psychiatric impact of pregnancy termination has been controversial, most studies, especially higher-quality ones, suggest that induced abortion is not associated with an increased risk of serious mental health disorders [<a href="#rid6">6-14</a>]. The psychological effect of pregnancy termination varies depending upon whether the reason is an unwanted pregnancy, multiple gestation, or fetal anomalies.</p><p>The potential psychiatric outcomes of pregnancy termination are reviewed here. Other issues regarding pregnancy termination are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3313.html" rel="external">"Overview of pregnancy termination"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H392034"><span class="h1">EVIDENCE REGARDING POTENTIAL OUTCOMES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most reviews, including a description of the Turnaway Study [<a href="#rid15">15</a>], have concluded that abortion does not harm a women’s mental health [<a href="#rid6">6,7,16-20</a>]. The Turnaway Study is the largest and longest study of the psychosocial effects of abortion versus childbirth.</p><p>However, some of the evidence regarding the psychiatric effects of pregnancy termination is of low quality, and study designs are inconsistent [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Many studies do not use validated mental health measures or control for pre-abortion mental status and whether the pregnancy is planned, and the presence and type of comparison group varies [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Specifically, many studies compare women with unplanned pregnancies to women planning an ongoing pregnancy. The circumstance of an unwanted pregnancy involves factors that are likely to be associated with emotional distress, such as impaired relationships and financial difficulties.</p><p>In addition, psychological responses to pregnancy termination often vary by social, cultural, religious, or legal context, so generalizations across populations are difficult to make [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]. Emotional responses to abortion are expected to differ between environments where induced abortion is permissible and where abortion is disapproved. If abortion poses risks such as injury, financial ruin, or incarceration, it is difficult to distinguish psychological responses to abortion from fears of the consequences. However, the Turnaway Study [<a href="#rid15">15</a>] and development of new assessment tools [<a href="#rid14">14</a>] have addressed some of these confounders.</p><p>The following sections focus upon mental health outcomes following pregnancy termination for unintended pregnancy. Psychiatric outcomes of pregnancy termination due to fetal abnormalities are discussed in a separate section. (See <a class="local">'Termination for fetal anomalies'</a> below.)</p><p>This topic reviews the best evidence rather than all of the evidence, consistent with all UpToDate topics. Thus, prospective observational studies are favored over retrospective studies, studies with appropriate control groups are favored over those with inappropriate or no control groups, studies with more events of interest are favored over those with fewer outcomes, studies of longer duration are favored over shorter studies, and studies that adjust for potential confounders (eg, prepregnancy mental disorders) are favored over studies that did not.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H22207621"><span class="h2">Mental disorders in aggregate</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most studies, especially higher-quality studies, suggest that induced abortion is not associated with an increased risk of mental health disorders [<a href="#rid6">6-9</a>]. As an example, the primary findings in a systematic review of 44 studies included the following [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among women with unwanted pregnancies who either terminate the pregnancy or give birth, the rate of mental illness is comparable.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unwanted pregnancies are associated with an increased risk for mental illness.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Postabortion mental illness is most consistently associated with pre-abortion mental illness. Other factors that may contribute to mental health problems following pregnancy termination include negative attitudes towards abortion, pressure from a partner to have an abortion, and negative reactions to the abortion including grief or doubt.</p><p></p><p>A subsequent retrospective study included adolescents who either had an induced abortion (n = 1041) or gave birth (n = 394) and were then followed up to age 25 years [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Following the abortion or childbirth, the risk of subsequent psychiatric disorders or episodes of self-harm were comparable. </p><p>Some data suggest that the patient population who undergo abortion have a higher baseline rate of mental health disorders. As an example, national registry study identified females who had no mental disorder and who either had a first-time first-trimester induced abortion or first childbirth [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. The study estimated the rates of first psychiatric contact (either inpatient admission or outpatient visit) for the 12-month period after the abortion or delivery as compared with the nine-month period preceding the event. The primary findings included the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Among women who had an abortion (n &gt;84,000), the incidence of first psychiatric contact for the 12 months after and the nine months preceding the abortion was comparable.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The incidence of psychiatric contact among women (n &gt;280,000) was greater after childbirth than before.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The incidence of mental health problems was greater in the nine months preceding abortion than the nine months preceding childbirth.</p><p></p><p>A subsequent national registry study identified women who had been hospitalized for mental disorders (eg, unipolar major depression, schizophrenia, substance use disorder, or personality disorder) and subsequently became pregnant [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. Among the women who had a first-time first-trimester induced abortion (n &gt;2800), the risk of readmission during the 12 months after the abortion or during the nine months prior to the abortion was comparable (relative risk 1.1, 95% CI 0.8-1.34). By contrast, in the women who delivered their first child (n &gt;5200), the risk of readmission was greater during the 12 months after delivery than the nine months prior to delivery (relative risk 1.8, 95% CI 1.3-2.4).</p><p>Women frequently struggle with decisions to end pregnancies. However, the conflicts and ambivalence regarding the abortion decision typically occur before the abortion [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. While unintended pregnancy brings about a crisis and stress for many women, the pregnancy termination is usually perceived as a resolution of the crisis and brings a sense of relief [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>].</p><p>Although a meta-analysis of 22 observational studies (n &gt;870,000 subjects, including more than 160,000 who had an abortion) found an 81 percent increased risk of mental health problems (eg, depression, anxiety, and/or substance use disorders) among women who had a prior abortion [<a href="#rid17">17</a>], this analysis has been widely criticized because of several methodologic problems [<a href="#rid6">6,7,18,28</a>]. As an example, half of the studies included in the meta-analysis were conducted by the same investigator who performed the meta-analysis, which raised concerns about selection bias; in addition, the meta-analysis did not assess the quality of studies that were included and did not control for mental illness prior to the induced abortion.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H694328"><span class="h2">Suicide</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The best evidence suggests that induced abortion does not increase the risk of suicidal ideation or behavior [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a systematic review that assessed study quality, no high- or fair-quality studies found an increased risk of completed suicide associated with pregnancy termination [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. However, two poor-quality studies found an association between pregnancy termination and completed suicide. In addition, a study not included in the review also found an association between termination of pregnancy and deliberate self-harm (suicide attempt), but the investigators concluded that the finding was probably confounded by factors such as psychological and social difficulties [<a href="#rid30">30</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A subsequent, five-year prospective study (Turnaway Study) followed 956 women who presented to a clinic seeking an abortion and either received an abortion or were denied an abortion (turned away) because they presented after the facility's gestational limit [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]; additional study details are described elsewhere in this topic (see <a class="local">'Depression'</a> below). The study showed that after the women first presented to the clinic seeking an abortion, the prevalence of suicidal ideation was similarly low in women who had abortions and women who did not, throughout follow-up. As an example, suicidal ideation in the near-limit abortion group and in the turnaway birth group (see <a class="local">'Depression'</a> below) was as follows:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>One week – 1.9 and 1.3 percent </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>One year – 1.3 and 0.9 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Two years – 0.9 and 0.6 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Three years – 0.6 and 0.5 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Four years – 0.4 and 0.3 percent</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Five years – 0.3 and 0.2 percent</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Factors at baseline that were associated with increased suicidal ideation included history of intimate partner violence in the past year, lifetime history of sexual assault, lifetime diagnosis of depression or anxiety, and prepregnancy alcohol abuse. Additional information about the association between violence victimization and postabortion mental health is discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See <a class="local">'Violence victimization'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A national registry study included nearly 49,000 women with a first-lifetime abortion [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. After adjusting for potential confounding factors such as personal and family psychiatric history and general medical comorbidity, the analyses found that the risk of a first, nonfatal suicide attempt was nearly identical in the year before the abortion and the year after. In addition, as time elapsed following the abortion, the risk of a suicide attempt decreased.</p><p></p><p>Increased enforcement of laws restricting access to abortion may also increase the risk of suicide. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14192.html" rel="external">"Unsafe abortion", section on 'Other health consequences of abortion restriction'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H694373"><span class="h2">Psychosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Induced abortion does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of psychosis; however, few studies have examined this issue. One prospective observational study found that among women with an unplanned pregnancy and no history of mental illness, the risk of psychosis was 70 percent lower in women who terminated their pregnancies than in women who delivered them [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. However, the incidence of psychosis leading to hospitalization appeared to be comparable for the two groups.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H392043"><span class="h2">Depression</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although there are conflicting data regarding the association of pregnancy termination with the long-term risk of depressive syndromes, higher-quality studies (eg, prospective and well-controlled) have generally found that induced abortion is not associated with an increased risk of depressive syndromes [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. As an example [<a href="#rid29">29,32</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A five-year prospective study (Turnaway Study) followed [<a href="#rid10">10,33</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Women who received a first-trimester abortion (n = 273)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Women who received an abortion near the facility's gestational limit (n = 452)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Women who were denied an abortion because they presented after the facility's gestational limit and subsequently</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Gave birth (n = 161)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Did not give birth because they miscarried or had an abortion at another clinic (n = 70)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Data were gathered through patient self-reports by telephone, and the analyses controlled for potential confounding factors (eg, age, parity, marital status, and psychiatric history). The study found that at baseline (assessed eight days after the first visit to the abortion clinic), self-reported rates of clinical depression were comparable for the four groups, as were cumulative rates over three years (ranging from 9 to 14 percent among the groups). Follow-up assessments for an additional two years showed that five years after seeking an abortion, the level of depressive symptoms for the four groups was similar. However, attrition at five years exceeded 40 percent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a prospective study, women were followed from birth and assessed at age 21 years; the cohort included women with a recent or remote history of either an induced abortion (n = 101) or miscarriage (n = 82) [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. Analyses that adjusted for early life and family factors, adolescent behaviors, and sociodemographic factors showed that the lifetime risk for mood disorders (unipolar major depression, persistent depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder) was comparable for the two groups.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A retrospective study examined women in a nationally representative sample aged 14 to 21 years in 1979, who had unplanned first pregnancies and either had an induced abortion (n = 479) or carried the pregnancy to term (n = 768) [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. The incidence of depression following abortion or delivery was comparable (25 and 29 percent). In addition, an analysis of a subgroup who had an abortion (n = 225) or delivery (n = 310) before 1980 found that depression occurred in fewer women who terminated the pregnancy than delivered (26 versus 35). Although a prior study using the same dataset found that the risk of depression was greater among women who had abortions than women who delivered [<a href="#rid36">36</a>], multiple reviews have concluded that this study was of poor quality because of several methodologic flaws such as selection bias [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>].</p><p></p><p>Following the diagnosis of pregnancy and prior to termination, depression occurs in approximately 20 percent of women [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Following induced abortion, the prevalence of depression is also approximately 20 percent [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H694452"><span class="h2">Anxiety</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although many women experience anxiety just prior to pregnancy termination, the short-term risk of anxiety symptoms appears to be greater in women who are denied an abortion compared with women who have an abortion [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. In addition, the long-term risk of anxiety disorders after an abortion is not elevated [<a href="#rid16">16,29,38</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A review of 24 studies found that in good-quality studies, significant levels of anxiety prior to abortion occurred in 40 to 45 percent of women [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Most studies found that in the month following pregnancy termination, the prevalence of anxiety had decreased. In one study, the factor most commonly associated with pre-abortion anxiety was anticipation of pain [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A five-year prospective study (Turnaway Study) followed 956 women who presented to a clinic seeking an abortion and either received an abortion or were denied an abortion (turned away) because they presented after the facility's gestational limit [<a href="#rid10">10,33</a>]; additional study details are described elsewhere in this topic (see <a class="local">'Depression'</a> above). The primary findings regarding anxiety included the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Eight days after the initial visit to seek an abortion, the rate of clinical anxiety was greater in the turn-away no-birth group, compared with the near-limit group (odds ratio 4.4, 95% CI 1.2-16.3).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Subsequently, rates of clinical anxiety in the groups progressively converged, and three years after seeking an abortion, the cumulative rate of clinical anxiety was comparable for the four groups (ranging from 10 to 16 percent among the groups).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Five years after the initial visit to an abortion clinic, the level of anxiety symptoms for the four groups was similar.

The prevalence of current PTSD at baseline and six months later was 4 and 2 percent.

When the types of regret are analyzed in detail, few women report true decisional regret [<a href="#rid51">51</a>], and when they do, often have simultaneous feelings of relief.</p><p>Evidence regarding pregnancy termination and short-term decisional regret includes a prospective study (the Turnaway Study), which examined the consequences of receiving or being denied an abortion. The women who received an abortion (n = 665) were asked one week later if the decision to have an abortion was the right one, given the situation; 95 percent replied yes [<a href="#rid52">52</a>]. In the subset of women who received an abortion just prior to the clinic’s gestational limit (n = 411), 41 percent felt regret, but among those feeling regret, 87 percent also felt relief. In addition, women who were turned away because they exceeded the gestational duration limit at that clinic (n = 178) were more likely to experience regret (regarding their ongoing pregnancy) than women who were still eligible and received an abortion. Other studies have also found that the predominant short-term emotion after abortion is relief [<a href="#rid41">41,53,54</a>].</p><p>The prospective Turnaway Study also examined longer-term regret associated with pregnancy termination. Women in the study who terminated their pregnancy (n = 667) were assessed every six months for three years; at each follow-up interview, approximately 95 percent thought it was the right decision. Regret and other negative emotions (anger, guilt, and sadness) were uncommon and were more likely to be reported by women who had terminated planned pregnancies; the intensity of these negative emotions diminished over time. Continued evaluations of the women for a total of five years found that the most common emotion at each assessment was relief [<a href="#rid48">48,49</a>]. In addition, a comparison of the women who received an abortion with women who were denied an abortion (n = 161) found few differences in decision regret [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3584859798"><span class="h2">Self-esteem</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Self-esteem in the short term appears to be lower in women who are denied an abortion, compared with women who receive an abortion.

In a study of women followed prospectively for two years after pregnancy termination (n = 442), 47 percent reported that others would disapprove of them as a result of their abortion and 44 percent felt they needed to keep the abortion a secret from family and/or friends [<a href="#rid57">57</a>].</p><p>In addition, difficulties in obtaining an abortion may exacerbate perceived stigma. In a prospective study of 928 women seeking abortion, women who were denied an abortion (based upon clinic-specific gestational age limits), and later experienced a miscarriage or obtained an abortion at another facility, had the highest rates of perceived social stigma, compared with women who had an abortion at earlier gestational ages or were denied an abortion and continued the pregnancy [<a href="#rid58">58</a>].
