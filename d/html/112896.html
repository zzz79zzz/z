The mechanisms driving progression from androgen-dependent (hormone-sensitive or castration-sensitive) prostate cancer to CRPC are still largely unclear, although continued androgen receptor signaling, despite depletion of circulating androgens and androgen receptor blockade, is thought by many to be central to the development of CRPC.</p><p>For males with metastatic and nonmetastatic CRPC, multiple active treatment modalities have emerged. An overview of treatment options for males with CRPC is presented here. Separate topic reviews are available that focus on castration-sensitive or androgen-dependent prostate cancer, treatments targeting androgen pathways, other alternative forms of hormone therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy approaches, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors for males with CRPC and homologous recombination deficiency, investigational approaches to systemic therapy, and management of symptomatic bone metastases:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6941.html" rel="external">"Overview of systemic treatment for recurrent or metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16351.html" rel="external">"Castration-resistant prostate cancer: Treatments targeting the androgen pathway"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6942.html" rel="external">"Alternative endocrine therapies for castration-resistant prostate cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6945.html" rel="external">"Chemotherapy in advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6937.html" rel="external">"Immunotherapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/128308.html" rel="external">"Management of advanced prostate cancer with germline or somatic homologous recombination repair deficiency"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/17128.html" rel="external">"Bone metastases in advanced prostate cancer: Management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H353469448"><span class="h1">DEFINITION OF CASTRATION RESISTANCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Males with advanced prostate cancer who have evidence of disease progression (eg, an increase in serum prostate-specific antigen [PSA], new metastases, or progression of existing metastases) and who have castrate levels of serum testosterone (&lt;50 ng/dL) are considered to have CRPC. Most of these males will be identified initially because of a rising serum PSA. Importantly, the presence of CRPC does not imply that the disease is totally independent of androgens and resistant to further therapies directed at blocking androgen stimulation.</p><p>These patients represent a heterogeneous group:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>PSA progression in males receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) can reflect disease recurrence that is metastatic to distant sites; locoregional only, without disease in bone or visceral organs; or limited only to a PSA rise, without any demonstrable radiographic findings. Males who are diagnosed with CRPC at a time when the only manifestation of progressive disease is an increase in serum PSA level, without demonstrable radiographic disease progression involving specific organs, are considered to have nonmetastatic CRPC. (See <a class="local">'Nonmetastatic CRPC'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Definitions of metastatic disease are changing in the new era of molecular imaging. In particular, the widespread availability of positron emission tomography (PET) scanning using prostate-specific radionuclides (eg, prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/computed tomography [CT]) is changing the definition of metastatic disease because of their greater sensitivity compared with conventional imaging (ie, CT, bone scan). Almost all of the trials that have demonstrated a survival benefit for various treatments for nonmetastatic as well as metastatic CRPC have been conducted in males who underwent staging using conventional imaging. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6929.html" rel="external">"Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Diagnostic evaluation", section on 'More sensitive prostate cancer-specific PET tracers'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Progression to CRPC has different treatment implications for those who have been treated with ADT plus an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor and/or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9381" href="/d/drug information/9381.html" rel="external">docetaxel</a> for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. (See <a class="local">'Patients with metastatic CRPC'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2263491162"><span class="h1">DEFINING DISEASE EXTENT</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3647059317"><span class="h2">Diagnostic workup</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For males who have suspected disease progression while receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for castration sensitive prostate cancer, imaging evaluation is appropriate to determine the site(s) and extent of disease spread (although imaging does not always change management). The best way to approach imaging is evolving. Newer more sensitive prostate-specific radiotracers for positron emission tomography (PET) scanning are being increasingly used. These tests are more sensitive than conventional imaging for detecting disease spread at lower prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, but the clinical impact of identifying and treating metastatic lesions that are not detected on conventional imaging is an area of active investigation and firm conclusion are not yet established. We individualize decision making. Next-generation imaging (ie, integrated PET/CT or PET/magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] using prostate-specific radiotracers) can be offered if a change in clinical care would be contemplated based on the findings, and if there is high clinical suspicion of subclinical metastases despite negative conventional imaging (bone scan and CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6929.html" rel="external">"Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Diagnostic evaluation", section on 'Evaluation for metastatic disease'</a>.)</p><p>The conventional and most often utilized diagnostic imaging studies to define metastatic versus nonmetastatic CRPC in this scenario include technetium-99m diphosphonate scintigraphy (bone scan) for evaluation for skeletal metastases, as well as CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (or MRI if CT is contraindicated). However, The sensitivity of conventional imaging to detect regional nodal or distant metastases is limited at lower PSA levels. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6929.html" rel="external">"Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Diagnostic evaluation"</a>.)</p><p>In particular, the role of next-generation imaging (ie, integrated PET/CT or PET/MRI using radiotracers that are more sensitive than fluorodeoxyglucose, or whole-body MRI), which is increasingly available to clinicians, is uncertain. Although next generation imaging tests such as prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/CT are more sensitive than conventional imaging for detecting disease spread at lower PSA levels, the clinical consequences of identifying and treating metastatic lesions that are not detected on conventional imaging is not established. As a result, there is no consensus from expert groups as to the utility of these novel imaging modalities in males with a rising PSA while receiving ADT:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines state that workup for progression should include bone imaging, chest CT, and abdominopelvic CT or MRI with and without contrast. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="101769" href="/d/drug information/101769.html" rel="external">C-11 choline</a> PET/CT or PET/MRI, or F-18 fluciclovine PET/CT or PET/MRI could be considered for further evaluation, but the panel was unsure what to do if distant metastatic disease was suggested by next-generation imaging but not conventional imaging [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines for optimum imaging strategies for advanced prostate cancer state that, for males with nonmetastatic or metastatic CRPC, next-generation imaging can be offered only if a change in clinical care is contemplated, in an individualized manner, and if there is high clinical suspicion of subclinical metastases despite negative conventional imaging [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>European guidelines state that new symptomatic bone lesions require a bone scan, as well as PSA progression suggesting CRPC status if a treatment modification is considered [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Suspicion of disease progression indicates the need for additional imaging modalities, most often initially a CT scan, but further imaging will be guided by symptoms or possible subsequent treatments. In CRPC, imaging must be individualized, with the aim of maintaining the patient's quality of life.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3140060902"><span class="h2">Definition of PSA-only progression</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are no widely accepted criteria to define the emergence of CRPC when the only evidence of disease progression while on ADT is an increase in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA); this decision requires judgment on the part of the treating clinician. </p><p>However, practice is variable:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Some clinicians follow the recommendations of the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3, which were primarily intended to define endpoints for clinical trial design [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]: a 25 percent increase from the nadir (considering a starting value of ≥1 ng/mL), with a minimum rise of 2 ng/mL, in the context of castrate testosterone values (&lt;50 ng/mL).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Guidelines from the European Association of Urology and others consider two consecutive PSA rises of &gt;0.2 ng/mL to be suggestive of progression [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The NCCN defines CRPC as prostate cancer that progresses clinically, radiographically, or biochemically despite castrate levels of serum testosterone, and it does not provide a specific definition for PSA-only progression [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p></p><p>PSA kinetics are also important in clinical decision making. Some trials conducted in males with nonmetastatic CRPC enrolled patients regardless of their absolute PSA level if their PSA doubling time was less than 10 months. This distinction is important as active treatment modalities have emerged to delay disease progression in males with nonmetastatic CRPC in which eligibility is limited to those with a PSA doubling time &lt;10 months. (See <a class="local">'Nonmetastatic CRPC'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1894462679"><span class="h1">PROGNOSIS AND PROGNOSTIC FACTORS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Males with CRPC represent a heterogeneous population; at one end of the spectrum are those with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-only recurrence (M0 disease with a rising PSA and no demonstrable metastases), and at the other end are males with extensive, high-volume, symptomatic, metastatic disease in visceral sites (especially liver).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2998222487"><span class="h2">Clinical parameters</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most important factors influencing survival in males with CRPC are the site and extent of metastatic involvement. An individual patient data meta-analysis included information from 8820 males with CRPC who had been treated with a docetaxel-containing regimen as participants in one of nine phase III trials [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. Overall survival (OS) was best for those with lymph-node-only disease and decreased progressively for those with bone, lung, or liver metastases (median 31.6, 21.3, 19.4, and 13.5 months, respectively).</p><p>A number of other factors can also influence survival:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Within the group of males with only a biochemical recurrence, PSA kinetics, as assessed by PSA doubling time, are an important prognostic factor for both time to metastasis and OS [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Two large phase III trials were used to develop and validate a model to predict OS in males with CRPC who were treated with chemotherapy [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Factors associated with shorter OS included a poorer performance status, the presence or absence of visceral metastases, use of opioids for pain relief, an elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), an increasing serum PSA, an increasing serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a lower serum albumin, and a lower hemoglobin level.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">These factors were combined into a <a class="external" href="/external-redirect?target_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cancer.duke.edu%2FNomogram%2Ffirstlinechemotherapy.html&amp;token=Of8FnZqvMN1YujNjztkgo%2FrWEcRf%2BlN95zXj%2Famn6bmcCuntnjGpmXB9e2IQWUaEvnCCa820ixz%2B1L1YpQCsk9du0vFVCsgl4fjIisZvvNs%3D&amp;TOPIC_ID=112896" target="_blank">nomogram</a> to classify patients as being at low, intermediate, or high risk, with median OS values in the high- and low-risk groups being 14 to 17 and 26 to 30 months, respectively.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A similar model has been constructed to predict prostate cancer survival in males treated with second-line chemotherapy after <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9381" href="/d/drug information/9381.html" rel="external">docetaxel</a> [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].

In addition, OS was significantly worse in those in whom CTCs increased after three cycles of treatment from &lt;5 to ≥5 CTCs per 7.5 mL compared with baseline, and it was best in those in whom CTCs decreased from ≥5 to &lt;5 CTCs per 7.5 mL.</p><p></p><p>In addition, changes in the number of CTCs may be an indicator of response to treatment and subsequent improved survival. In an analysis of 6081 patients enrolled in five trials of males with CRPC, the baseline CTC count was compared with the CTC count after 12 weeks of treatment [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The two most effective predictors of survival were a conversion from ≥1 to 0 CTCs at week 13 and a conversion from ≥5 to ≤4 CTCs at week 13.

Objective responses in such patients are difficult to measure, but their response duration and median survival tend to be shorter after initial androgen deprivation therapy compared with males with PSA-producing prostate adenocarcinoma [<a href="#rid78">78-81</a>]. Management of these patients is discussed below.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6948.html" rel="external">"Bone metastases in advanced prostate cancer: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>There is no clear consensus as to the optimal surveillance imaging strategy for males with metastatic CRPC in the absence of new symptoms. Cross-sectional imaging is appropriate as a restaging study to evaluate males with visceral metastases who have a rising PSA. However, many males have disease that is limited to bone. Although radionuclide bone scan is the most commonly used imaging study to detect bone metastases, bone scans may normalize after highly effective systemic therapy for metastatic disease. Furthermore, reliably evaluating the extent of metastatic burden in bone as an objective endpoint of therapy is challenging, as most radiographic assessments (including bone scan) are neither objective nor quantitative. Quantitation of bone metastases using newer techniques, such as the Automated Bone Scan Index, has been shown to correlate with prognosis in males with metastatic CRPC [<a href="#rid82">82</a>], and if validated, it may provide an objective imaging biomarker for response assessment. However, this test is not yet clinically available.</p><p>The Radiographic Assessments for Detection of Advanced Recurrence (RADAR) III group made new recommendations around serial imaging in males with metastatic (M1) prostate cancer who are undergoing treatment, suggesting that repeat imaging using traditional scans (ie, bone scan or CT) is indicated when at least one of the following occurs [<a href="#rid83">83</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Every doubling of PSA since the previous image was taken</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Every six to nine months in the absence of a PSA rise</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Change in symptomatology</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Change in performance status</p><p></p><p>There is not widespread consensus on these recommendations (particularly the recommendation to repeat imaging every six to nine months in the absence of a PSA rise) and on whether to image less frequently in asymptomatic males with limited metastatic disease burden. Many clinicians, including some of the authors and editors associated with this topic, review the PSA curves and results of prior imaging with patients and pursue shared decision making in assessing the need for and timing of imaging studies.</p><p>The Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 uses a threshold for progression of two or more new bone lesions on the first post-treatment bone scan and requires confirmation in a subsequent scan [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. At least some data suggest that, at least among patients treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="86370" href="/d/drug information/86370.html" rel="external">enzalutamide</a>, one or more new unconfirmed bone lesions seen on the first or second post-treatment scan in patients who seem to be otherwise responding to treatment are common (occurring in approximately one in five males treated in one of two studies of enzalutamide for metastatic CRPC) and are indicative of a favorable treatment response to enzalutamide (ie, pseudoprogression) [<a href="#rid84">84</a>]. However, this finding was limited to males who had not received prior <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9381" href="/d/drug information/9381.html" rel="external">docetaxel</a>. The detection of new unconfirmed bone lesions in males treated with enzalutamide after previously receiving docetaxel was associated with worse overall survival and was felt to likely represent true progression.</p><p>Compared with conventional imaging (bone scan, CT), both local recurrences and distant metastases can be better confirmed with next-generation imaging (ie, positron emission tomography [PET]/CT using prostate cancer-specific tracers, such as F-18 fluciclovine). Given their greater sensitivity, use of these imaging techniques has the potential to improve outcomes by leading to earlier therapeutic intervention for castration-resistant disease (eg, the use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="86370" href="/d/drug information/86370.html" rel="external">enzalutamide</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="116885" href="/d/drug information/116885.html" rel="external">apalutamide</a> in males with nonmetastatic CRPC). However, accessibility and cost may be significant issues.

Experimental data suggested that rapid cycling between supraphysiologic (&gt;1500 ng/dL) and castrate (&lt;50 ng/dL) testosterone levels may resensitize CRPC to further androgen-directed therapies [<a href="#rid85">85</a>].
