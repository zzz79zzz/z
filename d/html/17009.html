All forms of cancer treatment have the potential to negatively affect physical sexual function in females, including sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, and pain. Additionally, sexual dysfunction can impair body image, lower self-esteem and sexual satisfaction, and result in psychological distress and decreased quality of life [<a href="#rid2">2,3</a>]. </p><p>Despite the prevalence of sexual dysfunction related to cancer therapy, the majority of female cancer survivors do not always receive necessary information, support, or treatment for these conditions. Clinicians may efficiently and easily identify patients with sexual dysfunction using validated tools and ubiquity-style inquiry and statements. Guided by a multidisciplinary biopsychosocial model  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef131848" href="/z/d/graphic/131848.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>), clinicians can also comfortably and thoroughly inquire, assess, and refer if treatment is beyond their expertise [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. Finally, sexual rehabilitation should encompass both physical and psychosocial aspects of function that have been disrupted in order to maximize the potential for both short- and long-term sexual recovery. </p><p>An overview of the epidemiology, etiologies, evaluation, and management of sexual dysfunction in female cancer survivors is discussed in this topic. Sexual dysfunction in other cancer survivors and patient populations are discussed separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/100080.html" rel="external">"Overview of sexual dysfunction in male cancer survivors"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/17007.html" rel="external">"Approach to survivors of epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal carcinoma", section on 'Sexual dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/108021.html" rel="external">"Squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva: Medical therapy and prognosis", section on 'Surveillance'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14233.html" rel="external">"Overview of approach to lung cancer survivors", section on 'Sexual dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/96044.html" rel="external">"Overview of psychosocial issues in the adult cancer survivor"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5424.html" rel="external">"Overview of sexual dysfunction in females: Epidemiology, risk factors, and evaluation"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5485.html" rel="external">"Overview of sexual dysfunction in females: Management"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6840.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and etiologies of male sexual dysfunction"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14821.html" rel="external">"Sexual dysfunction in older adults"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2204.html" rel="external">"Sexuality in palliative care"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2724791793"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A majority of female cancer survivors endorse at least one distressing symptom related to sexual dysfunction, but few feel prepared to deal with these changes. The type and incidence of specific sexual dysfunction may differ based on the underlying malignancy. Dyspareunia (ie, pain associated with attempted vaginal intercourse) is the most common sexual complaint for female cancer survivors [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>Over half of female patients treated for breast and genitourinary cancers report long-term negative changes in sexual function. Similarly, among female patients treated for gynecologic cancers, a majority (up to 90 percent) report significant sexual dysfunction [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Additional populations of female cancer survivors similarly face high rates of treatment-related sexual dysfunction but are frequently overlooked, such as those with hematologic malignancies treated with hematopoietic cell transplantation [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]; female survivors of head and neck cancer; and those with genetic predispositions to malignancy.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Breast, gynecologic and rectal cancer </strong>– The rate of dyspareunia is estimated at 45 percent or greater among survivors of breast cancer and survivors of either gynecologic or rectal cancer treated with radiation therapy [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. Among females with cervical cancer, the rate of dyspareunia ranges between 12 to 58 percent, and is often attributed to estrogen deficiency and structural tissue changes related to cancer therapy [<a href="#rid11">11,12</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5409.html" rel="external">"Female sexual pain: Differential diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hematologic malignancies (treated with hematopoietic cell transplantation) </strong>– Females with hematologic malignancies who undergo hematopoietic cell transplantation are at risk for severe mucosal diseases, such as vulvovaginal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>] and lichen sclerosis [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Both GVHD and lichen sclerosis are painful conditions that are often either misdiagnosed or go undiagnosed. (See <a class="local">'Graft-versus-host disease'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5409.html" rel="external">"Female sexual pain: Differential diagnosis", section on 'Vulvar dystrophies and dermatoses'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Head and neck cancers </strong>– For females treated for head and neck cancers, over 35 percent report loss of sexual interest and enjoyment [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. This is most likely related to a combination of factors, including chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, changes in oral sensation (eg, xerostomia) or odor, changes in body image due to surgery, and psychological distress such as anxiety or depression. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/89977.html" rel="external">"Overview of approach to long-term survivors of head and neck cancer", section on 'Sexual dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Genetic disorders </strong>– Finally, female patients at high risk for cancer due to either genetic germline pathogenic variants or familial cancer predisposition often undergo prophylactic surgeries to reduce the risk of breast and/or ovarian cancers, such as mastectomies or bilateral oophorectomies. This population also reports high rates of negative sexual sequelae [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. However, these individuals often receive little attention or preparation for potential sexual problems because they may not have had a cancer diagnosis before undergoing such interventions. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/753.html" rel="external">"Genetic testing and management of individuals at risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/758.html" rel="external">"Cancer risks and management of BRCA1/2 carriers without cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/785.html" rel="external">"Overview of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2827466849"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF THE BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL MODEL</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Sexual dysfunction in female cancer survivors can be impacted by biological, psychological, interpersonal, and sociocultural factors, otherwise known as the biopsychosocial model  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef131848" href="/z/d/graphic/131848.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4,17</a>]. Guided by this multidisciplinary model, clinicians can also comfortably and thoroughly assess female cancer survivors for sexual dysfunction; offer specific therapeutic interventions, medical management, and education; and refer them for sexual counseling and/or rehabilitation if treatment is beyond their expertise.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Biological factors </strong>– Biological factors that can impact sexual dysfunction include hormonal changes (eg, due to menopause or endocrine therapy) or anatomic changes to genitalia secondary to therapy that can interfere with sexual response.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Psychological factors </strong>– Psychological factors include possible mood disorders such as depression or anxiety (which can often be comorbid in cancer survivors) or critical self-evaluation during sexual intercourse. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Interpersonal factors </strong>– Interpersonal factors include general satisfaction for the relationship and communication with the patient's partner, which can impact sexual satisfaction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sociocultural factors </strong>– Sociocultural factors that can impact a patient's attitude towards sexual health include menopause, age, religion, culture, and other social values.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1217778962"><span class="h1">CAUSES OF SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Sexual health is a multidimensional construct that goes beyond intercourse to include intimacy, body image, desire, arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction.<strong> </strong>Among female cancer survivors,<strong> </strong>common causes that impact sexual health include both primary therapies (eg, surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy [RT], endocrine therapy), secondary etiologies related to cancer treatment, and psychological distress.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2951189515"><span class="h2">Cancer therapy</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H632296181"><span class="h3">Surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surgical management, especially in the treatment of breast, gynecologic, bladder, and rectal cancer, often results in anatomic, sensory, and endocrinologic changes that affect sexual function. Examples of such as surgical interventions and their associated impact on sexual dysfunction include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mastectomy or lumpectomy </strong>– Mastectomy or lumpectomy can alter<strong> </strong>breast and nipple anatomy, as well as sensation, in female patients with breast cancer. Although most patients undergo breast-conserving and reconstructive surgeries, skin- and nipple-sparing procedures do not preserve sensation. Since nipple sensation and stimulation often plays a central role in sexual arousal, total loss of breast sensation can have a significant negative impact on sexual function. In addition, lymphedema may result from axillary, pelvic, or inguinal lymph node resection, which can result in psychological distress and reduced quality of life. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/738.html" rel="external">"Clinical staging and conservative management of peripheral lymphedema", section on 'Psychological morbidity'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/754.html" rel="external">"Overview of long-term complications of therapy in breast cancer survivors and patterns of relapse", section on 'Sexual dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Hysterectomy </strong>– Hysterectomy alone has not been associated with changes in sexual function, based on data from patients with benign disease. However, in patients with cervical cancer, the combination of<strong> </strong>hysterectomy and RT can lead to changes in the length or caliber of the vagina (eg, vaginal stenosis) as well as decreased vaginal lubrication and elasticity. These changes can adversely affect sexual function, overall quality of life, and psychosocial well-being following treatment. (See <a class="local">'Vaginal stenosis'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3246.html" rel="external">"Management of early-stage cervical cancer", section on 'Sexual dysfunction'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/134395.html" rel="external">"Hysterectomy (benign indications): Patient-important issues and surgical complications", section on 'Psychosexual issues'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Vulvectomy </strong>– In patients with vulvar malignancies treated with simple vulvectomy, surgery is tailored to maintain body image and preserve sexual function. However, in patients treated with radical vulvectomy, the extensive anatomic changes to the perineum can interfere with sexual response and result in significant sexual dysfunction and psychological distress. (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3284.html" rel="external">"Vulvar wide local excision and simple vulvectomy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3280.html" rel="external">"Radical vulvectomy", section on 'Introduction'</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Oophorectomy </strong>– Bilateral oophorectomy in premenopausal females leads to an abrupt and often severe premature menopause, which is associated with hormonal, physical, and psychological consequences that affect sexual well-being [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3304.html" rel="external">"Oophorectomy and ovarian cystectomy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/14198.html" rel="external">"Elective oophorectomy or ovarian conservation at the time of hysterectomy", section on 'Sexual dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cystectomy </strong>– Cystectomy for treatment of bladder cancer may result in neural injury and/or changes in pelvic anatomy that alter lubrication and reduce vaginal capacity, such as vaginal foreshortening or narrowing [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2974.html" rel="external">"Radical cystectomy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Colorectal resection, surgical ostomies </strong>– Surgery for treatment of colorectal cancer can lead to both neural and anatomic changes that result in vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. Female cancer survivors with permanent surgical ostomies also face a range of challenges that affect sexual function and body image; approximately half of female patients with stomas who were sexually active before surgery report not resuming sexual activity postoperatively [<a href="#rid19">19,20</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1384.html" rel="external">"Ileostomy or colostomy care and complications", section on 'Sex'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2163575467"><span class="h3">Chemotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Chemotherapy contributes to sexual dysfunction in female cancer survivors, regardless of age [<a href="#rid21">21</a>], and may affect all domains of sexual function. The most common side effects associated with chemotherapy include dyspareunia and vaginal dryness, which are most likely due to underlying mucosal injury. Examples of other specific side effects include the following: </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Endocrinologic effects </strong>– Younger females who undergo abrupt chemotherapy-related menopause are at the highest risk for sexual problems [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Chemotherapy may initiate ovarian failure, leading to sudden loss of estrogens. Similarly, endocrine therapy resulting in estrogen deprivation following chemotherapy-induced menopause leads to vaginal dryness and vaginal atrophy, resulting in dyspareunia. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5424.html" rel="external">"Overview of sexual dysfunction in females: Epidemiology, risk factors, and evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Peripheral neuropathy </strong>– Peripheral neuropathy is a common side effect with certain chemotherapeutic agents, such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/z/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a>, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8430" href="/z/d/drug information/8430.html" rel="external">etoposide</a>, taxanes, and vinca alkaloids. Perineal nerves may be affected, leading to numbness, tingling, or neuropathic pain [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2826.html" rel="external">"Overview of neurologic complications of platinum-based chemotherapy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94976.html" rel="external">"Prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mucosal changes </strong>– Some chemotherapeutic agents, such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10135" href="/z/d/drug information/10135.html" rel="external">pegylated liposomal doxorubicin</a>, may cause vaginal or rectal mucosal toxicity [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H632447254"><span class="h3">Radiation therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>RT for pelvic (ie, cervical, uterine, colon, and rectal) cancers can adversely impact sexual dysfunction due to both acute and long-term effects on the bowel, bladder, and vagina [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. </p><p>Common acute effects of RT that may impact sexual function during or immediately after RT include acute radiation injury to the bowels (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, radiation proctitis), bladder (eg, radiation cystitis) and vagina (eg, vaginal mucositis). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90926.html" rel="external">"Treatment-related toxicity from the use of radiation therapy for gynecologic malignancies", section on 'Gastrointestinal'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90926.html" rel="external">"Treatment-related toxicity from the use of radiation therapy for gynecologic malignancies", section on 'Genitourinary system toxicities'</a>.)</p><p>Chronic effects of RT that impact sexual function over time include vaginal atrophy, adhesions, and fibrosis. Compounded by the effects of menopause, these changes may lead to decreased tissue elasticity and vaginal stenosis, or the narrowing and shortening of the vaginal canal. Vaginal stenosis may cause dyspareunia and ultimately prevent vaginal penetration [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. Rarely, patients may experience rectovaginal or vesicovaginal fistulas. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90926.html" rel="external">"Treatment-related toxicity from the use of radiation therapy for gynecologic malignancies", section on 'Vagina'</a> and <a class="local">'Vaginal stenosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3891288880"><span class="h3">Endocrine therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In breast cancer patients, treatment with endocrine therapy may lead to vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and decreased sexual desire [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>]. As the duration of endocrine therapy has been extended for many female cancer survivors, it is important to recognize that unmanaged sexual side effects of endocrine therapy are one of the most common reasons for early treatment discontinuation [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>]. This pattern is seen mostly in women treated with aromatase inhibitors and less commonly in those treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9972" href="/z/d/drug information/9972.html" rel="external">tamoxifen</a>.

This brief educational overview also conveys a message that sexual recovery is possible, which impacts the interpersonal, psychological, and sociocultural domains. Cancer survivors often feel additionally burdened by social stigmas attached to sexual dysfunction. It can be a relief to survivors when their clinicians offer validation that unmanaged sexual dysfunction does not have to be the "price to pay" for becoming a cancer survivor.

The primary treatments for vaginal stenosis are the application of vaginal dilators and pelvic floor physical therapy. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2182921289"><span class="h3">Vaginal dilators</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goal of treatment with vaginal dilators is to limit the formation of adhesions by gently separating the layers of the vaginal wall. For females who wish to maintain vaginal function after pelvic radiation, vaginal dilators should be utilized approximately two to four weeks after treatment completion. A lubricated dilator is vaginally inserted for a duration of 10 to 20 minutes, three times a week. Vaginal bleeding with dilator use is common, and vaginal lubricants, moisturizers, and local hormone preparations may be useful adjuncts [<a href="#rid43">43</a>].</p><p>Unfortunately, adherence with vaginal dilators is low, and female patients often discontinue treatment due to lack of education on its proper use and/or therapeutic success. To optimize the efficacy of vaginal dilators, patients should be referred to a pelvic floor physical therapist who can demonstrate and educate patients on the use of vaginal dilators. For example, patients should be taught that the dilator gradually stretches an atrophic or shortened vagina; retrains the body to gain control of pelvic floor muscles; and reduces involuntary pelvic floor tightening due to anticipatory anxiety. </p><p>Among female patients treated with pelvic radiation, the consistent use of dilators in graduated sizes is associated with lower rates of stenosis, in one systematic review [<a href="#rid76">76</a>]. However, limited data from randomized trials demonstrate no improvements in sexual health with vaginal dilation.

Loss of sexual desire is typically driven by factors that are biological (eg, hormonal deprivation, vaginal dryness, pain) as well as psychological, interpersonal, and sociocultural (eg, negative body image, psychological or relationship distress). Because of the multifactorial nature of low desire, it is particularly important to bring a biopsychosocial approach to the diagnosis and management of these patients  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef131848" href="/z/d/graphic/131848.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). (See <a class="local">'Overview of the biopsychosocial model'</a> above.)</p><p>For female cancer survivors, low desire may often be initially ameliorated by treating underlying physical etiologies such as dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, or pelvic pain. For patients whose symptoms of low desire do not improve with treatment of physiologic etiologies, we suggest referral to a mental health provider and/or a sex therapist for behavior-based interventions that focus on mindfulness-based approaches to enhancing desire [<a href="#rid77">77-79</a>]. We also suggest referral for sex therapy or couples-based psychotherapy for female patients who specifically endorse concerns related to body image, psychological concerns, and relationship distress. As the theoretical model of female sexual desire has significantly shifted over the last two decades, there is a growing understanding of the importance of reframing expectations around the spontaneity of desire and, alternatively, emphasizing the responsive nature of desire [<a href="#rid80">80</a>]. Desire may be understood as an experience that can be cultivated through multiple modalities, both behavioral and cognitive. Specific examples include use of novel stimuli, pleasure-focused sensual awareness, intimacy-focused exercises with a partner, and enhancement of nonjudging cognitive awareness. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5485.html" rel="external">"Overview of sexual dysfunction in females: Management", section on 'Hormone therapy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/96044.html" rel="external">"Overview of psychosocial issues in the adult cancer survivor"</a>.)</p><p>Pharmacologic interventions are not effective in treating low desire. As an example, in a randomized phase II trial of 230 female survivors of breast and gynecologic cancer with low baseline sexual desire (based on the Female Sexual Function Index [FSFI]), treatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9171" href="/z/d/drug information/9171.html" rel="external">bupropion</a> at either 150 mg or 300 mg over a ten-week period did not improve sexual desire compared with placebo (mean change in FSFI desire subscale score from baseline to nine weeks for 150 mg daily 0.02, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.39; for 300 mg daily -0.02, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.36) [<a href="#rid81">81</a>]. </p><p>In addition, pharmacologic interventions are often not indicated for female cancer survivors who are postmenopausal or experiencing low desire secondary to a general medical condition or the direct, physiologic effects of a substance or medication (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). The role of androgen (ie, testosterone) therapy in this setting is also uncertain. Further details on such pharmacologic interventions are discussed separately.

Similar to postmenopausal females, those female patients with vaginal dryness due to cancer therapy typically need increased stimulation to reach orgasm. However, such vaginal dryness can make stimulation uncomfortable or painful, thus resulting in failure to reach climax. Initial therapy with sexual aids (eg, vibrators) can support oxygenated genital blood flow and enhance masturbation, genital stimulation, and arousal. Patients should also be advised to use lubricants with sexual aids; however, silicone-based personal lubricants should not be used with silicone vibrators because silicone surfaces may bond together and compromise the integrity of the vibrator covering.
