         Prevention of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections can avert significant morbidity associated with primary infection and the ongoing discomfort and psychological distress that may occur with recurrences. Preventive measures include patient education, use of barrier protection, and chronic suppressive therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will address measures that are available to prevent HSV transmission. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of HSV infection are discussed elsewhere. (See

         Counseling is important for the effective management of the patient with genital HSV, particularly in the setting of a primary or first recognized clinical episode. Many questions invariably arise at the time of diagnosis as to the expected frequency and severity of recurrences and the potential for transmission to others.
        </p>
        <p>
         Psychological aspects of HSV infection can be distressing for patients, but may be under-appreciated by the clinician. A diagnosis of HSV may evoke anger, disbelief, low self-esteem, and fear of rejection by present and future sexual partners [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. It is important for the clinician to openly address all of these issues.
        </p>
        <p>
         Anger is often directed at the current partner and questions regarding partner infidelity may arise at the time of diagnosis. However, the first diagnosed outbreak does not necessarily imply new acquisition [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Patients should be counseled that this may be the first recognized outbreak; only serologic testing in concert with virologic testing of the lesions can determine if their current episode represents newly acquired infection.

         <span class="headingEndMark">

         Patients need to be reassured that recurrences are generally less severe and shorter than the first episode and that episodic treatment of recurrences, or chronic suppression with antiviral therapy, are available therapeutic options. They should be educated about the probability of recurrence, which is much higher with HSV-2 (&gt;90 percent) than HSV-1 infections [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3

         Once a patient is diagnosed with genital HSV infection, counseling should also include prevention of transmission to the partner(s). Patients need to be educated that HSV can be transmitted even when symptoms or genital lesions are absent, due to viral shedding. Direct contact with mucous membranes or skin can lead to viral transmission, even in the absence of sexual intercourse.

         Prevention of genital herpes can only occur in the context of accurate, laboratory diagnosis. Up to 20 percent of persons clinically diagnosed with genital herpes do not have genital HSV infection [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ], and thus remain susceptible when exposed to infected partners. In addition, persons with genital HSV-1 infection remain susceptible to HSV-2 infection, and thus counseling associated with diagnosis of genital HSV-1 infection should include discussion of the potential risk of HSV-2 acquisition.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sex partners should be included within counseling and education sessions regarding HSV infection [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-7
         </a>
         ]. Serologic testing should be considered for partners without a clear diagnosis of genital herpes to determine the risk of HSV acquisition. Couples who are serologically discordant should be advised to abstain from intercourse when active lesions or prodromal symptoms are present [
         <a href="#rid8">

There is also a nationwide list of HSV support groups available to patients. The Herpes Resource Center (HRC) has an affiliated network of local support (HELP) groups for people concerned about HSV. The groups provide a confidential environment where participants can get information and share concerns with others (

          DISCLOSURE OF HSV STATUS TO SEXUAL PARTNERS

         All persons with genital HSV-2 infection should be encouraged to inform their current and future sex partners that they have genital herpes [
         <a href="#rid8">

         Retrospective studies evaluating source partners of individuals with newly acquired genital herpes have demonstrated a short interval between initiation of sexual activity and the onset of genital herpes infection.
        </p>
        <p>
         A clinical study was undertaken to determine whether persons who were aware of their HSV-2 status and disclosed this information to their sexual partners were less likely to transmit HSV-2 infection [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Based upon the short incubation period of HSV infection, a time-to-event design was utilized to assess the risk of HSV acquisition among these newly infected patients with the following results:

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">

         Most individuals who acquired genital herpes were in new sexual relationships (median duration 3.5 months).

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The median number of sex acts prior to HSV transmission was 40 (interquartile range, 15-75).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The median time to HSV-2 acquisition was longer in participants whose partners informed them that they had genital herpes than in those who were not informed (270 days versus 60 days, respectively).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In this study, the risk of HSV-2 transmission was approximately halved when the source partner knew their status and informed their partner. The changes in sexual behavior that accompanied the disclosure, which protected against HSV-2 transmission, were not clear.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since nearly all infected individuals regularly shed HSV on genital mucosa while remaining asymptomatic, sexual transmission of genital herpes continues [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. The study findings support the use of type-specific serologic assays that can reliably distinguish between HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections to identify individuals with HSV-2 infection [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,12
         </a>
         ]. Serologic testing coupled with efforts to encourage disclosure of genital herpes infection to sexual partners may provide a pivotal advance in public health strategies adapted to control transmission of genital herpes [

         Sexual activity should be discouraged if lesions or prodromal symptoms (those that precede the appearance of lesions) are present, even if condoms are used. Viral shedding is most likely to occur during these stages. Thus, patients should be encouraged to recognize the symptoms specific to their prodrome (eg, localized genital pain or itching, or neuropathic pain in the buttocks or leg) and avoid exposing susceptible partners to the genital area at that time. While viral shedding may also occur during asymptomatic periods, the frequency of viral shedding is higher during lesional episodes, and the amount of virus present is higher.

         </span>
         The use of condoms remains a pivotal strategy for the prevention of genital HSV-2 infection and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Given the potential for subclinical viral shedding, condoms should be used in patients with recurrent genital ulcer disease when lesions are not present, and in patients who only have serologic evidence of HSV-2 (ie, those who have never had symptoms). Individuals with HSV-2 who have prodromal symptoms or active lesions should abstain from sexual activity as described above.
        </p>
        <p>
         Consistent condom use can decrease the risk of HSV-2 transmission to an uninfected partner by up to 96 percent, and is most effective in preventing transmission from men to women [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13-17
         </a>
         ]. However, patients should be counseled that transmission of HSV-2 still remains a possibility even with consistent condom use due to shedding of virus from mucosa not shielded by condoms, or HSV-1 by unprotected oral-genital contact.
        </p>
        <p>
         Studies illustrating the efficacy of condoms in reducing HSV-2 transmission include:

         In one analysis of 528 monogamous couples with discordant HSV-2 serostatus (261 susceptible men and 267 susceptible women), condom use during more than 25 percent of sex acts was associated with a lower likelihood of HSV-2 acquisition in susceptible women (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.085) but not in men [
         <a href="#rid14">

         In a second study of 1843 participants, 118 (6 percent) became infected with HSV-2 [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Men and women reporting more frequent use of condoms (&gt;75 percent of sex acts) were at lower risk for acquisition of HSV-2 than those who used condoms less frequently (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.59-0.95).

         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Using data from an HIV-1 prevention trial, the estimated efficacy of condoms in reducing HSV-2 from men to women was 96 percent (28.5 transmissions per 1000 unprotected sex acts versus 1.3 per 1000 protected sex acts; 95% CI 84-99). There was also a nonsignificant reduction in HSV-2 transmission from women to men (1.7 transmissions per 1000 unprotected sex acts versus 0.6 per 1000 protected sex acts; 95% CI 5-88).

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite the benefits of using condoms, consistent condom use is difficult in monogamous HSV-2 serodiscordant couples. A study of condom use patterns among 1193 such couples demonstrated that the majority of persons either abstained from sexual activity or used condoms "always" during symptomatic periods; in contrast, condom use was low during asymptomatic periods [
         <a href="#rid18">

         <a href="#rid19">
          19

         ]. Symptomatic patients with HSV-2 infection received either 500 mg of valacyclovir once daily or placebo. Suppressive therapy led to a significant reduction in overall acquisition of genital HSV-2 infection in the uninfected partner (1.9 versus 3.6 percent, hazard ratio [HR] 0.52; 95% CI 0.27-0.99). Valacyclovir use was also associated with fewer days of viral shedding (2.9 versus 10.8 percent of days) and fewer recurrences of genital herpes (0.11 versus 0.40 per month) in the infected source partner. Therapy was extremely well tolerated over the eight-month study period.

         There is some evidence that prophylactic therapy may not be effective in preventing HSV-2 transmission from a subset of immunocompromised hosts to their serodiscordant partners.

At study entry, none of the participants were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) for their HIV, which was consistent with guidelines at that time. HSV-2 seroconversion occurred in 40 couples receiving acyclovir and 28 couples receiving placebo (HR 1.35; 95% CI 0.83-2.20). It is not known whether daily suppressive therapy will result in a reduced risk of HSV-2 transmission from HIV-infected persons who are receiving ART or from persons who are immunocompromised for reasons other than HIV.

         We suggest administering suppressive antiviral agents to most HSV-2-infected patients to reduce the risk of transmission to their uninfected partners. This decision is based, in part, upon the immune status of the host patient. Conversations with all patients should emphasize the importance of condom use to decrease HSV-2 transmission to uninfected partners since antiviral therapy reduces, but does not eliminate, viral shedding [

         In immunocompetent patients with HSV-2 (including those who are asymptomatic), we administer suppressive antiviral therapy to decrease the risk of HSV-2 transmission to patients who have an at-risk partner. The potential benefits include decreasing symptomatic disease and reducing the chance that an uninfected partner will acquire HSV-2 by approximately 50 percent. The use of suppressive therapy to prevent transmission has not been studied in asymptomatic individuals; however, antiviral treatment is likely to reduce the risk of HSV-2 transmission to the sexual partners of these persons, as viral shedding occurs also in the absence of symptoms. The risks of treatment include mild and infrequent side effects (eg, headaches) and the inconvenience of taking a daily medication.

         For most patients with genital HSV-2 infection and an uninfected partner, we administer chronic suppressive therapy to reduce clinical recurrences and viral transmission.
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10034" href="/z/d/drug information/10034.html" rel="external">
          Valacyclovir
         </a>
         (500 mg daily) is the best-studied regimen for this specific indication and offers the convenience of once-daily dosing. However,

          acyclovir
