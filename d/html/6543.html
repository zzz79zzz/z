         The emergency clinician should promptly identify children with vascular insufficiency and obtain emergency consultation with an orthopedic surgeon with appropriate pediatric expertise. Rarely, these children may require partial closed reduction in the emergency department in an attempt to restore distal circulation. Patients who display a cold, white, or cyanotic hand despite reduction attempts require operative exploration and vascular repair.

         Patients with type I open fractures of the forearm (ie, clean wound &lt;1 cm in length) usually have minimal soft tissue injury and intact local perfusion. These fractures have low infection rates (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef72480" href="/z/d/graphic/72480.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Preliminary evidence suggests that nonoperative treatment of these injuries with irrigation, one dose of intravenous antibiotics, and casting in the emergency department can have good results [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1-3
         </a>
         ]. However, given the limited numbers of patients in these series, further study is needed before nonoperative treatment of these injuries becomes routine. An orthopedic consultation should always be obtained for these patients.

         For children with no signs of vascular compromise, initial therapy consists of pain control and immobilization prior to radiographic evaluation [

          Mild to moderate pain
         </strong>
         – For patients with mild to moderate pain (eg, nondisplaced or minimally displaced fracture), oral nonopioid analgesia (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13371" href="/z/d/drug information/13371.html" rel="external">

          acetaminophen
         </a>
         ) may suffice. In most circumstances, pain relief will result in an improved ability to assess neurovascular status in the apprehensive child. For persistent moderate pain, a single dose of an oral opioid medications (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12666" href="/z/d/drug information/12666.html" rel="external">

          Severe pain

          fentanyl

         delivered by an atomizer (2 mcg/kg; maximum single dose 100 mcg) while establishing intravenous (IV) access. Once an IV line is established, further opioid analgesia (eg, fentanyl,
         <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="16024" href="/z/d/drug information/16024.html" rel="external">

          hydromorphone
         </a>
         ) can be given IV as needed. Pain should be controlled prior to radiographic evaluation. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/82857.html" rel="external">
          "Pediatric procedural sedation: Pharmacologic agents", section on 'Fentanyl'

        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with significant deformity, immobilizing the injured arm prior to taking radiographs also promotes pain relief and avoids additional soft tissue injury from inadvertent arm movement. In this situation, the arm should be splinted "as it lies" (typically a volar splint using prefabricated splinting material or eight layers of plaster with under cast padding [eg, Webril] and loosely applied elastic bandages [eg, Ace wrap]) (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50501" href="/z/d/graphic/50501.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Neurovascular status should be checked before and after splinting. If any further compromise is found after immobilization, then the splinting material should be removed and the arm position should be adjusted. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6334.html" rel="external">
          "Basic techniques for splinting of musculoskeletal injuries", section on 'Sugar tong splints'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients without obvious deformity may be initially managed with a splint and sling or a sling alone for additional pain relief during radiographic assessment.
        </p>
        <p>
         After immobilization, patients
         <strong>
          without
         </strong>
         vascular compromise should elevate the distal forearm above the level of the heart and should have a cold pack applied while awaiting definitive treatment.

         Evidence suggests that clinicians who are experienced in pediatric fracture reduction and cast or splint immobilization of the reduced fracture can provide this care for displaced Salter-Harris I or II, greenstick, or complete distal forearm fractures with good outcomes. As an example, fractures reduced and casted by trained pediatric emergency physicians had a similar healing, shorter emergency department stays, lower facility charges, and no increased short-term cast problems when compared with reduction by orthopedic residents [

          6-8

         Injury to the growth plate may be apparent on plain radiographs or, in patients with nondisplaced Salter-Harris I fractures, inferred by localized tenderness over the physis. The type of fracture, based upon the Salter-Harris classification (

         Presumed Salter-Harris I fractures occur when there is localized tenderness over the physis in the absence of any radiographic findings. If there is concern for a Salter-Harris I fracture without radiographic findings, it can be treated with a removable volar splint and re-evaluated by the primary care provider after 7 to 10 days to determine if further immobilization or imaging is required [

         Treatment of these fractures focuses on reducing the fracture and maintaining arm support during the healing period. The reduction should be performed as soon as possible (within a week), because the growth plate heals quickly and closed reduction after seven days is associated with injury to the growth plate and a higher risk of growth arrest (

         Follow-up with an orthopedic surgeon with appropriate pediatric expertise should occur within seven days. Displaced Salter-Harris I or II fractures typically require immobilization with a splint or cast for three to four weeks.

         These fractures warrant prompt consultation with an orthopedist with appropriate pediatric expertise. Salter-Harris type III fractures involve the joint surface (

        </p>
        <p>
         Salter-Harris type IV and V fractures also typically require open reduction with internal fixation [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. Salter-Harris IV fractures are unstable, and perfect reduction is necessary for a good outcome (

          image 2
         </a>
         ). These fractures usually heal in four to six weeks. Salter-Harris type V fractures are frequently difficult to identify at initial evaluation and are followed by premature growth plate closure and growth arrest several months later. (See

         Torus fractures are stable compression fractures that are located at the distal metaphysis where the bone is most porous (

         <a href="#rid12">
          12,14
         </a>
         ]. Before treatment, the clinician should be certain that the child does not have a greenstick (

         ) or Salter-Harris II distal radius fracture because these fractures are often mistaken for torus fractures. In contrast with torus fractures of the distal radius, greenstick and Salter-Harris II fractures of the distal radius have a greater tendency to displace, warrant closer follow-up, and require prolonged immobilization to ensure proper healing and recovery [

         For children with a torus (buckle fracture), we recommend treatment with either a soft elastic bandage or a removable short arm splint (eg, soft Velcro splint or a well-padded and molded fiberglass or plaster volar splint) rather than a circumferential cast [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. The choice of a soft elastic bandage versus a short-arm splint is determined by the parent's/primary caregiver's management preferences after an informed discussion of treatment options. This discussion should emphasize the evidence that pain control and recovery are similar regardless of which treatment is provided. It should also include detailed pain management instructions with the expected time of recovery [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Home management with follow-up with a physician as needed is sufficient for the vast majority of patients with torus fractures. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Torus fractures'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Use of a soft elastic bandage instead of splint immobilization (mostly removable splints) for torus fractures has been examined in a large multicenter randomized trial performed in nearly 1000 children 4 to 15 years old [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. The primary outcome of pain at three days measured with the Wong-Backer Faces pain rating scale was similar in the two groups (adjusted difference -0.1 [95% CI -0.4 to 0.2]) and pain scores remained equivalent at all other follow-up time points (day 7, 21, and 42). Patient or caregiver reported functional recovery was also similar in the two groups. Of the 458 children assigned to treatment with a soft bandage, 11 percent returned for medical care to change treatment to splint immobilization. Approximately 1 percent of patients were found to have an alternative diagnosis (eg, greenstick or complete fracture) that required a revisit and casting. Parent/caregiver satisfaction was higher for the splinted group on day 1 but was equivalent between the two groups on day 42.
        </p>
        <p>
         Systematic reviews demonstrate that splinting of torus fractures is similar to casting with respect to pain, return to normal function, treatment failure, or risk for refracture while having the advantage of lower burden of treatment, greater comfort, and lower cost [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19-21
         </a>
         ]. Although there is heterogeneity among the trials, they do demonstrate that, regardless of the treatment, children with torus fractures have a full return to prior function with no serious adverse events or refracture and indicate that below-elbow casting for torus fractures is unnecessary [
         <a href="#rid18">

         These patients typically require immobilization in a short arm cast or splint (depending on degree of angulation and displacement) for approximately four to six weeks, depending on the speed of radiographic healing and patient symptoms.

         The degree of angulation that is allowed without reduction depends on the patient's age and type of deformity.

For example, in a randomized, blinded trial of 133 children diagnosed with torus fractures in a pediatric emergency department, functional recovery and caregiver satisfaction at three weeks was at least as good for children who were assigned home management compared with routine primary care provider follow-up (mean performance score 95.4 versus 95.9 percent [95 percent score on the modified Activities Scale for Kids-38 question performance version indicates no disability]) [

In a large multicenter randomized trial of nearly 1000 children 4 to 15 years of age with torus fractures, a change in treatment because of persistent pain requiring a repeat hospital visit occurred in 11 percent of patients who received an elastic bandage and 5 percent of those who were splinted [

         Median neuropathy may also occur after a radial and/or ulnar distal physeal fracture as a result of direct trauma or a secondary carpal tunnel syndrome. Fracture reduction or release of the carpal tunnel compression typically results in return of nerve function.

          Greenstick fractures
         </strong>
         — Refracture may occur in children with poorly healed greenstick fractures. For this reason, these fractures need to be adequately immobilized until radiographic and clinical healing are evident. In addition, activities should be restricted for additional time (one to six weeks) so that full recovery of arm movement and strength can occur [

         <a href="#rid25">
          25

         Refracture is another common complication. Complete diaphyseal fractures are eight times more likely to refracture than complete metaphyseal fractures, with the rate of refracture highest in patients with the shortest duration of casting [

          Emergency treatment

         – The emergency clinician should promptly identify children with vascular insufficiency and emergently involve an orthopedic surgeon with appropriate pediatric expertise. Rarely, these children will require partial closed reduction in the emergency department in an attempt to restore distal circulation. Patients who display a cold, cyanotic or pale hand despite reduction attempts require emergency operative exploration and vascular repair. (See

         – Following definitive care, children with distal forearm fractures, other than splinted torus fractures, should follow up with an orthopedic surgeon. Timing depends on the type of fracture and treatment provided. (See

         Children with low-risk torus (buckle) fractures treated with a soft bandage or removable volar splints do not routinely require medical follow-up or repeat radiographs. (See
