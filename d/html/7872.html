Hyperthyroidism is the most common feature of Graves' disease, affecting nearly all patients, and is caused by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, thyrotropin)-receptor antibodies (TRAb) that activate the receptor, thereby stimulating thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion as well as thyroid growth (causing a diffuse goiter). The presence of TRAb in serum and thyroid eye disease on clinical examination distinguish the disorder from other causes of hyperthyroidism.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of treatment options for Graves' hyperthyroidism in nonpregnant adults. The pathogenesis of Graves' disease, the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, other causes of an overactive thyroid gland, as well as treatment of Graves' disease in pregnant women and in children are reviewed in more detail in separate topic reviews. The treatment of hyperthyroidism due to other etiologies is reviewed in the individual topics.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7841.html" rel="external">"Pathogenesis of Graves' disease"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7833.html" rel="external">"Overview of the clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism in adults"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7847.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of hyperthyroidism"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7871.html" rel="external">"Disorders that cause hyperthyroidism"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7884.html" rel="external">"Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy: Treatment"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5854.html" rel="external">"Treatment and prognosis of Graves disease in children and adolescents"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H27895232"><span class="h1">THERAPEUTIC APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The therapeutic approach to Graves' hyperthyroidism consists of both rapid amelioration of symptoms with a beta blocker and measures aimed at decreasing thyroid hormone synthesis: the administration of a thionamide, radioiodine ablation, or surgery [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>The approach outlined below is consistent with Hyperthyroidism Management Guidelines from the American Thyroid Association (ATA) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Symptom control: Beta blockers</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A beta blocker should be started (assuming there are no contraindications to its use) in most patients as soon as the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is made, even before confirming that the cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves' disease. We typically start with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8940" href="/d/drug information/8940.html" rel="external">atenolol</a> 25 to 50 mg daily and increase the dose as needed (up to 200 mg daily) to target a pulse of 60 to 90 beats per minute if blood pressure allows.</p><p><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8940" href="/d/drug information/8940.html" rel="external">Atenolol</a> has the advantages of single daily dosing and beta-1 selectivity; however, all beta-adrenergic blocking drugs effectively diminish hyperthyroid symptoms. Beta blockers ameliorate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism that are caused by increased beta-adrenergic tone [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. These include palpitations, tachycardia, tremulousness, anxiety, and heat intolerance. Fatigability and shortness of breath were also improved in patients who were treated with a beta blocker and a thionamide versus a thionamide alone [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7874.html" rel="external">"Beta blockers in the treatment of hyperthyroidism"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2638690"><span class="h2">Decrease thyroid hormone synthesis</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1095594915"><span class="h3">Treatment options</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are three treatment options for Graves' disease: antithyroid drugs (thionamides), radioiodine, or surgery. All three options are effective, but all three options have significant side effects  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67833" data-inline-graphics="67833" href="/d/graphic/67833.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). Additionally, the treatment options are not mutually exclusive. Antithyroid drugs may be used initially to control hyperthyroidism prior to definitive therapy with radioiodine or surgery, they may be prescribed for one to two years, or longer, to try and attain a remission, or they may be used long term. Radioiodine may be given as initial therapy or after pretreatment with antithyroid drugs, and surgery is usually preceded by antithyroid drugs to attain a euthyroid state preoperatively.</p><p>There are few trials comparing the three treatment options [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In the only randomized trial comparing all three therapies, each was equally effective in normalizing serum thyroid hormone concentrations within six weeks; after treatment, 95 percent or more of the patients were satisfied with their therapy [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. In addition, most patients reported that they would recommend the therapy to a friend without reservation (medical 68 percent, surgical 74 percent, radioiodine 84 percent). The risk of relapse was 37, 21, and 6 percent in the thionamide, radioiodine, and surgery groups, respectively.</p><p></p><p>Observational studies with three to eight years of follow-up show higher success for radioiodine and surgery compared with thionamides [<a href="#rid7">7-9</a>]. Most of the patients treated with radioiodine or surgery were being treated with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9557" href="/d/drug information/9557.html" rel="external">levothyroxine</a> for permanent hypothyroidism. </p><p>As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>At the Mayo Clinic (720 patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism), the rate of success was reported to be 52, 92, and 100 percent for thionamides, radioiodine, and surgery, respectively, while side effects occurred in 17, 1, and 6 percent of patients, respectively [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A United States administrative data set (4661 patients) reported success rates of 50, 93 and 99 percent for thionamides, radioiodine, and surgery, respectively, with side effects of 12, 6, and 24 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a study from Sweden (1186 patients assessed on average eight years later), 65 percent of patients were treated initially with thionamides, whereas 27 percent initially received radioiodine and 4.5 percent surgery [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Remission rates after initial therapy with thionamides, radioiodine, or surgery were 45, 82, and 96 percent, respectively. Half of the patients initially treated with thionamides eventually had ablative therapy. Only 39 percent were euthyroid without benefit of medication. </p><p></p><p>The popularity of antithyroid drugs is increasing in the United States, and the use of radioiodine is decreasing. In a 2011 survey, over half of clinicians in the United States preferred radioiodine while approximately 40 percent initiated a one- to two-year course of antithyroid drugs. Radioiodine was unpopular in Europe and Asia, with over 80 percent of European clinicians choosing antithyroid drugs and only 14 percent choosing radioiodine [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. In a 2020 analysis of United States insurance claims data, antithyroid drugs were used as initial therapy of Graves' disease in 60 percent of patients, while only 33 percent of patients received radioiodine and 6 percent surgery [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. At Massachusetts General Hospital, there has been an 85 percent reduction in the use of radioiodine for hyperthyroidism between 2006 and 2019 [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. </p><p>It is assumed that antithyroid drugs have become more popular than the other treatment options because of avoidance of hypothyroidism as well as publication of studies demonstrating their long-term safety and higher remission rates after longer periods of treatment. Whereas radioiodine has become less popular because of its association with worsening thyroid eye disease and patient fears regarding radiation exposure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7876.html" rel="external">"Thionamides in the treatment of Graves' disease", section on 'Remission'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7875.html" rel="external">"Thionamides: Side effects and toxicities"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7879.html" rel="external">"Radioiodine in the treatment of hyperthyroidism", section on 'Contraindications and precautions'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7879.html" rel="external">"Radioiodine in the treatment of hyperthyroidism", section on 'Adverse effects'</a>.)</p><p>In the future, immunotherapy may be a therapeutic option. In a phase 1 study utilizing antigen-specific immunotherapy with thyrotropin receptor peptides, hyperthyroidism improved in 70 percent of patients [<a href="#rid12">12</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1085652933"><span class="h3">Selection of therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We discuss treatment options with patients and consider their values and preferences when choosing therapy. Considerations in choosing treatment should include success rates, side effects, and the rapidity with which euthyroidism is achieved. This approach is consistent with ATA guidelines [<a href="#rid1">1,13</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Treatment options'</a> above and <a class="local">'Thionamides'</a> below and <a class="local">'Radioiodine ablation'</a> below and <a class="local">'Surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>A study of the determinates of patient and physician choice found that both patients and physicians valued achievement of remission highly (and avoidance of hypothyroidism), and thus a preference for antithyroid drugs [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. For second choice, patients preferred surgery over radioiodine, while physicians preferred radioiodine over surgery. Individual patient factors (eg, severity of hyperthyroidism, presence of thyroid eye disease, presence of contraindications to selected therapy) influence the choice of initial therapy. Overt hyperthyroidism is best managed by an endocrinologist or other providers trained and experienced with the treatment options and side effects.</p><p>The ATA guidelines provided a "rough guide" for the ranges of free thyroxine (T4) seen in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hyperthyroidism, but emphasized that patient symptoms, gland size, and T3 level (when available) were additional important considerations. The following suggests treatment options based upon disease severity:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mild hyperthyroidism</strong> <strong>(eg, free T4 1 to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal with minimal thyroid enlargement)</strong> –<strong> </strong>For patients with mild hyperthyroidism and no thyroid eye disease, a one- to two-year course of thionamides is associated with above average remission rates. For patients who prefer definitive therapy, radioiodine can be used as initial therapy (without thionamide pretreatment) when patients are tolerating hyperthyroid symptoms and are not at risk for complications. Surgery requires pretreatment with a thionamide (in the absence of a contraindication).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Moderate hyperthyroidism</strong> <strong>(eg, free T4 1.5 to 2 times the upper limit of normal with moderate thyroid enlargement)</strong> – For patients with moderate hyperthyroidism and no thyroid eye disease, a one- to two-year course (or longer) of a thionamide is reasonable. Long-term thionamide therapy may be needed. For patients who prefer definitive therapy, radioiodine can be administered with or without pretreatment with a thionamide depending upon symptoms. Alternatively, patients may prefer surgery after pretreatment with a thionamide.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Severe hyperthyroidism</strong> <strong>(eg, free T4 2 to 3 times the upper limit of normal with goiter)</strong> <strong>and/or high risk of complications</strong> – For patients with severe hyperthyroidism, or patients with a significant risk of hyperthyroid complications (eg, older age, cardiovascular disease), we suggest starting a thionamide (in addition to beta blockers) to achieve euthyroidism quickly. This can be followed by ablative therapy with radioiodine (in the absence of thyroid eye disease), by surgery, or by continuation of a thionamide for one to two years or longer with the hope of attaining a remission, or by long-term treatment with a thionamide.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thyroid eye disease</strong> – For patients with mild hyperthyroidism and minimal thyroid eye disease, radioiodine (with glucocorticoid coverage) or a one- to two-year course of thionamides are good options. For patients with moderate to severe thyroid eye disease, we prefer surgery rather than radioiodine with glucocorticoid coverage for definitive therapy. Radioiodine therapy may be more likely to lead to the development or worsening of orbitopathy than antithyroid drugs or subtotal thyroidectomy since it is associated with an increase in TSH-receptor antibodies (TRAb). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7827.html" rel="external">"Treatment of thyroid eye disease", section on 'Additional treatment according to severity of orbitopathy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Large goiters, suspicious nodules, or concomitant hyperparathyroidism</strong> – Surgery may be the best option for patients with very large goiters and patients with suspicious nodules or hyperparathyroidism but may be a poor option for patients who are older, at high surgical risk, or without access to high-volume thyroid surgeons.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pregnancy issues and</strong> <strong>contraindications</strong> – Radioiodine is contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation and should be discouraged or prohibited in patients who cannot follow radiation precautions (eg, sole caregivers for infants or young children, or incontinent older adult patients). Antithyroid drugs are contraindicated in patients with prior adverse reactions (agranulocytosis or hepatitis). Because they are teratogenic, their long-term use in women desiring a pregnancy in the next year or two requires a careful discussion of their risks and alternative treatments, such as definitive therapy prior to conception. Long-term use of thionamides may be preferred in patients who want to avoid definitive therapy and in older adult patients with contraindications to surgery and radioiodine. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7884.html" rel="external">"Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy: Treatment"</a> and <a class="local">'Thionamides'</a> below and <a class="local">'Radioiodine ablation'</a> below and <a class="local">'Surgery'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>The individual therapies are discussed briefly below and in more detail in the individual topic reviews.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h3">Thionamides</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with significant symptoms of hyperthyroidism, we suggest starting a thionamide (in addition to beta blockers) to achieve euthyroidism relatively quickly, prior to potential definitive therapy with radioiodine or surgery. The goal of thionamide therapy in Graves' hyperthyroidism is to attain a euthyroid state within three to eight weeks. This can be followed by ablative therapy with radioiodine or surgery, by continuation of the drug for one to two years or longer with the hope of attaining a remission, or for long-term therapy.</p><p>For patients with mild disease and small goiters, who are more likely to achieve remission after one year of treatment, primary antithyroid drug therapy may be preferred. Antithyroid drugs will control hyperthyroidism in most patients as long as the drug is taken, but remission rates (the percentage of patients who remain euthyroid one year after the drug is withdrawn) average under 40 percent after one to two years of treatment [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], but have been reported to exceed 80 percent after 5 to 10 years of treatment [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Remission is more likely in patients with mild hyperthyroidism and patients with small goiters or with goiters that shrink during thionamide therapy. Remission is also predicted by the change in TRAb levels over time. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7876.html" rel="external">"Thionamides in the treatment of Graves' disease", section on 'Rate of prolonged remission'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7876.html" rel="external">"Thionamides in the treatment of Graves' disease", section on 'Predictors of remission'</a>.)</p><p>Administration of thionamides is reviewed briefly below and, in more detail, separately. Contraindications and adverse effects are also reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7876.html" rel="external">"Thionamides in the treatment of Graves' disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7875.html" rel="external">"Thionamides: Side effects and toxicities"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pretreatment evaluation</strong> – Prior to initiating thionamides, we obtain baseline blood tests, including a complete blood count (white count with differential) and a liver profile (bilirubin and transaminases) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. We do not use thionamides in patients with a baseline absolute neutrophil count &lt;1000 cells/microL or elevated liver transaminases (more than fivefold the upper limit of normal) except in selected patients after careful assessment of alternatives and risks. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7876.html" rel="external">"Thionamides in the treatment of Graves' disease", section on 'Initiation of therapy'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Choice of thionamide</strong> – The thionamide <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9627" href="/d/drug information/9627.html" rel="external">methimazole</a> is the primary drug used to treat Graves' hyperthyroidism [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Methimazole is now almost exclusively used because of its longer duration of action, allowing for once-daily dosing, more rapid efficacy  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54732" href="/d/graphic/54732.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>), and lower incidence of side effects. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9830" href="/d/drug information/9830.html" rel="external">Propylthiouracil</a> (PTU) is preferred during the first trimester of pregnancy, because of the more significant teratogenic effects of methimazole, and in patients who have minor drug reactions to methimazole who want to avoid radioiodine or surgery. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7875.html" rel="external">"Thionamides: Side effects and toxicities"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Carbimazole, rather than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9627" href="/d/drug information/9627.html" rel="external">methimazole</a>, is available in some countries.
