         Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) is a rare pulmonary tumor, with features of both small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
        </p>
        <p>
         Due to the rarity of LCNEC, there are no large randomized trials that define the optimal treatment approach for either localized or advanced disease [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Treatment recommendations are based upon extrapolation from the approach to patients with SCLC, NSCLC, and the established literature, which is primarily retrospective in nature. Our suggested approach to LCNEC is discussed here.
        </p>
        <p>
         Discussions dealing with SCLC, NSCLC, and the pathology of lung cancer are found elsewhere.

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The clinical presentation of LCNEC appears similar to the other high-grade neuroendocrine pulmonary tumor, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), with notable exceptions: primary LCNECs tend to be located peripherally rather than centrally, and presentation of LCNECs with early-stage (I to II) disease is more common than for SCLC (approximately 25 versus less than 5 percent). Thus, patients with LCNEC more commonly undergo resection.
        </p>
        <p>
         Further, because LCNEC can be a difficult diagnosis based on needle aspirate or small biopsy, the diagnosis is frequently made post-resection. Approximately 25 percent of LCNEC tumors are combined with other histologies, including SCLC most commonly, as well as adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinomas.

         Genomic profiling of LCNEC using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue and targeted sequencing panels suggests similarities between both small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with regards to specific mutations [

         ]. However, the first investigation using integrative genomic and transcriptomic profiling of LCNEC shows that, despite mutations in genes commonly seen in NSCLC, the overall transcriptional pattern is most similar to SCLC [

         <a href="#rid4">
          4-6

         ]. For example, whole-exome sequencing of 467 cases of LCNEC found that 79.1 and 36.8 percent of tumors had alterations in
         <em>
          TP53
         </em>
         and RB1, respectively, the two most commonly altered genes [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. In this cohort, 24 percent of LCNECs were considered genomically SCLC-like (both

         and

        </p>
        <p>
         Subsequently, a 2018 study reported the first integrated genomic and transcriptomic profiling of LCNEC with comparison to other lung histologic subtypes [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing of 60 tumor-normal pairs, RNASeq on 69 tumors, and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays for copy number variations on 60 tumors were performed. They confirm the prior reports in showing two genomic subgroups segregating based primarily on
         <em>
          RB1
         </em>
         status. These groups were termed
         <strong>

         and
         <em>
          RB-1
         </em>
         ; 42 percent), similar to the NSCLC-like and SCLC-like subsets, respectively, discussed above.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, comparison of the transcriptomic profiles of LCNEC to existing gene expression data for SCLC, pulmonary carcinoids, squamous cell carcinomas, and adenocarcinomas, showed that LCNEC clustered in transcriptional subgroups with SCLC, one cluster predominantly LCNEC, and one cluster predominantly SCLC. There was no clustering of LCNEC with either adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. Thus, the profiles were distinctly different from the NSCLC tumors, despite harboring similar mutation signatures. They were much more similar to SCLC, though in many respects unique. Differential gene expression analysis confirmed that both type I and type II LCNECs commonly showed upregulation of neuroendocrine and endocrine markers and lineage-specific transcription factors commonly upregulated in SCLC (eg,
         <em>
          ASCL1
         </em>
         and
         <em>
          NeuroD1
         </em>
         ). There was also upregulation of E2F targeted genes, checkpoint kinases, and DNA damage response genes, confirming that LCNEC is truly a neuroendocrine tumor and not a neuroendocrine version of NSCLC subtypes. Similar to the majority of SCLCs, type I LCNECs, despite carrying mutations common to NSCLC, have an expression profile with
         <em>
          ASCL1
         </em>
         high/
         <em>
          DLL3
         </em>
         high/
         <em>
          NOTCH
         </em>
         low. Type II LCNECs, which carry the hallmark
         <em>
          p53
         </em>
         /
         <em>
          RB1
         </em>
         null profile of the SCLC, paradoxically exhibit decreased expression of neuroendocrine markers,
         <em>
          ASCL1
         </em>
         low
         <em>
          /DLL3
         </em>
         low
         <em>
          /NOTCH
         </em>
         high
         <em>
          ,
         </em>
         and increased expression of immune-related genes. While the transcriptomic data should be considered preliminary until confirmed in additional cohorts, they do provide a framework for further investigation, highlighting the importance of transcriptional profiling, analogous to the proposed classification for SCLC that is based on four key transcription factors [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In summary, despite earlier genomic data suggesting "NSCLC" and "SCLC"-like genomic profiles for LCNEC, the transcriptional profile of the NSCLC-like genomic subtype of LCNEC, appears similar to the most common subtype of SCLC. Meanwhile, the SCLC-like genomic subtype is characterized by a transcriptional profile uncommon in SCLC. Overall, these findings reinforce that LCNEC is a unique and separate entity that defies simplistic classification based only on mutation pattern, and the paradigm of categorizing it as either resembling SCLC or NSCLC is inaccurate.

However, application of the latter requirement to cytologic specimens and small biopsies is problematic, and we obtain resected tumors for analysis when LCNEC is suspected, when feasible [

         LCNECs do not meet the criteria for the three better recognized neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoid, atypical carcinoid, and small cell carcinoma). Previously classified as a variant of large cell carcinoma, LCNEC is grouped with the pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinomas in the 2015 World Health Organization classification. (See

         Similar to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we suggest sequencing using a next-generation sequencing panel to identify potentially targetable alterations. This and other methods to assess tumors for genetic alterations are similar to that used in NSCLC and are discussed elsewhere (see

         For example, one report has described the association of PD-L1 expression with tumor-infiltrating immune cells (including lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and monocytes) and mutation burden in 192 patients [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3

         ]. This analysis included comparative data in 120 patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Tumor cell PD-L1 expression ≥1 percent was found in 17 percent of LCNEC cases, similar to the 15-percent rate in SCLC. However, immune cell infiltration was more frequent in LCNEC versus SCLC (58 versus 23 percent), as was PD-L1 expression on immune cells (46 versus 23 percent). Similar rates of PD-L1 expression were observed in a cohort of 467 patients using 22C3 pharmDx immunohistochemistry assay, with 21.5 percent of samples staining &gt;1 percent [

         Immune cell infiltration was more frequent in early-stage versus late-stage LCNEC (61 versus 28 percent), though stage-dependent differences were not observed in SCLC. It should be noted that only 8 (7 percent) cases of SCLC were stage I or II, compared with 29 (40 percent) cases of LCNEC and thus stage effects, as opposed to histology may confound the finding that immune cell infiltration was more frequent in LCNEC. Further, technical issues could contribute to stage-dependent immune cell infiltration due to the evaluation of resected tumors in early stage, as opposed to biopsies for stages III to IV.

         In a subset of cases (39 LCNEC and 63 SCLC) with tumor evaluable for both PD-L1 by immunohistochemistry and mutation burden from targeted next-generation sequencing, the number of nonsynonymous mutations/tumor was positively correlated with immune cell infiltration and PD-L1 expression on immune cells for both LCNEC and SCLC [

Two of these three patients (66 percent) had confirmed partial responses, while the response rate overall for patients with high-grade tumors was 8 of 19 (42 percent). Interestingly, there were no confirmed responses in patients with low- or intermediate-grade NEC. Alanine transaminase (ALT) elevation (9 percent) was the most common grade 3 or 4 immune toxicity. Nausea and fatigue were the most common toxicities occurring in approximately 30 percent of patients. Given the established high tumor mutation burden (TMB) in LCNEC [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,7
         </a>
         ], and the previously reported correlation of high TMB and response to nivolumab with and without ipilimumab in SCLC [

         ],
         <strong>
         </strong>
         it is tempting to speculate that this could explain the high response rate observed in the DART trial. Correlative immune biomarker analysis from this cohort is awaited. The DART trial will also accrue an additional cohort of patients with high-grade NEC to confirm their initial findings.

Patients with heavier disease burden or a more rapid pace of disease may benefit from chemotherapy and immunotherapy, as discussed above. However, for those with limited disease burden or more indolent disease, or for those wishing to avoid the toxicities associated with these treatments, we suggest a targeted therapy approach, analogous to driver-mutated NSCLC. Case reports predominantly from Asia have demonstrated variable sensitivity of LCNEC to targeted therapy [

         Most studies indicate that stage-matched survival is worse for LCNEC compared to non-small cell carcinoma and other large cell carcinomas, and similar to that of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) [

         In a surveillance epidemiology and end results (SEER) database study of 1444 early stage patients who underwent resection only (no radiation therapy and no information regarding chemotherapy), a numerically worse four-year survival rate was observed in patients with SCLC, compared with LCNEC and other large cell carcinomas [

However, multivariate analysis demonstrated no significant difference in overall or lung cancer-specific survival between LCNEC and SCLC, nor between LCNEC and other large cell carcinomas.

         Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) is a rare pulmonary tumor, with features of both small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). (See

         The clinical presentation of LCNEC appears similar to SCLC, with notable exceptions: primary LCNECs tend to be located peripherally rather than centrally, and presentation of LCNECs with early-stage (I to II) disease is more common than for SCLC. (See
         <a class="local">

         Although genomic profiling of LCNEC suggests similarities between both SCLC and NSCLC with regards to specific mutations, subsequent integrative genomic and transcriptomic profiling of LCNEC shows that the overall transcriptional pattern is most similar to SCLC. (See

         LCNEC is diagnosed based on high-grade features (&gt;10 mitotic figures in 2 mm

         For patients with early-stage LCNEC, surgical resection is indicated when feasible. Because of the overall poor prognosis, we suggest adjuvant chemotherapy rather than observation (

          Grade 2C

          etoposide

         For patients with positive mediastinal nodes (stage III) after resection, and for those with unresectable stage III disease, we suggest chemoradiotherapy with
