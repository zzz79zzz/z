         Acute coronary syndrome includes suspected or confirmed cases of acute myocardial ischemia or infarction. The three types of acute coronary syndrome are ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI), non-ST elevation MI, and unstable angina. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/43.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Psychosocial factors such as stress and depression may be risk factors for acute coronary syndrome, although the mechanisms underlying the association remain uncertain. Emotional stress may also trigger takotsubo cardiomyopathy and spontaneous coronary artery dissection. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3494.html" rel="external">

         This topic discusses psychosocial factors that might precipitate acute coronary syndrome, mechanisms by which emotional stress may perhaps precipitate acute coronary syndrome, and depression following acute coronary syndrome.

         </span>
         The circadian variation in frequency of myocardial infarction (MI), sudden cardiac death, and myocardial ischemia is characterized by a morning peak. A meta-analysis of 66,635 patients with an acute MI and 19,390 patients with sudden death reported an excess of MIs (relative risk 1.38) and sudden deaths (relative risk 1.29) between the hours of 6:00 AM and noon compared with the rest of the day  (

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The circadian variation in event frequency suggests that cardiac events may be triggered by external activities, particularly those activating the sympathetic nervous system [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Support for this comes from one study of 1225 patients that reported an absence of a circadian variation in diabetics, particularly those with evidence of cardiac autonomic neuropathy who have absent heart rate variability [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ] and those taking beta blockers or

        </p>
        <p>
         Circadian variability in platelet aggregability and fibrinolytic capacity may be other factors contributing to the morning increase in MI. Among patients with stable coronary heart disease, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity peaks in the early morning while tissue plasminogen activator activity is at its nadir; treatment with a beta blocker ameliorated this relatively prothrombotic state [

         Psychosocial factors are associated with onset of acute coronary syndrome. One study found that among 849 patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI), 48 percent described one or more events that possibly triggered the MI, the most common of which was emotional upset (14 percent) [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Other studies have identified possible psychosocial triggers in up to 27 percent of patients [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-9
         </a>
         ]. The subsections below describe specific factors that may trigger acute coronary syndrome.

         Multiple studies have established that adverse life events are associated with acute coronary syndrome [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. As an example, a national registry study identified a group of patients with psychiatric disorders induced by an acute stressful life event (n &gt;130,000) and a group of their full siblings without stress related disorders (n &gt;170,000) [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. The stress-related disorders included acute stress reaction, posttraumatic stress disorder, or adjustment disorder, and study subjects were followed for up to 27 years. After controlling for potential confounding factors (age, comorbid general medical disorders, and comorbid psychiatric disorders), the analyses found that among subjects followed for at least one year, the risk of MI was modestly greater in patients with stress-related disorders than the unaffected siblings (relative risk 1.3, 95% CI 1.2-1.4). In subjects followed for at least 10 years, the risk of MI was 60 percent greater in patients with stress-related disorders than the unaffected siblings.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, a retrospective study of psychosocial cardiac risk factors compared patients with a first MI (n &gt;11,000) with age- and sex-matched controls (n &gt;13,000) from 52 countries on six continents [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. One of the factors was stressful life events, such as marital separation or divorce, loss of job, violence, or death of a close family member. Stressful life events had occurred more frequently during the prior year in patients than controls (16 versus 13 percent; odds ratio 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.6). Additional information about the risk of acute MI soon after bereavement is discussed separately. (See

         In a prospective study of men and women with a mean age of 45 years (n &gt;13,000), a questionnaire assessed levels of chronic psychosocial stress, which were high in 15 percent, moderate in 6 percent, and low in 80 percent [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. At a mean follow-up of 21 years, 20 percent had suffered a first cardiovascular event (fatal or nonfatal MI or stroke, angina, or acute coronary syndrome). The risk of a first cardiovascular event was higher for those with moderate or high stress, though the magnitude of the increase was small (adjusted risk ratio 1.14).

Patients were assessed for high job strain, which was a combination of high psychological demands and little latitude to make decisions, and for recurrent coronary heart disease events (fatal coronary heart disease, nonfatal MI, or unstable angina). After adjusting for potential confounding factors (eg, sociodemographic factors, coronary heart disease risk factors, and social support), the analyses found that chronic high job strain was robustly associated with an increased rate of recurrent coronary heart disease events (hazard ratio 2.4, 95% CI 1.4-4.1).

After adjusting for potential confounding factors (eg, age, smoking, and history of diabetes), the analyses showed that each one-point increase in PHQ-2 scores was modestly associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease, including symptom levels below the threshold that indicate potential depressive disorders (hazard ratio 1.11, 95% CI 1.08-1.14). The corresponding incidence of cardiac events per 10,000 person-years of follow-up was greater among individuals with a PHQ-2 score of 4 or more, compared with a score of 0 (21 versus 14).

After controlling for potential confounding factors (eg, age, diabetes, and hypertension), the analyses found that cardiovascular mortality was greater in patients with current or previous depression than patients without depression (0.8 versus 0.5 percent).

         Multiple studies suggest that there is a dose-response relationship, such that more severe depression is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease. In a prospective cohort of subjects ≥65 years of age (n &gt;4400), who were initially free of cardiovascular disease at baseline and followed for up to six years, each five-unit increase in depression rating scale score was associated with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.15 for developing coronary heart disease and 1.16 for all-cause mortality [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. Those with the highest depression scores had a 40 and 60 percent increased risk of coronary disease and death compared with those with the lowest scores. A similar graded relationship was noted for the occurrence of MI in an epidemiologic study; the relationship was independent of coronary risk factors [

         In addition, the risk of cardiovascular disease may be greater in patients diagnosed with depressive disorders than patients with depressive symptoms identified by rating scales. A systematic review of 28 studies in approximately 80,000 subjects found that the probability of cardiovascular disease was greater in patients with a clinical diagnosis of a depressive syndrome than those without a diagnosis (odds ratio 2.5, 95% CI 2.1-3.1) [

Although depressive disorders and depressive symptoms were each associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, the risk was greater in patients with depressive disorders.

If the plaque disruption is major with extensive exposure of collagen and atheromatous core contents to the lumen, this may lead immediately to occlusive thrombosis, with MI or sudden cardiac death. If the disruption is minor, it may lead to nonocclusive thrombosis. In this setting, the patient may be asymptomatic or develop unstable angina or non-ST elevation MI. The lesion may gradually heal with smooth muscle cell proliferation and a greater degree of stenosis. Alternatively, a further increase in coagulability or vasoconstriction may precipitate occlusive thrombosis, MI, and sudden cardiac death.

A retrospective study identified patients without known cardiovascular disease (n = 293) who underwent positron emission tomography/computerized tomography and were followed for a median of four years. After controlling for potential confounding factors (eg, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking), the analyses found that increased resting metabolic activity in the amygdala was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events such as MI, stroke, and unstable angina (hazard ratio 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.8) [

         The relationship between stress and acute coronary syndrome may also involve the prefrontal cortex.

          60
         </a>
         ]. After adjusting for potential confounding factors (eg, age, smoking, and prior MI), the analyses found that a one standard deviation increase in prefrontal activation during mental stress at baseline was associated with a 21 percent increase in major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, MI, unstable angina with revascularization, and heart failure hospitalization).

         After acute coronary syndrome, depression appears to be a risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes and mortality, and should not be viewed as a normal reaction to cardiac illness [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. Psychotherapy and antidepressants, combined together or as monotherapy, can resolve depressive syndromes, and treatment may improve cardiovascular outcomes. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Choosing a treatment regimen'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Although many patients who are depressed after a myocardial infarction (MI) will spontaneously remit, it is not possible to predict which patients will do so. Thus, we suggest screening for depressive symptoms in patients with established coronary heart disease, which is consistent with practice guidelines. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Screening'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Many cardiologists diagnose and treat depression, as do primary care clinicians [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. However, we suggest referral to mental health specialists for treatment-resistant depression and for severe major depression characterized by suicidal or homicidal ideation or behavior, psychosis, or catatonia. In addition, referral is indicated for patients who prefer psychotherapy and patients with comorbid psychopathology such as substance use disorders and anxiety disorders.

         The risk of depression may be three times greater in patients with an MI, compared with the general population [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. After an acute coronary syndrome event, the estimated prevalence of depression ranges from 20 to 30 percent [

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The prevalence of unipolar depression after acute coronary syndrome varies across studies, such that structured interviews detect lower rates and rating scales yield higher rates. In a meta-analysis of eight studies that used structured interviews to assess patients hospitalized for an MI (n &gt;10,000), the estimated prevalence of unipolar major depression was 20 percent (95% CI 19-21 percent) [
         <a href="#rid61">
          61

         ]. By contrast, the same study found that in a meta-analysis of six studies, which used a rating scale to assess clinically significant depressive symptoms in hospitalized patients with MI (n &gt;2200), the prevalence of depression was 31 percent (95% CI 29-33 percent).

         Following an acute coronary syndrome, we suggest screening patients for depression within three months, if services are in place to ensure follow-up for diagnosis and treatment. This approach is consistent with multiple treatment guidelines [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28

         ]. Screening for depression in patients with recent acute coronary syndrome is supported by the American Heart Association scientific advisory that recommends screening for depressive symptoms in patients with established coronary heart disease [
         <a href="#rid62">
          62

         ], practice guidelines from the American Academy of Family Physicians that recommend screening for depression following an MI [
         <a href="#rid64">
          64
         </a>
         ], and the United States Preventive Services Task Force practice guidelines that recommend screening for depression in all adults, including those with cardiovascular disease. (See

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Multiple self-report instruments are available to screen for depression, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire, including the two-item  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89663" href="/z/d/graphic/89663.html" rel="external">

          table 2

         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. Other self-administered instruments include the Beck Depression Inventory and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. A review of six prospective observational studies, which enrolled patients within three months of an acute coronary syndrome (n &gt;1700) and screened them for unipolar major depression  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994" href="/z/d/graphic/89994.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ), found that the diagnostic accuracy of screening instruments in postacute coronary syndrome patients is satisfactory and comparable to what is observed in the general population [
         <a href="#rid65">
          65
         </a>
         ]. Choosing an instrument and screening implementation are discussed separately. (See

          "Screening for depression in adults", section on 'Routine for all patients'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Indirect evidence that supports screening for depression in patients with recent acute coronary syndrome includes multiple randomized trials, which demonstrated that screening for depression in the general adult population improves depressive symptoms, if services are in place to ensure follow-up for diagnosis and treatment. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/83887.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         However, screening for depression following an acute coronary syndrome is not universally endorsed, due to the lack of direct evidence that screening is beneficial [
         <a href="#rid66">
          66,67
         </a>
         ]. Few high quality studies have evaluated screening for depression specifically in patients with recent acute coronary syndrome [
         <a href="#rid68">
          68
         </a>
         ]. One randomized trial lasting 18 months compared screening plus enhanced depression care with no screening and usual care in 999 patients who had no prior history of depression and were hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome in the past 2 to 12 months [
         <a href="#rid69">
          69

         Evaluating patients with acute coronary syndrome for depression can be difficult because some symptoms of depression (eg, anorexia, insomnia, and fatigue) may be attributable to general medical disorders such as heart disease. (See

         Among patients with acute coronary syndrome who are depressed, more severe levels of depression and persistent depression are each associated with greater all-cause mortality. A prospective study enrolled 358 patients who were hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome and had unipolar major depression, and followed them for a median of seven years [
         <a href="#rid73">
          73
         </a>
         ]. The mortality rate was greater in patients with a baseline score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression  (

          table 4
         </a>
         ) ≥18, compared with a score &lt;18 (26 versus 12 percent). All-cause mortality was also greater in patients with little or no improvement in their depressive syndrome, compared with patients who improved very much (28 versus 12 percent). In addition, the association between baseline severity of depression and long-term mortality was independent of the association between failure to improve and mortality.
        </p>
        <p>
         High levels of social support may perhaps reduce mortality among depressed post-MI patients. A study seven days after an MI in 887 patients found that mild to moderate depression, present in 32 percent, was associated with increased cardiac mortality during a one-year follow-up [
         <a href="#rid74">
          74
         </a>
         ]. Although high levels of social support alone did not influence cardiac mortality, they were associated with improvements in depressive symptoms. In addition, high levels of social support appeared to buffer the impact of depression on mortality  (

         Acute coronary syndrome may be associated with an increased risk of suicide [
         <a href="#rid75">
          75
         </a>
         ]. A registry study identified nearly 20,000 people aged 40 to 89 years who died by suicide, and randomly selected nearly 200,000 controls matched by sex, date of birth, and calendar time (control was alive on the day that the case committed suicide) [
         <a href="#rid75">
          75
         </a>
         ]. Patients who suffered an MI and had no prior history of psychiatric illness were three times more likely to commit suicide within one month of the MI, compared with individuals who had no history of MI or psychiatric illness (incidence rate ratio 3, 95% CI 2-7). The risk of suicide remained elevated for at least five years after an MI.

         Several mechanisms may link depression to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Depression is associated with autonomic dysfunction (eg, hypertension, resting tachycardia, and reduced heart rate variability), increased platelet activity, impaired vascular endothelial function, insulin resistance, and inflammation [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27-29
         </a>
         ]. In addition, depression may be associated with functional impairment and negatively affect adherence with recommendations for post-MI therapy, such as cardiac pharmacotherapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and improved diet.

         Depression that occurs soon after acute coronary syndrome often persists. A review of four prospective studies found that among patients who were hospitalized for an MI and developed depressive syndromes (major depression or minor depression) or clinically significant depressive symptoms, 40 to 70 percent remained depressed in the year after discharge [

         For patients with unipolar major depression after acute coronary syndrome (eg, within the past three months), we suggest psychotherapy plus an antidepressant. However, psychotherapy alone is a reasonable choice for patients who want to avoid adverse effects of antidepressants and drug-drug interactions, whereas medication alone is reasonable in patients who decline or do not have access to psychotherapy. No head-to-head randomized trials have compared these three standard treatment regimens in patients who have survived an acute coronary syndrome, and clinicians should attempt to accommodate patient preferences. In addition, it is reasonable to choose treatment based upon factors such as prior treatment history and cost.
        </p>
        <p>
         Using patient preferences to guide treatment of depression is supported by a trial that enrolled patients with acute coronary syndrome and clinically significant depression (n = 157) and randomly assigned them to treatment based upon patient preferences or to usual care [
         <a href="#rid76">
          76
         </a>
         ]. The active intervention arm initially offered patients psychotherapy and/or pharmacotherapy; patients who did not improve were allowed to intensify the initial treatment (eg, increase the frequency of therapy sessions or add a second medication), switch treatments (eg, from psychotherapy to pharmacotherapy), or combine psychotherapy with pharmacotherapy. Improvement of depression was greater among intervention patients and the clinical benefit was moderate to large. In addition, nonfatal MI and unstable angina occurred in fewer intervention patients than usual care patients (4 versus 13 percent).

         For patients who survive an acute coronary syndrome (eg, within the past three months) and have unipolar major depression, we suggest treating the depressive syndrome with psychotherapy plus an antidepressant. We typically use cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) plus a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) such as

Improvement of depression and perceived social support were each greater in patients who received experimental treatment than usual care, but the clinical effect was modest. Although recurrence of MI or death were each comparable for the two groups, antidepressant drugs were associated with a decreased risk of reinfarction or death.

         Many patients with postacute coronary syndrome and unipolar major depression decline treatment with antidepressant drugs and prefer treatment with psychotherapy alone, due to concerns about adverse effects and drug-drug interactions with cardiac medications. For these patients, we suggest monotherapy with CBT or another psychotherapy, such as interpersonal psychotherapy and problem-solving therapy. Other reasonable choices include psychodynamic psychotherapy and supportive psychotherapy. (See

         In addition, randomized trials suggest that psychotherapy can be efficacious for treating unipolar major depression in patients who survive an acute coronary syndrome. Although the benefit of psychotherapy for depression is clinically small, psychotherapy may also reduce cardiac mortality:

          78
         </a>
         ]. The psychological interventions included CBT, relaxation techniques, and emotional support. Some studies included or permitted other interventions, such as cardiac rehabilitation or antidepressants, for both the psychotherapy and usual care groups. Most patients were post-MI (66 percent) or had undergone a revascularization procedure such coronary artery bypass graft (27 percent). Depressive symptoms improved more in the group that received psychological interventions than usual care, but the clinical effect was small. In addition, psychological interventions provided a small to moderate improvement of anxiety and stress that did not occur with usual care. Psychotherapy also resulted in a 21 percent reduction of cardiac mortality (relative risk 0.79, 95% CI 0.63-0.98).

         For patients with acute coronary syndrome who prefer pharmacotherapy rather than psychotherapy for treating unipolar depressive syndromes, we suggest an antidepressant and generally select an SSRI because SSRIs have demonstrated efficacy, are well tolerated, and have been more widely studied and may be more cost effective than other antidepressants [

         Antidepressants can be started once the diagnosis of unipolar major depression has been made, provided the acute coronary syndrome has been stabilized.

         Evidence supporting the use of antidepressants for treating major depression following acute coronary syndrome includes numerous randomized trials in the general population of adults with unipolar major depression; these trials indicate that antidepressants such as SSRIs are more efficacious than placebo.

         Multiple randomized trials have found that SSRIs are safe for patients with unipolar major depression after acute coronary syndrome (eg, within the past three months). In addition, these trials suggest that SSRIs may protect patients against subsequent adverse cardiac events. Although clinicians may be reluctant to prescribe antidepressants to patients who have suffered a recent MI, due to concerns about mortality and major adverse cardiac events such as recurrent MI, unstable angina, or revascularization procedures, the trials indicate that these concerns appear to be unfounded. As an example, a systematic review identified six randomized trials that compared an SSRI with a control condition in patients with coronary artery disease and depression (n = 1091) [
         <a href="#rid93">
          93

         MI occurred less often in patients treated with SSRIs than controls (relative risk 0.54, 95% CI 0.34-0.86). When the analysis was restricted to the four trials that included only postacute coronary syndrome patients (n = 753), the result was nearly the same: SSRIs reduced the risk of MI by 44 percent.

         Collaborative care is a health care model that integrates psychiatric treatment into primary care practices. Patients are treated by a team that usually includes a primary care clinician, a case manager such as a nurse or social worker who provides support and outreach to patients, and a mental health specialist (eg, psychiatrist) who provides consultation and case supervision. Other elements include a structured treatment plan that involves pharmacotherapy and/or other interventions (eg, patient education, CBT, or problem-solving therapy), scheduled follow-up visits, communication among members of the treatment team, and measurement-based care. The specific interventions are administered according to patient preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
         Collaborative care programs can be useful for patients with comorbid coronary heart disease and depression [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27,28
         </a>
         ]. Evidence supporting the use of collaborative care in this population includes numerous randomized trials in the general population of primary care patients with depression, as well as the general population of patients with comorbid depression and general medical illness. (See
