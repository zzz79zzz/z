         Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is an inherited (autosomal recessive) red blood cell (RBC) enzyme disorder that causes chronic hemolysis. It is the second most common RBC enzyme defect but is the commonest cause of chronic hemolytic anemia from an RBC enzyme deficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic reviews the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of PK deficiency. General approaches to evaluating the cause of hemolytic anemia are presented separately:

         PK deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder; affected individuals are either homozygous for a single pathogenic mutation or compound heterozygous for two different pathogenic variants affecting the function of the PK enzyme in red blood cells (RBCs) and liver [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Individuals who are heterozygous for PK deficiency have intermediate enzyme levels and are not affected clinically.
        </p>
        <p>
         PK enzymes consist of several isoforms. They are products of two distinct genes,
         <em>
          PKLR
         </em>
         and
         <em>
          PKM
         </em>
         , both encoding enzymes that catalyze the transphosphorylation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) into pyruvate and ATP during the terminal part of the glycolysis pathway. Clinical PK deficiency with hemolytic anemia is limited to mutations of the
         <em>
          PKLR
         </em>
         gene:

         gene encodes the L (liver) and R (RBC) isoenzymes. The R isoform, unique to RBCs, is 33 amino acids larger than the L isoform, which is unique to hepatocytes. Expression in RBCs versus liver is due to differential use of tissue-specific promoters, which drive expression as well as tissue-specific exon usage (use of exon 1 but not exon 2 in RBCs and exon 2 but not exon 1 in liver).

There are two isoforms, M1 and M2, which result from differential processing of a single transcript. The M2 isoform is dominant during fetal development and is overexpressed in many tumors. After birth, the M2 isoform persists in WBCs and platelets. In RBC progenitor cells, the M2 isoform is progressively replaced with the R form during fetal development. The

         ]. The variants include single nucleotide substitutions as well as intronic and exonic deletions and insertions  (

         The frequency of pathogenic

         gene mutations is far lower than that of the mutations affecting glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), which cause G6PD deficiency. However, unlike G6PD deficiency, which may only manifest hemolysis under certain circumstances such as exposure to oxidant drugs, in PK deficiency, the hemolysis is typically chronic, with occasional superimposed acute hemolysis during hematopoietic stresses such as infection, surgery, trauma, or pregnancy. Thus, PK deficiency is the most common RBC enzyme deficiency causing chronic congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia.

         Pathogenic variants in genes other than
         <em>
          PKLR

         have been shown to reduce PK enzymatic activity, although these are rare. As an example, compound heterozygous disease variants in the gene that encodes Kruppel-like factor 1 (KLF1), the hematopoietic-specific transcription factor essential for induction of expression of adult beta globin and other erythroid genes, have been associated with severe transfusion-dependent hemolytic anemia and PK enzyme deficiency [

         RBCs use several enzyme systems to maintain their viability and function. Two of the major processes under enzymatic control are the production of energy, in the form of ATP, and protection from oxidative injury by compounds that act as reducing agents. The PK enzyme functions in the energy-producing glycolytic pathway, which metabolizes glucose to generate ATP for the cell. However, as PK is the terminal enzyme in glycolysis, the proximal glycolytic intermediates are increased [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,14
         </a>
         ]. This includes increases in 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG, also called 2,3-BPG), with resultant three- to fourfold increase in 2,3-DPG:ATP ratios [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Levels of 2,3-DPG may be elevated up to two times normal in PK-deficient individuals, resulting in decreased hemoglobin oxygen affinity and improved oxygen delivery per unit of hemoglobin, with better tolerance of anemia than would be otherwise expected [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         As shown in the figure, PK catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate by removal of a phosphate group  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83968" href="/z/d/graphic/83968.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). The phosphate group from PEP is transferred to ADP to create one molecule of ATP.
        </p>
        <p>
         The active PK enzyme is a homotetramer that contains four molecules of the PK protein. Thus, in an individual who is heterozygous for two different
         <em>
          PKLR
         </em>
         mutations, five different tetramer compositions will be present (eg, tetramers containing 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 percent of each of the two abnormal protein subunits). The common R510Q and R486W
         <em>
          PKLR
         </em>
         mutations as well as some but not all other
         <em>
          PKLR
         </em>
         mutations, destabilize formation of PK R enzyme tetramers [
         <a href="#rid17">

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         PK is an allosteric enzyme (an enzyme for which binding of an effector to one region of the enzyme results in altered conformation and/or altered enzymatic activity towards a substrate that binds to another region of the enzyme). The substrate for PK is PEP and the allosteric regulator is fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP); binding to FDP changes the conformational structure of PK and its enzymatic activity towards PEP.
        </p>
        <p>
         As noted above, there are two different genes that encode different PK isoforms (see
         <a class="local">
          'Genetics'
         </a>
         above). Individuals with PK deficiency have mutations in the
         <em>
          PKLR
         </em>
         gene that cause reduced PK activity in RBCs. However, the PK activity in other cell types such as WBCs, platelets, and other tissues is normal because the enzyme expressed in these cells is encoded on a separate gene.

         </span>
         The mechanism for hemolysis in PK deficiency is not clear. Although the defect in ATP generation contributes to hemolysis, it is not a sufficient explanation; this conclusion is based on observations that ATP deficiency is difficult to demonstrate in some of the affected patients [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. In addition, other disorders with more severe degrees of ATP deficiency are not associated with significant hemolysis [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Hemolysis in PK deficiency is mainly extravascular (ie, due to phagocytosis of cells by reticuloendothelial macrophages); however, if the hemolysis is severe, there may be spillover to intravascular hemolysis. Thus, many affected patients have normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, but most have elevated bilirubin and clinical jaundice [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         It has been proposed that the mechanism of hemolysis in PK deficiency is similar to the as yet unexplained destruction of young RBCs described in individuals descending from high altitude, a process termed "neocytolysis." It is possible that the process may involve impaired mitochondrial autophagy, resulting in increased mitochondrial mass, in turn leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and prolongation of mitochondrial clearance, along with prolonged reticulocyte survival; however, this remains speculative [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21-23
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with hemolytic anemia who undergo splenectomy, with a resultant decrease in the hemolytic process and improvement of anemia, have a higher number of reticulocytes than they did before the splenectomy. This perplexing observation indicates that knowledge of the regulation of erythropoiesis and reticulocyte kinetics remains incomplete. A significant interaction may occur between the spleen and PK-deficient, young RBCs, through an as yet unknown mechanism that influences premature splenic destruction of reticulocytes and young RBCs, especially in patients with more severe PK deficiency [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24-28
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The metabolic disturbances in PK deficiency affect the survival of RBCs as well as the maturation of erythroid progenitor cells in the spleen, which results in their apoptosis (referred to as ineffective erythropoiesis). Ineffective erythropoiesis in the spleen has been demonstrated in a four-year-old PK-deficient patient who underwent splenectomy, as well as in a mouse model of PK deficiency [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28,29
         </a>

         PK-deficient RBCs show enhanced oxygen delivery for a given partial pressure of oxygen in the bloodstream. This is because the block in glycolysis in PK deficiency is downstream of the Rappaport-Luebering shunt, which results in formation of the metabolic intermediate 2,3 diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG, also called 2,3 bisphosphoglycerate [2,3 BPG]). An accumulation of 2,3-DPG has been noted in PK deficiency, in contrast to a low concentration in hexokinase deficiency, which is upstream from the shunt. This increased 2,3-DPG leads to a rightward shift of the oxygen dissociation curve for hemoglobin in patients with PK deficiency  (

          figure 2
         </a>
         ), resulting in better oxygen delivery to the tissues. As a result, individuals with PK deficiency may tolerate anemia better than those with defects upstream to the Rappaport-Luebering shunt that do not cause a rightward shift in the hemoglobin oxygen curve, such as hexokinase deficiency [

         As in any patient with ineffective erythropoiesis and hyperactive production of early RBC precursors, iron absorption is increased, and iron retention in macrophages is decreased, due to erythroferrone-mediated decreases in the levels of hepcidin. As expected, the iron overload is even more common in those patients requiring transfusions [

         – The geographic distribution of PK deficiency does not show any indication of a positive selection pressure from malaria as there is for other inherited RBC gene variants such as the sickle mutation, thalassemia mutations, the Duffy blood group system, and certain forms of hereditary elliptocytosis.

         PK deficiency is extremely rare; its true prevalence is unknown. Based on the gene frequency of the
         <em>
          PKLR
         </em>
         1529A variant (encoding PK R510Q) in White people and its relative abundance in people with hemolytic anemia, a prevalence of approximately 51 cases per million has been estimated in White Europeans [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33
         </a>
         ]. However, in the experience of this author, the true prevalence of PK deficiency encountered by hematologists to whom rare red blood cell (RBC) disorders are referred is much lower. This coincides with the published prevalence of diagnosed PK deficiency, suggesting that most people with PK deficiency remain undiagnosed [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34,35
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         PK deficiency has a worldwide distribution, but it is more common among people of northern European and perhaps Chinese ancestry [

        </p>
        <p>
         As with any autosomal recessive disorder, PK deficiency can be more common in groups with a history of consanguinity. As an example, a high frequency of PK deficiency has been documented in Pennsylvanian Amish communities and in a fundamentalist branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-day Saints (FLDS Church) at the Utah/Arizona border [

          37,38

         PK deficiency is a lifelong condition, but the age of presentation is not predictable and may vary widely due to significant heterogeneity in the severity of hemolysis and anemia, even among individuals who share the same genotype  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef117376" href="/z/d/graphic/117376.html" rel="external">
          figure 3
         </a>
         ). In some cases, the burden of disease can be high, especially in early childhood [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In most cases, members of a family with the same gene variant tend to have a similar degree of disease severity. The disease has been reported to be particularly severe among the Amish of Pennsylvania, with occasional lethal outcomes in children unless splenectomy is performed [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. (See

         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         There is no typical presentation. The rarity of the condition and variability of presentation make diagnostic delays common, and affected individuals may carry a diagnosis of unexplained anemia or may be misdiagnosed as having other causes of anemia.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a report from 2018 that included 254 individuals in a PK registry, the median age at diagnosis was approximately five months, but the range was large (from birth to 60 years of age) [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Approximately one-third of the individuals in the registry were genetically related to other participants, which may explain the early age at diagnosis for some. In contrast, in a registry study from 2005 that included 61 individuals referred to a single center, the median age at diagnosis was 16 years (range, 1 day to 65 years) [

         The majority of patients (59 percent) had a splenectomy, usually to treat anemia and/or to decrease the transfusion burden (at a median age of 4.1 years); of those who did not undergo splenectomy, 35 percent had splenomegaly [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18

         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. Hemolytic rates were improved after splenectomy but may still remain high even after splenectomy; therefore, cholecystectomy should be considered at the time of splenectomy, even in those without any evidence of gallbladder stones, to avoid future second surgery [

         The severity of presenting findings is highly variable, from hydrops fetalis with death in utero or shortly after birth, to transfusion-dependent anemia, to a mild, compensated hemolysis that does not require transfusions [
         <a href="#rid46">
          46

She had kernicterus as a neonate and was found to have hemolytic anemia without any specific morphologic RBC abnormalities on the peripheral blood smear. She required weekly blood transfusions.

         Management included splenectomy at the age of five months.

She was treated with iron chelation and judicious phlebotomies (starting with volumes of approximately 50 mL and progressively increasing volumes up to 250 mL), and after two years of therapy, her liver function improved and normalized. During this time, her hemoglobin ranged from 8.2 to 9.4 g/dL and her iron markers improved (ferritin decreased to 420 ng/mL; transferrin saturation [TSAT] decreased to 62 percent).

         Iron overload is less common than neonatal jaundice or chronic anemia as a presenting finding that brings the patient to medical attention, but it becomes clinically more apparent during adulthood. Children can also develop iron overload; in a series of 124 children with PK deficiency, iron overload was present in nearly half of those who were evaluated by serum ferritin and/or liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In a 2019 series that evaluated 242 patients using ferritin and MRI, iron overload was seen in 82 percent of patients who were not receiving regular transfusions [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. Ferritin &gt;1000 ng/mL had a sensitivity for liver iron concentration (LIC) &gt;3 mg/g dry weight of only 53 percent, but the sensitivity increased to 90 percent using a ferritin threshold &gt;500 ng/mL, suggesting ferritin &gt;500 ng/mL is a better cut off. The high prevalence of iron overload is the rationale for routine surveillance and preventive strategies. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Typical monitoring schedule'
         </a>
         below and
         <a class="local">
          'Prevention/treatment of iron overload'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Causes of iron overload include ineffective erythropoiesis, leading to increased erythroferrone and decreased hepcidin, which in turn leads to increased intestinal iron absorption, as well as transfusional iron overload. Similar to thalassemia, severe iron overload may occur in nontransfused patients as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         If not detected by surveillance, advanced iron overload may present in a number of ways depending on the organ most affected. Examples include heart failure, liver disease, and endocrine dysfunction; these may be similar to the findings in individuals with other forms of iron overload. (See

         Prenatal diagnosis of anemia can be done using ultrasound and calculating middle cerebral artery velocity [
         <a href="#rid56">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         After birth, the first step in the evaluation of a person with possible PK deficiency is to establish if hemolysis is present. This is done by measuring the reticulocyte count and serum markers of hemolysis such as indirect bilirubin or haptoglobin. Hemolytic anemia is characterized by an increased reticulocyte count, increased indirect bilirubin, and possibly by increased LDH and decreased haptoglobin. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Laboratory findings'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Not all affected individuals have anemia, however, as some may have compensated hemolysis without anemia. In some cases, these individuals come to medical attention when they develop an aplastic crisis (eg, in the setting of parvovirus infection), when they present with complications of hemolysis such as pigment gallstones, or when they develop iron overload.
        </p>
        <p>
         The next step is to determine whether the hemolysis is chronic and present since birth versus acquired, following a period of normal findings (absence of anemia and hemolysis). If hemolysis has been present throughout life, or if this information is inferred (eg, due to family history) or not verifiable, the peripheral blood smear is examined, with a focus on red blood cell (RBC) morphology (eg, schistocytes, elliptocytes, echinocytes, spherocytes, acanthocytes, sickle cells, RBC inclusions). This may allow elimination of other possible causes of inherited hemolytic anemia with highly characteristic findings on the blood smear  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef72394" href="/z/d/graphic/72394.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ), such as hemoglobinopathies (eg, sickle cell disease, unstable hemoglobin, or autoimmune hemolytic anemia) and membrane disorders (eg, hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis). (See
         <a class="local">
          'Differential diagnosis'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         PK deficiency should be considered after these obvious alternative diagnoses have been eliminated, as illustrated in the figure  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef142682" href="/z/d/graphic/142682.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         In many cases, the presence of chronic lifelong anemia and characteristic RBC morphologies are strongly suggestive of specific inherited disorders of the RBC membrane or hemoglobinopathies, and specific diagnostic testing can be obtained. The pace of the evaluation and whether testing is ordered sequentially or simultaneously depends on the severity of the anemia, patient symptoms, and other considerations such as the ease of additional blood draws and follow-up testing.
        </p>
        <p>
         If PK deficiency is suspected based on the family history and/or initial evaluation, subsequent testing can be done using a biochemical assay and/or genetic testing, as discussed below. (See

         However, not every variant detected by DNA analysis can immediately be classified as pathogenic (disease-causing), and further investigation may be required that is only available in a few specialized laboratories (four in the United States and three in Europe). This is especially true for variants in
         <em>
          KLF1

         , which may decrease PK enzyme activity. The

         Biochemical testing should optimally be deferred for two to three months following the last transfusion; this may not be possible in severely anemic, transfusion-requiring individuals.

         WBCs and platelets are removed by filtration with cellulose chromatography. FDP is removed by dialyzing the hemolysate; the enzyme activity is measured in filtered, dialyzed hemolysate tested at different concentrations of the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), with and without FDP [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55,58
         </a>
         ]. Transfused RBCs cannot be removed, and biochemical testing may be affected (eg, falsely normalized) by recent transfusion. In a series of 61 patients with PK deficiency, the median PK activity was 35 percent of normal [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The abnormal PK enzyme may also be partially purified and analyzed via kinetic and electrophoretic studies, although this is not widely available [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         An alternative to the gold standard biochemical assay is to use a rapid screening assay that is widely available in many commercial laboratories. In this assay, the PK activity is measured in an RBC hemolysate, without the initial steps for removing platelets, WBCs, and FDP. This rapid assay identifies most but not all PK-deficient patients, and if positive for PK deficiency, it is sufficient to confirm the diagnosis (see
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnostic confirmation'
         </a>
         below). However, a negative assay cannot be used to eliminate the possibility of PK deficiency, because the contribution of WBC and platelet PK may make the RBC PK activity appear normal when it is not. A similar issue arises in a patient who has recently been transfused.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to performing a potentially less sensitive assay, routine commercial laboratories typically cannot perform the appropriate quantitative analyses with varying concentrations of the PEP substrate, which is helpful for screening for high Km (low affinity) mutants, or to remove FDP, to detect variant enzymes with altered FDP interaction [
         <a href="#rid55">
          55
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Other biochemical testing such as measuring the level of the glycolytic intermediate 2,3-DPG is not used. Increased 2,3-DPG is a common occurrence in PK deficiency but is nonspecific and highly variable. It has been reported that the measurements of RBC 2,3-DPG:ATP ratios would be more specific, but this is not done in routine practice [

         As with any hereditary hemolytic anemia, it is important to thoroughly evaluate the possibility of other causes of anemia for individuals who have a change in symptoms, hemoglobin level, or reticulocyte count, rather than attributing these changes to the underlying disorder. As examples, a decline in hemoglobin and reticulocytes may be a sign of parvovirus infection, new macrocytosis may be a sign of vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, and new microcytosis may be a sign of iron deficiency. At a minimum, these individuals warrant increased monitoring, and if the changes do not resolve in a reasonable period of time, additional testing may be needed, as discussed in separate topic reviews.

        <p>
         Transfusions are generally given for symptoms. The level of hemoglobin should not be the sole criterion, and the need for transfusions should be individualized.
        </p>
        <p>
         RBCs in PK deficiency have a right-shifted hemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve, which means that symptoms are generally less severe than in other individuals with a similar degree of anemia; this is the reason that the hemoglobin level alone should not be used to guide transfusions [

         In a large natural history cohort that included 254 patients, 84 percent received at least one transfusion, with 30 to 50 percent of children on regular transfusions, compared to 10 to 15 percent of adults [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. In a series of patients with PK deficiency referred to a single center, 38 of 59 (64 percent) received blood transfusions (median number, 15; range, 1 to &gt;100), and 19 (32 percent) were transfusion-dependent during childhood or until they underwent splenectomy [

          Indications
         </strong>
         – It would be reasonable to try mitapivat in any adult with PK deficiency who requires transfusions. While some individuals with specific pathogenic variants in the
         <em>
          PKLR
         </em>
         gene may have a suboptimal response or no response, even a borderline response would be of significance in an individual who is transfusion-dependent. Mitapivat is very unlikely to be effective in individuals who are compound heterozygotes for the R479H variant or two non-missense mutations, and these individuals may reasonably choose not to take
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="135030" href="/z/d/drug information/135030.html" rel="external">
          mitapivat
         </a>
         . Mitapivat is a lifelong therapy. These considerations regarding efficacy and need for lifelong treatment should be discussed with patients at the time of therapy decision.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Mitapivat may also be reasonable in adults with symptomatic anemia who do not require transfusions, and even in individuals with compensated hemolysis who do not have overt anemia, as they may have mild symptoms that only become apparent when hemolysis is reduced (eg, fatigue of which they were unaware until it resolved). Further, amelioration of the severity of hemolysis is likely to reduce the accumulation of excess iron leading to iron overload. Although not approved for individuals &lt;18 years, we would also use

         Splenectomy is typically reserved for adults with severe transfusion-dependent anemia not responsive to

         </a>
         . However, in children with frequent transfusions, the benefits of splenectomy may outweigh its risks, even in neonates. Thus, the decision of whether to pursue splenectomy must be made on a case-by-case basis.
         <strong>
         </strong>
         Guidelines for splenectomy used in more common congenital hemolytic anemias such as hereditary spherocytosis may be helpful. (See

         This decision to pursue splenectomy is particularly difficult in adolescents, where the efficacy and safety of

          mitapivat
         </a>
         is under investigation. We generally raise the possibility of splenectomy in all individuals who require chronic transfusions despite mitapivat; we also evaluate the possibility of splenectomy in individuals who do not require chronic transfusions but who have a significant decrease in daily activities due to anemia despite mitapivat. Splenectomy is discouraged in patients &gt;65 years and individuals with increased risk of thrombosis or infection.

          Preoperative considerations
         </strong>
         – For those who elect to pursue splenectomy, especially children, we try to delay the procedure as long as possible (until after the age of three years or after age six years if possible). Young children who undergo splenectomy should be treated with penicillin until they reach the age of three years. Evidence to guide the optimal age of splenectomy comes mainly from observational data in other conditions. (See

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         We make sure to provide pre-splenectomy vaccinations against encapsulated organisms, similar to all individuals undergoing splenectomy for other hematologic conditions such as immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). (See

         The skill of the surgeon is important in preventing surgical complications and allowing a laparoscopic technique, which appears to have lower rates of morbidity and mortality in other conditions such as ITP. In some individuals, it may be possible to perform partial splenectomy. A single report indicated failure of partial splenectomy (80 percent) to reduce the transfusion requirement of a four-year-old patient with PK deficiency [
         <a href="#rid66">
          66

         Splenectomy and cholecystectomy can sometimes be done simultaneously using laparoscopic techniques. For individuals who require cholecystectomy for pigment gallstones, the option of concomitant splenectomy should be discussed, and if the patient is considering splenectomy, the option of combining the procedures should be strongly encouraged. Likewise, any splenectomy candidate should be evaluated for gallstones to consider concomitant cholecystectomy.

         – The beneficial effect of splenectomy on hemolysis has been well documented. Typically, hemolysis and anemia are ameliorated but not entirely abated. In severe cases, the transfusion requirement is generally, but not invariably, abolished.

         Individuals with PK deficiency are at risk of iron overload from frequent transfusions as well as from increased iron absorption due to ineffective erythropoiesis. Iron overload in turn can cause serious organ toxicity to the liver, heart, and endocrine organs.

         Approximately 50 percent of children &lt;18 years have iron overload. The risk of iron loading is lifelong and does not change by age. In children requiring regular transfusions, regular ferritin monitoring and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for iron assessment are advisable on an annual basis. Individuals not receiving regular transfusions should have an MRI once the patient is at an age at which the MRI can be conducted without sedation and/or if their ferritin level is &gt;500 ng/mL [

          Genetics and mechanisms of hemolysis
         </strong>
         – Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is an autosomal recessive hemolytic anemia characterized by reduced activity of one of the two red blood cell (RBC) isoforms of the PK enzyme, which is encoded by the
         <em>
          PKLR
         </em>
         gene  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116698" href="/z/d/graphic/116698.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). PK generates ATP during glycolysis, and reduced ATP may contribute to hemolysis. PK-deficient RBCs show enhanced oxygen delivery for a given partial pressure of oxygen; thus, anemia may be better tolerated than in other hemolytic anemias. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pathophysiology'

         <strong>
          Prevalence
         </strong>
         – PK deficiency is rare. It has a worldwide distribution, but it is more common among people of northern European and perhaps Chinese ancestry. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Epidemiology'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Clinical features
         </strong>
         – Symptoms are variable and diagnostic delays are common. Presentations include neonatal jaundice, chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia  (

         <strong>
          Initial evaluation
         </strong>
         – Testing is appropriate in any sibling of a patient with PK deficiency who has unexplained anemia, or any individual with Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia and absence of morphologic abnormalities suggestive of other conditions  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef142682" href="/z/d/graphic/142682.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Blood smear findings in other anemias are summarized in the table  (

          table 2

         ). Prenatal testing should be offered to parents of a child with hydrops fetalis or severe transfusion-dependent anemia not abrogated by splenectomy. (See

         <strong>
          Specialized testing

         . (See

         <strong>
          for symptomatic anemia

          Grade 2B
         </a>
         ). Mitapivat is also reasonable in children and adolescents with transfusion-dependent anemia and in individuals with mild anemia without symptoms or compensated hemolysis without anemia. Individuals with two non-missense mutations in the
         <em>
          PKLR

          Other interventions
         </strong>
         – Cholecystectomy may be required for pigment gallstones. Iron chelation may be needed to prevent or treat iron overload. Genetic counseling may be appropriate; preimplantation genetic testing or prenatal testing may be offered. (See
