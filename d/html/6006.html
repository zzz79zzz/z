         Promptly establishing the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in infants and young children is important because infants who are infected with HIV have a high morbidity and mortality if treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) is delayed [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In infants and young children, HIV testing must be performed using nucleic acid tests (NATs). Antibody-only and antigen/antibody combination assays that are commonly used for HIV testing in adults and older children are not reliable in infants and young children, because of the persistence of transplacentally acquired maternal antibody.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic reviews the strategy for diagnosing HIV infection in infants and young children of mothers with known HIV infection or of uncertain HIV serostatus.
        </p>
        <p>
         We recognize that not all pregnant, postpartum, and lactating individuals identify as women or mothers. Using gender-inclusive language, however, is not possible in all languages and all countries and for all our readers. The topics discussed here are based on risks driven by biological sex and not gender identity. Therefore, throughout this topic, we use the term “woman” to signify a person of the female sex (regardless of gender identity) and the term “mother” to signify the female biological parent of a child (regardless of gender identity).
        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis of HIV infection in adults and older children (older than age 18 months) and strategies for screening during pregnancy to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV are discussed separately:

         Antibody assays are commonly used for detection of HIV infection in adults and older children. These tests are highly sensitive and specific, though they may be falsely negative in the first few weeks after acute infection. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3736.html" rel="external">
          "Screening and diagnostic testing for HIV infection", section on 'Antibody-only tests'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Newer antigen/antibody combination assays can detect HIV-1/2 antibodies and HIV-1 p24 antigen. Including the latter shortens the window period and increases the detection of early infection. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3736.html" rel="external">
          "Screening and diagnostic testing for HIV infection", section on 'Combination HIV antigen and antibody tests'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The diagnosis of HIV infection in infants and young children differs from that in adults and older children because antibody-only and antigen/antibody combination assays will detect transplacentally transferred maternal HIV antibodies that persist for many months [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. In a study of 234 uninfected children born to HIV-infected mothers who were followed for up to two years, the mean age of loss of maternal antibody was 10.3 months; one child did not lose maternal antibody until &gt;18 months of age [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         To identify HIV infection in infants and young children (ie, &lt;18 months of age), HIV virologic testing must be performed using assays that detect HIV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA), collectively referred to as "nucleic acid tests" (NATs) [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. Cord blood should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be used for testing, because of the possibility of contamination of the sample with maternal blood. Scheduled repeated testing is necessary because test sensitivity increases with time from HIV virus exposure and very recent infection may not be detected.

         Testing at birth – Testing at birth allows early HIV diagnosis and initiation of ART. It also permits determination of timing of the infection if the infant is infected. A positive result at ≤48 hours after birth reflects HIV infection in utero, while infants who have a negative test result during the first week of life and subsequently have positive test results are considered to have intrapartum infection.

         Testing two to six weeks after cessation of ARV prophylaxis – ARV prophylaxis, particularly combination ART, may reduce the sensitivity of testing during prophylaxis. Rather than deferring the earlier testing (at four to eight weeks of age) until after prophylaxis is discontinued (ie, 8 to 12 weeks of age), a strategy of testing at both time points allows prompt recognition of infected infants and may capture additional cases.

         Ideally, all women should be tested to identify HIV infection either prior to pregnancy or early in the prenatal course. Recommendations for HIV screening during pregnancy and in the general adult population are discussed in separate topics. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         If a woman presents in labor or at delivery without documentation of her HIV status, HIV testing should be performed on either the mother or infant. The results of serologic testing (mother or infant) reflect the HIV status of the mother, not the infant, since it is maternal antibodies to HIV that will be detected. If serologic testing for HIV in the mother or infant is positive, testing of the infant should proceed as described above. (See

         It is important that testing in the peripartum period be expedited so that ARV prophylaxis or presumptive HIV therapy can be given to the newborn as soon as possible, ideally within six hours of birth.

         A qualitative HIV-1 DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that detects HIV proviral DNA within peripheral blood mononuclear cells has been the primary test used for the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in infants born to mothers with HIV [

        <p>
         Approximately two-thirds of mother-to-child transmissions of HIV occurs perinatally, and DNA PCR testing will not detect very recent infection. The sensitivity of HIV-1 DNA PCR testing when performed at birth is 55 percent; it increases to &gt;90 percent by two to four weeks of age and 100 percent at three and six months [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8-10

         ]. The specificity of HIV-1 DNA PCR is 99.8 percent at birth and 100 percent at one, three, and six months.

         HIV clade B is the predominant viral strain in the United States. Non-clade-B strains are more prevalent in other parts of the world. For example, clade C predominates in Africa and India and clade E in Southeast Asia. Although some early HIV DNA PCR assays may have been less sensitive in detecting non-B clades [

          11-13

         HIV infection may be identified using either qualitative or quantitative RNA assays. There are a variety of methodologies used to detect HIV RNA including reverse-transcription PCR, b-DNA, transcription-mediated amplification, and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification. For diagnosis, HIV-1 qualitative RNA assays are used in the United States and other resource-rich countries in place of the HIV DNA PCR. Quantitative RNA assays are the standard viral load test performed for monitoring the response to treatment of HIV infection but may be used as a supplemental diagnostic assay to confirm HIV infection.
        </p>
        <p>
         Compared with DNA PCRs, RNA assays may better detect HIV infection at birth, enabling the early initiation of ART [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ], which has been shown to reduce infant morbidity and mortality. Studies have suggested that the sensitivity and specificity of qualitative and quantitative HIV RNA assays for identifying neonatal HIV infection are at least as good as those of HIV DNA testing [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8-10,14,16,17
         </a>
         ]. However, these studies were not performed in children born to mothers who were receiving potent combination ART or in children receiving multidrug prophylaxis. Treatment of either mother or infant with combination ART could be expected to lead to an undetectable viral load measurement and thus a negative HIV-1 RNA test [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Recommendations for serial testing between birth and four to six months of age allow for diagnostic testing to be done after cessation of antiretroviral (ARV) prophylaxis for infants receiving combination ARV infant prophylaxis if the results of testing were negative while the infant was receiving prophylaxis.

         In addition, some infants may have NAT results that fall in an indeterminate range (also called "weakly positive"). These infants may be characterized as having indeterminate HIV status pending repeat testing. Follow-up testing should be performed as soon as possible. In a systemic review and meta-analysis of 32 studies, indeterminate results accounted for 17 percent of initial non-negative test results, of which three-quarters were negative on repeat testing [

          Challenges of HIV testing in infancy

         – Antibody-only and antibody/antigen combination assays that are commonly used for HIV testing in adults and older children are not reliable in infants and young children, because of the persistence of transplacentally acquired maternal antibody. For this reason, HIV nucleic acid testing (NAT; ie, assays that detect HIV DNA or RNA) must be used to diagnose HIV infection in this population. (See

          Intermediate HIV status
         </strong>
         – HIV-exposed infants who meet neither criteria for having HIV infection nor criteria for exclusion of HIV infection are characterized as having indeterminate HIV status. Infants with NAT results that fall in an indeterminate range (also called "weakly positive") are also included in this category pending repeat testing. Follow-up testing should be performed as soon as possible. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Indeterminate HIV infection status'

         Infants with indeterminate HIV status should receive prophylaxis against
         <em>
          Pneumocystis

         pneumonia (PCP) starting at four to six weeks until they are determined to be definitively or presumptively without HIV. PCP prophylaxis is discussed in detail separately. (See
