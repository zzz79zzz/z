The diagnostic approach to the child with a limp is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6458.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of limp in children"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H16522448"><span class="h1">DEFINITION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For the purposes of this discussion, limp is defined as an abnormality in gait that is caused by pain, weakness, or deformity. In toddlers and young children, limp also refers to refusal to walk or stand.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1143392097"><span class="h1">CLASSIFICATION OF LIMP</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is no universal classification system for limp. For the purposes of this topic, the many causes of limp will be divided by life- or limb-threatening, common, or other conditions  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119013" href="/d/graphic/119013.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). In addition, to assist clinicians with narrowing the differential diagnosis in individual patients, a table that identifies etiology by location of abnormality is provided  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76343" href="/d/graphic/76343.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6458.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of limp in children"</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3925971670"><span class="h1">LIFE-THREATENING AND OTHER EMERGENCY CONDITIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinician should always be alert to the possibility of a life-threatening or other emergency cause for limp  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119013" href="/d/graphic/119013.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H849842891"><span class="h2">Bacterial (septic) arthritis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bacterial arthritis is an important consideration in all children with the acute onset of fever and joint pain and/or loss of function such as limping. Patients also will typically have swelling, pain, and limited mobility of the affected joint. In addition, other constitutional symptoms (malaise, poor appetite, irritability, and/or tachycardia) are frequently present. Physical examination typically reveals ill appearance, joint effusion, periarticular warmth and tenderness, and severe pain on range of motion, although more subtle presentations may occur. Changes in the adjacent soft tissue are variable and depend upon the duration of infection and the depth of the joint. Of note, swelling, clinically appreciable joint effusion, and soft tissue changes usually do <strong>not</strong> occur with infections of the hip. The presentation of septic arthritis may be altered if the patient has recently received oral antibiotics; fever may not be as prominent a symptom, and pain and limitation of motion may be modest. Missed septic hip arthritis in children presenting to ED appears to occur most frequently in the very young (one to two years). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2856.html" rel="external">"Approach to hip pain in childhood", section on 'Septic arthritis'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of bacterial arthritis is supported by an elevated white blood cell count with a left shift and elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate<em>.</em> Blood culture should also be obtained, although results are negative in the majority of cases. Ultrasonography is helpful in identifying and quantifying joint effusions, particularly for deep joints such as the hip  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60427" href="/d/graphic/60427.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). Plain radiographs add little to the diagnostic evaluation of joints that are readily accessible to physical examination, such as the knee, but may add additional information for the hip such as widening of the joint space, which is seen occasionally in infants and young children; soft tissue swelling; obliteration of normal fat planes; or changes caused by an associated osteomyelitis, such as periosteal elevation.</p><p>Consultation with an orthopedic surgeon with pediatric expertise is mandatory for a patient with concern for a septic hip because emergency drainage is indicated. Urgent aspiration of a potentially infected joint other than the hip joint may be performed by the emergency clinician, if experienced with this procedure, or by a subspecialist. Given the frequency of contiguous osteomyelitis, antibiotic-resistant pathogens, and culture-negative cases, consultation with an expert in infectious diseases may also be warranted. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6033.html" rel="external">"Bacterial arthritis: Treatment and outcome in infants and children", section on 'Indications for consultation'</a>.)</p><p>Clinical rules have been developed to aid in differentiating septic arthritis of the hip from transient synovitis. However, these clinical prediction rules do not apply to assessment of joints other than the hip [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. These rules are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2856.html" rel="external">"Approach to hip pain in childhood", section on 'Septic arthritis'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H219417732"><span class="h2">Osteomyelitis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Osteomyelitis is an uncommon cause of limp. It is more likely in children younger than five years of age and in children with sickle cell disease, immunodeficiency, or sepsis. More than 80 percent of cases of hematogenous osteomyelitis occur in the long (tubular) bones, usually originating in the metaphyses  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61415" href="/d/graphic/61415.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Most cases of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in children are caused by gram-positive bacteria, principally <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef96510" href="/d/graphic/96510.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6063.html" rel="external">"Hematogenous osteomyelitis in children: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and microbiology"</a>.)</p><p>Although variable, children with hematogenous osteomyelitis usually first complain of extremity pain, refuse to bear weight, or limp. Fever may or may not be present initially. Later in the course of illness, children may develop persistent fever, constitutional symptoms (eg, irritability, decreased appetite or activity), and focal findings of bone inflammation (warmth, swelling, point tenderness). The initial symptoms of hematogenous osteomyelitis in older infants and young children may be nonspecific and mild.</p><p>Patients with findings suspicious for osteomyelitis initially warrant blood studies (complete blood count [CBC] with differential, blood culture, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and plain radiographs of the affected area. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (preferred) or radionuclide bone scanning are indicated to confirm a diagnosis when plain films are negative. Consultation with an orthopedist is appropriate to obtain an aspirate for culture in selected cases. The diagnosis of osteomyelitis is often challenging. The evaluation and approach to patients with suspected osteomyelitis and its treatment are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6067.html" rel="external">"Hematogenous osteomyelitis in children: Evaluation and diagnosis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5958.html" rel="external">"Hematogenous osteomyelitis in children: Management"</a>.)</p><p>Patients who are immunosuppressed or have recently received antibiotics may have modified presentations of osteomyelitis or bacterial arthritis, which may include limp without fever and less prominent swelling or tenderness. In addition, some patients with osteomyelitis may present early in the course of the illness with localized bony tenderness and limp without fever. Especially in infants and young children, signs and symptoms of bone inflammation may be poorly localized although constitutional symptoms (irritability, decreased appetite, or activity) and limited use of the affected leg are present. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6067.html" rel="external">"Hematogenous osteomyelitis in children: Evaluation and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical suspicion'</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2829767105"><span class="h2">Infections with referred pain to the lower extremity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Several serious infections can cause fever and an acute or chronic limp with referred pain, typically to the hip or back of the thigh. Examination of the lower extremities may be unrevealing or, for infections associated with iliopsoas irritation (eg, appendicitis or pelvic inflammatory disease), may demonstrate a preference for holding the hip in flexion accompanied by pain and irritability when the examiner attempts to extend the hip (positive psoas sign). </p><p>Additional findings vary by the site of infection:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Appendicitis with periappendiceal abscess</strong> – Patients with a periappendiceal abscess often have a history of fever, anorexia, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Typical findings on abdominal examination include right lower quadrant tenderness and signs of peritoneal irritation (eg, guarding or rebound). Patients may complain of right hip pain and demonstrate a limp characterized by a shuffling gait with hips flexed. Diagnostic imaging (eg, ultrasonography of the abdomen) helps confirm the clinical diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6479.html" rel="external">"Acute appendicitis in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Psoas abscess</strong> – The presenting symptoms of psoas abscess may be nonspecific, and the onset is often subacute; symptoms may be present for a few weeks and up to six months and include back or flank pain, fever, inguinal mass, limp, anorexia, and weight loss. Pain is present in up to 90 percent of cases with localization to the back, flank, or lower abdomen, with or without radiation to the hip and/or the posterior aspect of the thigh. Fever is present in up to 75 percent of cases, and a psoas abscess may manifest as a fever of unknown origin. On physical examination, a positive psoas sign (pain on hip extension) is frequently present. Unlike septic arthritis, hip pain in patients with psoas abscesses is usually diminished with hip flexion. The diagnosis of a psoas abscess may be suspected on clinical grounds and confirmed on imaging studies. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7652.html" rel="external">"Psoas abscess"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Suppurative iliac fossa adenitis with retroperitoneal iliac fossa abscess</strong> – Patients with iliac fossa adenitis present with right or left lower quadrant pain often initially attributed to hip abscess, osteomyelitis, or appendicitis but may subsequently develop a palpable mass just above the inguinal ligament [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Fever is often present but low grade.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Spinal epidural abscess</strong> – The classical diagnostic triad of spinal epidural abscess consists of fever, spinal pain, and neurologic deficits. However, only a small proportion of patients have all three components at presentation. Fever in a patient with severe, localized back pain, especially if the pain is worsened by palpation or percussion, should suggest the diagnosis of spinal epidural abscess. If untreated, the patient typically develops nerve root pain ("shooting" or "electric shocks" in the distribution of the affected nerve root) followed by neurologic deficits (sensory changes, motor weakness, and bowel of bladder dysfunction) and ending with paralysis, which quickly can become irreversible. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and is best confirmed by MRI of the spine. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1292.html" rel="external">"Spinal epidural abscess"</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Discitis</strong> – Discitis typically presents with the gradual onset of irritability and back pain, limp, or refusal to crawl or walk, without systemic toxicity; fever usually is absent or low grade. In some patients, abdominal pain and/or vomiting may be the only complaints. Most patients have had symptoms for three or more weeks by the time discitis is diagnosed. Examination findings may include: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Refusal to bend forward </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Percussion tenderness over the involved spine, hip pain and stiffness </p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Decreased muscle strength or reflexes in the lower extremities</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>With high lesions (T8-L1), ileus</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Plain radiographs of the spine may show narrowing of the joint space. MRI of the spine confirms the diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2852.html" rel="external">"Back pain in children and adolescents: Causes", section on 'Discitis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Skeletal tuberculosis</strong> – Tuberculous spondylitis (Pott disease) usually affects the lower thoracic and upper lumbar region. Once two adjacent vertebrae are involved, infection can involve the adjoining intervertebral disc space, leading to vertebral collapse. Subsequent kyphosis can lead to cord compression and paraplegia. The most common symptom of tuberculous spondylitis (Pott disease) is local pain, which increases in severity over weeks to months, sometimes in association with muscle spasm and rigidity. A characteristic erect posture and "alderman's" gait may be observed in which the patient walks with short, deliberate steps to avoid jarring of the spine. Constitutional symptoms such as fever and weight loss are relatively uncommon and active chest disease is typically absent. The diagnosis should be considered in patients with a history of risk factors for tuberculosis and characteristic symptoms. Plain radiographs of the spine may show bony changes at the anterior aspect of the vertebral body, loss of the disc space, and/or a paravertebral abscess. MRI, whenever available, identifies soft tissue extension and spinal cord involvement  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86251" href="/d/graphic/86251.html" rel="external">image 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86252" href="/d/graphic/86252.html" rel="external">image 3</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7658.html" rel="external">"Bone and joint tuberculosis", section on 'Spondylitis (Pott disease)'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/8007.html" rel="external">"Tuberculosis disease in children: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pelvic inflammatory disease</strong> – Adolescent females with severe pelvic inflammatory disease may present with a shuffling gait and an examination that demonstrates lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, and pelvic examination findings of cervical motion, uterine, or adnexal tenderness. Fever and cervical infection with <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> or <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> are often present. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7581.html" rel="external">"Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Acute symptomatic PID'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3629023650"><span class="h2">Occult fracture (child abuse)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Child abuse is a potentially life-threatening etiology that may occasionally present as a limp. Children younger than five years of age are at highest risk of child abuse. Most abusive fractures are accompanied by other findings of abuse  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109402" href="/d/graphic/109402.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). Metaphyseal corner (or bucket handle fractures)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60912" href="/d/graphic/60912.html" rel="external">figure 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79186 graphicRef130665" href="/d/graphic/79186.html" rel="external">image 4A-B</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82390" href="/d/graphic/82390.html" rel="external">image 5</a>) or multiple fractures with different stages of healing are highly suggestive of abuse. Isolated long bone fractures in ambulatory children are less specific but warrant further evaluation when the mechanism is absent or insufficient to explain the injury. Significant concern for physical abuse in children younger than 24 months of age is an absolute indication for obtaining a skeletal survey. Other indications for ordering a skeletal survey and the diagnostic evaluation for physical child abuse are discussed separately  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef109271" href="/d/graphic/109271.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6600.html" rel="external">"Physical child abuse: Diagnostic evaluation and management", section on 'Skeletal survey'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6600.html" rel="external">"Physical child abuse: Diagnostic evaluation and management"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H413367097"><span class="h2">Slipped capital femoral epiphysis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), also called slipped upper femoral epiphysis (SUFE) and physiolysis of the hip, is characterized by a displacement of the capital femoral epiphysis from the femoral neck through the physeal plate. It is one of the most common hip disorders of adolescence and is associated with obesity. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6554.html" rel="external">"Evaluation and management of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE)", section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>The two most common features of the presentation of SCFE are pain and altered gait. The classic presentation is that of an obese adolescent with a complaint of nonradiating, dull, aching pain in the hip, groin, thigh, or knee, and no history of preceding trauma. The pain is increased by physical activity and may be chronic or intermittent. The absence of pain, or pain localized to the knee or thigh instead of the hip, can lead physicians to overlook the diagnosis. Physical examination may demonstrate hip pain on palpation and limitation of hip range of motion, especially internal rotation and flexion. The diagnosis of SCFE usually can be made on plain radiographs, which reveal an apparent posterior displacement of the femoral epiphysis, like ice cream slipping off a cone  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59157" href="/d/graphic/59157.html" rel="external">image 6</a>).

Tumor should be considered in children with complaints of bone pain that occurs at night, at rest, and in nonarticular locations. Occasionally, bone tumors will present with pathologic fractures  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86777" href="/d/graphic/86777.html" rel="external">image 7</a>).

Spontaneous hemarthroses are characteristic of severe disease (defined as &lt;1 percent of normal factor activity). Bleeding into the joint cavity originates from the synovial vessels. Bleeding episodes often affect a variety of joints, particularly the knees and ankles, which are the major weight-bearing joints. One joint is usually affected at a time, but multiple bleeding sites are not uncommon. The ankles are most commonly affected in children, and the knees, elbows, and ankles in adolescents and adults. In toddlers, early signs of bleeding include irritability and limp. In older children and adolescents, hemarthrosis is manifested by prodromal stiffness and, in some patients, by a characteristic warm sensation, which is followed by acute pain and swelling.

Pain typically occurs in a lower extremity and cause an antalgic gait but may occur in an upper extremity or at multiple sites. Most patients will experience allodynia and are unable to tolerate light touch or clothing on the limb. The borders of allodynia vary by 4 to 6 cm with retesting. Children with CRPS frequently hold the involved extremity in an unusual position, and the limb is cool and cyanotic  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63159" href="/d/graphic/63159.html" rel="external">picture 13</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53380" href="/d/graphic/53380.html" rel="external">picture 14</a>). A history of minor trauma to the affected extremity may be elicited. CRPS is a clinical diagnosis.

Supportive history includes abrupt and paroxysmal onset with maximal symptoms, nonprogressive course, and spontaneous remission. Past medical and social history may be notable for psychologic stressors, psychiatric comorbidities, multiple somatic symptoms (eg, pseudoseizures) or undiagnosed conditions, and potential secondary gain [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. On physical examination, the child may have movement inconsistencies (intermittent or varying limp), a limp not consistent with organic cause, a distractible limp, a paroxysmal or suggestible limp, and/or false weakness (giving away). Associated findings may include sensory loss that does not correspond to normal dermatomes (eg, crosses the midline) or functional disability out of proportion to examination findings. </p><p>The approach to somatic symptom disorder including diagnosis and treatment is provided separately.

The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

In toddlers and young children, limp also refers to refusal to walk or stand. (See <a class="local">'Definition'</a> above.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Etiology and classification</strong> – The many causes of limp can be divided according to life-threatening/emergency, common, or other important conditions  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119013" href="/d/graphic/119013.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). In addition, to assist clinicians with narrowing the differential diagnosis in individual patients, a table that identifies etiology by location of abnormality is provided  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef76343" href="/d/graphic/76343.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'Classification of limp'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Evaluation</strong> – The cause of limp in children usually can be determined through a careful history and physical examination. Ancillary studies are often necessary to confirm clinical suspicions, but operative procedures are rarely required. Acute trauma or benign self-limiting conditions are the most frequent etiologies.
