The common modes of ventilation, initial settings, and supportive care for intubated patients are discussed in this topic review. Intubation and complications of invasive mechanical ventilation are described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1598.html" rel="external">"Ventilator-induced lung injury"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1628.html" rel="external">"Clinical and physiologic complications of mechanical ventilation: Overview"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/260.html" rel="external">"Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/270.html" rel="external">"Rapid sequence intubation in adults for emergency medicine and critical care"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/268.html" rel="external">"The decision to intubate"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1644.html" rel="external">"Complications of the endotracheal tube following initial placement: Prevention and management in adult intensive care unit patients"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4167959455"><span class="h1">DEFINITION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Invasive mechanical ventilation is defined as the delivery of positive pressure to the lungs via an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube.</p><p>During mechanical ventilation, a predetermined mixture of air (ie, oxygen and other gases) is forced into the central airways and then flows into the alveoli. As the lungs inflate, the intra-alveolar pressure increases. A termination signal (usually flow or pressure) eventually causes the ventilator to stop forcing air into the central airways and the central airway pressure decreases. Expiration follows passively, with air flowing from the higher pressure alveoli to the lower pressure central airways.</p><p>Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is delivered through an alternative interface, usually a face mask. Patient selection and indications for NIV are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1636.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Benefits and contraindications", section on 'Patients likely to benefit'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3153777971"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Invasive mechanical ventilation is most often used to fully or partially replace the functions of spontaneous breathing by performing the work of breathing and gas exchange in patients with respiratory failure  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67457" href="/d/graphic/67457.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef78508" href="/d/graphic/78508.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef66496" href="/d/graphic/66496.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Invasive mechanical ventilation may also be useful in those who require airway protection to reduce the risk of aspiration (eg, depressed mental status from an overdose, patients with variceal bleeding). Importantly, regardless of the indication, invasive mechanical ventilation should be considered early in the course of illness and should not be delayed until the need becomes emergent. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/277.html" rel="external">"Mechanical ventilation of adults in the emergency department"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1647.html" rel="external">"Measures of oxygenation and mechanisms of hypoxemia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1458.html" rel="external">"The evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of the adult patient with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1991676208"><span class="h1">SELECTING AN INITIAL MODE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Commonly selected initial modes and factors that influence mode selection are discussed in this section. Further details on the physiology that underlies each mode are provided separately.

However, common initial modes which are suitable for most patients include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Volume-limited assist control ventilation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pressure-limited assist control ventilation</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) with pressure support ventilation (SIMV-PSV)</p><p></p><p>Pressure support ventilation (PSV) alone is uncommonly used as an initial mode of ventilation but commonly used during weaning (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1650.html" rel="external">"Initial weaning strategy in mechanically ventilated adults", section on 'Choosing a weaning method'</a>). Continuous (formerly known as "controlled") mechanical ventilation (CMV; volume-limited CMV or pressure-limited CMV), intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV), and airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) are not typically used as initial modes of ventilation. Adaptive support ventilation (ASV), and neurally adjusted ventilatory assist ventilation (NAVA) are investigational modes and high frequency mechanical ventilation is not recommended in adults. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1651.html" rel="external">"Modes of mechanical ventilation"</a>.)</p><p>Regardless of the initial mode selected, the mode of ventilation can often be changed when a patient demonstrates intolerance of selected mode or demonstrates the signs of dyssynchrony. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1653.html" rel="external">"Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Ventilator management strategies for adults", section on 'Treat dyssynchrony'</a>.)</p><p>The modes of mechanical ventilation are distinguished from each other by the types of breaths that they deliver  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef77391" href="/d/graphic/77391.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). In brief, the delivery of breaths is typically either volume-limited or pressure-limited:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Volume-limited – Volume-limited breaths can be ventilator-initiated (also known as volume-controlled or volume-cycled [VC]) or patient initiated (also known as volume-assist [VA]). VC or VA breaths deliver a predetermined tidal volume at a set ventilator rate such that a minimum minute ventilation (tidal volume x respiratory rate) is guaranteed. Each tidal volume is delivered at a set inspiratory flow rate and inspiration is terminated once the set tidal volume has been delivered. In this mode, airway pressure is dependent on the airway resistance, lung compliance, and chest wall compliance. Modes of mechanical ventilation used in the ICU that can deliver VC or VA breaths include volume-limited assist control and volume-limited SIMV. Volume-limited continuous mechanical ventilation (VC-CMV) is not generally used in the ICU. Pressure-regulated volume control ventilation (PRVC) is being increasingly used. In PRVC, a set tidal volume is targeted by varying airway pressure resulting in variable inspiratory flow. Further details are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1651.html" rel="external">"Modes of mechanical ventilation", section on 'Volume-limited ventilation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pressure limited – Pressure-limited breaths can be ventilator-initiated (also known as pressure-control or pressure-cycled [PC]) or patient initiated (also known as pressure-assist [PA]). In PC or PA breaths, the flow of air into the lung is determined by a set pressure limit and the rate is determined by a set ventilator rate. Inspiration is terminated once the set inspiratory time has elapsed. The tidal volume for each breath is variable and related to compliance, airway resistance, and tubing resistance. A consequence of the variable tidal volume is that a specific minute ventilation cannot be guaranteed. Modes of mechanical ventilation used in the ICU that deliver PC or PA breaths include pressure-limited assist control and pressure-limited SIMV. Pressure-limited continuous mechanical ventilation (PC-CMV) is not generally used in the ICU. Further details are provided separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1651.html" rel="external">"Modes of mechanical ventilation", section on 'Pressure-limited ventilation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Pressure support – Spontaneous breathing can be supported to a set pressure limit; such breaths are called "pressure support (PS) breaths." The ventilator provides the driving pressure for each spontaneous breath, which determines the maximal airflow rate. Inspiration is terminated once the inspiratory flow has decreased to a predetermined percentage of its maximal value. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1651.html" rel="external">"Modes of mechanical ventilation", section on 'Pressure support'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Other modes that are not generally used as the initial mode but may be used during the course of mechanical ventilation are described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1651.html" rel="external">"Modes of mechanical ventilation", section on 'Adaptive support ventilation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1651.html" rel="external">"Modes of mechanical ventilation", section on 'Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist ventilation'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1651.html" rel="external">"Modes of mechanical ventilation", section on 'High frequency ventilation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h2">Factors influencing the choice</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Factors that influence the initial mode chosen include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Level of support needed</strong> – The level of ventilator support is the proportion of the patient's ventilatory needs that are met by the ventilator. The level of support is determined by the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The mode – Generally speaking, among the modes used in the ICU, volume- or pressure-limited modes that use assist control functions tend to provide the most support (ie, resting respiratory muscles while simultaneously minimizing atrophy). In contrast, pressure support tends to provide the least support and is associated with a greater work of breathing.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The indication for mechanical ventilation – In general, patients who are mechanically ventilated for respiratory failure need more support than those ventilated for airway protection while those with severe respiratory failure need more support than those with mild respiratory failure.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The selected settings – Selected settings can be adjusted to provide an increased proportion of reduced support. (See <a class="local">'Settings'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Reason for mechanical ventilation</strong> – The indication for mechanical ventilation may influence the mode. For example, patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are typically placed on low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) delivered using volume-limited assist control ventilation or pressure-limited assist control ventilation. In contrast, a patient who is mechanically ventilated short-term for airway protection may be suitable for several additional modes including SIMV-PSV as well as PSV alone. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1653.html" rel="external">"Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Ventilator management strategies for adults", section on 'Volume- versus pressure-limited mode'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Presence of airflow limitation</strong> – In patients with active airflow limitation such as severe chronic obstructive lung disease [COPD], acute asthma, or acute COPD exacerbation, volume-limited modes of ventilation are commonly used (eg, volume-limited assist control ventilation, SIMV-PSV). In contrast, pressure support or pressure-limited modes including APRV are generally avoided. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1632.html" rel="external">"Invasive mechanical ventilation in acute respiratory failure complicating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/570.html" rel="external">"Invasive mechanical ventilation in adults with acute exacerbations of asthma"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Presence of an air leak</strong> – In patients with a prolonged, significant air leak (eg, from pneumothorax or lung surgery) pressure-limited ventilation or SIMV-PSV, or even PSV alone, are preferred in order to limit additional barotrauma and worsening of the air leak.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Concern for elevated intracranial pressure (ICP)</strong> – While volume-limited modes are frequently used in patients with an elevated ICP (eg, traumatic brain injury or stroke), pressure-limited modes are popular due to the theoretical concern that elevated intrathoracic pressures hamper venous return from the brain and therefore worsen ICP. However, there are no data in this population to suggest that one mode is superior to the other and practice varies widely. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4826.html" rel="external">"Management of acute moderate and severe traumatic brain injury", section on 'Ventilation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Paralysis</strong> – For patients who are paralyzed or heavily sedated (ie, those in whom the initiation of a spontaneous breath is limited), PSV is contraindicated and assist controlled modes (volume- or pressure-limited) are typically used, <strong>provided</strong> the set minute ventilation is adequate.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Others</strong> – Clinician familiarity and institutional preferences often dictate common modes used.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h1">SETTINGS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once the mode is selected, there are numerous parameters that need to be set, many of which depend upon the mode selected.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1253694595"><span class="h2">Mode-specific settings</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Included in this section are suggested initial settings for the commonly used modes of ventilation  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef123028" href="/d/graphic/123028.html" rel="external">table 5</a>). However, it should be noted that settings should be tailored to the patient who is being ventilated. Importantly, it is critical that the patient be monitored and settings adjusted according to clinical and, when available, blood gas findings.

(See <a class="local">'Tidal volume'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ventilator rate – Ventilator rate is typically set at 12 to 16 breaths per minute; higher rates may be necessary for patients with ARDS (eg, ≤35 breaths per minute).

(See <a class="local">'Fraction of inspired oxygen'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Inspiratory flow – Inspiratory flow is typically set at 40 to 60 L/minute with a ramp pattern to target an inspiratory:expiratory (I:E) ratio of approximately 1:2 to 1:3. Higher rates up to 75 L/minute that decrease the I:E ratio are appropriate in patients with airflow obstruction. (See <a class="local">'Flow rate and pattern'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Trigger sensitivity – Typical values are 2 L/minute when flow-triggering is used <strong>or</strong> -1 to -2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O when pressure-triggering is used.

(See <a class="local">'Trigger sensitivity'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>A modified version of volume-limited ventilation known as pressure-regulated volume control (PRVC) is increasingly used in some ICUs. PRVC is a form of volume control ventilation where tidal volume is set and the applied airway pressure changes to attain the target tidal volume (resulting in variable inspiratory flow). In PRVC, clinicians set the inspiratory time instead of flow in addition to the desired tidal volume and the other parameters listed above. The inspiratory time should target an I:E ratio of 1:2 to 1:3.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1440416749"><span class="h3">Pressure-limited assist control ventilation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients in whom pressure-limited assist controlled ventilation is chosen as the initial mode of ventilation, we typically set the inspiratory pressure level to target an approximate tidal volume (eg, 4 to 8 mL/kg PBW for a patient with ARDS) and the inspiratory time is set to deliver an I:E ratio of 1:2 to 1:3 (typically one second). The FiO<sub>2</sub>, ventilator rate, applied PEEP, and trigger sensitivity are similar to those of volume-limited-assist control ventilation (VC-AC). (See <a class="local">'Volume-limited assist control ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p>The initial inspiratory pressure set varies depending upon lung compliance, airway resistance, and tubing resistance, but in general, acceptable target tidal volumes may be reached with inspiratory pressure levels between 12 and 25 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. However, the clinician should bear in mind that the addition of the applied PEEP to a set inspiratory pressure increases peak airway pressure and may further increase the risk of barotrauma (eg, patient with a set inspiratory pressure level of 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and an applied PEEP of 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O will have a peak airway pressure of 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3824519155"><span class="h3">Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation with pressure support ventilation (SIMV-PSV)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients in whom SIMV-PSV is chosen as the initial mode of ventilation, we typically use similar settings to VC-AC with the addition of pressure support (eg, 5 to 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) for spontaneous breaths taken by the patient above the set rate.

These studies that found that overall inspiratory effort was lower with flow-triggering than pressure-triggering during intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) [<a href="#rid31">31,32</a>] and PSV [<a href="#rid33">33</a>], and unaltered during assist control ventilation (ie, volume-limited or pressure limited assist control) [<a href="#rid33">33</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>When pressure-triggering is used, a ventilator-delivered breath is initiated if the demand valve senses a negative airway pressure deflection generated by the patient trying to initiate a breath that is greater than the trigger sensitivity. A trigger sensitivity of -1 to -3 cm H<sub>2</sub>O is typically set, which means that ventilator-assisted breaths will be triggered when the alveolar pressure decreases to 1 to 3 cm H<sub>2</sub>O below atmospheric pressure. Pressure-triggering can be used with the assist control or synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation modes of mechanical ventilation. Auto-PEEP (intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure) interferes with pressure-triggering and this setting should not be used if auto-PEEP is suspected. The mechanism by which auto-PEEP interferes with pressure-triggering is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1642.html" rel="external">"Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)", section on 'Potential sequelae'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>The trigger sensitivity should allow the patient to trigger the ventilator easily. A trigger sensitivity that is too sensitive may cause a breath to be delivered in response to patient movement or subtle pressure deflections caused by water moving within the ventilator tubing. In contrast, a trigger sensitivity that is not sensitive enough increases patient effort. This may cause a prolonged period between the initial effort and the ventilator breath or patient-ventilator asynchrony.

Moreover, not all ventilators can incorporate the sigh maneuver.</p><p>The term sigh refers to a deep breath, normally taken once every few minutes that is thought to maintain lung volume, avoid atelectasis, and improve lung compliance. The sigh, during mechanical ventilation, was popular in the past but fell out of favor when lung protective ventilation was found to be beneficial and high volumes shown to induce lung trauma. However, newer data suggest that the sigh maneuver, when limited and low in volume, may be safer than the more aggressive sigh strategies used in the past [<a href="#rid34">34,35</a>]. As an example, among 524 ventilated trauma patients who were at risk of ARDS, sigh volumes producing a plateau pressure of 35 cm H<sub>2</sub>O delivered once every six minutes did not increase the number of ventilator-free days compared with those receiving usual care [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. There was, however, a nonsignificant improvement in 28-day mortality. While there were few adverse events, hypotension attributable to sighs was seen in 2 percent and appeared to be associated with a vasopressor requirement. Further data are needed before sighs can be routinely applied during mechanical ventilation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3053104280"><span class="h1">SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Select populations need specific considerations and are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1653.html" rel="external">"Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Ventilator management strategies for adults"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Respiratory failure complicating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1632.html" rel="external">"Invasive mechanical ventilation in acute respiratory failure complicating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/570.html" rel="external">"Invasive mechanical ventilation in adults with acute exacerbations of asthma"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Traumatic brain injury (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4826.html" rel="external">"Management of acute moderate and severe traumatic brain injury", section on 'Ventilation'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with an air leak (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1649.html" rel="external">"Management of persistent air leaks in patients on mechanical ventilation", section on 'Ventilator management'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1592.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis, management, and prevention of pulmonary barotrauma during invasive mechanical ventilation in adults", section on 'Ventilator management'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients undergoing anesthesia (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/93386.html" rel="external">"Mechanical ventilation during anesthesia in adults"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients undergoing bariatric surgery (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/584.html" rel="external">"Intensive care unit management of patients with obesity", section on 'Mechanical ventilation'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3867307475"><span class="h1">FOLLOW-UP</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>While most patients tolerate volume-limited or pressure-limited assist-controlled ventilation, some patients do not tolerate it as evidenced by dyssynchrony, high airway pressures, or hypoxemia.
