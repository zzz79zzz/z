Symptoms of exercise-induced dyspnea resemble those of deconditioning-related dyspnea, and these symptoms make patients fearful of being active and patients may interpret deconditioning as worsening of their disease. Exercise training improves functional capacity and quality of life in patients with HF.</p><p>A comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation program provides services including patient evaluation, exercise training, physical activity counseling, cardiovascular risk factor management, psychosocial support, and patient education (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73513" href="/z/d/graphic/73513.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), as discussed in detail separately (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1477.html" rel="external">"Cardiac rehabilitation programs"</a>). This topic will focus on the exercise training component of cardiac rehabilitation in patients with HF. Measurement of peak oxygen uptake to assess exercise capacity is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3503.html" rel="external">"Exercise capacity and VO2 in heart failure"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H708736768"><span class="h1">RATIONALE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although exercise training of HF patients was previously discouraged due to concerns of worsening symptoms and detriment to the disease process itself, evidence supports a role for exercise training in this population as a means of reversing cardiac and skeletal muscle abnormalities, and improving functional status, quality of life, and clinical outcomes [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Evidence on effects of exercise'</a> below.)</p><p>It was previously thought that exercise limitation in patient with HF was due entirely to cardiac dysfunction. However, drugs that improve cardiac output may not acutely improve exercise tolerance [<a href="#rid3">3-6</a>]. Thus, factors in addition to the low cardiac output and reduced skeletal muscle blood flow contribute to poor exercise tolerance and fatigue.</p><p>Observations since the 1980s have documented improvements in exercise function for patients with HF with a low rate of complications. These observations were followed by a series of studies that demonstrated that significant biochemical and functional abnormalities in skeletal muscle are present in patients with HF and play a large role in the exercise intolerance [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Inactivity is in part responsible, leading to muscle atrophy. In addition, skeletal muscle utilizes high-energy phosphates in an inefficient manner; as a result, lactic acid accumulates at a more rapid rate than in normal controls, contributing to muscle fatigue and limited exercise capacity. Skeletal muscle dysfunction can also involve the respiratory muscles, which may contribute to fatigue and dyspnea on exertion [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. These biochemical and functional abnormalities, when added to deconditioning, can result in even greater impact on physical function. The importance of skeletal muscle dysfunction provides part of the rationale for the use of cardiac rehabilitation in patients with HF.</p><p>The effects of exercise in patients with HF are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Evidence on effects of exercise'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H708736843"><span class="h1">EXERCISE TRAINING RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H709595862"><span class="h2">Indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following indications for exercise training apply to patients with HF. Evidence for these recommendations is discussed below. (See <a class="local">'Evidence on effects of exercise'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with stable New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II to III HF with reduced ejection fraction (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] ≤40 percent; HFrEF), we recommend referral for exercise training. (See <a class="local">'For heart failure with reduced ejection fraction'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients with stable NYHA functional class II to III HF with preserved ejection fraction (LVEF ≥50 percent; HFpEF) or mid-range ejection fraction (LVEF 41 to 49 percent), we suggest referral for exercise training. (See <a class="local">'For heart failure with preserved or mid-range ejection fraction'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Similar recommendations for exercise training in patients with HF are included in major society guidelines [<a href="#rid8">8-10</a>]. The recommendation for exercise training in patients with HFrEF is stronger than for patients with HFpEF because the data are not as robust for patients with HFpEF, as discussed below. There are not enough data at present to recommend cardiac rehabilitation for patients with class IV HF. (See <a class="local">'Evidence on effects of exercise'</a> below.)</p><p>In the United States, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) provide coverage for cardiac rehabilitation services for patients with stable chronic HF with LVEF ≤35 percent and NYHA class II to IV symptoms despite treatment with optimal HF therapy for at least six weeks [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Stable is defined as no recent (≤6 weeks) or planned (≤6 months) major cardiovascular hospitalizations or procedures. Most United States insurers cover the sessions similarly to CMS.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H709595874"><span class="h2">Components of cardiac rehabilitation</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H89281857"><span class="h3">General components</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A cardiac rehabilitation program for patients with HF should include all components of such programs, including medical evaluation and baseline patient assessment, education concerning medication adherence, risk factor reduction including dietary recommendations, psychosocial support (which may include peer support), as well as exercise training and physical activity counseling [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The program should include assessment and management of barriers to adherence [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. In addition to providing direct benefits, the closer monitoring of symptoms afforded by a supervised program may allow detection and treatment of worsening HF prior to those symptoms necessitating an emergency department visit or an admission, particularly if the cardiac rehabilitation team communicates with patients’ other care teams. The frequent contact with the rehabilitation team may also identify medication issues such as side effects and questions about meals with medications, all of which impact adherence.</p><p>The components of cardiac rehabilitation programs in patients with cardiac disease in accordance with recommendations by the European Society of Cardiology [<a href="#rid13">13</a>] and by the American Heart Association and American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation [<a href="#rid14">14</a>] are discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1477.html" rel="external">"Cardiac rehabilitation programs"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H619956807"><span class="h3">Exercise prescription</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An appropriate exercise prescription, in parallel with a medication prescription, includes intensity (dose), duration (how long for each session), frequency (usually on a weekly basis), location (center- or home-based), type of activity, and very importantly, progression. Intensity can be specified as a heart rate, a speed and grade of a treadmill, or a rated perceived exertion scale (RPE) (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef70470" href="/z/d/graphic/70470.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Cardiac rehabilitation programs can be monitored or non-monitored. Examples of patients who may need intermittent or constant monitoring include those with atrial fibrillation and uncontrolled ventricular response or those with suspected exercise-induced ventricular ectopy.</p><p>A typical exercise prescription includes a three-day-per-week program with 30 to 40 minutes of aerobic activity at an intensity commensurate with 60 to 70 percent of heart rate reserve (maximum heart rate-resting heart rate) or an RPE of 15 to 17. Starting in a six- to eight-week program of supervised training will familiarize patients with a sense of activity and better quality of life and reassure them of the safety of exercise. An unsupervised home training program can overlap with supervised sessions and gradually become the preferred modality of exercise once the supervised program is complete [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Beta blockers are a component of current guideline-recommended treatment so the heart rate usually remains lower than the maximum by age. However, if the patient is stable and doing well, there are no data to show harm from allowing the heart rate to rise above 60 to 70 percent of heart rate reserve. Timing of oral administration of beta blocker may affect the heart rate. Generally, patients are instructed to take all their medications as directed even on the days they attend a rehabilitation session.</p><p>The approach described here can be used for both HFrEF and HFpEF. Patients may also have comorbidities that limit activity, such as chronic lung disease, and a consult with an exercise specialist may be particularly helpful for patients with comorbid conditions. One such example is identifying and addressing a need for supplemental oxygen during exercise sessions.</p><p>When patients are rehospitalized, they will lose functional capacity. Once a patient is euvolemic and discharged, exercise can resume safely. Return to rehabilitation may necessitate starting at a lower intensity of aerobic training and progressing gradually.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H89281876"><span class="h3">Types of exercise training</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In cardiac rehabilitation programs for patients with HF, aerobic exercise training is dominant since evidence and experience is greatest for this type of activity. Some programs also include resistance training and inspiratory muscle training as limited evidence suggests that such programs are beneficial. In patients who have lost muscle mass, particularly in the upper extremities, resistance training will improve their ability to perform activities of daily living, since most self-care involves the arms. Older women may benefit greatly from adding small weights with arm exercises. Inspiratory muscle training will ultimately improve the intercostal muscles and may be most helpful in patients who have been intubated or have chronic lung disease in addition to HF. (See <a class="local">'For heart failure with reduced ejection fraction'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H89281883"><span class="h4">Aerobic exercise</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Aerobic activity is defined by movement through space and includes treadmill walking, cycling, upper body ergometry, dancing, swimming, and playing sports. Other aerobic modalities that may be included are low-level group activities with stretching and movement. Some programs may also offer group walks within or outside the facility. Aerobic exercise blocks can alternate with intervals of rest. With a variety of training modalities, patients may remain more engaged and find exercise enjoyable.</p><p>Some patients may not be able to attend a formal program due to social issues, such as transportation. Nonetheless, activity can generally be prescribed such as walking 20 to 30 minutes daily at an intensity that feels moderate in effort. Periods of rest can be interspersed. Progression can occur by adding time to the initial 20 to 30 minutes or increasing the speed of walking. Walking can occur outside (weather and conditions permitting) or in the patient’s home, up and down stairs, or walking from room to room. Some shopping malls open early for the public to walk in a sheltered safe environment. Engaging the caregivers in supporting the patient will go a long way to encouraging adherence to the recommendation. Comfortable shoes and loose clothing are recommended. Activity should occur at times of day where the weather is not uncomfortable, and when the patient feels most energetic (ie, morning versus afternoon and not after meals). In the digital era, smartphone technology may be helpful both to monitor the patient’s activity and to assess changes in function. Technology tools may enhance patient participation in increased activity at home. More research is needed to assess the long-term benefits of technology as a substitute for center-based cardiac rehabilitation [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p>It is important to advise the patient that at the initiation of a program, they may feel fatigued, but that this fatigue will improve with time and not to be discouraged since activity is safe.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H89281889"><span class="h4">Resistance training</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Exercise programs for patients with HF may include resistance training as well as aerobic exercise, although as noted below, evidence on resistance training in this population is more limited. Resistance training should be individualized by the rehabilitation team with monitoring of symptoms and blood pressure. Teaching the patient to breathe during a resistance activity is important to avoid the Valsalva maneuver, which may increase vascular resistance. Muscle conditioning can help patients for their activities of daily living. (See <a class="local">'Resistance training'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H89281895"><span class="h4">Inspiratory muscle training</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Inspiratory muscle training has also been a part of individual rehabilitation programs given the respiratory symptoms of more advanced patients. (See <a class="local">'Inspiratory muscle training'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H195639300"><span class="h2">Safety considerations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Evaluation of patients prior to enrollment in an exercise program should include history and physical examination as well as exercise testing with electrocardiographic monitoring to screen for patients at high risk for adverse events (by evaluating for ischemia and significant arrhythmias), to help identify an exercise intensity training range, and evaluate any exercise limitations, such as muscular-skeletal conditions or angina [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Risk stratification for exercise in patients with heart disease is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1477.html" rel="external">"Cardiac rehabilitation programs", section on 'Risk stratification for exercise'</a>.)</p><p>The safety of symptom-limited exercise testing in patients with HFrEF was assessed in 2037 of the subjects enrolled in the HF-ACTION trial who performed 4411 exercise tests [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. There were no deaths per 1000 exercise tests and 0.45 nonfatal major cardiovascular events per 1000 exercise tests. In HF-ACTION, patients who had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) had no adverse events or ICD firing during the exercise sessions, as the exercise training heart rate is usually below the firing rate for the device.</p><p>Meta-analyses of studies of patients with HFrEF have found no significant adverse effects of exercise in patients with HF [<a href="#rid18">18-20</a>]. HF-ACTION, the largest trial of exercise training in patients with HFrEF found that exercise training was well-tolerated and safe; results were consistent across subgroups, including age and etiology of HF [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Similarly, no significant adverse effects were found in a meta-analysis of nine randomized trials of exercise training in 348 patients with HFpEF [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">EVIDENCE ON EFFECTS OF EXERCISE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most of the studies on exercise in HF have included patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. Much less data are available on patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), although these patients can be as limited in their exercise capacity as those with HFrEF [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p>No ventilatory, hemodynamic, autonomic, or clinical factor at baseline predicts the outcome with exercise training in patients with HF [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. An exception may be the presence of hibernating (ischemic and dysfunctional yet viable) myocardium as evidenced by a positive response to low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9380" href="/z/d/drug information/9380.html" rel="external">dobutamine</a>. The presence of hibernating myocardium is predictive of an increase in functional capacity and fewer cardiac events during follow-up after moderate exercise training [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>].</p><p>The type of exercise training may be important, although limited data are available on the effect of exercise type on hemodynamics and clinical outcomes [<a href="#rid27">27</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H113444468"><span class="h2">For heart failure with reduced ejection fraction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most of the evidence on the effects of exercise training in HF comes from studies of patients with HFrEF.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H709595631"><span class="h3">Aerobic training</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Aerobic interval training has been the type of training best studied in patients with HF.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1084880929"><span class="h4">Effect on patient outcome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Evidence from randomized trials indicates that exercise training reduces hospitalizations in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II or III HFrEF [<a href="#rid15">15,19</a>].</p><p>A meta-analysis included 33 randomized controlled trials comparing exercise training and usual care in a total of 4740 patients with NYHA functional class II and III HF (predominantly HFrEF) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. The overall risk of bias of included trials was moderate. There were similar pooled mortality rates at one year in exercise and control groups (25 trials). Exercise training reduced the rate of overall hospitalization (15 trials, 1328 participants: relative risk [RR] 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.92) and HF-related hospitalization (12 trials, 1036 participants: RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.46-0.80).</p><p>The largest trial included in the meta-analysis was the HF-ACTION trial in which 2331 patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤35 percent and NYHA class II to IV HF (96 percent with NYHA class II or III symptoms) were randomly assigned to either a supervised exercise training program plus usual care or usual care alone (which included education and recommendation of regular exercise) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Background medical therapy was optimized with greater than 90 percent use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers and beta blockers. Median follow-up was 30 months. Results included the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The primary composite end point was all-cause mortality or all-cause hospitalization. There was no significant difference in the primary end point upon analysis adjusted for HF etiology (hazard ratio [HR] 0.93, 95% CI 0.84-1.02).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>However, analysis adjusted for major prognostic baseline factors and HF etiology revealed a modest but significant decrease in the primary end point with the exercise training program (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81-0.99). After adjustment for prognostic baseline covariates, there was also a significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality or HF hospitalizations (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.99).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The trial demonstrated a high level of safety during and after the training sessions.</p><p></p><p>The economic analysis of HF-ACTION showed that more than one-half of costs were related to inpatient care, and that mean unadjusted direct medical costs were lower in the exercise group compared with control. However, taking into account travel costs, patient time, and parking, the cost advantage became nonsignificant [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. However, the majority of patients with HF who are Medicare recipients may not be actively employed. By removing the payment for patient time, the cost advantage becomes significant.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h4">Effect on functional status and quality of life</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation has a beneficial effect on functional status and health-related quality of life in patients with HF, including those who are older (&gt;60 years) and those with frailty, as demonstrated by randomized trials comparing one to six months of exercise training with no exercise program [<a href="#rid2">2,8,15,18,19,24,29</a>]. For those patients with problems of balance, stability, and muscle weakness, a program that combines physical therapy with the aerobic training may improve mobility. Patient stability, stable balance, and strength are necessary to embark on aerobic mobility. The program could be initiated with physical therapy to improve stability, balance, and strength and transition to aerobic activities, performed with better balance and better strength. The beneficial effects of exercise may be seen with high or low levels of training.</p><p>The benefits of cardiac rehabilitation were illustrated by an individual participant data meta-analysis that included 13 randomized trials with a total of 3990 patients with HF (97 percent with LVEF &lt;45 percent) comparing exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (for three weeks or more) with a no exercise control group [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>At 12 months follow-up, there were significant improvements in six-minute walk test (mean increase 21.0 m, 95% CI 1.57-40.4) and Minnesota Living with HF score (mean improvement 5.9 [on a scale from 0 to 105], 95% CI 1.0-10.9). In the seven trials assessing peak VO<sub>2</sub>, this was nominally but not significantly increased with exercise training (mean 1.01 mL/kg/min, 95% CI -0.42 to 2.44).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>No significant treatment interaction was observed across patient subgroups including age, sex, NYHA functional class (I/II versus III/IV), and HF etiology. Results were also similar for LVEF &lt;45 percent and LVEF ≥45 percent, although confidence intervals were wide for patients with higher LVEFs given low numbers of participants in this group. Studies in patients with HFpEF are discussed below. (See <a class="local">'For heart failure with preserved or mid-range ejection fraction'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>The largest trial in the meta-analysis, HF-ACTION, randomly assigned 2331 patients with reduced LVEF (≤35 percent) and NYHA class II to IV HF to a formal exercise program or control program [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. The peak improvement in peak VO<sub>2</sub> was modest, although statistically significant (0.6 versus 0.2 mL/kg/min in controls) both at 3 and 12 months, as was the improvement in six-minute walk distance at three months. The six-minute walk improvement at three months was attenuated at 12 months. In addition, there was a significant improvement in health status as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, which occurred early and remained for the duration of the trial [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. Adherence was less than predicted and may have affected the improvement in peak VO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>The benefits of cardiac rehabilitation on physical function have also been demonstrated in older patients with HF who have a high burden of frailty:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a trial (REHAB-HF) published after the meta-analysis cited above, 349 patients age 60 years or older who were recently hospitalized for HF (approximately half with LVEF &lt;45 percent) were randomly assigned to usual care or a tailored cardiac rehabilitation program (36 sessions) [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. In contrast with programs used in other trials, this program began in the hospital, focused primarily on balance and mobility training, and required minimal equipment. At baseline, 97 percent of the trial subjects were classified as prefrail or frail by the Fried criteria. At three months, patients in the cardiac rehabilitation group had higher levels of physical function (as measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery score) compared with those in the control group (8.3 versus 6.9 points). Rates of rehospitalization for any cause were similar between the groups.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H113444351"><span class="h4">Effect on depression</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Depression is common among patients with HF and adversely impacts prognosis [<a href="#rid32">32,33</a>]. A meta-analysis of 16 randomized trials with 3226 patients with HF (mostly HFrEF) found that exercise training reduced symptoms of depression, and this antidepressive effect was consistent in patients under and over 65 years of age [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].</p><p>The largest included trial was the HF-ACTION trial in which the Beck Depression Inventory II was administered to 2322 patients [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. At entry, 28 percent of patients had scores of 14 or higher, which is considered clinically significant. Exercise training modestly improved the depression scores compared with the control group at three months with a smaller response at one year.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2851366183"><span class="h4">Effect on hemodynamics and skeletal muscle</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Exercise training improves measures of LV function and hemodynamics.</p><p>The effect of exercise training on cardiac structure and function was examined by a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of exercise training in chronic HF [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. Aerobic training was associated with significant improvements in LVEF (weighted mean difference 2.6 percent), and end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (weighted mean difference -11.5 mL and -12.9 mL, respectively) [<a href="#rid36">36</a>]. Improvements in cardiac output and exercise capacity with exercise may be related to improvements in diastolic function as manifested by increase in peak early diastolic filling rate of the LV at rest and during exercise [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].</p><p>Exercise training improves hemodynamics and muscle energetics so that oxygen utilization becomes more efficient, allowing a similar amount of work to be performed at a lower heart rate, rate-pressure product, and minute ventilation (indicating improved gas exchange). The lower rate-pressure product may permit patients to perform their daily tasks with fewer symptoms and less disability [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Exercise-induced improvements in hemodynamics may be mediated by reduction of autonomic and neurohumoral activation [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. Exercise training reduces sympathetic tone and increases vagal tone at rest, thereby restoring autonomic cardiovascular control towards normal [<a href="#rid39">39-41</a>]; enhanced arterial baroreceptor sensitivity may contribute to this reduction [<a href="#rid42">42,43</a>]. This change in the sympathetic-parasympathetic balance is associated with lower resting heart rates [<a href="#rid39">39,41,44-46</a>]. Exercise training also reduces neurohumoral activity with decreased resting levels of angiotensin, aldosterone, vasopressin, and natriuretic peptide [<a href="#rid42">42,47,48</a>]. To the degree that these changes reduce systemic vascular resistance and cardiac afterload, they may lead to an improvement in cardiac performance [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3486.html" rel="external">"Natriuretic peptide measurement in heart failure"</a>.)</p><p>Exercise training also improves endothelial function as evidenced by increased basal endothelial nitric oxide formation and acetylcholine-mediated, endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the skeletal muscle blood vessels, possibly leading to an increase in exercise capacity [<a href="#rid50">50,51</a>]. Dietary supplementation with L-arginine, which also increases nitric oxide levels, improves endothelial function in patients with HF to a similar extent as exercise; both interventions together have additive effects [<a href="#rid52">52</a>]. Aerobic interval training improves flow-mediated vasodilation more than moderate continuous training [<a href="#rid53">53</a>].</p><p>In addition, exercise training reduces plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 and their soluble receptors; and apoptotic mediators, such as Fas and Fas ligand [<a href="#rid54">54,55</a>]. Such cytokines may have detrimental effects on cardiac function and skeletal muscle.</p><p>Exercise training can increase muscle oxidative capacity and reduces oxidative stress. In patients with HFrEF, exercise training improves oxygen utilization with increased activity of oxidative enzymes and an increase in mitochondrial content [<a href="#rid47">47</a>]. Such exercise-induced changes may improve the peak VO<sub>2</sub> and delay the onset of anaerobic metabolism. Patients with the worse function seem to benefit the most. This observation is encouraging and should be shared with patients who may be hesitant or afraid [<a href="#rid39">39</a>].</p><p>Reduced sympathetic hyperactivation and improved endothelial dysfunction with exercise training contribute to improved muscle blood flow and clinical performance. However, the information available on the effects of exercise training on the distribution of fast and slow twitch fibers and capillary densities in HF are not consistent and may be related to intensity of training and length of time with HF.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H195638220"><span class="h4">Effect of intensity and volume of aerobic training</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most HF trials have studied moderate intensity (50 to 60 percent peak VO<sub>2</sub> or 60 to 70 percent heart rate reserve) exercise, which has resulted in 4 to 31 percent increases in peak exercise capacity [<a href="#rid2">2,15</a>].</p><p>In an analysis from HF-ACTION of a subset of 959 patients who were randomized to the exercise arm and were event free for at least three months, the volume of exercise was inversely associated with the risk for clinical events, with only moderate levels (3 to 7 MET-h per week) of exercise needed to observe a clinical benefit [<a href="#rid56">56</a>]. This on-therapy analysis of HF-ACTION supports the use of regular exercise in the management of patients with HFrEF and supported approval by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid of coverage for cardiac rehabilitation in HFrEF.</p><p>High-intensity training may provide some advantages over moderate-intensity training but evidence is limited. A meta-analysis including seven randomized trials comparing high-intensity training with moderate-intensity continuous training in clinically stable patients with HFrEF found greater improvements in exercise tolerance with high-intensity training but no significant effect on LVEF at rest [<a href="#rid57">57</a>]. A systematic review suggested that higher-intensity training in patients with HF may have a greater beneficial effect on peak oxygen consumption as a measure of cardiorespiratory fitness [<a href="#rid58">58</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H709595658"><span class="h3">Resistance training</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Resistance training has been less well studied in HF due to concerns about potential risks, although the available limited evidence suggests that resistance training is safe and beneficial.</p><p>Patients with chronic HF are known to have significant physical disability compared with age- and activity-matched controls due to deficits in both aerobic capacity and muscular strength [<a href="#rid59">59,60</a>]. Myocardial dysfunction induces neurohormonal, metabolic, and circulatory changes that result in an imbalance between anabolic and catabolic processes at the level of skeletal muscle, producing a progressive skeletal myopathy and ultimately a wasting syndrome. This myopathy contributes to the exercise intolerance observed in chronic HF.</p><p>There is growing evidence of benefit from resistance training in patients with HF. Most studies have included only patients with HFrEF [<a href="#rid61">61,62</a>] with a few studies focusing on patients with HFpEF [<a href="#rid63">63,64</a>].

Respiratory muscle weakness and deconditioning may worsen exercise tolerance and quality of life in patients with HF. Respiratory muscle training, or inspiratory muscle training, has improved muscle strength and endurance in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1452.html" rel="external">"Respiratory muscle training and resting in COPD"</a>.)</p><p>A meta-analysis included nine randomized controlled trials comparing inspiratory muscle training with sham or control (education) with a total of 239 participants with chronic HFrEF (NYHA class II or III) [<a href="#rid66">66</a>].
