         Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with the Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22)(q34;q11), resulting in the
         <em>
          BCR::ABL1
         </em>
         fusion gene. This genetic abnormality results in the formation of a unique gene product (BCR::ABL1), which is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. It is this deregulated tyrosine kinase that is implicated in the development of CML. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4537.html" rel="external">
          "Molecular genetics of chronic myeloid leukemia"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The majority of patients with CML present in a relatively indolent phase termed chronic phase and are treated initially with a BCR::ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), such as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8961" href="/z/d/drug information/8961.html" rel="external">
          imatinib

         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8852" href="/z/d/drug information/8852.html" rel="external">
          dasatinib

         , or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9448" href="/z/d/drug information/9448.html" rel="external">
          nilotinib
         </a>
         . Side effects are generally mild, but there are some patients who must discontinue the drug due to intolerance. In addition, second line therapy is required for the patient who has a suboptimal response (primary resistance) or relapses after an initial response (secondary resistance) to a TKI.
        </p>
        <p>
         The treatment of patients with chronic phase CML who are intolerant of or have a primary or secondary resistance to a TKI will be reviewed here. The initial treatment of chronic phase CML and specific details regarding the pharmacology of TKIs are discussed separately. (See

         Long-term studies of BCR::ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown that side effects are usually mild and most patients can continue treatment without interruption. When more severe symptoms do develop, the majority resolve rapidly within a few days after stopping the TKI for a brief "drug holiday." Often, the drug can then be restarted at the same dose without a recurrence of the side effects. Fewer than 5 percent of patients treated with a TKI will be unable to tolerate long term treatment. The side effects of TKIs and their management are discussed in detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4514.html" rel="external">
          "Accelerated phase chronic myeloid leukemia: Diagnosis and treatment", section on 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitor selection'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         While the TKIs have some side effect profiles in common, there are some notable variations. Common side effects include myelosuppression, gastrointestinal complaints, fatigue, headache, rash, and peripheral and periorbital edema (most notably with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8961" href="/z/d/drug information/8961.html" rel="external">
          imatinib
         </a>
         ). Imatinib has been rarely associated with severe heart failure.
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8852" href="/z/d/drug information/8852.html" rel="external">
          Dasatinib
         </a>
         may cause pleural effusions and rarely pulmonary hypertension, as well as gastrointestinal bleeding (probably related to an effect on platelet function). Dasatinib and
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9448" href="/z/d/drug information/9448.html" rel="external">
          nilotinib
         </a>
         are associated with QT prolongation. Nilotinib can occasionally cause pancreatitis.
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="86371" href="/z/d/drug information/86371.html" rel="external">
          Bosutinib
         </a>
         can cause transient elevations of transaminases and significant diarrhea during the first one to two months of treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Myelosuppression is uncommon after patients achieve remission, but neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia can occur during the initial treatment period until the marrow repopulates with normal hematopoietic cells. Some side effects, such as severe recurrent rash or hepatotoxicity, necessitate permanent discontinuation of therapy while others, as mentioned above, require only a brief "drug holiday."
        </p>
        <p>
         There is no universal definition of intolerance. In general, we consider a patient intolerant when a grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity recurs despite appropriate dose reductions and optimal symptomatic management [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. However, since these drugs must be taken daily for many years, even grade 1 or 2 toxicities may be considered intolerable by some patients, sometimes leading to poor adherence to treatment. Grading of toxicities is based on the United States National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>

         Resistance to treatment is divided into two categories: primary and secondary [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. Primary resistance is when a TKI fails to achieve a desired response; this occurs in up to 25 percent of patients with chronic phase CML treated with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8961" href="/z/d/drug information/8961.html" rel="external">
          imatinib

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Secondary resistance refers to relapse following an initial response to a TKI. The occurrence of secondary resistance has been estimated at approximately 8 percent at two years for patients in chronic phase treated with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8961" href="/z/d/drug information/8961.html" rel="external">
          imatinib

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients who appear to have resistant disease should be questioned carefully to assure that they are taking the TKI at the recommended dose and schedule and avoiding other medications or herbal supplements which may impair efficacy [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. A study employing an electronic device to monitor compliance with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8961" href="/z/d/drug information/8961.html" rel="external">
          imatinib
         </a>
         therapy in 87 patients with CML in stable complete cytogenetic response on imatinib reported that compliance was an independent predictor of major molecular response (MMR) [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Patients with ≥90 percent compliance had a significantly higher rate of MMR at six years (95 versus 28 percent). No patients with compliance ≤80 percent attained a MMR. Compliance appeared to decrease among patients who had their imatinib dose escalated. Compliance also appears to be lower among patients with higher medication co-payments [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Imatinib blood levels can and should be measured if there are questions about an individual's compliance with the medication [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12-15
         </a>
         ]. Plasma trough concentrations &lt;1000 ng/mL are associated with higher rates of disease progression [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16,17
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         If resistance is identified, the disease phase should be re-evaluated using a complete blood count with differential and a bone marrow biopsy with cytogenetic testing. In addition, mutational analysis of
         <em>
          BCR::ABL1
         </em>
         should be performed. A newly acquired mutation in
         <em>
          BCR::ABL1
         </em>
         may trigger a change in treatment (eg, dose increase, change to another TKI, hematopoietic cell transplantation) depending upon the type of mutation found. Specific details on disease phase and mutational analysis are presented separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4496.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia", section on 'Pretreatment evaluation'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients found to be in accelerated phase or blast crisis at the time of identification of TKI resistance are treated differently than those in chronic phase. This is discussed in detail separately. (See

         </span>
         Patients whose CML is resistant to any of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) should have evaluation of blood or bone marrow for the presence of
         <em>
          BCR::ABL1
         </em>
         kinase mutations. Such mutations can be identified in approximately 40 percent of such individuals and the sensitivity pattern of particular mutations can suggest the use of which TKI to use subsequently  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109963" href="/z/d/graphic/109963.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). In addition, evaluation of the possibility of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) should be done, because "second line" treatment is not uniformly successful. Eligibility criteria for allogeneic HCT vary by institution. Patients are often excluded based on age (&gt;70 years old), uncontrolled infection, cardiac, pulmonary, liver or renal dysfunction, and/or psychosocial variables. Patients who are not candidates for HCT are treated almost exclusively with second generation TKIs. Trials that support the use of second generation TKIs in patients with intolerance or resistance to an initial TKI are discussed below. (See

          imatinib

         therapy is not successful. Approximately half of patients in chronic phase CML initially treated with imatinib will attain a durable complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) with a second generation TKI [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. The response rates for patients not responding to initial treatment with dasatinib or nilotinib are less well defined but are considerably lower. Allogeneic HCT is usually reserved for those patients who have failed to respond to two or more TKIs.

         There are no randomized trials that have directly compared the efficacy of second generation TKIs in patients with chronic phase CML who experience failure of an initial TKI. Phase II studies in this population suggest that they have similar efficacy. Response rates are generally higher in patients who were switched due to intolerance compared with those switched due to resistance.

Those taking ponatinib should be monitored for the development of hypertension to allow for early medical intervention.

         There are limited data to guide the choice between these options. Continuation of a TKI or HCT are acceptable alternatives and a decision should be made after a detailed discussion with the patient.

        <p>
         Scoring systems have been devised in an attempt to predict the response of CML to a second generation TKI. As an example, analysis of 123 patients with chronic-phase CML intolerant or resistant to
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8961" href="/z/d/drug information/8961.html" rel="external">
          imatinib
         </a>
         who underwent treatment with a second generation TKI identified two risk factors for progression [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57
         </a>
         ]: the lack of a cytogenetic response to initial imatinib and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or more. Patients with zero, one, or two of these factors had rates of event-free survival at two years of 78, 49, and 20 percent, respectively. Another scoring system incorporated information on the best cytogenetic response to imatinib, the occurrence of neutropenia, and the Sokal score at diagnosis [
         <a href="#rid58">
          58
         </a>
         ]. Other factors that might affect the response to a second generation TKI include adherence to imatinib therapy and point mutations in
         <em>
          BCR::ABL1
         </em>
         [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,22
         </a>
         ]. Validation of these scoring systems in independent patient cohorts is necessary before they can be widely applied with confidence. In practice, because the responses to second generation TKIs occur usually rapidly, we recommend repeating PCR evaluations about two months after switching; one should have concern if improvements are not apparent.
        </p>
        <p>
         HCT is an appealing option for some patients since it is the only proven curative treatment option in CML. Among patients with certain clinical characteristics, five-year survival can be as high as 80 percent. However, early mortality is in the 10 to 20 percent range. Details on the efficacy and risks associated with HCT are presented separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4494.html" rel="external">
          "Hematopoietic cell transplantation in chronic myeloid leukemia"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Survival with HCT can be predicted with reasonable accuracy using a scoring system devised by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef67260" href="/z/d/graphic/67260.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ) [
         <a href="#rid59">
          59
         </a>
         ]. This scoring system incorporates the patient's age, stage of disease, time from diagnosis, and the closeness of the donor match. An ideal candidate for transplant would be a young (&lt;40 years old) patient in chronic phase with an HLA identical sibling donor. The five-year overall survival rates for such patients (EBMT score 0-2) ranged at the time of this scoring system's creation from 60 to 80 percent. However, with the advent of newer approaches to HCT, current overall survival rates are likely to be higher. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4494.html" rel="external">
          "Hematopoietic cell transplantation in chronic myeloid leukemia"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The benefits, risks, and side effects of HCT and tyrosine kinase inhibitors should be discussed with the patient in some detail before a treatment decision is made. The main factors when deciding among these options are the patient's age, availability of an appropriate donor, and the patient's interest in undergoing HCT.

         The most commonly used approach in patients without a

         <strong>
          without
         </strong>
         a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), we suggest HCT given the likelihood of disease progression without transplantation. However, we often treat with a third TKI if resistance is due to an acquired
         <em>
          ABL1
         </em>
         kinase domain mutation that has high sensitivity to a particular TKI  (

          figure 1
         </a>
         ). As an example, if a TKI has an inhibitory concentration (IC
         <sub>
          50
         </sub>
         ) in the range of 50 nM or lower to the mutation, we treat with that TKI prior to proceeding to HCT.

          with

         a CCyR, options include continued TKI therapy or HCT. Some clinicians prefer HCT immediately in such individuals, primarily due to concerns regarding the durability of these responses, although most suggest close monitoring with HCT offered should there be evidence of disease progression or cytogenetic relapse. Maturing data regarding second generation TKIs suggest that the responses will be durable in the vast majority of patients [

         Treatment with a BCR::ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) should be discontinued for drug intolerance, a suboptimal response to initial therapy, or for relapse after an initial response to a TKI. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Defining intolerance and resistance'

         There is no universal definition of TKI intolerance. We consider a patient intolerant when a nonhematologic toxicity of grade 3 or 4 recurs despite appropriate dose reductions and optimal symptomatic management. Cytopenias are more often a sign of the drug's effectiveness, and less often due to drug toxicity. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Defining intolerance and resistance'

         All patients with presumed resistance should be questioned carefully to assure compliance with the recommended dose and avoidance of other medications or herbal supplements that may impair TKI efficacy. All patients with confirmed resistance should undergo mutation analysis of
         <em>
          BCR::ABL1

         For most patients with intolerance to an initial TKI, we recommend treatment with another TKI rather than immediate allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Response rates to a second-line TKI are generally lower in patients with primary treatment failure or following relapse compared with those patients who are intolerant of the initial TKI. For such patients, we suggest treatment with another TKI (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">
          Grade 2B
         </a>
         ). HCT is a reasonable alternative for young, fit patients with a matched donor. (See

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Selection of a second generation TKI is based upon side effect profiles of these agents, knowledge of the individual's comorbid conditions, and occasionally by the presence of specific kinase mutations  (

          table 3

         Further management of these patients is guided by achievement of a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR):

         Many patients who achieve a CCyR will obtain a long term response. For those who achieve a CCyR, we suggest continued TKI therapy with close monitoring (followed by HCT at the signs of relapse) rather than immediate HCT (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">
          Grade 2B
         </a>

         <a class="local">
          'Initial management'
         </a>
         above and

         For those patients who fail to achieve a CCyR and remain in chronic phase CML, we suggest evaluation for allogeneic HCT. However, if resistance is due to an acquired
         <em>
          ABL1
         </em>
         kinase domain mutation that has high sensitivity (eg, IC
         <sub>

         in the range of 50 nM or lower) to a particular TKI  (

          figure 1
         </a>
         ), we often treat with that TKI prior to proceeding to HCT. In patients without a mutation, a trial of a third-line TKI (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
