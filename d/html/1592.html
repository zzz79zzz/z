         Pulmonary barotrauma can complicate mechanical ventilation. It is most often due to alveolar rupture resulting in the release of air into extra-alveolar locations [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Pulmonary barotrauma may be associated with increased mortality and in some circumstances it may be life-threatening. Thus, it is important that clinicians prevent, recognize, and promptly manage barotrauma in this population.

         The prevention, diagnostic evaluation, and management of pulmonary barotrauma are discussed in this topic review. Additional complications of mechanical ventilation are described separately. (See

         Barotrauma is physical damage to body tissues caused by a difference in pressure between a gas space inside the body and its surrounding external environment. Pulmonary barotrauma from invasive mechanical ventilation refers to alveolar rupture due to elevated transalveolar pressure (the alveolar pressure minus the pressure in the adjacent interstitial space); air leaks into extra-alveolar tissue resulting in conditions including pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum, and subcutaneous emphysema.

         Although not true barotrauma, direct injury to the alveolar or pleural space (eg, from chest trauma or biopsy) results in conditions that present and are managed similarly. Thus, they will be included in this topic for the purposes of discussion. (See

         The incidence of barotrauma during mechanical ventilation varies with the underlying indication for mechanical ventilation but ranges from 0 to 50 percent [

         All patients on mechanical ventilation are at risk of barotrauma. The normal respiratory cycle during spontaneous breathing is dependent upon negative pressure. In contrast, invasive mechanical ventilation involves the delivery of positive pressure. Positive pressure ventilation causes barotrauma by increasing transalveolar pressure (ie, alveolar pressure minus the pressure in the adjacent interstitial space), which results in alveolar rupture [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Alveolar rupture allows air from the alveolus to enter the pulmonary interstitium. The interstitial air can then dissect along the perivascular sheaths toward the pleural space, mediastinum, peritoneum, and/or skin, leading to pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum, and/or subcutaneous emphysema, respectively  (

        <p>
         The mechanism of barotrauma in patients who receive noninvasive ventilation (NIV), which also delivers positive pressure, is likely similar [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11-15
         </a>
         ]. However, such instances are rare probably because airway pressures associated with NIV are lower when compared with invasive mechanical ventilation. (See

         Barotrauma refers to trauma induced by high pressures, while volutrauma refers to injury induced by overdistension of the lung during mechanical ventilation. These phenomena are interrelated when one considers tidal volume in relation to functional residual capacity (strain) and airway pressure in relation to pleural pressure (stress). However, limiting alveolar pressure appears to be the most effective way of preventing barotrauma suggesting that high alveolar pressures play a dominant role in alveolar rupture.

          Elevated plateau pressure
         </strong>
         – The plateau pressure (Pplat) represents the pressure applied to the small airways and alveoli. There is no absolute Pplat above or below which barotrauma does or does not occur but, in general, the higher the Pplat, the greater the risk of barotrauma with the highest rates occurring in those with a Pplat &gt;35 cm H

         Pplat is not routinely displayed. To determine Pplat, the clinician must apply an inspiratory breath hold (usually 0.5 to 1 second) to the ventilated patient and measure the airway pressure during the breath hold. In our practice, we follow the Pplat daily and also intermittently measure it when peak pressures are elevated. Targeting the ideal Pplat during mechanical ventilation to prevent barotrauma is discussed below. (See

          Elevated peak pressure
         </strong>
         – Similar to Pplat, there is no absolute threshold for the peak pressure (Ppeak; also known as peak inspiratory pressure [PIP]), above which barotrauma occurs and in general, the lower the better.

         Ppeak is routinely displayed on most ventilators and is the highest airway pressure measured during each respiratory cycle. It represents the total pressure needed to overcome the inspiratory flow resistance, elastic recoil of the lung and chest wall, and the alveolar pressure that exists at the beginning of each breath. Thus, Ppeak is partly determined by Pplat, such that when the Ppeak is &gt;35 cm H
         <sub>
          2

         O and largely due to an elevated Pplat, the risk of barotrauma is likely elevated. Similarly, when Pplat is elevated to the same degree as Ppeak, then patients are at risk of alveolar overdistension and, therefore, barotrauma [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ]. Ppeak is higher than the Pplat, with the difference between the two values being related to airway resistance. Larger differences indicate more airway resistance (eg, asthma exacerbation). Determining the contributions of airway resistance and plateau pressure to Ppeak is discussed separately. (See

          High levels of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP)
         </strong>
         – In the past, most experts traditionally considered high levels of PEEP as a potential risk factor for barotrauma based upon the rationale that in ARDS, high levels can result in overdistension in regions of the lung not involved with ARDS. However, several studies have reported that open lung ventilation strategies using high levels of PEEP or recruitment maneuvers, have not been shown to increase the risk of barotrauma [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,24-30
         </a>
         ]. This is probably because most open lung approaches also concomitantly use lung protection strategies (ie, low tidal volume with a target plateau pressure ≤30 cm H
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         O) and perhaps because the application of PEEP appropriately recruited involved atelectatic lung, thereby improving lung compliance. Thus, we believe that high levels of PEEP may increase the risk of barotrauma only when this strategy is ineffective in recruiting ARDS-affected atelectatic lung, or not performed together with lung protective ventilation. These ventilatory approaches and determining the optimal level of PEEP are discussed separately. (See

         The data to support a ventilatory approach that reduces the risk of barotrauma in mechanically ventilated patients are extrapolated from patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although no single strategy prevents barotrauma, we typically use lung protective ventilatory approaches by limiting plateau pressure (Pplat) ≤30 cm H

         O and using low tidal volume ventilation (6 to 8 mL/kg ideal body weight [IBW]). Additional principles of prevention include the avoidance of overventilation, adopting measures to avoid or treat dynamic hyperinflation (auto-positive end expiratory pressure [PEEP]), and the cautious use of high levels of PEEP. The risk of barotrauma is not eliminated until the underlying predisposing condition is resolved and the patient is weaned from mechanical ventilation  (

         This approach is based upon the rationale that overventilation is a risk factor for barotrauma and that this strategy reduces mortality in patients with ARDS  (

In general, we use tidal volumes of 6 mL/kg IBW in high risk patients particularly those with ARDS, but also in those with COPD, asthma, and chronic interstitial lung disease (ILD) (see

          'Disease-related'

         This strategy is based upon data derived from patients with dynamic hyperinflation (DHI) from asthma and COPD. DHI is characterized by increased levels of intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi or "auto-PEEP"). The hyperinflation is progressive (dynamic) because air accumulates in the lung with each breath as a result of a failure to achieve complete exhalation before the onset of the next breath  (

          figure 3
         </a>
         ). The prevention and treatment of DHI are primarily achieved through a reduction in respiratory rate and/or tidal volume (ie, reducing minute ventilation) and shortening inspiratory time (both prolonging expiratory time), as well as treating the underlying airflow obstruction when present. Further details are discussed separately. (See

Physical findings may include tachycardia, tachypnea, respiratory distress, hypertension, or hypoxemia accompanied by a new unilateral reduction of breath sounds. Ventilator asynchrony, acute elevation of peak and plateau pressures, and an acute reduction in expired tidal volume may be noted. Tension pneumothorax should be suspected in those who also have distended neck veins, tracheal deviation away from the affected side, and hypotension or shock. Although iatrogenic-induced pneumothorax is not ventilator-induced, the presenting features and management principles are often the same. (See

          Diagnosis

         – Pneumothorax is typically a radiographic diagnosis. Unless tension pneumothorax is suspected, a portable chest radiograph should be performed, although computed tomography is sometimes required. When available, ultrasonography is particularly useful when rapid diagnosis and/or treatment with tube thoracostomy is needed.

          Chest radiography
         </strong>
         – Chest radiography for the diagnosis of pneumothorax in ventilated patients poses certain challenges. Pneumothorax on an upright chest radiograph in a spontaneously breathing patient most often reveals an apical white visceral pleural line which is separated from the parietal pleura by a collection of gas (ie, a radiolucent space with no lung markings). However, in ventilated patients, portable chest radiographs are obtained with the patient semirecumbent or supine, such that free air collects anteriorly or in a subpulmonic location, resulting in atypical findings (free air will rise superiorly and follow the path of least resistance) [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. Gas in the subpulmonic location outlines the anterior pleural reflection, the anterolateral border of the mediastinum, and the costophrenic sulcus creating the "deep sulcus" sign or the "double diaphragm" sign  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef90382" href="/z/d/graphic/90382.html" rel="external">

         ). On rare occasions, pneumothoraces are bilateral and may have evidence of gas in other locations (eg, subcutaneous, or mediastinal). Post-processing image enhancement can aid in the detection of pneumothorax on portable chest radiograph [

         When tension pneumothorax is suspected immediate intervention with tube thoracostomy or needle decompression followed by tube thoracostomy is typically indicated; thus, there is seldom time for radiographic evaluation, although ultrasonography may be useful diagnostically and therapeutically in such circumstances. Rapid clinical improvement following empiric aspiration of a suspected tension pneumothorax is considered by most experts as diagnostic. (See

          Management
         </strong>
         – Patients with evidence of barotrauma-associated pneumothorax are managed with an immediate reduction in ventilatory pressures and most additionally undergo chest tube drainage. Although increased levels of supplemental oxygen are often administered, this strategy has no proven value, particularly for those already receiving high fractions of inspired oxygen.

          Tube thoracostomy
         </strong>
         – There is a paucity of evidence to help guide the clinician regarding the decision to place a chest tube for the drainage of pleural air in mechanically ventilated patients. In general, we have a low threshold for thoracostomy tube placement based upon our observation that more than 30 percent of pneumothoraces in mechanically ventilated patients progress to tension pneumothoraces. Immediate insertion of a chest tube is indicated for suspected tension pneumothorax. Tube thoracostomy is also appropriate if the pneumothorax is symptomatic, impairs gas exchange or is large, persistent, or progressive. Further details regarding chest tube management (placement, duration, location, size, ultrasonography assistance), and management of persistent air leaks and bronchopleural fistulas are described separately.

         – Patients may complain of dyspnea, chest pain, or neck pain. Physical findings may include tachycardia, tachypnea, or hypertension. A crunching sound is occasionally heard during cardiac auscultation. Hypotension due to decreased venous return and cardiac output may occur if tension pneumomediastinum develops, although this is rare [

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Pneumomediastinum is commonly diagnosed on a chest radiograph. It appears as radiolucent streaks in the mediastinum  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef127806" href="/z/d/graphic/127806.html" rel="external">
          image 4
         </a>
         ). Free air tracking along normal anatomic structures (eg, trachea, heart) may outline those structures. When extensive, it may result in a linear lucency above the diaphragm including the central portion which is not normally visualized on the chest radiograph, a finding known as the continuous diaphragm sign  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef127802" href="/z/d/graphic/127802.html" rel="external">
          image 5
         </a>
         ). Although this finding may also be seen with pneumopericardium it is much more common with pneumomediastinum. However, if accumulations are small, pneumomediastinum may only be detected by CT chest.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Increased intramediastinal pressure results in collapse of the cardiac chambers, restriction of cardiac filling, and reduction of stroke volume and cardiac output. A flattened cardiac silhouette, known as the earth-heart sign  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef138550" href="/z/d/graphic/138550.html" rel="external">
          image 6
         </a>
         ), is suggestive of tension pneumomediastinum (ie, a larger transverse cardiac diameter and a smaller vertical cardiac diameter than usual). In the appropriate clinical context, the presence of the earth-heart sign together with classical radiologic features of pneumomediastinum strongly support the diagnosis of tension pneumomediastinum [
         <a href="#rid45">

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         When found radiographically, other etiologies should be considered including a ruptured esophagus (eg, previous vomiting, nasogastric tube placement), trauma, endobronchial fracture, or mediastinitis from gas-producing organisms. The presence of the Naclerio V sign  (

         ) on plain chest radiography films in patients with a pneumomediastinum suggests esophageal rupture. This appears as a V-shaped air collection, with one limb of the V produced by mediastinal gas outlining the left lower lateral mediastinal border and the other limb produced by gas between the parietal pleura and medial left hemidiaphragm. However, the Naclerio V sign is not specific to esophageal rupture.

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – Although pneumoperitoneum may be diagnosed by upright abdominal or chest radiography, the diagnosis is often missed such that when suspected, it is best evaluated by CT [
         <a href="#rid47">
          47
         </a>
         ]. When feasible, the patient should remain in position for approximately 5 to 10 minutes before the CT is performed to allow the air to collect in sufficient volume to be detected radiographically. When plain film abdominal radiography is used, free air accumulates superiorly (ie, underneath the diaphragm) when the patient is upright, and anteriorly when the patient is supine; anterior accumulation of air appears as gas on both sides of the bowel wall (Rigler sign), gas outlining the falciform ligament, gas outlining the peritoneal cavity (Football sign), gas outlining the medial umbilical folds (inverted V sign), or gas localized in the right upper quadrant [

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Since pulmonary barotrauma is a rare cause of pneumoperitoneum, other etiologies should be considered for which CT may also be useful. These include a ruptured viscus, abdominal trauma, recent abdominal laparoscopy or surgery, peritoneal dialysis, paracentesis, vaginal procedures, bacterial peritonitis, pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis, and bowel malignancy.

An exception is the rare patient who develops abdominal compartment syndrome due to tension pneumoperitoneum.

         Compartment syndrome due to severe subcutaneous emphysema may require surgical decompression as a life-saving maneuver in those with hypotension or who are unstable. Surgical decompression involves creating one or more sterile surgical incisions ("blowhole incision"), usually 1 to 2 inches long through the dermis of the anterior chest wall to allow air to escape; air may be heard escaping through the skin and occasionally gentle massage of air through subcutaneous tissue can encourage decompression. Incisions may be left loosely covered with sterile gauze until healing has occurred. Subcutaneous drain placement and blow hole incisions with negative pressure wound therapy have also been reported for severe cases or for palliation of symptoms, although none of these techniques are validated [

         When auto-PEEP is suspected (eg, patients with acute asthma), it can be managed by reducing minute ventilation (ie, decrease tidal volume and respiratory rate). Inspiratory time may be shortened by increasing the flow rate when volume-controlled modes are used and lowering inspiratory:expiratory (I:E) ratio of 0.33 if pressure-controlled modes are being used. Inverse ratio ventilation (ie, inspiratory time exceeds expiratory time) should be avoided. (See

         Treatment of the underlying medical condition is indicated in all patients. As an example, for those with an asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, aggressive bronchodilation with beta agonists may result in significant and immediate reduction in airway pressures. There is no contraindication to the use of steroids particularly when indicated for managing the underlying lung disease. Medical treatment of asthma, COPD, ARDS, and interstitial lung disease are discussed separately. (See

         For other rare cases, reversal of the offending cause is appropriate including treatment of central airway obstruction, repositioning the endotracheal tube when malpositioned in the mainstem bronchus, ventilating at lower than usual tidal volumes for those with pneumonectomy (eg, one-third to one-half), and antimicrobials for cavitating pneumonia.

         Once ventilator changes have been made and specific therapies have been administered (eg, bronchodilators, chest tube placement), follow up within one hour with an arterial blood gas is advised so that further ventilator adjustments can be made, if necessary. All patients must be monitored closely by routine clinical examination and assessment of vital signs and ventilator settings. While some physicians perform serial chest radiography (eg, every 8 to 12 hours until the patient is stable or has no signs of progression), we generally perform routine daily imaging and imaging that is symptom-directed. When air is not drained, it resorbs slowly and evidence of barotrauma may remain on radiographs for days to weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
         For those in whom a thoracostomy tube is placed, some require tube repositioning or replacement, or additional tubes if followup imaging reveals an incomplete response or no response. Using the least amount or no chest tube suction to maintain lung inflation is typically preferred in order to reduce the risk of developing a persistent leak or bronchopleural fistula. The management of persistent air leaks and bronchopleural fistula are discussed separately. (See

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The decision to remove thoracostomy tubes in ventilated patients is challenging and individualized, especially if they remain mechanically ventilated and the underlying disorder remains acutely active. We generally only remove them when the pneumothorax has completely resolved, the patient is clinically stable, and is successfully weaning (eg, low plateau pressure, minimal ventilator settings, on tracheostomy and ready for a long term care facility) or has weaned from mechanical ventilation (ie, extubated). Additional indications to remove chest tubes also include difficulty weaning due to pleural pain or infection from the chest tube itself or in those with direct injury to the pleural space (eg, pneumothorax due to central line placement).

          Definition and epidemiology

         – Pulmonary barotrauma from invasive mechanical ventilation refers to alveolar rupture due to elevated transalveolar pressure. Estimates suggest that the incidence of barotrauma is approximately 10 percent or less. While direct injury to the alveolar or pleural space is not true barotrauma, the resulting conditions (eg, pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum) present and are managed similarly. (See

         <strong>
          Prevention
         </strong>
         – No single strategy prevents barotrauma. We typically use lung protective ventilatory strategies by limiting plateau pressure (Pplat) ≤30 cm H
         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         O and using low tidal volume ventilation (eg, 6 to 8 mL/kg ideal body weight [IBW]). We also use measures to avoid or treat dynamic hyperinflation (eg, lower minute ventilation, shorten inspiratory time, treat obstruction). These and other measures are listed in the table  (

          Manifestations
         </strong>
         – Common manifestations include pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum, and subcutaneous emphysema, or combinations thereof. Signs and symptoms range from an asymptomatic finding on routine chest radiography to tachypnea, tachycardia, acute respiratory distress, profound hypoxemia, and hemodynamic collapse. Ventilator asynchrony, acute elevation of peak and plateau pressures and an acute reduction in the expired tidal volume may also be noted. Pulmonary barotrauma is typically diagnosed radiographically, but physical examination is also appropriate. (See

         <strong>
          Management
         </strong>
         – For mechanically ventilated patients who develop pulmonary barotrauma, we suggest that the Pplat be immediately lowered (

          Grade 2C

         <sub>
          2
         </sub>
         O. This may require lowering the tidal volume and positive end-expiratory pressure as well as increasing sedation (including neuromuscular blockade). Additional therapies may involve managing the specific consequence of the barotrauma (eg, tube thoracostomy) and treating the underlying medical condition (eg, bronchodilators for asthma). (See
