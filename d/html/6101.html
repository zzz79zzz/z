         The nephrotic syndrome is caused by increased permeability across the glomerular filtration barrier. It is classically characterized by nephrotic range proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. The first two features are diagnostic.

         The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of nephrotic syndrome in children are reviewed here. The complications and treatment of idiopathic childhood nephrotic syndrome and specific kidney diseases that present as nephrotic syndrome in children are discussed separately.

         Congenital nephrotic syndrome occurs in children less than three months of age. These cases can be either primary, likely due to a genetic disorder, or secondary, likely due to congenital or acquired infection. Infantile nephrotic syndrome occurs between three months and one year of age. Two-thirds of nephrotic syndrome cases that occur during the first year of life and as many as 85 percent of cases that occur during the first three months of life have a genetic basis and a poor outcome [

         Minimal change disease (MCD) is the most commonly seen diagnosis of childhood nephrotic syndrome based on histopathology. This was illustrated in a classic study from the International Study of Kidney Disease in Children (ISKDC) of 521 children (age range 12 weeks to 16 years of age) who presented with primary nephrotic syndrome. The study was conducted in 24 centers in North America, Europe, and Asia between 1967 and 1974 [
         <a href="#rid1">

         ]. Whether this is due to a true increase in prevalence or is a result of improved detection of the histologic changes consistent with FSGS on kidney biopsy is unknown. Since the diagnosis of FSGS is made by the detection of one or more glomeruli with segmental glomerulosclerosis, one cannot be certain that a patient with an initial diagnosis of MCD does not actually have FSGS that was missed because of sampling error.

         Although children with nephrotic syndrome most often present with edema, it does not occur in every patient. Periorbital edema is typically noted first and is often misdiagnosed as a manifestation of allergy. The edema is gravity dependent, so throughout the day, periorbital edema decreases while edema of the lower extremities increases. In the reclining position, edema localizes to the back and sacral area. Other dependent areas that can become edematous include the scrotum, penis, or labia. The affected areas are nonerythematous, soft, and pitting. Edema increases gradually and becomes detectable when fluid retention exceeds 3 to 5 percent of body weight.

         Hyperlipidemia does not occur in every patient with the condition. Hyperlipidemia in nephrotic syndrome is usually characterized by increased total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) levels  (

          table 2

         ). HDL cholesterol remains unchanged or low, particularly HDL2, leading to an increased LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio. Patients with severe hypoalbuminemia also have increased TG and VLDL levels. Additionally, the levels of lipoprotein Lp(a) are elevated in nephrotic patients, and this further contributes to an increased risk of cardiovascular and thrombotic complications [

         in a 24-hour urine collection. In children, early morning 'spot' urine protein to creatinine ratio is often used to quantify proteinuria because it may be difficult to perform a 24-hour urine collection. Values exceeding 2 mg protein/mg creatinine (200 mg/mmol) are the most commonly reported cut off value for nephrotic range proteinuria and correspond to a dipstick value +3 and above.

Plasma protein levels are also markedly reduced due to hypoalbuminemia, often less than 5 g/dL (50 g/L). Electrophoresis, if performed, typically shows low albumin and increased alpha2- and beta-globulins The level of gamma-globulins depends on the cause of the nephrotic syndrome. For example, IgG levels are markedly reduced in minimal change disease and elevated in systemic lupus erythematosus.

         In patients with established nephrotic syndrome, additional clinical and laboratory evaluation is warranted to identify the specific underlying cause and assess for possible complications. Often in clinical practice, testing is initiated as soon as nephrotic syndrome is suspected. Although we have separated out the steps of testing for discussion in this topic, in practice these laboratory tests are performed at the same time as diagnostic testing to confirm nephrotic syndrome. Our approach is consistent with the following initial evaluation of nephrotic syndrome developed by the Children's Nephrotic Syndrome Consensus Conference [

Hyponatremia has also been attributed to the generation of non-sodium (non-Na+) and non-potassium (non-K+) osmoles in response to plasma-volume contraction secondary to hypoalbuminemia [

         We usually perform genetic testing rather than a kidney biopsy for infants under three months of age, as nephrotic syndrome in these patients is most often due to a genetic cause. Exceptions to this include infants with extra-renal symptoms suggesting a secondary cause (ie, malar rash, purpura, adenopathy) and those with a birth history suggesting a congenital infection (ie, HIV, Hepatitis B or C, syphilis). These infants should be evaluated with additional tests, as discussed above. (See

         If we do not identify a genetic cause on initial testing, we perform a kidney biopsy to identify the cause of nephrotic syndrome or treat presumptively for MCD with a course of glucocorticoids. The decision of which modality to choose is based on the likelihood that the nephrotic syndrome is secondary to another disorder.

         Our approach to performing genetic testing rather than kidney biopsy for patients under three months of age is largely supported by a study reporting that as many as 85 percent of nephrotic syndrome cases that occur during the first three months of life have a genetic basis and are unlikely to respond to steroids [

         For children without findings suggesting an inherited cause, the likelihood is high that they have primary nephrotic syndrome (ie, MCD), and so we treat presumptively with steroids rather than pursue kidney biopsy. We proceed with genetic testing for those who do not respond to steroid therapy (ie, who have steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome). (See

         We generally reserve kidney biopsy for those children who have both negative genetic testing and are steroid resistant in order to look for other causes of nephrotic syndrome.

         For most children 1 to 12 years of age, we defer biopsy and empirically treat for MCD with glucocorticoids, since primary nephrotic syndrome (ie, MCD) is the most likely cause in these children. Exceptions that prompt kidney biopsy include features suggesting a secondary cause, such as extra-renal symptoms (ie, malar rash, purpura, adenopathy, recent group A streptococcal infection) or atypical features (macroscopic hematuria, low C3 levels, elevated serum creatinine, hypertension). We also favor kidney biopsy over presumptive glucocorticoids in children between 10 to 12 years who show signs of pubertal development, as steroids may cause unacceptable side effects during puberty.

        <p>
         In a child between 1 and 12 years of age, with no syndromic features or family history, and without specific clinical features suggestive of a secondary cause, the diagnosis of MCD is very likely. As many as 90 percent of these patients are steroid responsive, so an initial trial of steroid therapy is most often administered without further evaluation. In this sense, an initial trial of steroid therapy in children likely to have MCD is both a diagnostic and a therapeutic measure.
        </p>
        <p>
         For children who do not respond to empiric steroids, we perform kidney biopsy. Treatment of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (and MCD) is discussed in detail separately. (See

         This approach is supported by evidence suggesting that age and certain clinical features can reasonably distinguish minimal change disease from other causes of nephrotic syndrome. Specifically, in the International Study of Kidney Disease in Children (ISKDC), age &lt;10 years, normal kidney function and complement levels, and the absence of hypertension and gross hematuria, predicted minimal change disease on kidney biopsy compared with other glomerulopathies. Thus, it is reasonable to presumptively treat such patients for minimal change disease based on clinical features alone. This approach avoids invasive kidney biopsy in 80 percent of children between 1 and 10 years of age who present with nephrotic syndrome, since the majority of patients with MCD respond to steroid therapy. In one study, only 10 percent of children less than 10 years of age failed to respond to steroids for presumptive minimal change disease [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,23
         </a>
         ]. Although the age threshold for presumptive diagnosis of MCD in the ISKDC was 10 years, subsequent evidence also suggests that the likelihood of MCD is high in children up to 12 years old.

         We proceed with kidney biopsy in children presenting with nephrotic syndrome at &gt;12 years of age regardless of whether they have findings of secondary causes because they are less likely to have MCD. In addition, steroid therapy in these children may cause unacceptable side effects.

         Histology of kidney biopsy generally reveals the underlying glomerulopathy. Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is characterized by diffuse foot process effacement on electron microscopy and minimal changes (MCD), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), or mesangial proliferation on light microscopy. It is unclear whether these three light microscopic patterns represent separate disorders or are a spectrum of a single disease process [

          Classification and etiology

         – Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is caused by kidney diseases that increase the permeability across the glomerular filtration barrier. It is characterized by nephrotic range proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. It is classified based on the underlying cause: primary NS, secondary NS, and congenital and infantile NS  (
