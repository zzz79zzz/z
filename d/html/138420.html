         Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) occurs in approximately 0.5 to 3 percent of pregnant individuals with diabetes [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. It is characteristically associated with type 1 diabetes, but can occur in type 2 diabetes in the setting of infection, trauma, or other precipitating factors (eg, high-dose glucocorticoid therapy, vomiting), especially in patients who are "ketosis prone." DKA is an obstetric emergency because it can result in life-threatening fetal hypoxemia and acidosis, in addition to maternal morbidity (eg, cerebral edema) and, rarely, mortality.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will discuss issues related specifically to DKA in pregnant patients. Issues related to DKA in nonpregnant adults are reviewed separately.

         DKA results from absolute or relative insulin deficiency combined with counterregulatory hormone excesses (ie, glucagon, glucocorticoids, catecholamines, and growth hormone). Pregnant individuals are prone to ketosis because of metabolic changes that have been referred to as "accelerated starvation." Pregnancy also induces a state of insulin resistance in late gestation that may result in greater relative insulin deficiency. (See

         agonist and antenatal corticosteroids administered to accelerate fetal lung maturity can cause counterregulatory hormone excesses leading to DKA. Other triggers for DKA, including infection, trauma, and cardiac ischemia, are not specific to pregnancy. In addition, insulin omission, which sometimes occurs in the setting of an insulin pump system failure due to blockage or leakage in the infusion set or connectors, can also contribute to development of DKA.

         The maternal clinical presentation of DKA is similar in pregnant and nonpregnant persons except that it can be seen at lower serum glucose levels and symptoms may develop more rapidly in pregnant individuals. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, thirst, polyuria, polydipsia, abdominal pain, tachypnea, and, when DKA is severe, a change in mental status. Most, but not all, cases occur in the second or third trimester [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. Rarely, DKA can be the initial presentation of new-onset diabetes, usually type 1 diabetes. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1792.html" rel="external">
          "Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in adults: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical presentation'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Osmotic diuresis can lead to severe volume depletion and a reduction in uteroplacental blood flow. The reduced perfusion combined with the metabolic abnormalities of DKA (maternal acidosis, hyperglycemia, electrolyte imbalance) can result in life-threatening fetal hypoxemia and acidosis. In fetuses who displayed cardiac maturity (ie, heart rate variability amplitude 6 to 25 beats per minute [bpm] and accelerations ≥15 bpm above baseline) before DKA, the fetal heart rate during acute DKA often has minimal or absent variability and absent accelerations, as well as repetitive decelerations [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. These abnormalities usually resolve with resolution of DKA, but it may take several hours before the fetal heart rate tracing is normal [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>

         </span>
         Laboratory findings of DKA usually include hyperglycemia, acidemia, an elevated anion gap, ketonemia (elevated serum beta-hydroxybutyrate and the presence of urine ketones), low serum bicarbonate, and renal dysfunction [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5

        </p>
        <p>
         However, when evaluating laboratory values in pregnant patients with possible DKA, it is important to consider the physiologic changes that occur during gestation, which alter these typical laboratory values used in DKA evaluation.

         Glucose levels in pregnant patients may be lower than usually expected in DKA; pregnancy is one of the known causes of "euglycemic" DKA. Hyperglycemia in nonpregnant patients with DKA is usually severe (often in the 350 to 500 mg/dL [19.4 to 27.8 mmol/L] and generally less than 800 mg/dL [44 mmol/L]). By comparison, in a series of 11 pregnant patients with DKA, more than one-third (4 out of 11) had blood glucose levels &lt;200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. In pregnant patients without markedly elevated glucose levels, it may be difficult to distinguish starvation ketosis from DKA.

         Pregnant patients have a respiratory alkalosis due to increased minute ventilation, which results in lower serum bicarbonate levels and higher arterial pH (7.40 to 7.45) in normal pregnancy. The respiratory alkalosis of pregnancy may mask metabolic acidosis of DKA but the pregnancy-related reduction in serum bicarbonate may be exaggerated. (See

         Albumin levels are reduced, which can lower the anion gap [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ], and this may mask the DKA-associated anion gap elevation. Measurement of serum beta-hydroxybutyrate can be helpful in evaluating whether ketosis is present in individuals whose anion gap appears to be within the normal range. (See

         Pregnancy results in a physiologic increase in glomerular filtration rate; thus, renal dysfunction may be present in those with apparently normal creatinine levels (creatinine level is &lt;0.75 mg/dL [70.7 micromol/L] in normal pregnancy). (See

         DKA should be suspected in pregnant patients with diabetes and clinical symptoms of the disorder (eg, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting), especially in the setting of a precipitating factor (eg, infection). The diagnosis is confirmed by characteristic abnormalities in laboratory findings. (See

         The symptoms of DKA are nonspecific. In early pregnancy, nausea and vomiting may be mistaken initially for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. The presence or absence of hyperglycemia can help to distinguish between the two diagnoses, though euglycemic DKA is possible. (See

         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>

         – Insulin and intravenous fluids should be continued until normalization of the anion gap. If a patient has ongoing ketosis, DKA will not be adequately treated if insulin is stopped upon achieving euglycemia. The resolution of DKA should be judged based on normalization of the anion gap or lack of elevated serum ketones, rather than the serum bicarbonate level, since hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis may be induced by volume resuscitation during treatment.

         – Administration of dextrose-containing intravenous fluids in addition to insulin is important when the glucose level is falling and below 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) to avoid interruption of insulin because of impending hypoglycemia and to facilitate continued insulin administration and normalization of the anion gap.

          Fetal monitoring and timing of delivery
         </strong>
         – In fetuses with cardiac maturity before DKA, the fetal heart rate is continuously monitored. The pattern may be nonreassuring (no or minimal variability, absent acceleration, deceleration), but the abnormal pattern usually resolves as DKA is treated and maternal metabolic abnormalities improve [

         Emergency delivery before maternal stabilization usually should be avoided because it increases the risk of maternal morbidity and mortality and may result in delivery of a hypoxic, acidotic preterm newborn for whom in utero resuscitation may have resulted in a better outcome. The timing of delivery needs to be individualized based on multiple factors, including gestational age, maternal condition (whether the mother is responding to aggressive therapy or deteriorating), and fetal condition (whether the fetal heart rate pattern is improving or deteriorating).

          Clinical findings
         </strong>
         – Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) occurs in approximately 0.5 to 3 percent of pregnant individuals with diabetes, usually in the second or third trimester. The maternal clinical presentation of DKA is similar in pregnant and nonpregnant persons, but symptoms may develop more rapidly in pregnancy. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, thirst, polyuria, polydipsia, abdominal pain, tachypnea, and, when DKA is severe, a change in mental status. DKA can result in life-threatening fetal hypoxemia and acidosis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical manifestations'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – DKA should be suspected in pregnant patients with diabetes and clinical symptoms of the disorder (eg, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting), especially in the setting of a precipitating factor (eg, infection, antenatal corticosteroid administration, betamimetic tocolytic therapy). The diagnosis is confirmed by characteristic abnormalities in laboratory findings (hyperglycemia, acidemia, an elevated anion gap, ketonemia [elevated serum beta-hydroxybutyrate and the presence of urine ketones]), low serum bicarbonate, and renal dysfunction. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Diagnosis'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The degree of hyperglycemia may be lower than in nonpregnant patients in DKA, and may be &lt;200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L).

         <strong>
          Differential diagnosis
         </strong>
         – In early pregnancy, nausea and vomiting may be mistaken initially for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. The presence or absence of hyperglycemia can help to distinguish between the two diagnoses, though euglycemic DKA is possible. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Differential diagnosis'

         <strong>
          Management
         </strong>
         – The general principles of DKA management are similar in pregnant and nonpregnant patients: appropriate volume replacement, potassium repletion (prior to insulin administration), intravenous insulin, administration of bicarbonate in severe cases, frequent laboratory monitoring, and a search for precipitating causes, such as infection. Phosphate is repleted if hypophosphatemia is severe or symptomatic. An algorithm for DKA treatment in pregnancy is provided  (
