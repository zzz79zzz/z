         Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS) are malignant soft tissue tumors that are thought to originate from immature cells and myogenic satellite cells that are destined to form striated skeletal muscle; however, these tumors can arise in locations where skeletal muscle is not typically found (eg, the urinary bladder).
        </p>
        <p>
         The treatment of RMS has evolved considerably. Cure rates have risen, largely due to the use of combined modality therapy in trials conducted by large international cooperative groups, such as the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group (IRSG), which is also known as the Soft Tissue Sarcoma Committee of the Children's Oncology Group (COG) [
         <a href="#rid1">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic review will provide an overview of treatment for RMS. The epidemiology, pathology, molecular pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of RMS are discussed elsewhere. (See

         In the past, fewer than 20 percent of patients with rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) were cured with surgery alone, implying that micrometastatic disease was present at diagnosis in the majority of these patients [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. In contrast, with the use of modern combined modality therapy, over 70 percent of children with localized RMS can be cured of their disease [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,5
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         These improved outcomes are the direct result of multimodality therapeutic protocols that have been developed by large international cooperative groups, such as the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group (IRSG, or the Soft Tissue Sarcoma Committee of the Children's Oncology Group [COG]). Modern treatment for RMS includes chemotherapy for primary cytoreduction and eradication of both macroscopic and microscopic metastatic disease; surgery, if feasible; and radiation therapy (RT) to control microscopic local residual disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         The specific treatment regimen depends on the estimated risk of a disease recurrence, which is based upon a variety of clinicopathologic prognostic factors that have been identified through a series of treatment protocols carried out by the IRSG. This is termed risk-adapted therapy. One risk stratification schema is used in the United States  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71404" href="/z/d/graphic/71404.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). A different risk stratification system that does not incorporate molecular classification (fusion gene status) is used in Europe [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         In this topic, we describe treatment guidelines based upon the established historical definition of "risk group,"  (

         The IRSG, a National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsored cooperative group, was formed in 1972 to investigate the biology and treatment of RMS; it was merged into the COG in the year 2000.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since its inception, six protocols involving over 5000 patients have been completed: IRS-I (which accrued between 1972 and 1978), IRS-II (1978 to 1984), IRS-III (1984 to 1991), IRS-IV Pilot (1987 to 1991), IRS-IV (1991 to 1997), and the D series protocols of IRS-V (1996 to 2005) [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-12
         </a>
         ]. These studies have been instrumental in identifying prognostic factors, developing risk-based therapies, and improving outcomes for RMS. The group's success is reflected in dramatic increases in the overall five-year survival rates for patients with RMS, from 55 percent in IRS-I to 63 percent in IRS-II to approximately 71 percent in the IRS-III and IRS-IV protocols [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12-14
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         All of these studies enrolled all stages of disease, but separate protocols were carried out for completely resected localized disease, incompletely resected localized disease, and regionally advanced/distant disease. The most important findings of these studies, which have formed the basis for risk-adapted therapy, can be summarized as follows:

         The extent of surgical resection (ie, the clinical group [CG] classification  (

         <a href="#rid7">
          7,9,10
         </a>
         ]. In IRS-III, for example, patients with completely resected RMS (CG I) had a five-year survival rate of over 90 percent, as compared with 80, 70, and 30 percent for those with CG II, III, and IV disease, respectively. For CG III patients (gross residual disease after surgery), neither a higher total dose of RT nor the use of accelerated fractionation RT improved local control or survival [

         </a>
         ]. For IRS-IV, TNM stage was used to assign chemotherapy treatment, while CG was used to select patients for RT. In subsequent studies (eg, IRS-V), a combined prognostic stratification scheme was used to assign all therapeutic modalities based upon estimated prognosis (ie, risk-adapted therapy) [

         The following sections provide an overview of standard treatment recommendations for RMS, which are based mainly upon the results of IRS-IV, the D series studies of IRS-V, and all of the COG-era ARST protocols.
        </p>
        <p>
         An important point is that treatment for RMS is constantly evolving, and if the reader's goal is to obtain information on how to treat a specific patient, he/she should contact a pediatric oncologist who is a member of the

         and who has expertise in soft tissue sarcoma for the latest recommendation. All eligible patients with RMS should be enrolled in one of the active clinical research protocols in any part of the world. In the United States, these are designed by the Soft Tissue Sarcoma Committee of the COG and administered by COG centers according to risk groups  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71404" href="/z/d/graphic/71404.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). For available open protocols, a member center should be contacted. Although in the United States pediatric oncologists treat patients up to the age of 20, any patient younger than 50 years old is eligible for these protocols.

         We recommend complete excision for localized disease as long as functional and/or cosmetic results are acceptable. If complete resection is not feasible or if disease involves the orbit, vagina, bladder, or biliary tract, patients are better approached with an initial diagnostic biopsy followed by neoadjuvant chemotherapy and then definitive local therapy with either surgery or RT. For disease at any primary site, palpable or radiologically enlarged (≥1 cm) lymph nodes should be excised and submitted for histologic evaluation, regardless of positron emission tomography (PET) avidity, if this modality is used for staging. (See

         Primary head and neck tumors are rarely amenable to wide local excision because of proximity to vital structures and cosmetic concerns. This generally limits the role of surgery to initial diagnostic biopsy. However, the availability of highly skilled otolaryngologic and craniofacial reconstructive teams at selected institutions may permit resection of some tumors that would otherwise be considered unresectable [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18

         All boys 10 years of age or older who have a paratesticular RMS and no imaging evidence of gross lymphatic metastatic disease should undergo routine ipsilateral nerve-sparing retroperitoneal lymph node (RPLN) sampling. The rationale for this recommendation is as follows:

         Overall, approximately 14 percent of boys with paratesticular RMS without radiographic lymph node enlargement will be found to harbor metastases; the risk is much higher (up to 47 percent) among adolescents [
         <a href="#rid21">

         In IRS-III, RPLN sampling was recommended, and only 2 of the 11 failures (18 percent) were regional. In contrast, routine RPLN sampling was not used in IRS-IV, and 7 of the total 16 failures (43 percent) were nodal. For patients over the age of 10 who had CG I paratesticular RMS and only received VA, the three-year failure-free survival (FFS, defined as the time from therapy initiation to disease progression, recurrence, or death from any cause) rate was significantly worse than that for younger boys with CG II disease (68 versus 100 percent) who were treated with intensive chemotherapy and RT [

         The histopathologic documentation of nodal metastases is clinically important because patients with positive nodes are referred for postoperative RT as well as three-drug (VAC) chemotherapy, while both

        </p>
        <p>
         For younger boys (under the age of 10), surgical excision of radiographically enlarged lymph nodes is warranted, but RPLN sampling is not indicated in the absence of definite radiographic findings.

         Selected patients may benefit from second-look surgery after upfront chemotherapy to evaluate for residual disease. A multidisciplinary discussion among the surgeon, radiation oncologist, pediatric oncologist, and the parents should take place after chemotherapy in all patients with CG III disease  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef59875" href="/z/d/graphic/59875.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ) regarding the risks and potential benefits involved in a second-look surgery. The main benefit of second-look surgery in this setting is to identify patients who may benefit from reduced-dose RT.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients with a clinical (radiographically) complete response to induction chemotherapy, second-look surgery has been studied as a means of documenting the histopathologic response in an attempt to improve outcomes. However, a survival benefit from this approach has not been proven. A lack of correlation between radiographic tumor response to induction therapy and overall prognosis was shown in the IRS-IV trial, in which CG III participants who completed all protocol therapy without developing progressive disease were assessed for response (complete response, partial response [≥50 percent decrease], or no response [&lt;50 percent decrease and &lt;25 percent increase]) by radiographic measurement [
         <a href="#rid41">
          41
         </a>
         ]. When categorized as to the best response to therapy, five-year FFS was similar for participants achieving a clinical complete response and for those whose best response was a partial response or no response (80 versus 78 percent). Among the 17 participants with a best response of partial/no response who had second-look surgical procedures, 8 (50 percent) of 16 with available pathology reports had residual viable tumors, and resection did not improve outcomes (refer below).
        </p>
        <p>
         However, it should be noted that in other studies, such as the Cooperative Weichteilsarkom Studiengruppe (CWS) RMS trials, partial response (&gt;33 percent reduction in tumor size) or an objective response of a lesser magnitude (&lt;33 percent reduction in tumor size) after three cycles of chemotherapy has been correlated with better outcomes [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Additional data examining the value of second-look surgery come from the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) Malignant Mesenchymal Tumors study, in which 237 patients with nonparameningeal RMS underwent initial biopsy or limited surgery, followed by three to six cycles of chemotherapy and a second-look surgical procedure [
         <a href="#rid43">
          43
         </a>
         ]. RT was withheld in patients with a histopathologic complete response. Unfortunately, 50 percent of patients ultimately had a local recurrence, regardless of whether they underwent second-look surgery or were followed clinically.
        </p>
        <p>
         This approach was also evaluated using data from the IRS-III study, in which patients with CG III disease  (

         <a href="#rid7">
          7

         Twenty-seven patients had a clinical complete response, 55 patients had a partial response, and there were 29 patients with minor responses (objective tumor regression of less than 50 percent of baseline tumor size).

         Among the 55 patients who had a partial response undergoing second-look surgery, 14 (25 percent) were in fact histopathologic complete responses and an additional 12 (22 percent) were rendered tumor free by surgery.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The survival impact of a second-look surgical procedure during treatment was also addressed in an analysis of a subset of patients who participated in IRS-IV and who underwent a second-look procedure before the completion of chemotherapy [
         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. The initial protocol had stipulated that a second-look procedure be considered for patients who still had a persistent tumor mass at week 46 or 47, approximately four weeks after completing treatment. Despite this, 79 children had a second-look procedure prior to completing chemotherapy. Overall, 13 of the 14 patients with a clinical complete response had no viable tumor, while 41 percent of those without a complete response had no viable tumor. Five-year FFS rates were significantly higher in patients without viable tumor when compared with those who had viable tumor (81 versus 53 percent, hazard ratio [HR] 0.38, 95% CI 0.15-0.99); overall survival did not reach the level of statistical significance (81 versus 67 percent, HR for death 0.42, 95% CI 0.12-1.41).
        </p>
        <p>
         In another COG study of 369 patients with clinical group III RMS  (

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Based upon these reports, there is no clear survival advantage to second-look surgical procedures when they are used to document the response to chemotherapy in children with RMS, and second-look surgery should only be used selectively.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the other hand, a reasonable indication for second-look surgery is to document the histopathologic response to chemotherapy in order to allow a reduction in the prescribed radiation dose in patients with CG III disease  (

In the D9802 protocol, doses as low as 36 Gy (in those with a complete response [complete resection with negative margins]) and 41.4 Gy (in those with positive margins) were employed with equal local control and survival compared with previous protocols for patients who otherwise would have received 50.4 Gy [

         On the other hand, at least some data suggest that resection of metastatic disease may benefit some patients. In a report of 88 patients with metastatic RMS treated over three consecutive European cooperative group protocols, patients who underwent aggressive attempts at local control (surgery plus radiation) had a longer overall survival compared with those who were treated with surgery or radiation only (44.3, 18.8, and 16.1 percent, respectively, p&lt;0.006) [

         Based upon prior cooperative group studies, when it is administered, RT is generally given after four cycles of chemotherapy. Historically, for patients with parameningeal tumors and intracranial extension or cranial nerve palsies, radiation was initiated emergently on day 0. However, data suggest that there is no benefit for early RT when intensive chemotherapy is used and that the functional and survival outcomes are similar if RT is delivered after four cycles of chemotherapy [

         <a href="#rid55">
          55

However, there is a need for further evidence for optimal timing of RT in patients treated with contemporary chemotherapy regimens that are less intense. In the open

         Treatment volume is determined by tumor extent at diagnosis, including involved nodes, and should include at least a 1 cm margin of normal tissue. RT is typically given over four to six weeks in once-daily fractions of 1.8 to 2 Gy. Although early guidelines recommended doses as high as 55 to 60 Gy for control of the primary, clinical practice has evolved over time, with the underlying strategy of reduced RT doses to minimize posttreatment complications. However, even with reduced doses, the decision to pursue RT in very young children (under the age of three) is difficult, as there are minimal data regarding the survival benefits [

         The recommendation that all CG I alveolar RMS receive RT has been called into question by a later analysis of 71 patients with CG I alveolar RMS who were treated in the IRS-III and IV studies [

          59

        </p>
        <p>
         These numbers are very small, and larger studies are needed before it can be concluded that RT is not needed in patients with alveolar histology and CG I disease. Treatment standards in North America recommend the addition of RT to all patients with CG I tumors that are fusion positive (forkhead box O1 [
         <em>
          FOXO1

         RT is recommended for all patients with CG III disease. The benefit of RT is supported by a pooled analysis of patients with bladder/prostate primaries treated in United States and European cooperative protocols, in which patients who did not receive RT for local control had an inferior EFS, although overall survival was not adversely affected [

         It may be possible to omit RT in certain subsets of patients, but this is not the standard of care in the United States yet and needs to be appropriately studied. As an example, for patients with localized vaginal disease, the last two United States trials, D9602 [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12

         <a href="#rid66">
          66
         </a>
         ]. Patients with group IIA or III N0 disease who did not receive RT had a 46 percent incidence of local recurrence when treated with VAC/VA according to the ARST0331 protocol, compared with 14 percent when treated with VAC high-dose

         <a href="#rid66">
          66

         ]. Thus, these higher local failure rates may be attributed to the lower doses of cyclophosphamide; a similar pattern of higher local failure rates has been observed among patients with intermediate-risk disease who received lower total cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide  (

         In some United States RMS studies, a dose of 50.4 Gy has been recommended for all sites except the orbit. Later studies support the use of even lower doses in children with CG III disease who have only microscopic disease remaining after induction chemotherapy, as determined by second-look surgery. As an example, in the D9802 protocol, doses as low as 36 Gy (for patients with a complete response after second-look surgery) and 41.4 Gy (for patients with positive margins after second-look surgery) were employed with equal local control and survival compared with previous protocols [

This is higher than the five-year cumulative local failure rate of 2 percent for similar patients treated in IRS-IV (n = 49), who received 50.4 to 59.4 Gy and alkylating-agent-containing chemotherapy. However, it is similar to the 16 percent cumulative local failure rate seen in CG III orbital tumors treated in IRS-III (n = 71), who received 41.4 to 50.4 Gy RT (depending on patient age and tumor size) without an alkylating agent.

However, the number of failures in these comparisons is very small, and there is no legitimate statistical comparison. The result seen in the IRS-IV trial may in fact be the anomaly because it has the smallest number of patients treated among the four studies. It is difficult to make sound conclusions as to whether one RT dose is superior to the other based upon these limited data. In our view, any of these treatment approaches is appropriate for CG III orbital tumors.

The incorporation of systemic chemotherapy into treatment protocols has increased survival rates in patients with apparently localized disease to approximately 60 to 90 percent.

         Outcomes for children with intermediate-risk disease have remained virtually unchanged over the past two decades despite intensification of alkylating agents and addition of new therapies such as

In an attempt to improve the outcome of these patients, the EpSSG conducted a randomized study in patients with high-risk disease (which is comparable to the intermediate-risk group as defined by the COG). Patients aged 6 months to 21 years with node-negative alveolar or incompletely resected (group II or III) embryonal RMS arising in an unfavorable site (head and neck, pelvis) or with lymph node-positive disease, and who had no radiologic evidence of disease at the end of treatment (typically, six to nine cycles of intense chemotherapy with

         ]. Maintenance therapy was associated with a borderline improvement in three-year disease-free survival (the primary endpoint, 77.6 versus 69.8 percent, HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.45-1.02, p = 0.06) and better three-year overall survival (86.5 versus 73.7 percent, HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.32-0.86). Toxicity was predominantly low grade and hematologic. Although 91 percent completed the maintenance treatment, 79 required at least one cycle modification. The authors concluded that this therapy established the new standard of care for this group of patients in Europe.

        <p>
         Several differences exist between this treatment schema and the one used by the COG for American children, including a longer duration of therapy (14 cycles with a higher

         dose) and inclusion of all in the outcome analysis regardless of remission status at the end of a prespecified time point. Thus, in our view, although maintenance therapy is a reasonable approach for children treated according to the EpSSG guidelines, these results cannot be extrapolated or incorporated into the standard therapy regimen for patients treated off protocol according to COG protocols using high cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide. As noted above, maintenance chemotherapy is recommended for patients receiving therapy within the open intermediate-risk protocol ARST1431. (See

         Most of these patients will belong to the low- or intermediate-risk category. However, the decision to determine standard chemotherapy in this group should be based on previous best evidence, which has always been using intermediate-risk therapy. Therefore, we treat with higher total cumulative doses of

         High-risk disease includes all patients with metastatic disease with alveolar histology or fusion-positive tumors, and patients with metastatic embryonal or fusion-negative tumors who are older than 10 years of age at diagnosis. Overall five-year EFS for a patient with high-risk disease ranges between approximately 60 and 70 percent with standard therapy [

        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, not all patients presenting with metastatic disease do poorly with standard therapy, and there are factors other than fusion status that are predictive of outcome. A large pooled dataset using cooperative trial results from Europe and the United States showed that the following variables are poor risk factors and predict survival accurately (Oberlin criteria): age &lt;1 or ≥10 at diagnosis, unfavorable site (limbs or other), bone or bone marrow involvement, and three or more metastatic sites [

         (IE; ie, treatment cycles were given every two rather than three weeks through use of hematopoietic growth factor support) in 109 patients with metastatic disease at presentation [
         <a href="#rid85">
          85

         ]. There were 20 patients with metastatic (CG IV, stage 4) embryonal tumors who were younger than 10 years of age (intermediate risk, historically) included in the cohort. RT to the primary site was administered at weeks 20 to 25 but was permitted at weeks 1 to 6 for intracranial or paraspinal extension and at weeks 47 to 52 for extensive metastatic disease. At a median follow-up of 3.8 years, three-year EFS was 38 percent, and overall survival was 56 percent. Patients with fewer than two Oberlin risk factors [
         <a href="#rid96">
          96
         </a>
         ] had a three-year EFS of 69 percent, a result that compares favorably with a historically treated cohort of patients with high-risk disease in the Oberlin cohort (44 percent EFS) [
         <a href="#rid96">
          96
         </a>
         ]. In contrast, high-risk patients with two or more Oberlin risk factors did not benefit from this approach and had a three-year EFS of 20 percent. For the 20 patients with metastatic (CG IV, stage 4) embryonal tumors who were younger than 10 years of age, three-year EFS was 60 percent, which is similar to the three-year EFS of 59 percent for those treated on D9803 with VAC. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         Patients with high-risk disease, particularly if they have two or more Oberlin factors, have a very poor prognosis. There is clearly a need for novel treatment strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
         We prefer that eligible patients with high-risk disease be enrolled in a clinical trial testing new strategies. We do not recommend treatment according to ARST0431 as an option for this group of patients since the published results do not suggest any improvement over historical cohorts and the regimen is longer, has more side effects, and is more expensive [
         <a href="#rid85">
          85
         </a>
         ]. If a clinical trial is not available, we recommend VAC alone according to regimen A of the ARST0531 protocol in this subset, using lower doses of
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">
          cyclophosphamide
         </a>
         . We expect that a very small number of patients, if any, will be cured. However, they will receive an outpatient regimen with fewer side effects compared with higher intensity regimens; they are likely to have a clinical and imaging response, and they are likely to have palliation of symptoms and a better quality of life.

         In view of the poor prognosis associated with high-risk disease, high-dose chemotherapy with or without total body irradiation and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been studied as an initial treatment strategy. In uncontrolled series that generally involve small numbers of patients, the survival rates using this approach for previously untreated children with metastatic RMS/undifferentiated sarcoma range between 19 to 44 percent [
         <a href="#rid97">
          97-100
         </a>
         ]. However, it is unclear if these results are better than those that can be achieved with standard-dose chemotherapy in RMS since there are no randomized trials directly comparing both approaches. In the only randomized trial exploring the value of high-dose chemotherapy in this setting, the control group received oral maintenance therapy, which was not given to those undergoing high-dose therapy, and only 86 of the 295 registered patients were reported; 162 never received the protocol therapy [
         <a href="#rid101">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Two meta-analyses concluded that there was no significant survival advantage to high-dose chemotherapy/stem cell rescue for patients with advanced RMS [

          102,103

         Observational studies have evaluated the impact of surveillance imaging on detecting recurrences and overall survival. A retrospective analysis of 199 patients with RMS and localized relapses who were enrolled in several European cooperative protocols showed similar overall survival regardless of whether the recurrence was detected by surveillance imaging or a symptom (50 versus 46 percent) [

         Experience with treatment of adults with RMS is limited [
         <a href="#rid77">
          77,78,141
         </a>
         ]. Some data suggest that compared with children, adults have an inferior outcome [

          77,78,140,142,143
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in a compilation of data on outcomes of RMS among 1071 adults (age &gt;19 years) and 1529 children derived from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), adults had significantly worse five-year survival (27 versus 61 percent). Tumors in adults were more likely to be at an unfavorable site (65 versus 55 percent, p&lt;0.0001) and to have histologies that are unusual during childhood, particularly the pleomorphic subtype and not otherwise specified. However, adults had overall worse survival than children for similar tumors. This was especially evident for localized disease (five-year survival 47 versus 82 percent).
        </p>
        <p>
         The poorer outcomes in adults may, in part, reflect the inadequacy of primary treatment, as evidenced by the following:

         In one report of 82 adults with locoregional RMS treated over a 38-year period at MD Anderson Cancer Center, the 10-year disease-free and overall survival rates were 41 and 40 percent, respectively [
         <a href="#rid77">

         In a second series of 171 patients over age 19 who were diagnosed with RMS at a single institution over a 25-year period, five-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival rates were 28 and 40 percent, respectively [
         <a href="#rid78">
          78

         In general, adults with RMS should be treated using the same principles as established for children, although data are lacking with regards to some specifics, such as the total radiation dose (there is a trend towards use of higher radiation doses in adults because late growth-related radiation sequelae are not consequential) and the best way to integrate surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy in these patients. Results are most favorable when adults are treated in pediatric clinical trials, which are generally open to individuals up to age 50 [

          Evolution of therapy
         </strong>
         – The treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) has evolved considerably. Using contemporary combined modality therapy, over 70 percent of children with localized RMS can be cured. These improved outcomes are the direct result of the use of risk-based multimodality therapeutic protocols that have been developed by large international cooperative groups, such as the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group (IRSG), also known as the Soft Tissue Sarcoma Committee of the Children's Oncology Group (COG).

         <strong>
          Treatment options
         </strong>
         – Modern treatment includes chemotherapy for primary tumor cytoreduction and eradication of both macroscopic and microscopic metastatic disease; surgery, if feasible; and radiation therapy (RT) to control microscopic local residual disease. The specific treatment regimen depends on the estimated risk of a disease recurrence, which is based upon a variety of clinicopathologic prognostic factors, an approach termed risk-adapted therapy  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef71404" href="/z/d/graphic/71404.html" rel="external">

         ). This risk stratification system is used in North America. A different risk stratification system that does not incorporate molecular classification (fusion gene status) is used in Europe. (See

          Treatment approach
         </strong>
         – Some general principles underlying treatment of RMS are outlined below. Treatment is constantly evolving, and if the reader's goal is to obtain information on how to treat a specific patient, he/she should contact a pediatric oncologist who is a member of the COG and who has expertise in soft tissue sarcoma for the latest recommendation. In general, adults with RMS are treated using the same principles as established for children. Results are most favorable when adults are treated in pediatric clinical trials, which are generally open to individuals up to age 50. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Surgery
         </strong>
         – We recommend complete excision for localized disease as long as functional and/or cosmetic results are acceptable (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_1" rel="external">
          Grade 1A
         </a>
         ). If complete resection is not feasible or if disease involves the orbit, vagina, bladder, or biliary tract, patients are better approached with an initial diagnostic biopsy followed by induction (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy and then definitive local therapy. For disease at any primary site, palpable or radiologically enlarged (≥1 cm) lymph nodes should be excised and submitted for histologic evaluation, regardless of positron emission tomography (PET) avidity. The necessity of routine surgical sampling of nonsuspicious lymph nodes depends on the primary site. (See

          'Role of surgery'

          Radiation therapy
         </strong>
         – We recommend RT to enhance local control in all patients with RMS except those who have embryonal/fusion-negative clinical group (CG) I tumors (

          Grade 1B

         ). For available open protocols, a member center should be contacted. Although in the United States pediatric oncologists usually treat patients up to the age of 20, any patient younger than 50 years old is eligible for these protocols. In particular, there is no standard approach for patients with high- and intermediate-risk disease at present. We suggest that all of these patients be enrolled in available national collaborative clinical trials or local clinical trials testing novel approaches. (See

          'Treatment strategies according to risk group'

         For patients diagnosed in other parts of the world, cooperative group protocols are available through organizations such as the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP), the Weichteilsarkom Studiengruppe (CWS), and the European paediatric Soft tissue sarcoma Study Group (EpSSG).

         – A significant portion of children who are successfully treated for RMS develop long-term treatment-related sequelae. Specific long-term follow-up guidelines after treatment of childhood cancer have been published by the COG and are available online [

          Recurrent disease
         </strong>
         – Recurrences are often, but not uniformly, fatal. Standard therapy for relapsed patients is suboptimal, and the best regimen has yet to be identified. There are several active chemotherapy regimens, but local therapy (eg, surgery) should be considered if feasible. (See
