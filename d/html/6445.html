         The primary function of swallowing is the ingestion, preparation, and transportation of nutrients to the digestive tract. Secondary functions of swallowing are the control of nasal and oropharyngeal secretions, clearance of mucous and contaminants from the lower respiratory tract, protection of the upper airway, and equalization of pressure across the tympanic membrane through the Eustachian tube.

         This topic will review the differential diagnosis and evaluation of dysphagia in children with a focus on conditions that present with acute-onset dysphagia. The evaluation and management of chronic swallowing dysfunction resulting in chronic aspiration in children are discussed separately. (See

         Retropharyngeal cellulitis and abscess occur most commonly in children between the ages of two and four years. Retropharyngeal abscess often is a polymicrobial infection. The predominant bacterial species are
         <em>
          Streptococcus pyogenes
         </em>
         (group A streptococcus),
         <em>
          Staphylococcus aureus
         </em>
         (including methicillin-resistant
         <em>
          S. aureus
         </em>
         ), and respiratory anaerobes (including
         <em>
          Fusobacteria

         ,
         <em>
          Prevotella

         , and

          Veillonella
         </em>
         species).
        </p>
        <p>
         Early in the disease process, the findings may be indistinguishable from those of uncomplicated pharyngitis. With disease progression, symptoms related to inflammation and obstruction of the upper aerodigestive tract develop. Children with retropharyngeal cellulitis with or without abscess eventually appear ill with fever. Symptoms may include dysphagia, odynophagia, drooling, pain on neck extension, and torticollis. In addition, respiratory distress, stridor, and/or neck swelling, mass, or lymphadenopathy may be present. In stable patients, the diagnosis is best confirmed by contrast computed tomography (CT) of the neck. (See

         Diphtheria occurs rarely in regions with high vaccination rates but remains a serious disease throughout much of the world. It is an acute, communicable disease caused by the Gram-positive bacillus
         <em>
          Corynebacterium diphtheriae
         </em>
         . Respiratory diphtheria has a gradual onset of symptoms, with sore throat, odynophagia, malaise, and low-grade fever being the most common. In a significant percentage of patients, diphtheria toxin locally induces the formation of a coalescing pseudomembrane, which can extend to any portion of the respiratory tract from the nasal passages to the tracheobronchial tree and cause odynophagia. Neurologic toxicity with uncoordinated swallowing, dysphagia, upper airway obstruction, and/or pulmonary aspiration is unusual in mild disease but develops in up to three-fourths of patients with severe diphtheria. The diagnosis is confirmed by positive culture and positive toxin assay. (See

         Children with meningitis, encephalitis, or cerebral abscess may have impaired consciousness (lethargy, obtundation, or coma) with loss of the gag reflex and dysphagia. They may also rarely exhibit bulbar signs with difficulty swallowing due to infection of the components of the swallowing pathway (eg, cortical motor stripe, vagus nerve nucleus). Fever is usually present.

        <p>
         Most patients with bacterial meningitis present with fever and with clinical findings of meningeal inflammation (nausea, vomiting, irritability, anorexia, headache, confusion, back pain, and nuchal rigidity). However, the clinical manifestations of bacterial meningitis are variable and nonspecific; no single sign is pathognomonic. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         For patients without contraindications to lumbar puncture, the diagnosis of meningitis or encephalitis is confirmed by the presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis. Presumptive antimicrobial therapy should be given to patients in whom lumbar puncture cannot be safely performed. Specific pathogens are identified by isolation from CSF by culture or other molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as well as similar detection methods in other samples such as blood. The approach to diagnosis of bacterial meningitis and viral meningitis or encephalitis is discussed in greater detail separately. (See

         <em>
          Clostridium tetani

         . Dysphagia and trismus are common presenting symptoms in patients with generalized tetanus. Other clinical findings may include stiff neck, severe neck arching (opisthotonos), or risus sardonicus (sardonic smile). Patients with generalized tetanus characteristically have tonic contraction of their skeletal muscles and intermittent intense muscular spasms. Since patients with tetanus have no impairment of consciousness or awareness, both the tonic contractions and spasms are intensely painful. Tetanic spasms may be triggered by loud noises or other sensory stimuli, such as physical contact or light. The diagnosis of tetanus is made based upon typical clinical findings. (See

         Although polio no longer poses the public health threat in the United States that it once did, areas of endemic wild-type poliovirus still exist in other areas of the world and decreasing rates of vaccination of children in some regions increases the risk of resurgence. The hallmark of poliomyelitis is acute flaccid weakness due to anterior horn cell injury. The onset of weakness typically coincides with signs and symptoms of viral meningitis (eg, neck stiffness, headache, fever, and vomiting) as well as muscle pain. The distribution and extent of weakness may vary, ranging from one muscle or group of muscles to quadriplegia and respiratory failure. Tone is reduced, nearly always in an asymmetric manner. Proximal muscles usually are affected more than distal muscles, and legs more commonly than arms. Reflexes are decreased or absent. The sensory examination is almost always normal. Up to one-third of patients may develop bulbar involvement with dysphagia, dysarthria, and difficulty handling secretions. The diagnosis of poliomyelitis is suspected based on the clinical presentation and high index of suspicion from epidemiology or exposure history. Isolation of the poliovirus from stool is the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis. (See

         Patients of any age with an esophageal foreign body may present with inability or refusal of oral fluids or solids (dysphagia), drooling, or respiratory symptoms, including wheezing, stridor, or choking. The majority of foreign body ingestions occur in children between the ages of six months and three years. Most children with esophageal foreign bodies are brought to medical attention by their parents because the ingestion was witnessed or reported to them.
        </p>
        <p>
         When symptoms do occur, they are often related to the location of the foreign body. Older children may localize the sensation of something "stuck" in the neck or lower chest, suggesting irritation in the upper or lower esophagus, respectively. Foreign bodies lodged in the esophagus at the level of the cricoid cartilage or the tracheal bifurcation can compress the airway causing partial airway obstruction  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76887" href="/z/d/graphic/76887.html" rel="external">
          image 1
         </a>
         ). It is also possible that an esophageal foreign body will become dislodged into the upper airway. (See

          "Emergency evaluation of acute upper airway obstruction in children"

         Esophageal perforation from ingested sharp objects or erosion from retained smooth foreign bodies, particularly "button" batteries, may cause serious sequelae, including mediastinitis, sepsis, and death  (

         ). Children with suspected foreign body or "button" battery ingestion should have prompt anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral radiographs performed to identify possible esophageal or gastrointestinal retention. Evidence of a double-ring or halo on the AP view  (

          image 3
         </a>
         ), indicates the presence of a "button" battery rather than a coin and requires immediate removal. "Button" batteries can cause severe esophageal injury within two hours of ingestion. (See

         Impacted meat or other food bolus is the most common esophageal foreign body in adults but is relatively rare in children. It usually presents as dysphagia beginning acutely while eating. In children presenting with a food impaction, there is a higher incidence of underlying esophageal pathology (strictures, achalasia, eosinophilic esophagitis [EoE], or esophageal motility disorders) as compared with children with other esophageal foreign bodies [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1

         ]. Children who are in acute distress or unable to swallow oral secretions following food impaction require immediate attention and removal of the impaction. If the patient is comfortable and able to handle oral secretions, endoscopic intervention can be delayed because many food impactions will pass spontaneously. (See

         Esophageal perforation progresses to mediastinitis when oral and gastric fluids contaminate the mediastinal space. Mediastinitis typically presents with fever and subcutaneous emphysema and rapidly progresses to septic shock within hours if not rapidly detected and treated.

         ]. Findings depend on the location of the perforation. Neck films demonstrate air in the prevertebral fascial planes of the retropharynx and subcutaneous emphysema in patients with cervical esophageal perforations. Findings associated with more distal esophageal perforations on chest radiograph include pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, pleural effusion, hydrothorax, hydropneumothorax, and subdiaphragmatic air (upright film).

         Children with peritonsillar cellulitis and abscess (PTA) have a severe sore throat (usually unilateral), fever, and a "hot potato" or muffled voice. Pooling of saliva or drooling may be present. Trismus, related to irritation and reflex spasm of the internal pterygoid muscle, occurs in nearly two-thirds of patients and helps to distinguish PTA from severe pharyngitis or tonsillitis. Although most children with PTA are adolescents, rarely, it may present in younger children and be difficult to differentiate from retropharyngeal abscess or epiglottitis, especially if drooling and trismus are present.

          Achalasia
         </strong>
         – Dysphagia for solids and liquids during swallowing, with a gradual but progressive onset and sometimes associated with regurgitation, is the primary clinical feature of achalasia  (

         ). An association with adrenal glucocorticoid deficiency and alacrima (triple A syndrome or Allgrove syndrome) has been described in children with achalasia. (See

         A contrast swallow is the primary screening test when achalasia is suspected on clinical grounds. The diagnostic accuracy of contrast swallow for achalasia is approximately 95 percent. Patients who have clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of achalasia require manometric and endoscopic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis. (See

          Rheumatic disease
         </strong>
         – Gastrointestinal involvement is found in 30 to 74 percent of children with juvenile systemic sclerosis (scleroderma [JSSc]). Radiological and functional studies of the gastrointestinal tract often demonstrate abnormalities, such as gastroesophageal reflux and esophageal dysmotility, even in the absence of symptoms. Manometry and intraesophageal 24-hour pH monitoring are sensitive indicators of diminished lower esophageal sphincter tone and gastroesophageal reflux. (See

         In children with juvenile dermatomyositis, weakness of the palate and cricopharyngeal muscle may result in dysphagia, a nasal voice, tracheal aspiration, and reflux of food into the nasopharynx. Involvement of the upper esophagus can lead to dysphagia for solids and liquids. Dysphagia may also result from weakness of striated muscle in the lower third of the esophagus with esophageal reflux and esophageal dysmotility [

          Crohn disease

         – In children with Crohn disease, esophageal involvement is present histologically in 18 to 43 percent of patients and may cause dysphagia and odynophagia. This condition is primarily seen in children with advanced ileocolonic disease. The symptoms usually improve with effective management of the Crohn disease. (See

          Thyroid enlargement
         </strong>
         – Enlarging thyroid lobes usually grow outward because of their location in the anterior neck in front of the trachea and are covered only by thin muscles, subcutaneous tissue, and skin. As a result of this outward growth, even very large goiters may not compress the trachea or impinge on the great vessels lateral to the lobes. However, in patients with substantial enlargement of one lobe or asymmetric enlargement of both lobes, the trachea, esophagus, or blood vessels may be displaced or, less often, compressed. Bilateral lobar enlargement, especially if the goiter extends posterior to the trachea, may cause either compression or concentric narrowing of the trachea or compression of the esophagus or jugular veins. Dysphagia is less common than respiratory distress because of the posterior position of the esophagus relative to the trachea. (See

         – Although vascular anomalies of the aortic arch with an encircling ring around the esophagus and trachea usually present as respiratory distress and/or stridor, they may rarely present as dysphagia in children. These anatomic anomalies typically present in an infant less than one year of age. Dysphagia, vomiting, and feeding difficulty are also common. Vascular rings may be suggested by findings on plain radiographs of the chest and confirmed by CT angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, or echocardiography depending upon available technology and expertise.

For patients with a mediastinal mass on chest radiograph, ultrasonography of the chest may be useful to identify whether the mass is solid or liquid. Ultrasonography provides less information than chest CT, but can be done while the patient is upright, whereas chest CT requires supine positioning, which risks acute respiratory decompensation. In most cases, CT will ultimately be required but can be accomplished in a controlled, well-monitored setting, as determined by the appropriate specialist who will provide definitive care.

         grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10

         <strong>
          Definition
         </strong>
         – Dysphagia is defined as any difficulty or abnormality of swallowing. Dysphagia is a symptom of other conditions some of which may be life-threatening  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef73934" href="/z/d/graphic/73934.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Pain on swallowing (odynophagia) commonly accompanies dysphagia. Drooling (sialorrhea) is an indicator of potentially life-threatening upper airway or esophageal obstruction.

          Stabilization

         – The initial evaluation of children with signs and symptoms of dysphagia must begin with a rapid assessment of respiratory status to identify those who need resuscitation. Conditions that require immediate intervention include the following (see

         Once the airway is stabilized, as needed, the dysphagic patient should undergo a complete physical examination with special emphasis on the oropharynx, neck, lungs, and neurologic examination. (See

         A complete history and physical examination should suggest the diagnosis in most patients. Additional studies, including imaging in selected patients, provide confirmation of the clinical diagnosis for each condition and guide definitive management. (See
