         Turner syndrome is one of the most common chromosomal anomalies in humans and represents an important cause of short stature and primary ovarian insufficiency (POI; early menopause) in females. It is caused by loss of part or all of an X chromosome.

         The transition from pediatric care to adult care is a crucial period during the health care management of the Turner syndrome patient. Unfortunately, few girls with Turner syndrome go on to receive optimal care and surveillance as adults [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Loss to follow-up is common, leading to insufficient monitoring of comorbidities and lack of estrogen therapy or other interventions [

         As patients transition to adult providers, the communication and counseling should be tailored to the patient's maturity level and is ideally achieved by a multidisciplinary specialty team that includes adult and pediatric endocrinology, mental health, and obstetrics and gynecology providers [

          5-8
         </a>
         ]. In one retrospective cohort study of 82 patients with Turner syndrome receiving care at a multidisciplinary specialty clinic, patients were more likely to be started on estrogen therapy and have comorbidities identified than similar women receiving care at primary care facilities [

         Cardiovascular disease presents the most serious health problem for adult women with Turner syndrome and substantially contributes to the increased mortality rates for affected individuals. The morbidity and mortality are due to increased risks for cardiovascular malformations, compounded by renal abnormalities and hypertension, leading to increased risk for aortic dilatation and dissection [

         Ideally, all patients with Turner syndrome, especially those with identified cardiac anomalies, should have ongoing care with a cardiologist, preferably one who has expertise in congenital heart disease [

         Blood pressure should be monitored annually, and patients should undergo a full cardiac examination, with additional imaging studies (transthoracic echocardiography or, and often more desirable, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) to monitor valvular disease and to detect aortic root dilatation or other cardiovascular anomalies  (

         Electrocardiography with QTc measurement is done at diagnosis, and repeat assessment will depend on the presence or absence of QT prolongation or other arrhythmia. Repeat electrocardiography should also be done one to two weeks after initiation of therapy with QT-prolonging drugs. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7386.html" rel="external">
          "Management of Turner syndrome in children and adolescents", section on 'Management of specific cardiovascular abnormalities'

        <p>
         The imaging studies are done to detect cardiovascular anomalies such as coarctation of the aorta, bicuspid aortic valve, or partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR). Cardiac MRI is valuable for both screening and surveillance, especially to detect abnormalities such as a dilated aorta and elongated transverse aortic arch, as well as milder aortic coarctation and PAPVR.
        </p>
        <p>
         Repeat imaging with echocardiography and cardiac MRI is performed periodically. The frequency of imaging studies depends upon the presence or absence of existing cardiovascular abnormalities, such as coarctation of the aorta, bicuspid aortic valve, or hypertension, and the aortic size index (ASI)  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116903" href="/z/d/graphic/116903.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). For example, women without cardiovascular abnormalities on MRI at baseline and whose ASI is &lt;2 cm/m
         <sup>
          2
         </sup>
         are considered low risk. Imaging studies for these women are recommended every 5 to 10 years. Imaging studies are recommended more often for those at moderate to high risk, as outlined in the algorithm  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116903" href="/z/d/graphic/116903.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, imaging studies are recommended before attempting pregnancy and/or if hypertension develops  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106468" href="/z/d/graphic/106468.html" rel="external">
          table 3

        </p>
        <p>
         An overview of the management of coarctation of the aorta in women, including management before and during pregnancy, is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5784.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Women with Turner syndrome are also at substantially increased risk for noncongenital cardiovascular disease, which is an important contributor to their excess mortality. Therefore, all women should have close monitoring and vigorous intervention for cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, prediabetes, or diabetes mellitus. (See

         If aortic dilatation is identified on imaging, management may include beta blockers, exercise restriction, and aggressive blood pressure control, similar to management of this issue in patients with Marfan syndrome. Any complaint of
         <strong>
          chest pain should
         </strong>
         <strong>
          be evaluated urgently
         </strong>
         by a specialist because it may be a symptom of early dissection. (See

         Elective surgical repair may be an option for some patients, particularly if aortic dilation is rapidly expanding (ie, an increase of more than 0.5 cm in one year).

         Hypertension is reported in 30 to 50 percent of adult Turner syndrome patients and is associated with an increased risk of stroke and aortic dissection  (

         <em>
          .
         </em>
         Twenty-four-hour Holter monitoring may be helpful to confirm hypertension in certain patients who are particularly anxious in the clinician's office.
        </p>
        <p>
         If hypertension develops, treatment should be initiated, including lifestyle modification and weight loss if indicated. Patients should also be evaluated for causes of hypertension such as kidney disease, obstructive uropathy, and previously undetected coarctation of the aorta.

         Antimicrobial prophylaxis is not required for most Turner syndrome patients with valvular heart disease, including those with bicuspid aortic valve.

         As noted, most women with Turner syndrome are infertile because of ovarian follicular depletion, but occasional spontaneous pregnancies occur. In one cohort of 480 women with Turner syndrome, 27 women (5.6 percent) had a total of 52 spontaneous pregnancies [

Of the 52 pregnancies, there were 16 miscarriages (30.8 percent), one intrauterine fetal death related to severe growth restriction, five pregnancy terminations, and 30 live births (in 18 women). These pregnancies are associated with a higher prevalence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including preeclampsia and eclampsia.

Ten women had a known cardiac defect before pregnancy, although only 49 percent had a prepregnancy cardiac evaluation within two years before pregnancy and only 29 percent had an echocardiogram or cardiac MRI during pregnancy. Potentially life-threatening complications occurred in four patients (3.3 percent). In spite of suboptimal preconception evaluation and screening, no maternal deaths were reported. The rate of multiple gestations in this study was lower than what is typically reported in oocyte donation studies of women without Turner syndrome; single embryo transfer is mandatory with Turner syndrome, but not with other patients.

         Turner syndrome is one of the most common chromosomal anomalies in humans and represents an important cause of short stature and primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) in females. It is caused by loss of part or all of an X chromosome. (See

         Cardiovascular disease presents the most serious health problem for women with Turner syndrome and substantially contributes to the increased mortality rates for affected individuals. The morbidity and mortality are due to increased risks for cardiovascular malformations, compounded by renal abnormalities and hypertension, leading to increased risk for aortic dilatation and dissection. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Cardiovascular health'

         Ideally, all patients with Turner syndrome (especially those with identified cardiac anomalies) should have ongoing care with a cardiologist, preferably one who has expertise in congenital heart disease.

         Imaging with transthoracic echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is performed periodically. The frequency of imaging studies depends upon the presence or absence of existing cardiovascular abnormalities, such as coarctation of the aorta, bicuspid aortic valve, or hypertension, and the aortic size index (ASI)  (

         Women with Turner syndrome have POI, also known as premature ovarian failure. Unless there is an absolute contraindication, we suggest estradiol-progestin therapy to reduce the risk of osteoporosis and urogenital atrophy and to maintain sexual health (

          Grade 2B

         ). We suggest that these women continue therapy until the average age of menopause (ie, approximately 50 or 51 years) (

          Grade 2B

         Most women with Turner syndrome are infertile but can achieve fertility with in vitro fertilization (IVF) with donor oocytes. However, there are serious cardiovascular risks during and after pregnancy, the most important of which is the risk of aortic dissection. Cardiovascular evaluation is essential before considering pregnancy  (

         In addition to monitoring for cardiovascular complications, patients with Turner syndrome should have ongoing monitoring for other important health issues  (
