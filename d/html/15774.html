It is commonly associated with impairments in social and occupational functioning [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. It is among the most disabling and economically catastrophic medical disorders, ranked by the World Health Organization as one of the top 10 illnesses contributing to the global burden of disease [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>Antipsychotic medications are first-line treatment for schizophrenia. They have been shown in clinical trials to be effective in reducing symptoms and behaviors associated with the disorder. However, most patients with schizophrenia experience disabling impairment even after benefiting from antipsychotics, including positive and negative symptoms, cognitive deficits, poor social functioning, and episodes of acute symptomatic relapse. Empirically validated psychosocial interventions, added to antipsychotic medication, target one or more of these deficit areas.</p><p>This topic addresses psychosocial interventions for schizophrenia. Psychosocial interventions for severe mental illness (not limited to schizophrenia), including assertive community treatment and supported employment, are discussed separately. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, clinical manifestations, course, diagnosis and pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia are also discussed separately. Common comorbid presentations of schizophrenia are also discussed separately.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14804.html" rel="external">"Schizophrenia in adults: Epidemiology and pathogenesis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6962.html" rel="external">"Schizophrenia in adults: Clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14791.html" rel="external">"Depression in schizophrenia"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15259.html" rel="external">"Anxiety in schizophrenia"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7798.html" rel="external">"Co-occurring schizophrenia and substance use disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14805.html" rel="external">"Schizophrenia in adults: Maintenance therapy and side effect management"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15250.html" rel="external">"Schizophrenia in adults: Pharmacotherapy with long-acting injectable antipsychotic medication"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H19410373"><span class="h1">TYPES OF PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Following treatment with antipsychotic medication, which is often only partially effective, most individuals with schizophrenia would benefit from systematic rehabilitation. This may include family interventions, social skills training, and/or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which are discussed in this topic, as well as assertive community treatment and supported employment, which are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/105343.html" rel="external">"Assertive community treatment for patients with severe mental illness"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/120584.html" rel="external">"Supported employment for patients with severe mental illness"</a>.)</p><p>Psychosocial interventions are indicated for patients with schizophrenia and the characteristics that follow as an adjunct to antipsychotic medication:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Family psychoeducational intervention</strong> – For patients who have had a recent psychotic relapse and have significant ongoing contact with family members, we recommend psychoeducational intervention with the patient and family members. (See <a class="local">'Family-based Interventions'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Social skills training</strong> – For individuals with schizophrenia who have deficits in skills needed for everyday activities, we recommend social skills training. (See <a class="local">'Social skills training'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>CBT</strong> – For individuals who experience persistent delusions or hallucinations despite adequate trials of antipsychotic medication, we recommend treatment with CBT. (See <a class="local">'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Despite evidence of their effectiveness from randomized trials, the availability of these interventions varies widely, even in developed countries, as does the availability of clinicians trained to provide them.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13622397"><span class="h1">FAMILY-BASED INTERVENTIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goals of a family intervention for schizophrenia are to:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Prevent relapse</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Promote medication adherence</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Promote a supportive family environment</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Reduce distress among family members</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Develop an appropriate level of patient autonomy</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13622218"><span class="h2">Theoretical foundation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The level of continuous stress between patients with schizophrenia and their environment has been found to be a robust predictor of relapse [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. This finding began with the study of "expressed emotion" (EE), an empirically developed concept characterizing families who are rated highly on hostile, critical or over-involved comments. Patients with schizophrenia who had extensive face-to-face contact with "high EE" family members have been found to have a higher risk of relapse, compared with patients with low-EE families, following hospitalization with effective pharmacotherapy. The relationship between high EE and relapse is not specific to schizophrenia, but has been observed in other chronic psychiatric and nonpsychiatric illnesses [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13622225"><span class="h2">Indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with schizophrenia who have had a recent psychotic relapse and have significant ongoing contact with family members, including relatives and significant others, we recommend the patient and family members receive a family intervention for six to nine months as augmentation to treatment with antipsychotic medication.</p><p>For patients with schizophrenia who have experienced multiple psychotic relapses and reside in a particularly stressful family environment, a more intensive problem-solving family therapy may be helpful [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], although the only controlled trial of the intervention was negative.

Patients and family members receive education about the nature, course, and treatment of schizophrenia [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], including the following objectives:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Present schizophrenia as a brain disorder with genetic, perinatal, and environmental risk factors. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14804.html" rel="external">"Schizophrenia in adults: Epidemiology and pathogenesis", section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Correct the erroneous notion that poor parenting causes schizophrenia.

(See <a class="local">'Social skills training'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Explain that delusions, talking to oneself, and other dramatic manifestations of schizophrenia, which a family member might see as "craziness," are, in fact, distressing symptoms of the disorder that are likely to improve with treatment. (See <a class="local">'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/14805.html" rel="external">"Schizophrenia in adults: Maintenance therapy and side effect management"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Teach how to recognize early warning signs of relapse and develop a plan in collaboration with the patient and family members for what to do when signs become apparent.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Explain the importance of medication adherence. Emphasize that cognitively impaired individuals may present with overt poor-compliance while patients with limited insight may have covert compliance issues.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Provide education about the high comorbidity of substance use disorder.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Foster optimism and actively discourage the development of nihilism. Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder that is not limited to a uniform outcome of progressive deterioration. For the majority of patients, integrated, comprehensive treatment, including pharmacologic and psychosocial interventions, provided early in the illness can significantly improve functioning and as many as 20 percent can be expected to have a full recovery [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6962.html" rel="external">"Schizophrenia in adults: Clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis", section on 'Course of illness'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H115334322"><span class="h3">Problem-solving family therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with multiple relapses of schizophrenia who reside in a particularly stressful family environment, a more intensive, problem-solving family therapy has been developed [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. Components of this approach include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Identify critical, hostile, and over-involved parent-patient interactions, explaining that these interactions are associated with worse outcomes, but taking care to avoid misunderstandings that they are a cause of the disorder.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Help families and patients to avoid adverse interactions. An example is reframing a family member's critical assessment of a patient who will not clean up after themselves, from "passivity" or "laziness" to "avolition" (ie, a lack of motivation for goal directed behavior), a common symptom of schizophrenia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assign "homework," for example, to encourage the patient to implement simple tasks, while encouraging parents to refrain from being critical or prematurely involved.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Stressful family dynamics can often be best addressed by finding outside rehabilitative activities or supported employment for the patient. (See <a class="local">'Social skills training'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/120584.html" rel="external">"Supported employment for patients with severe mental illness"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An isolated and distressed parent or caregiver can be encouraged to develop hobbies outside of the house without concern that they need to be monitoring the patient at home. This can support the development of a schedule for training for the patient in more independent living skills. A minority of patients who need constant supervision due to safety issues may require attendance at a specialized daycare program.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H115334380"><span class="h2">Administration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A family psychosocial intervention for schizophrenia is typically provided in monthly sessions, which should be continued for six to nine months [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. These sessions may be for an individual family or for groups of families. They should be in addition to the patient's individual visits with a psychiatrist and other clinicians.</p><p>Problem-solving therapy is usually more intensive than a typical family intervention, requiring weekly or biweekly visits for the initial two to three months, sometimes in the home [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. After this period, typically, a monthly schedule of more supportive maintenance sessions can be adopted.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13622239"><span class="h2">Efficacy</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1343211"><span class="h3">Family intervention</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A meta-analysis of 2981 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in 32 randomized trials found that a family intervention of at least five sessions reduced the frequency of relapse compared with a control condition (relative risk 0.55, CI 0.5-0.6; number need to treat = 7) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Reductions were also seen in hospital admissions and medication nonadherence. There is less support from clinical trials for shorter family interventions and family interventions for stable individuals who had not had a recent exacerbation of illness.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1343301"><span class="h3">Problem-solving family therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the largest randomized trial of problem-solving family therapy for individuals with chronic schizophrenia, 313 patients were assigned to two years of treatment with one of three antipsychotic dosing strategies and either a problem-solving family therapy or a monthly family psychoeducational group. [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. At treatment end, differences between family intervention treatment groups were not seen.</p><p>In the longest and largest study in first-episode schizophrenia, subjects were randomly assigned to five years of treatment with either sustained specialist treatment (n = 65; pharmacotherapy plus individual problem-solving), sustained specialist treatment plus additional parent groups focused on psychoeducation and problem-solving (n = 68), or treatment as usual (n = 65; pharmacotherapy plus general support) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Primary outcomes (eg, rate of relapse) and secondary outcomes (eg, suicide or level of social functioning) were similar between groups. Rates of relapse were low (50 percent) after five years, suggesting that treatment as usual was quite effective. In our clinical experience, we have found that problem-solving family therapy prevents rehospitalization in patients with multiple relapses of schizophrenia who reside in a particularly stressful family environment.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13622373"><span class="h1">SOCIAL SKILLS TRAINING</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Deficits in areas such as social interactions and independent living skills often interfere with the ability of people with schizophrenia to perform everyday activities and to function in the community. As examples, individuals may have difficulties with personal care, cooking, laundry, paying bills, use of public transportation, leisure activities, developing social networks, and dating.</p><p>Deficits in these skills are related to the negative symptoms (or "deficit symptoms") of schizophrenia. Negative symptoms rarely respond to pharmacotherapy alone [<a href="#rid12">12</a>], but have been found to respond to social skills training as augmentation of antipsychotic medications [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>Social skills training for individuals with schizophrenia consists of behavioral training focused on specific situations, problems, and activities. The ultimate goal of this training is the generalization of learned skills to community-based activities with improved functioning.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13622302"><span class="h2">Theoretical foundation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Two programs stemming from distinct conceptual models have been developed to address social skills deficits of people with schizophrenia, including:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Basic social skills training utilizes principles from learning theory to improve social functioning by working with patients to remediate problems in activities of daily living, leisure, relationships, or employment [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The social problem-solving model focuses on improving impairments in information processing that are assumed to be the cause of deficits in social skills [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13622309"><span class="h2">Indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We recommend that individuals with schizophrenia who have deficits in skills needed for everyday activities receive social skills training. If there is a choice among social skills training models available, a reasonable approach is to start with the basic model, and if the patient does not experience an adequate response, advance to the more complex problem-solving intervention. Selection may be constrained by the local availability of only one model.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13622316"><span class="h2">Intervention</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are two forms of social skills training: the basic model and the social problem-solving model. Although the field has evolved to more integrated, manualized, step-by-step guides [<a href="#rid16">16</a>], we briefly describe both models to illustrate the evolution of this therapeutic approach.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3203416"><span class="h3">Basic model</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the basic model, complex social repertoires (such as conversation with a peer) are broken down into simpler steps, which can be taught more effectively, practiced in role playing exercises, and applied in natural settings.</p><p>While the content of skills training programs may vary with the program or with the needs of individual patients, most include an emphasis on interpersonal skills [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. Basic training techniques include behaviorally based instruction, role modeling, rehearsal, corrective feedback, and positive reinforcement. Typical steps include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Initial training may start with conversation between therapist and patient with immediate feedback to the patient on specific, problematic interpersonal behaviors.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The conversation may be videotaped; the therapist would then review the tape with the patient, pointing out problematic behaviors and suggesting desired alternatives.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>After several sessions with the same therapist, the patient may be encouraged to interact with other staff and patients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Eventually these skills may be practiced in the patient's own environment to implement the learned skills more generally. Programs that start as clinic-based can be adapted to targeted areas such as the patient's work place and social settings.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>As examples:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A person with affective flattening, poverty of speech, and poor social interaction is encouraged to role play with the therapist. They start a conversation and the therapist provides feedback to foster increased eye-contact, and appropriate hand gesticulation, nodding, and asking follow-up questions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A paranoid person, with intense responses to others and intimidating eye contact, is encouraged to look down at times, pause before responding, and lower their voice.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3203426"><span class="h3">Social problem-solving model</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The social problem-solving model targets behavioral or symptom domains needing changes.

(See <a class="local">'Social skills training'</a> above.)</p><p>CBT is used to treat medication-resistant psychosis in patients with schizophrenia. Its principal aims are to reduce the intensity of delusions and hallucinations (and related distress) and to promote active participation of the individuals in reducing their risk of relapse and their social disability. Other target symptoms of CBT include the patient's preoccupation with the delusions and hallucinations, and the impact of symptoms on their behavior.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H633970894"><span class="h2">Theoretical foundation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CBT for schizophrenia presumes that a patient with the disorder can, with the help of a therapist, engage in a logical examination of maladaptive aspects of their symptoms. Despite active psychosis, most patients with schizophrenia have the verbal and cognitive capacities to participate in CBT. CBT begins with the patient's interpretation of symptoms, from which the patient and therapist work collaboratively to develop more rational and adaptive behaviors.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H633970901"><span class="h2">Indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>People with schizophrenia often have some degree of persistent psychosis even when pharmacotherapy has been optimized.

This initial framework allows the therapist to know the language and context the individual uses to describe their symptoms.</p><p>Focused work can then begin on specific delusions and hallucinations by identifying them and collaboratively reviewing with the patient the presence or absence of evidence supporting their validity. This reality testing is followed by generating alternative responses to the delusions or hallucinations. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A patient who reports hearing a derogatory voice telling her that she is worthless can be encouraged to look to see if someone is speaking, or to ask a companion if they hear anything. The patient and clinician then review the findings.

In the prior example, this may involve learning to live with an implanted device or learning to control its signaling.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H633970915"><span class="h2">Administration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CBT can be provided in either an individual or group format.

Additionally, greater improvements were noted for the CBT group as compared with control in positive symptoms, negative symptoms, global psychopathology, performance of independent functions and prosocial activities.</p><p></p><p>However, not all trials report clear differences between treatment with CBT plus usual treatment versus usual treatment only. For example:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a review of two trials including 184 subjects with psychosis (mainly schizophrenia) and violence, CBT plus standard care, as compared with standard care appeared to result in little difference in the frequency of physical violence at treatment end (odds ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.53-2.00) or follow-up (relative risk 0.86, 95% CI 0.44-1.68) [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. However, the certainty of the evidence in this review was noted to be very low and the conclusion was that more evidence is needed to firmly establish the effects.</p><p></p><p>The efficacy of CBT for schizophrenia has not been determined in patients with recent-onset schizophrenia or those experiencing an acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms.

By increasing awareness of cognitive biases (eg, jumping to conclusions, overconfidence in judgments), it aims to plant doubt into delusional beliefs. MCT involves a brief intervention (8 to 10 modules) available for either individual or group format. The treatment format is accessible for less experienced facilitators thus increasing its availability in communities.</p><p>In a meta-analysis including 40 trials and 1816 participants, individuals with schizophrenia spectrum and related psychotic disorders were treated with MCT for psychosis [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Treatment with MCT led to improvements in the following symptoms: a large effect size on delusions (g = 0.69, 95% CI 0.45-0.93), moderate effects on positive symptoms (g = 0.5, 95% CI 0.34-0.67) and functioning (g = 0.41, 95% CI 0.12-0.69), and small effects on hallucinations (g = 0.26, 95% CI 0.11-0.4) and negative symptoms (g = 0.23, 95% CI 0.1-0.37). These improvements were maintained for up to one year, indicating that MCT may merit further consideration as part of the standard treatment for individuals with persistent delusions.</p><p>An analysis of data from follow-up assessment after a clinical trial suggests that the effects of CBT persisted at least three years. The trial randomly assigned 150 patients with schizophrenia to receive MCT or neuropsychological training. After six months, the CBT group reported reduced delusional thinking [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].

Four hundred and four patients with a first-psychotic episode were randomly assigned to receive usual care or treatment with evidence-based pharmacotherapy, family education about illness management, resilience-focused individual therapy, and supported employment and education. After two years of treatment, patients in the multimodal group had greater improvements in quality of life, participation in work and school, and psychotic symptoms compared with patients receiving usual care.</p><p>Such team-based, multimodal programs can be easier to implement in countries with a national health care system, due to their integrated staffing, financing, and delivery of care.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2409188925"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
