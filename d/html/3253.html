         Assessment of the gynecologic history and the pelvic examination is part of the assessment of female patients in many clinical contexts. Clinician familiarity with the gynecologic evaluation can help reduce anxiety for both patients and health care professionals [

         The gynecologic history and physical examination in adult females are reviewed here. The initial assessment of pregnant patients, evaluation of breast complaints, general approaches to patient interviewing as well as pelvic examination in children are discussed separately. (See

         Individual patients vary tremendously in their knowledge of, and comfort with, their own bodies. While some may be quite open in disclosing their sexual, reproductive, and genital concerns, others will find such discussions embarrassing or socially inappropriate. Thus, it is essential that providers maintain a sensitive and nonjudgmental approach during this encounter.
        </p>
        <p>
         The history should be obtained in a relaxed and private setting, and before the patient is asked to disrobe. The patient should be interviewed alone under most circumstances, unless there is a hearing or language barrier. Questioning should proceed from very straightforward, objective information to more delicate issues. The provider should evaluate and respond to the patient's comfort level and make every effort to remain supportive.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is particularly important to avoid making assumptions about a patient's background; as an example, that a patient is sexually active or is heterosexual.
        </p>
        <p>
         One should begin the history with an open-ended question that will elicit the patient's gynecologic concerns. Patients should be encouraged to describe the situation in their own words and without frequent interruptions. Maintaining eye contact, nodding, and brief clarification of important points convey the provider's attention to the patient's issues. The provider can then ask questions to proceed with the evaluation.

         Specific questions are essential in order to obtain accurate information. As an example, some patients may not include miscarriages or abortions when asked about past pregnancies; therefore, the provider should specifically inquire about these events. Some patients will equate undergoing a pelvic examination with having a Pap test, and erroneously state that this test was recently performed [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Other patients may make inaccurate assumptions about whether their ovaries or cervix were removed with a hysterectomy. Therefore, written records of cervical cytology testing results, operative procedures, and pathology results should be obtained whenever possible.

        <p>
         A comprehensive gynecologic history includes a complete summary of the patient's medical, surgical, social, and family history. A review of symptoms is taken that focuses on the genitourinary areas  (

         The most common gynecologic concerns relate to vaginal discharge, abnormal bleeding, pelvic pain, urinary problems, sexual dysfunction, and infertility. When a patient identifies one of these issues, detailed questioning can guide further evaluation and diagnosis.

         Many reproductive-age patients have daily vaginal discharge. Normal vaginal discharge is composed of mucoid endocervical secretions in combination with desquamated vaginal wall epithelium and normal bacteria. Physiologic discharge is typically clear, white, or light yellow in color. The volume of discharge varies considerably among patients and timing in the menstrual cycle. For patients who present with vaginal discharge, questions should be asked regarding the onset, duration, frequency, color, consistency, volume, and odor of the flow. Discharge that is malodorous, pruritic, copious, purulent, bloody, or accompanied by fever requires investigation. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5477.html" rel="external">

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Patients commonly present with a complaint of "vaginal bleeding." A complaint of vaginal bleeding most often represents uterine bleeding, but the source may be any part of the genital tract, or the urinary or gastrointestinal tracts  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef74527" href="/z/d/graphic/74527.html" rel="external">
          table 4
         </a>
         ). Pregnancy should be excluded in any patient of reproductive age with abnormal genital tract bleeding. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5440.html" rel="external">
          "Causes of female genital tract bleeding"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Pertinent data are the onset of a change in bleeding, and the amount, duration, and frequency of bleeding  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69390" href="/z/d/graphic/69390.html" rel="external">
          table 5
         </a>
         ). In patients of reproductive age or in the menopausal transition, the use of a menstrual chart or electronic tracking application to document bleeding patterns is helpful in determining whether the changes are sufficiently abnormal to justify investigation  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76376" href="/z/d/graphic/76376.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Irregular bleeding occurs commonly during the menopausal transition and may be a symptom of serious underlying pathology.
        </p>
        <p>
         Uterine bleeding is abnormal when it is associated with a change in the patient's normal menstrual pattern or it occurs after menopause. The average menstrual cycle lasts up to seven days and the amount of menstrual blood loss is 35 to 40 mL per cycle, but the range is wide [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,4
         </a>
         ]. Historically, heavy menstrual bleeding has been defined as menstrual blood loss greater than 80 mL [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ]. As blood volume is difficult to measure, heavy menstrual bleeding is defined as "excessive menstrual blood loss which interferes with a woman's physical, social, emotional, and/or material quality of life" [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5,6
         </a>
         ]. Prolonged menses are defined as longer than seven to nine days, depending on the patient's age [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8
         </a>
         ]. Given the difficulty in quantifying actual blood loss, questions should focus on a significant change from baseline, bleeding at abnormal times during the cycle (intermenstrual or postcoital), and symptoms of anemia (such as new significant fatigue, orthostasis, or palpitations). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3263.html" rel="external">
          "Abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-age patients: Terminology, evaluation, and approach to diagnosis"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Menopause is defined by 12 months of amenorrhea after the final menstrual period. Postmenopausal bleeding refers to any uterine bleeding in a menopausal patient, though some light bleeding may occur when initiating or discontinuing a hormone replacement regimen. While menopause may occur in some patients in their 40s, other causes of amenorrhea and abnormal uterine bleeding should be considered, particularly for patients in their early 40s. While a change in the menstrual pattern is expected in the months or years prior to menopause, an increase in the amount or duration of bleeding during this time should be treated as pathologic and evaluated.

         The characterization of pelvic pain should include the time of onset, duration, location, quality, and severity. The relationship of the pain to menstruation, physical activity, or sexual activity and alleviation of the pain with analgesics, hormonal contraceptives, or position change are useful components of the pain history. For example, pelvic pain provoked by activity or that radiates to the hips or back may reflect pelvic floor dysfunction. (See

        <p>
         Associated gastrointestinal or urinary symptoms could point to a nongynecologic source of the pain. However, ovarian torsion is often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. (See

         Urinary incontinence occurs among patients of all ages and requires evaluation when the involuntary loss of urine is bothersome. Historical factors, such as leakage of urine with physical activity (exercise, lifting, coughing, sneezing) versus an overwhelming urge to void with leakage of urine before reaching a toilet, can help to differentiate stress incontinence from detrusor instability. A careful voiding and intake history will help the clinician determine the underlying cause. (See

        <p>
         Patients with pelvic organ prolapse may complain of a vaginal bulge, vaginal pressure, or the need to place a finger in the vagina to void or defecate. Such symptoms should be evaluated further with physical examination. It is important to ask about urinary and fecal incontinence as well as sexual dysfunction when evaluating prolapse symptoms and making treatment decisions. (See

         Many sexual problems result from and/or cause reproductive dysfunction and gynecologic problems. Sexual issues include prevention of sexually transmitted infections, contraception, sexual dysfunction (pain or difficult arousal or orgasm), and prevention and management of sexual assault.
        </p>

         Many patients are reluctant to express concerns regarding these matters but welcome the opportunity to discuss them when approached in an interested and compassionate manner. The importance of an assessment of sexual function was demonstrated in a questionnaire study of over 1000 females seen for a primary care visit; 98 percent reported one or more sexual concerns, but only 18 percent of clinicians asked about sexual health [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Patients who discussed their sexual concerns with their clinician found the discussion helpful. In another study, among 3000 patients with a sexual problem that caused personal distress, only 6 percent of those who sought medical advice scheduled a visit specifically for a sexual problem, and approximately 80 percent of the time, the patient, rather than the physician, initiated the conversation [
         <a href="#rid10">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to questions regarding basic gynecologic health, contraception and safe sex practices, all patients should be asked an open-ended question, such as: do you have any sexual concerns? This question also provides an opportunity to discuss sexual issues and pertinent sexual history.

         A brief set of screening questions is adequate to determine whether a problem exists that requires further inquiry:

         Many patients become very concerned when they have not conceived a pregnancy after a few months of trying, while others have had years of unprotected, regular intercourse without recognizing that an underlying medical problem may exist. Infertility is defined as failure of a couple to conceive after 12 months of regular intercourse without use of contraception in females less than 35 years of age, and after six months of regular intercourse without use of contraception in females 35 years and older [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Before proceeding with an infertility evaluation, the provider should confirm that the couple is having regular, frequent intercourse during the middle of the menstrual cycle. Once the diagnosis is established, the infertility history should focus on three factors: ovulation, tubal and uterine problems, and male factors  (

         The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends a first reproductive health visit between the ages of 13 and 15 years [

          12,13

         ]. The scope of the examination in adolescents depends upon the individual needs of the patient. A reproductive health visit may be limited to age-appropriate education regarding reproductive health matters. A pelvic examination is not included unless indicated due to symptoms or specific patient concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to a first pelvic examination, the components and benefits of the examination should be explained. Every effort should be made to communicate with and reassure the patient, and the examination should be stopped if the patient is too anxious or uncomfortable. Education regarding the pelvic examination includes potential evaluation for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and cervical cancer screening. Many patients erroneously equate a speculum examination with a Pap test and may incorrectly think that they have been screened for cervical cancer.

         Traditionally, an annual pelvic examination combined with a Pap test, often with screening for STIs, was standard practice in all adult females. In current practice, the goals and outcomes of a routine annual pelvic examination have been questioned [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14,15

         The pelvic examination had been required historically as a prerequisite to obtain hormonal contraceptives. However, this is no longer part of current practice with the exception of intrauterine devices [

         The question of the necessity of routine pelvic examination is part of a larger trend away from routine annual physical examinations. In addition, cervical cancer screening guidelines have changed, and many patients require screening only every three to five years. Also, some STI screening may be performed with methods that do not require a pelvic examination. (See

         In 2018, ACOG discontinued the recommendation for an annual routine pelvic examination and advised shared decision-making with the patient. They recommended that obstetrician-gynecologists and other gynecologic care providers counsel asymptomatic, nonpregnant patients about the benefits, harms, and lack of data regarding routine pelvic examinations. The patient and gynecologic care provider should then decide together if an examination will be performed [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. They also advised that, regardless of whether a pelvic examination is performed, patients should see their obstetrician-gynecologist at least once a year for well-woman care [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. We acknowledge that high-quality care can be provided by a variety of health care professionals with an interest in female health, including family practice and primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and certified nurse-midwives. Ultimately, a patient should have the opportunity to form a comfortable relationship with the provider of their choice.

          22
         </a>
         ]. Also, clinician factors have not been evaluated (specialty, frequency, and comfort level with performing pelvic examination). Patients who present to a gynecologist may differ from those who present to another clinician in terms of underlying pathology and goals and expectations of the visit. The varying guidelines from the USPSTF, ACP, and ACOG may reflect these differences.

        <p>
         Patients and clinicians should engage in shared decision-making regarding pelvic examination. Patients should be informed if a pelvic examination is recommended, and the examination should not be performed if a patient declines.

         For patients who are anxious or uncomfortable before or during a pelvic examination, in our experience, modifications of pelvic examination technique (eg, varying the order of the steps of the examination, use of a single finger for bimanual examination rather than two, use of a narrow Pederson or pediatric speculum) and clinician explanation and reassurance are helpful.

         There is no routine screening method for vulvar cancer and no data regarding use of pelvic examinations for screening. However, periodic examinations may provide some benefit. In our clinical experience, vulvar precancer and cancer are often asymptomatic and may be detected only on routine pelvic examination. This is particularly true for older patients (average age at diagnosis is 65 years), who may be less likely to notice a vulvar lesion or bring it to medical attention. Vulvar cancer is more likely to be diagnosed at an advanced stage in older patients [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28,29
         </a>
         ]. There is no evidence that vulvar cancer screening should be performed more frequently than cervical cancer screening in asymptomatic patients with no history of vulvar disease, though it is also not clear that vulvar cancer screening should stop at age 65. Because there is no HPV screening test for the vulva and because some vulvar cancers are not HPV-related, vulvar cancer screening may need to continue after cervical cancer screening is discontinued. In our practice, we perform a careful inspection of the vulva each time that a patient presents for cervical cancer screening or for a pelvic examination for another indication. Any suspicious lesion should be biopsied. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3237.html" rel="external">

         In our practice, we perform a pelvic examination in all symptomatic patients. This requires taking a detailed history to elicit any new, unusual, or bothersome symptoms. A benefit of routine pelvic examination is that many patients have difficulty expressing concerns or symptoms related to their genital tract or sexual function. A pelvic mass, tenderness, or discharge may be noted on examination in patients who did not notice or were reluctant to discuss pelvic issues.

         In asymptomatic patients, in addition to cervical cancer and STI screening, we recommend a pelvic examination in the following situations:

         It would be reasonable to stop performing pelvic examinations when a patient's age or other health issues reach a point where the patient would not choose to intervene on conditions detected during the routine examination, particularly if the patient is discontinuing other routine health care maintenance assessments. This conclusion can be documented after a process of shared and ongoing communication and decision-making between the patient and clinician.

          —
         </span>
         Some patients have had difficult experiences with sexual abuse or assault or with prior pelvic examinations and may feel substantial anxiety regarding the examination. For such patients, the examination may be nearly unbearable, and may deter the patient from seeking appropriate health care. Such anxiety may manifest as tense and withdrawn body language, extreme discomfort with the examination, or refusal to have an examination at all.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is widely recognized that a pelvic examination may be uncomfortable. In its summary of studies reporting on over 4000 patients, the ACP reported that approximately 35 percent may experience pain, discomfort, fear, embarrassment, or anxiety during a pelvic examination [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. In one study, approximately 1000 patients in a variety of clinical settings were asked to explain the parts of the examination that were uncomfortable, the reasons for the discomfort, and to suggest ways the provider could have improved the process [
         <a href="#rid37">
          37
         </a>
         ]. Physical discomfort (37 percent), embarrassment (20 percent), disliking the attitude of the examiner (7 percent), and experiencing problems during a previous examination (5 percent) were the major concerns reported. Techniques suggested to improve the examination process included explaining each step of the examination in advance, providing more information about the reproductive organs, warming the instruments, and increased gentleness. Other surveys have recommended that providers make an effort to maintain eye contact during the examination and give the patient choices (eg, asking permission prior to placing the speculum or performing a bimanual examination) where possible [
         <a href="#rid38">
          38,39
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         At first recognition of the patient's discomfort, the provider should stop the physical examination and address the patient's concerns. In some patients, performing the bimanual examination with one finger before the speculum examination is helpful in decreasing anxiety. In addition, a narrow speculum (narrow Pederson, Huffman, or pediatric) can be used to decrease discomfort.
        </p>
        <p>
         If it becomes clear that the patient has been abused or is suffering from severe anxiety, the provider may need to delay the examination in order to elicit help from a therapist or social worker. Often by discussing the examination ahead of time and agreeing to stop uncomfortable procedures at the patient's request, the provider can give the patient some control over the situation, which may alleviate some anxiety regarding the examination. Importantly, the provider should never proceed in the setting of patient refusal and should abort an examination when asked to do so, no matter how medically necessary the provider perceives the examination.

         The pelvic examination is traditionally performed in the dorsal lithotomy position in order to allow optimal exposure of the internal and external genitalia and palpation of the pelvis. Unfortunately, laying the patient in a horizontal position does not allow eye contact between the provider and patient and may increase the patient's sense of vulnerability. Raising the patient's head to allow eye contact may be particularly important for patients who are hard of hearing. The horizontal position may also be physically difficult for patients with cardiorespiratory or musculoskeletal limitations. Elevating the head of the table 30 to 45 degrees makes it easier for the patient to relax, thereby facilitating bimanual examination.

Comprehensive examination also includes evaluation of some components of the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts, including the urethra, anus, and rectum.

         The vagina is first inspected using a speculum of appropriate size, lubricated with warm water or a water-soluble lubricant. Some lubricants may interfere with sampling for cervical cytology, and lubricants containing carbomers or carbopol polymers should be avoided [

         Atraumatic insertion is aided by assisting muscle relaxation at the opening of the vagina. This may be accomplished by advising patients to relax their legs to the sides and also by inserting a finger into the distal vagina and gently applying downward pressure. The speculum is then inserted and downward pressure applied. The speculum is advanced in a direction free of resistance and opened as the apex of the vagina is reached.

         Vaginal lesions, anomalies, or atrophic mucosa are noted. If abnormal discharge is identified, the volume, color, consistency, and odor should be noted and a sample taken with a cotton swab. The pH of physiologic vaginal discharge is less than 4.5; an elevated pH may be due to infection (eg, bacterial vaginosis) or exogenous substances (eg, semen), and may be normally observed in menopausal patients.

         The degree of vaginal wall relaxation and uterine prolapse is evaluated, if indicated, by removing the top blade of the speculum and using the posterior blade as a retractor. It is helpful to ask the patient to bear down to determine the degree of uterovaginal descensus. Additional testing can be performed in patients with complaints of urinary incontinence. (See

         The index and middle fingers of the dominant hand are normally used to examine the vagina, cervix, uterus, and pelvic floor, although some providers find that switching hands during the examination facilitates evaluation of the adnexa. Only a single finger can be inserted comfortably in patients with a narrow introitus. The abdominal hand should be used to sweep the pelvic organs downward, while the vaginal hand is simultaneously elevating them.

         The uterus is assessed for size, shape, symmetry, mobility, position, and consistency. The uterine size and consistency vary according to reproductive status (parity, menopausal status  (

         The adnexal areas are checked for the presence of appropriately sized, mobile ovaries (eg, approximately 2 by 3 cm), which are normally somewhat tender. Palpable ovaries in postmenopausal patients are not a "normal" finding (detectable in approximately 30 percent of postmenopausal patients [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42,43
         </a>
         ]) and require investigation, although most are associated with benign or no disease [

          44-49
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The ability to palpate the ovaries during a clinical examination in the office depends upon several factors, including the patient's body habitus, the examiner's experience, the time taken to perform the examination, and the presence of other pelvic abnormalities. Ovaries can be difficult to palpate, even by experienced clinicians under ideal circumstances. In one series in which bimanual examination was performed under anesthesia before various gynecologic surgery procedures, ovaries were detected in 30 percent of patients ≥55 years of age versus 51 percent of patients under 55 years of age, in 9 percent of patients weighing over 200 pounds versus 55 percent of patients weighing under 200 pounds, and in 12 percent of patients with a uterine weight over 200 g versus 51 percent of patients with a uterine weight under 200 g [
         <a href="#rid42">
          42
         </a>
         ]. Overall, the bimanual examination has a sensitivity of less than 60 percent, whether for detecting adnexal masses in general or for distinguishing benign from malignant masses [

        </p>
        <p>
         When adnexal masses are detected, they should be described as to location, size, consistency, mobility, and degree of tenderness. (See

         Another potential component of the gynecologic assessment is the rectovaginal examination. This allows optimal palpation of the posterior cul-de-sac and uterosacral ligaments, as well as the uterus and adnexa. Studies of rectovaginal examinations under anesthesia show poor sensitivity in detecting adnexal masses and uterosacral and posterior cul-de-sac disease [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51,52

         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         If a rectovaginal examination is performed, anorectal findings should be documented (eg, hemorrhoids, rectal mass). If indicated, stool on the examining glove can be tested for occult blood. However, a single sample does not suffice for colorectal cancer screening; screening is better accomplished by colonoscopy or, less preferably, home collection of stool samples. Screening for colorectal cancer is discussed in detail separately. (See

        </p>
        <p>
         When performing the rectovaginal examination, using a lubricated examining glove and asking the patient to strain against the examiner's finger will usually allow the sphincter to relax and decrease discomfort. The same finger should not be used to examine both the vagina and rectum to avoid transmission of HPV [

         The indications for pelvic examination are the same for patients who have undergone hysterectomy as for other patients. The exception to this is that most patients who have undergone total hysterectomy (the cervix has been removed) do not require Pap tests. In the past, many clinicians performed vaginal Pap tests in this patient population. However, the risk of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN) or vaginal cancer is extremely low in patients who have undergone total hysterectomy for benign disease (excluding cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2,3) and, for this reason, screening guidelines in the United States from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the American Cancer Society (ACS), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) concur that these patients do not need posthysterectomy vaginal cytology. Vaginal cancer screening is advisable in patients with risk factors for vaginal cancer. (See

         ACOG guidelines state that some patients may choose to stop having pelvic examinations after total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, if asymptomatic and if there are no other factors that increase the risk of pelvic disease [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. We recommend ongoing periodic external genital examinations in this situation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'When to discontinue examinations'

         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
         Examination of patients following hysterectomy or other gynecologic surgery (eg, oophorectomy) is generally the same as for other patients, but the examination and documentation of the findings should reflect the patient's current anatomy. As an example, in a patient who has undergone a total hysterectomy, the examiner should note that the cervix is surgically absent and record the condition of the vaginal cuff (eg, well-healed). In some cases, patients are not certain of the details of their surgical procedure, including whether the cervix or one or both ovaries or tubes were conserved. The definitive documentation of this is in the operative note. If this is not available, the clinician can confirm the absence of the cervix on examination and the absence of the ovaries with pelvic imaging, if this information is needed for clinical reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients who have had a total hysterectomy continue to be at risk of sexually transmitted infections of the urethra. Thus, patients at risk of, and/or with symptoms of, these infections should be tested for gonorrhea or chlamydia with urine testing. (See

          Pelvic examination
         </strong>
         – The pelvic examination traditionally includes the external genitalia and internal pelvic organs. The abdomen and breasts are also commonly examined. The pelvic examination is traditionally performed in the dorsal lithotomy position in order to allow optimal exposure of the internal and external genitalia and palpation of the pelvis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pelvic examination'

         <strong>
          Age at initial examination
         </strong>
         – There is no defined age at which the first gynecologic examination is performed, as this depends upon the probability of identifying a gynecologic problem. Screening examinations generally begin when cervical cancer screening is initiated  (

         <strong>
          Indications and frequency
         </strong>
         – A gynecologic examination should be performed whenever a patient presents with pelvic symptoms. Asymptomatic patients should have an examination at least with every scheduled cervical cancer screening test. There is controversy as to whether an asymptomatic screening examination should take place yearly or periodically, and the preferred examination frequency should be decided by patients and their providers. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Indications and frequency for examination'

         <strong>
          Chaperones
         </strong>
         – No universal guidelines exist regarding the use of a chaperone during the examination, though the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends a chaperone for breast and pelvic examinations. Although charges of inappropriate conduct during a pelvic examination are rare, both male and female providers should consider utilizing a chaperone. (See
