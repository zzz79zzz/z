The RANKL/RANK interaction results in activation, migration, differentiation, and fusion of hematopoietic cells of the osteoclast lineage to begin the process of bone resorption. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="15575" href="/z/d/drug information/15575.html" rel="external">Denosumab</a>, a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds RANKL, blocks the binding of RANKL to RANK and thereby reduces the formation, function, and survival of osteoclasts, which results in decreased bone resorption and increased bone density.

In one such trial, 242 men (mean age 65 years, mean femoral neck T-score -1.9) were randomly assigned to denosumab (60 mg subcutaneously every six months) versus placebo [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. After 12 months, denosumab improved BMD at all sites compared with placebo (5.7 versus 0.9 percent, 2.4 versus 0.3 percent, and 2.1 versus 0 percent for LS, total hip, and femoral neck, respectively). Biochemical markers of bone turnover were significantly reduced in men taking denosumab. Clinical fractures occurred in two men in the placebo and one man in the denosumab-treated group. In another trial, denosumab reduced the risk of vertebral fractures (a secondary endpoint) in men with prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. This trial is reviewed separately.

Some experts believe that denosumab should not be used as initial therapy for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, because of the availability of oral bisphosphonates, for which there are long-term safety and fracture prevention data. In addition, generic <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9427" href="/z/d/drug information/9427.html" rel="external">alendronate</a> is less expensive, and bisphosphonates are not associated with an increased risk of vertebral fracture with discontinuation of therapy or with missed doses as may occur with denosumab. (See <a class="local">'Increased fracture risk after stopping'</a> below and <a class="local">'Duration of therapy'</a> below.) </p><p>However, other experts disagree and would use <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="15575" href="/z/d/drug information/15575.html" rel="external">denosumab</a> as initial therapy for women at high risk for fracture who have difficulty with the dosing requirements of oral bisphosphonates or are unwilling to take bisphosphonates. This is particularly reasonable in patients who have a life expectancy less than 10 years since denosumab has safety data for 10 years and transitioning to another drug is complicated. (See <a class="local">'Increased vertebral fractures'</a> below and <a class="local">'Sequential osteoporosis therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>There are currently no head-to-head trials comparing the anti-fracture efficacy of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="15575" href="/z/d/drug information/15575.html" rel="external">denosumab</a> with other available osteoporosis therapies (eg, oral and intravenous bisphosphonates, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10178" href="/z/d/drug information/10178.html" rel="external">teriparatide</a>). The reduction in vertebral fracture noted with denosumab is similar to the reductions reported for subcutaneous teriparatide and intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9902" href="/z/d/drug information/9902.html" rel="external">zoledronic acid</a> and greater than that reported for oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9427" href="/z/d/drug information/9427.html" rel="external">alendronate</a>.

Prior to the initiation of denosumab, therefore, clinicians should discuss the need for timely (every six months) administration of denosumab [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Patients with a history of poor adherence to medication or appointment schedules may do better with an alternative agent (eg, intravenous <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9902" href="/z/d/drug information/9902.html" rel="external">zoledronic acid</a>). Discontinuation of denosumab results in bone loss and increased vertebral fracture risk within a relatively short time (unlike discontinuation of bisphosphonates, which does not lead to immediate bone loss). If denosumab is discontinued, administering an alternative therapy (typically a bisphosphonate) to prevent rapid bone loss and vertebral fracture is advised.
