Presentations vary widely, from acute cerebellar swelling due to infarction, edema, or hemorrhage that can have rapid and catastrophic effects, to chronic and slowly progressive cerebellar degeneration.</p><p>Here we set out to briefly describe the clinical/anatomic correlates of cerebellar disease, to provide a broad differential diagnosis for patients who present with cerebellar ataxia, and to provide a methodologic approach to the evaluation of patients with cerebellar signs. A special emphasis is placed on causes of cerebellar ataxia, both acquired and genetic, that are reversible when timely therapy is initiated.</p><p>Related topics review genetic ataxias in more detail:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6234.html" rel="external">"Overview of the hereditary ataxias"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6230.html" rel="external">"Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6224.html" rel="external">"Friedreich ataxia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>An approach to acute ataxia in children is also reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6465.html" rel="external">"Approach to the child with acute ataxia"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17305672"><span class="h1">CLINICAL SYNDROMES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The anatomy of the cerebellum is complex. For the purposes of clinical localization, it is useful to distinguish between the midline cerebellum and the cerebellar hemispheres. Cerebellar syndromes can be divided into symptoms arising from one or the other, although there is significant clinical overlap [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].</p><p>Midline cerebellar structures include the vermis, the fastigial and interposed (globus and emboliform) nuclei, the vestibulocerebellum (flocculus and nodulus), and the paravermis/intermediate zone. The right and left cerebellar hemispheres include the dentate nuclei on each side.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17305679"><span class="h2">Midline cerebellar dysfunction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Midline cerebellar structures are critical for motor execution, rapid and slow eye movements, balance/lower extremity coordination, and vestibular function. Damage to midline structures can result in:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Imbalance </strong>–<strong> </strong>Patients tend to fall when standing with their feet together, whether their eyes are opened or closed. They may adopt a compensatory wide-based stance. They often have difficulties with gait, especially tandem walking. They may complain of a sensation of disequilibrium.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Truncal ataxia</strong> – Truncal ataxia manifests as swaying of the head and trunk when the patient is sitting. In severe cases, it results in the inability to sit unsupported by the arms. This is seen more often in severe midline injuries. Patients can also have bilateral upper limb ataxia, as seen in hemispheric dysfunction, especially if the paravermis/intermediate zone region of the cerebellum is damaged.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Titubation</strong> – Titubation is an involuntary, semirhythmic nodding of the head, neck, and/or trunk that is often seen with midline cerebellar dysfunction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Lower-limb dysmetria</strong> – Dysmetria refers to an impaired ability to perform accurate movements during goal-directed tasks because of a faulty estimation of distance [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. It can be seen with both midline and hemispheric cerebellar lesions. With midline cerebellar lesions, dysmetria may predominantly affect the lower extremities and can be elicited on heel-to-shin testing.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Saccadic intrusions</strong> – Saccadic intrusions are the most common ocular abnormality caused by midline lesions. Intrusions are irregular bursts of rapid eye movements that include opsoclonus, ocular flutter, square wave jerks, and macrosaccadic oscillations. They are often but not always a sign of midline cerebellar pathology.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Nystagmus</strong> – Horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus is commonly seen with midline cerebellar injury. Often the nystagmus is more prominent when looking towards the side of the lesion, although nystagmus in all directions of gaze is usually present. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5109.html" rel="external">"Overview of nystagmus"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Down-beating nystagmus present in primary gaze or induced by up-gaze localizes to the cerebellar flocculus, as does rebound nystagmus, which is the induction of nystagmus upon return to primary gaze. Both of these can be seen in other processes [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Up-beating nystagmus can be seen with midline cerebellar vermis lesions as well as in brainstem lesions.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">"Ocular dysmetria" is the term applied to hypermetric saccadic eye movements. After overshooting, the eyes rapidly correct their position to focus appropriately on the object in question. This finding is very suggestive of cerebellar dysfunction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Vertigo</strong> – Vertigo with nausea and vomiting may result from damage to the vestibulocerebellum and is usually associated with saccadic intrusions and nystagmus.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17305686"><span class="h2">Hemispheric cerebellar dysfunction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The cerebellar hemispheres are largely responsible for motor planning and coordination of complex tasks. Damage to one hemisphere leads to symptoms that are most notable in the ipsilateral limbs. Clinical signs of hemispheric cerebellar dysfunction include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Dysdiadochokinesis</strong> – Dysdiadochokinesis, which is incoordination when performing rapid alternating movements, is a common finding in cerebellar disease. Specific testing includes having the patient alternately pronate and supinate the forearm and hand.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Dysmetria</strong> – Dysmetria of the hands and arms can be seen as past-pointing on finger-to-nose testing. Dysmetria is also commonly seen in the legs on heel-to-shin testing and leads to some degree of gait ataxia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Limb ataxia</strong> – Limb ataxia is usually seen clinically as difficulty with coordinated tasks.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intention tremor</strong> – Intention tremor is a type of kinetic tremor, which typically increases in severity (amplitude) as the hand moves closer to its target and is usually large in amplitude.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ataxic dysarthria </strong>– Ataxic dysarthria is characterized by alternating loudness and fluctuating pitch levels, such that the emphasis is placed on syllables that should not be stressed. It can also manifest as scanning speech, which refers to slow enunciation with pauses in between syllables and words. Patients can also exhibit irregular articulatory breakdown, transient nasality, harshness, or breathiness.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Ocular findings</strong> – Ocular findings are generally less prominent, but broken smooth pursuits and ipsilateral gaze-evoked nystagmus are often seen.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17305693"><span class="h2">Noncerebellar causes of ataxia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Weakness and/or sensory loss (both tactile and visual) are common causes of falls and can simulate features of cerebellar ataxia. Proprioceptive sensory loss in particular can cause both limb and gait ataxia. Moreover, the presence of proprioceptive deficits can significantly worsen cerebellar ataxia that would otherwise be subclinical.</p><p>A number of other processes, including hydrocephalus and vestibular disease (usually bilateral), also can produce clinical pictures similar to cerebellar ataxia and therefore need to be ruled out as part of the evaluation. While dizziness and vertigo are commonly seen in cerebellar disease, especially when the vestibulocerebellum is damaged, they rarely occur in isolation as the result of a cerebellar lesion. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5099.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with dizziness"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5094.html" rel="external">"Evaluation of the patient with vertigo"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17305700"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGIC EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are many different etiologies for cerebellar disease  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90074" href="/d/graphic/90074.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90077" href="/d/graphic/90077.html" rel="external">table 2</a>), and clinical presentations have significant overlap. The urgency and scope of the evaluation depends largely on the temporal onset of symptoms.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H17305707"><span class="h2">Acute ataxia (medical emergency)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The sudden onset of cerebellar ataxia over a period of minutes to hours is considered a medical emergency because it may represent an acute vascular event. In addition to neuroimaging, diagnostic screening for causative drugs and toxins is always an appropriate part of a comprehensive assessment  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90077" href="/d/graphic/90077.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3975925874"><span class="h3">Urgent neuroimaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who present with acute cerebellar ataxia require emergency neuroimaging with a noncontrast head computed tomography (CT) scan and/or brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate for hemorrhage, ischemia/infarction, or significant cerebellar edema.</p><p>Importantly, CT has poor resolution in the posterior fossa due to bone artifact, and as such ischemic strokes can be missed, particularly in the acute setting. Patients with a negative head CT for whom suspicion of an acute cerebellar process is high should therefore go on to have an MRI. For patients who cannot undergo MRI due to implanted MRI-incompatible hardware or other contraindications, serial CT-based imaging may be indicated if clinical suspicion remains high.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3663415871"><span class="h3">Important causes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Important causes of acute ataxia are stroke, hemorrhage, toxins, medications, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9988" href="/d/drug information/9988.html" rel="external">thiamine</a> deficiency (Wernicke encephalopathy), and infections.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Vascular disorders</strong> – Cerebellar ischemia and hemorrhage are important causes of acute ataxia. Important risk factors include older age, hypertension, and diabetes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Cerebellar ischemia </strong>– Cerebellar ischemia can result from multiple mechanisms affecting the vertebrobasilar arterial system  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66585" href="/d/graphic/66585.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>), including embolism, thrombosis, dissection, and vasculitis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1102.html" rel="external">"Posterior circulation cerebrovascular syndromes", section on 'Cerebellar infarction in PICA territory'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">In most cases, occlusion of the vertebral arteries, basilar artery, or major branches feeding the cerebellar hemispheres results in ipsilateral limb ataxia and, in cases of damage to midline cerebellar structures, nystagmus, imbalance, vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. In addition, there can be associated brainstem findings that vary depending on the site of the lesion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Intermittent cerebellar ataxia can be seen with transient vertebrobasilar ischemia. In such cases, symptoms may worsen with positional changes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Cerebellar hemorrhage</strong> – Cerebellar hemorrhage may result from a number of etiologies, including hemorrhagic conversion of ischemic infarction, hypertensive hemorrhage, aneurysmal rupture, and bleeding from arteriovenous malformation. Cerebellar hemorrhage usually originates in the dentate nucleus and may extend into the fourth ventricle and cerebellar hemispheres  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef118071" href="/d/graphic/118071.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). Midline cerebellar symptoms are common. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1133.html" rel="external">"Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Neurologic signs and ICH location'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Cerebellar ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke are commonly associated with headache and can be complicated by edema of the cerebellum. This edema can lead to compression of the adjacent brainstem and the fourth ventricle, resulting in hydrocephalus from compression of cerebrospinal fluid outflow through the fourth ventricular foramina and eventually downward herniation and death if left untreated. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1084.html" rel="external">"Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Acute treatment and prognosis", section on 'Intracranial pressure management'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">This makes any vascular injury to the cerebellum a neurologic emergency requiring rapid imaging, aggressive monitoring, and potentially surgical intervention to achieve the best outcomes. When the cerebellum is the only structure damaged, patients may achieve a near full recovery of function if the acute swelling and compression issues can be overcome. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1084.html" rel="external">"Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Acute treatment and prognosis", section on 'Cerebellar hemorrhage'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Medications and toxins</strong> – Medications and toxins can lead to transient or permanent cerebellar ataxia and should be explored in most patients with acute (and chronic) presentations where an etiology is not readily apparent  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90077" href="/d/graphic/90077.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Antiseizure medications </strong>– Antiseizure medications, especially those that affect sodium channel conductance such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9769" href="/d/drug information/9769.html" rel="external">phenytoin</a>, are associated with ataxia.

Effects are usually reversible when the medicine is stopped, but chronic administration of phenytoin in particular can lead to permanent cerebellar degeneration.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Chemotherapy</strong> – Chemotherapy can be associated with both reversible and permanent cerebellar ataxia. <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9314" href="/d/drug information/9314.html" rel="external">Cytarabine</a>, often used in treatment of leukemias and lymphomas, and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a>, which is used in various cancer treatments including colon cancer therapy, are the most common chemotherapeutics associated with acute cerebellar ataxia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span><strong>Cytarabine</strong> – High doses of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9314" href="/d/drug information/9314.html" rel="external">cytarabine</a> cause an acute cerebellar syndrome in 10 to 25 percent of patients.

As a separate issue, certain chemotherapeutic agents, including <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10180" href="/d/drug information/10180.html" rel="external">oxaliplatin</a>, are associated with the development of sensory ataxia caused by neurotoxicity affecting dorsal root ganglia and peripheral nerves.

PSP is now recognized to encompass a number of phenotypic variants. The two most common are Richardson syndrome (the classic form of PSP) and PSP-parkinsonism. Although ataxia is usually not a prominent symptom, it may be seen and is exacerbated by coexistent parkinsonism and oculomotor palsies.

Impaired biliary copper excretion leads to accumulation of copper in several organs, most notably the liver, brain, and cornea. Over time, the liver is progressively damaged and eventually becomes cirrhotic. A minority of patients develop acute liver failure, most often in the setting of advanced fibrosis of the liver. In addition, patients may develop neurologic complications, which can be severe. Although ataxia can be present at the time of diagnosis, there is usually but not always evidence of compensated liver failure by the time neurologic symptoms become apparent. In addition to ataxia, Wilson disease is associated with a wide array of movement disorders including tremor, choreoathetosis, and bradykinesia, as well as psychiatric symptoms of depression, paranoia, or delusions. Nearly all patients with Wilson disease with neurologic manifestations have Kayser-Fleischer rings. The diagnosis, management, and prognosis of Wilson disease are reviewed in detail elsewhere.

These are both autosomal recessive disorders and present with a slowly progressive gait-predominant ataxia in the late teens or early adulthood. Abetalipoproteinemia is also associated with retinal degeneration and peripheral neuropathy as a result of malabsorption of vitamin A and other fat-soluble vitamins. In both of these diseases, early supplementation with high-dose vitamin E is associated with better outcome.

ARSACS results from mutations in the <em>SACS </em>gene that encodes the protein sacsin, whose function is unknown, although it has homology to a number of heat-shock proteins. Mutations lead to absent or severely reduced sacsin levels, which appear to correlate with clinical disease severity [<a href="#rid70">70</a>]. This disorder was initially described in families from Quebec, but pathogenic mutations in <em>SACS</em> have now been identified around the world. Although children are usually symptomatic by one year of age, the disease is slowly progressive, and most affected individuals are able to ambulate into their third or fourth decade before requiring a wheelchair in later life. Most patients have preserved cognition until late in the disease course. The phenotypic expression of the disease includes patients who lack one or more of the features that constitute the classic triad (spasticity, cerebellar ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy), or have pure neuropathy, or have atypical features such as autonomic involvement or supranuclear gaze palsy [<a href="#rid66">66,67</a>]. Brain MRI characteristically shows abnormalities involving the pons, including linear hypointensities on T2-weighted sequences, bilateral hyperintensities on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences involving the lateral pons, and thickening of the middle cerebral peduncle [<a href="#rid66">66,71-73</a>].

The mean age of onset is in the third decade (range age 6 to 46 years) [<a href="#rid76">76,77</a>]. Imaging studies reveal marked cerebellar atrophy. The prevalence of the disorder worldwide is unknown, but it appears to be the most common inherited cause of cerebellar ataxia in Quebec, where it was first identified. It is also a relatively common cause of early-onset (age &lt;40 years) ataxia with autosomal recessive inheritance in Europe after exclusion of Friedreich ataxia [<a href="#rid76">76</a>]. The disorder results from truncation mutations in the spectrin repeat containing nuclear envelope protein 1 (<em>SYNE1</em>) gene on chromosome 6. <em>SYNE1</em> encodes a large protein related to the spectrin family of proteins that link organelles to the actin cytoskeleton, but its specific function is unknown [<a href="#rid74">74-76</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia type 3</strong> – Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia type 3 is characterized by slowly progressive ataxia with cerebellar atrophy [<a href="#rid78">78</a>].

Common additional features include corticospinal tract signs such as spasticity, hyperreflexia, and extensor plantar responses. In a report from France of 186 unrelated subjects with sporadic or recessive progressive cerebellar ataxia of unknown etiology, mutations in the <em>ANO10</em> gene were found in 5 percent, suggesting that this disorder is a relatively common cause of recessive cerebellar ataxia [<a href="#rid78">78</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Refsum disease</strong> – Refsum disease is a rare autosomal recessive peroxisomal disorder characterized by retinitis pigmentosa, ichthyosis, sensorimotor polyneuropathy, and cerebellar ataxia. In addition, electrocardiographic (ECG) changes and sensorineural hearing loss are also seen. The disease usually presents in adolescence but can present in early adulthood. Patients with classic Refsum disease are unable to degrade phytanic acid due to deficient activity of phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase (PhyH) caused by mutations in the <em>PHYH </em>gene. Strict reduction in dietary phytanic acid intake may be associated with a significant improvement in both the peripheral neuropathy and ataxia.

Neonatal cholestatic jaundice and infantile diarrhea are early signs in some patients but are rarely identified as symptoms of the disorder until other manifestations appear in late childhood or early adulthood; these include premature cataracts and atherosclerosis, tendon xanthomas, cerebellar gait ataxia, upper motor neuron weakness, pseudobulbar affect, and progressive cognitive deficits. Laboratory studies showing elevated levels of serum cholestanol and serum and urine bile alcohols are supportive of the diagnosis, and genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis.

This is often combined with seizures, episodic vomiting, and lethargy, similar to that seen in children with urea cycle deficits. The urine usually has a characteristic odor. Hartnup disease results from a defect in renal and intestinal transport of neutral amino acids rather than a metabolic defect. This disorder also is associated with niacin deficiency, often leading to symptoms of pellagra (such as rash and confusion). Hartnup disease results from mutations in the solute carrier family 6 member 19 (<em>SLC6A19</em>) gene, which encodes for a sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter that is primarily expressed in the kidney and intestine.
