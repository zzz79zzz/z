The level of evidence to guide the clinician in initiating chelation therapy is quite variable as shown by the following examples in disorders associated with iron overload:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Myelodysplasia</strong> – The role of iron chelation in patients with MDS and transfusional iron overload is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/15776.html" rel="external">"Myelodysplastic syndromes/neoplasms (MDS): Management of hematologic complications in lower-risk MDS"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7123.html" rel="external">"Sideroblastic anemias: Diagnosis and management", section on 'Iron overload'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Thalassemia</strong> – Institution of vigorous chelation therapy early in childhood has been responsible for a marked improvement in survival of patients with transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia major and beta thalassemia intermedia and is considered the standard of care in this disorder. (See <a class="local">'Iron chelation in transfusion-dependent thalassemia'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Individuals with transfusion-independent thalassemia (non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia [NTDT]; also called thalassemia intermedia in some studies) accumulate iron due to increased absorption of dietary iron rather than via repeated blood transfusions. These individuals also may require chelation therapy, although complications generally occur at an older age (by 10 to 15 years) and we evaluate them for iron overload when they are 10 years of age or older. (See <a class="local">'Iron chelation in transfusion-independent thalassemia'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In contrast, individuals with alpha or beta thalassemia minor (also called thalassemia trait) do not develop iron overload and do not require screening. However, it is important that these individuals are not inappropriately diagnosed as being iron deficient due to microcytosis and are not inadvertently given iron for an incorrect diagnosis of iron deficiency. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7116.html" rel="external">"Diagnosis of thalassemia (adults and children)", section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Sickle cell disease</strong> – This subject is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/128123.html" rel="external">"Transfusion in sickle cell disease: Management of complications including iron overload", section on 'Excessive iron stores'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Post-transplantation management</strong> – The use of iron chelation is being increasingly employed for those with iron overload who are being considered for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), or who have been cured of their underlying disorder following HCT, since iron overload is known to be associated with increased complications and a poor prognosis [<a href="#rid5">5,6</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Iron chelation in other iron overload conditions'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3555.html" rel="external">"Thalassemia: Management after hematopoietic cell transplantation", section on 'Iron stores'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2407611"><span class="h2">Goals of iron chelation therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goal of iron chelation therapy is to reduce the body burden of iron, especially iron within labile compartments in plasma as well as in various tissues. By decreasing iron in these sites, the specific aim is to minimize the production of reactive oxygen species, thus reducing damage to critical organs such as the liver, heart, and endocrine organs, resulting in reduced morbidity and improved survival [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. </p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Primary goal</strong> – As increased availability of iron chelators and the ability to quantify specific organ iron has become available, the primary goal of chelation therapy has become the<strong> </strong>prevention of toxic iron burden and the maintenance of safe iron levels. This is achieved using chelator doses that balance iron intake from transfusions with iron excretion by chelation. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Rescue therapy</strong> – When unsafe levels of iron have developed, the goal of iron chelation is no longer iron maintenance therapy but is instead iron rescue therapy. This requires a more aggressive approach to iron chelation, with doses higher than used in iron maintenance. Toxic levels of tissue iron, even if temporary, are likely to induce some irreversible damage. Since only a small amount of body iron is available for iron chelation at any one time, iron chelation therapy cannot rapidly lower body iron stores, even with regimen adjustment. While removal of iron from the liver may be relatively rapid, lowering iron in the heart and other organs is a much slower process. </p><p></p><p>Since iron chelation must be given over extended periods of time in those with iron overload and must be rigorously followed, the choice of a chelating agent must take into account the ability of the patient to tolerate and pursue the chosen regimen with high compliance and to obtain continuous follow-up evaluation of its efficacy and safety. (See <a class="local">'Choice of initial therapy'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7157.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with suspected iron overload", section on 'Sequence and interpretation of testing'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1161278"><span class="h1">IRON CHELATION IN TRANSFUSION-DEPENDENT THALASSEMIA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Currently, there are three iron chelating agents in wide use and numerous ways in which iron chelation therapy can be given to patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia. No agent or combination of agents is considered the "gold standard" of therapy for all patients or programs. The optimal chelator regimen is not solely determined by the drug used, but by the regimen which results in chronic optimal patient adherence, in which continuous effective therapy is administered safely, providing protection from labile iron. </p><p><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9327" href="/d/drug information/9327.html" rel="external">Deferoxamine</a> is an excellent iron chelator, but it is not commonly chosen as the primary chelator because its requirement for continuous infusion often results in non-adherence. While there is no universal gold standard in chelation therapy, there are consensus recommendations from experts and thalassemia organizations that share similar approaches in most instances [<a href="#rid8">8-10</a>]. </p><p>The following sections present the available information concerning such therapeutic options. A comparison of the variously available guidelines for such care has been published, which concluded that there were "notable variations in the recommendations for iron chelation therapy" [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1161607"><span class="h2">Indications</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Prior to the advent of hypertransfusion regimens in the 1960s, beta thalassemia major was a disease fatal in infancy. Hypertransfusion regimens transformed this disorder into a more chronic disease, with patients usually dying in their second decade of life from the complications of transfusional iron overload. Iron chelation therapy, begun in the 1970s, transformed this into a chronic disease permitting prolonged survival  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75362" href="/d/graphic/75362.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>). Accordingly, the mainstays of therapy for beta thalassemia major are chronic hypertransfusion combined with iron chelation and supportive measures directed at the complications of the expanded erythron and iron overload. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7118.html" rel="external">"Management of thalassemia"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2086796062"><span class="h3">Transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (previously beta thalassemia major)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Indications for initiating chelation therapy are listed below:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>After 10 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC), or greater than 100cc/Kg per year (PRBC hematocrit 60).</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Ferritin is greater than 1000ug/L.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver iron concentration &gt;3mg/g/dry weight, or the cardiac T2* is less than 20 milliseconds [<a href="#rid3">3,12,13</a>]. </p><p></p><p>General recommendations are to initiate chelation therapy at two years of age or older based on the criteria above. Neither of the oral medications are US Food and Drug Administration-approved for children under two years of age. Data on young children is very limited and largely based on <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9327" href="/d/drug information/9327.html" rel="external">deferoxamine</a> experience and limited reports on the oral chelators [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].

The prospective, non-inferiority trial between deferiprone and deferasirox (DEEP-2) followed 393 randomized patients, with 30 percent of patients younger than six years and 6 percent younger than two years. Both drugs had a good safety profile [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3935461619"><span class="h3">Non-transfusion dependent thalassemia (NTDT)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In NTDT, the ferritin alone underestimates the iron burden and can result in patients with significant iron overload being untreated. The liver iron concentration (LIC) is the preferred method to determine iron stores and the initiation of chelation. [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Iron chelation in transfusion-independent thalassemia'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7157.html" rel="external">"Approach to the patient with suspected iron overload", section on 'Post-diagnostic testing'</a>.) Chelation is initiated when the MRI measurement of the LIC is equal to or greater than 5 mg/g dry weight. If quantitative measurement is not available, a ferritin of 800ug/L is utilized. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1161681"><span class="h2">Choice of initial therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are three options for initial chelating therapy.

The long half-life allows once daily dosing. Deferasirox is the most common choice for initiating chelation therapy in the United States [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">There are two formulations:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Jadenu is a film-coated tablet that has better absorption and is better tolerated than Exjade.

It is equally effective as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8794" href="/d/drug information/8794.html" rel="external">deferasirox</a> but must be given parenterally. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The recommended method of administration is a slow subcutaneous infusion of a 10 percent solution over 8 to 12 hours for a minimum of five days per week. Prefilled balloon infusors increase patient adherence. The average daily dose in children is 20 mg/kg day; this can be increased to 40 mg/kg /day. Higher doses are not recommended because of the adverse impact on skeletal growth. In adults, DFO dosing may be increased to 60 mg/kg/day. Low dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9327" href="/d/drug information/9327.html" rel="external">deferoxamine</a> (2 to 3mg/kg/day on the days it is used) increases iron excretion and may be beneficial. High-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9776" href="/d/drug information/9776.html" rel="external">vitamin C</a> (eg, &gt;200 mg) is avoided due to a potential risk of rapid iron mobilization and toxicity [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Deferiprone</strong> – Oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="17092" href="/d/drug information/17092.html" rel="external">Deferiprone</a> has been available throughout the world (United Kingdom, India, Far East) since the 2000s. It is a rapidly absorbed tablet that is typically given three times daily. Some data suggest twice daily dosing is acceptable and may improve adherence. In many countries, deferiprone is a second-line therapy for patients who cannot tolerate other chelators. It has less gastrointestinal toxicity than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8794" href="/d/drug information/8794.html" rel="external">deferasirox</a> but carries the rare risk of agranulocytosis. It is widely used throughout the world, especially in resource-limited settings, due to its lower cost and ease of administration.</p><p></p><p>There are no randomized trials that give guidance with regard to the choice of agent for initial iron chelation therapy. As a result, the choice is largely dependent on local experience, availability, age of the patient, comorbidities, drug side effect profile, and patient preference, especially with regard to the route of administration [<a href="#rid2">2,11</a>]. Cost may also be an issue for some individuals, especially in resource-limited settings.</p><p>Most patients in North America and Europe have chosen <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8794" href="/d/drug information/8794.html" rel="external">deferasirox</a> over <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9327" href="/d/drug information/9327.html" rel="external">deferoxamine</a> as initial therapy. Compared with deferoxamine, deferasirox has been associated with greater patient satisfaction, adherence to therapy, and increased time available for normal activities [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].

It should be noted that the most clinically meaningful differences are those in which similar measurements are compared (eg, T2* compared with T2* using the same imaging parameters). The most dramatic reductions occurred in individuals with the highest baseline cardiac iron. In contrast, individuals with baseline cardiac iron overload receiving placebo plus chelation therapy did not have a significant reduction in cardiac iron, and individuals with baseline cardiac iron ≤0.59 mg/g dry weight had no statistically significant changes in cardiac iron with amlodipine or placebo added to chelation.
