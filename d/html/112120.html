The material that has lodged in the extremity decreases blood flow because of occlusion or severe stenosis of the blood vessel. By understanding the breadth of that definition, the variables of "material" and "elsewhere in the body" provide a way to systematically think through the various etiologies. In addition, a systematic approach helps to avoid jumping to diagnostic conclusions based purely on what is common or clinically familiar. </p><p>The priorities of managing acute embolism to the lower extremities are first to address the ischemia and then to institute measures to prevent further embolic events. </p><p>The clinical presentations, evaluation, diagnosis, and general management of embolism to the lower extremities are reviewed here. Other causes of acute arterial occlusion to the lower extremities are reviewed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8213.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of acute lower extremity ischemia"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2939549419"><span class="h1">ETIOLOGY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Etiologies leading to lower embolism are shown in the table and discussed below  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58846" href="/z/d/graphic/58846.html" rel="external">table 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4280819048"><span class="h2">Cardiac sources</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The most commonly reported source of lower extremity emboli is the heart, accounting for 55 to 87 percent of events [<a href="#rid1">1-3</a>]. The main sources of embolism from the heart are thrombus from within the cardiac chambers and debris shedding off valves (native, prosthetic). Rarely, cardiac tumor (eg, atrial myxoma) can also embolize [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p>Emboli from intracardiac thrombus usually come from the left atrium, often associated with atrial fibrillation. Thrombus can also form in the left ventricle (eg, severe cardiomyopathy, post-myocardial infarction). In either case, an area of relative stasis within the heart allows thrombus to form locally, which can dislodge and embolize to virtually anywhere in the body, including the lower extremities. Intracardiac sources of thrombus are often fibrin rich, with acute thrombus generally responding well to thrombolytic agents (eg, tissue plasminogen activator) [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/90.html" rel="external">"Left ventricular thrombus after acute myocardial infarction"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/128998.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation in adults: Selection of candidates for anticoagulation"</a>.)</p><p>The aortic or mitral valves can also be sources of emboli to the lower extremities. This may be from debris on diseased native or prosthetic valves, vegetative growths from bacterial endocarditis, or nonbacterial vegetations such as Libman-Sacks endocarditis in lupus [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. As these types of embolic debris are not largely thrombotic in nature, they do not respond well to thrombolysis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2143.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and evaluation of adults with suspected left-sided native valve endocarditis"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2138.html" rel="external">"Prosthetic valve endocarditis: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>When septic emboli from cardiac valves lodge in the lower extremity, they can cause local destruction of the artery, abscess formation, and/or mycotic pseudoaneurysms in addition to the usual ischemic picture. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2142.html" rel="external">"Complications and outcome of infective endocarditis", section on 'Septic embolization'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2129.html" rel="external">"Overview of infected (mycotic) arterial aneurysm"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4162790879"><span class="h2">Aortic plaque</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A diseased aortic wall with complex atherosclerotic plaque can also be a source of emboli. Presumably following the rupture of the fibrous cap overlying an atherosclerotic plaque, luminal irregularities and ulcerations result in a surface that is thrombogenic [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. In addition to embolization of larger pieces of accumulated thrombus, microembolization of cholesterol crystals can also occur. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8197.html" rel="external">"Thromboembolism from aortic plaque"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8184.html" rel="external">"Embolism from atherosclerotic plaque: Atheroembolism (cholesterol crystal embolism)"</a>.)</p><p>Asymptomatic atherosclerotic disease of the aorta often seen incidentally on imaging studies (the so-called "shaggy aorta syndrome") can lead to macrovascular or microvascular embolization (or both) [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. This can occur anywhere along the aorta, including the ascending aorta, aortic arch, descending thoracic aorta, or abdominal aorta. </p><p>Another source of emboli from the aorta is thrombus that appears to be nearly free-floating with attachment at one end to the wall of the aorta (also known as mural thrombus, mobile aortic thrombus, pedunculated aortic thrombus) [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. Sometimes these are found incidentally on imaging studies and other times during the evaluation for an embolic source. When surgically removed, the attachment point appears often to originate from an intimal irregularity/defect, suggesting that these may start from a ruptured plaque or other primary intimal defect. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1913043073"><span class="h2">Aortic and peripheral aneurysm</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Blood flow within aortic aneurysms (thoracic or abdominal) is altered such that mural thrombus frequently forms within the aneurysm sac. Unlike with rupture risk, there is no known association of embolic potential of aortic aneurysms relative to their diameter. Although mural thrombus in an aortic aneurysm is common, dislodgement of aortic thrombus is an uncommon but known source of embolization to the lower extremities [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. Embolism may be spontaneous, during manipulation of the aneurysm during open or endovascular repair, or during arterial instrumentation for another reason. (See <a class="local">'Instrumentation'</a> below.)</p><p>Although iliac artery aneurysms are more likely to be complicated by rupture, thrombosis with the potential for embolism can occur.</p><p>Peripheral aneurysms such as femoral and popliteal aneurysms have a propensity to thrombose, which may propagate to occlude the distal vasculature, or alternatively, mural thrombus can embolize distally. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/17030.html" rel="external">"Femoral artery aneurysm"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15187.html" rel="external">"Popliteal artery aneurysm"</a>.) </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3868618474"><span class="h2">Paradoxical embolism</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A paradoxical embolus results from venous thrombus embolizing to the right heart and then crossing into the arterial circulation through an intracardiac septal defect, or a right-to-left shunt in the pulmonary circulation. </p><p>Although the most commonly described manifestation of paradoxical embolism is acute stroke, embolization elsewhere in the peripheral arterial system has been described, including to the lower extremities. Because these clots originate in the veins, they tend to be larger, and when they embolize to the lower extremities, they tend to obstruct larger vessels. </p><p>A timely diagnosis of paradoxical embolism requires a high index of suspicion because of the low prevalence of structural defects (eg, patent foramen ovale, atrial septal defect) that allow crossing from the venous to arterial circulation. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1382211073"><span class="h2">Instrumentation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The incidence of lower extremity embolization as result of cardiac or peripheral interventions (catheter based or surgical) is quite low, but it is important to consider as a potential etiology when evaluating an embolic event. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1470.html" rel="external">"Complications of diagnostic cardiac catheterization", section on 'Atheroembolism'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15202.html" rel="external">"Access-related complications of percutaneous access for diagnostic or interventional procedures", section on 'Atheroembolism'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15202.html" rel="external">"Access-related complications of percutaneous access for diagnostic or interventional procedures"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H602615294"><span class="h3">Endovascular intervention</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Careful manipulation of wires, catheters, and treatment devices during endovascular interventions is important to minimize damage from the intervention itself. Disruption of plaque or thrombus can occur during any type of intervention, including diagnostic studies and stent or stent-graft placement. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15217.html" rel="external">"Endovascular techniques for lower extremity revascularization", section on 'Complications and management'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/15202.html" rel="external">"Access-related complications of percutaneous access for diagnostic or interventional procedures"</a>.)</p><p>The incidence of iatrogenic embolization is not well known, but angiographically or clinically noted macroembolic events are estimated to occur in 2 to 5 percent, with smaller, undetected microembolic events likely occurring at much higher rates [<a href="#rid13">13,14</a>]. The clinical implications of microembolic events are not well known [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. </p><p>The intraprocedural embolic event may be recognized at the time of the procedure on completion imaging that shows a new filling defect or loss of outflow vessels. Early recognition provides an opportunity to immediately address the problem, with the goal of minimizing negative clinical effects, which can often be accomplished using endovascular means. Embolization related to instrumentation can also occur in a delayed manner after the intervention has been completed. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2914646862"><span class="h3">Arterial closure devices</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A variety of arterial closure devices (suture-mediated closure, metal clip-mediated closure, collagen or other soluble plugs) can be used at the end of endovascular procedures, usually with good results [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Vessel thrombosis and/or distal embolization are potential complications of these devices, with embolization occurring infrequently (&lt;1 percent) [<a href="#rid17">17-19</a>]. </p><p>Such complications are usually related to an unrecognized maldeployment of the device such that an external component is deployed within the vessel wall or intraluminally. Although the component may be designed to dissolve over time, the timeframe is usually over weeks to months. Any narrowing of the vessel causing ischemia will usually need to be addressed sooner. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H669299776"><span class="h1">CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinical presentation of lower extremity embolization varies depending upon the source of the thrombus, the size of the embolic debris, and the ability of the extremity to compensate for reduced flow related to the obstruction, which varies by the location of the obstruction. Some clinical presentations increase suspicion for certain etiologies. </p><p>Emboli tend to lodge at arterial branch points where the caliber of vessels changes or at a site of narrowing from a preexisting atherosclerotic plaque. In one of the largest series on embolic disease, lower extremity emboli accounted for 63 percent of events, with the femoral artery affected most commonly (28 percent), followed by the aortoiliac segment (18 percent), and then the popliteal segment (17 percent) [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3282444174"><span class="h2">Acute limb ischemia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The working definition of acute limb ischemia is based on the 2007 Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease (TASC II), which describes acute limb ischemia as "a quickly developing or sudden decrease in limb perfusion, usually producing new or worsening symptoms or signs, and often threatening limb viability" [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. The duration of symptoms that distinguishes acute from chronic limb ischemia is defined as &lt;2 weeks [<a href="#rid22">22-24</a>]. </p><p>Emboli from cardiac sources or paradoxical emboli tend to lodge in larger arteries and tend to occur in individuals even without peripheral artery disease. Symptoms are sudden and rapidly progressive. The severity of the initial presentation corresponds to the degree of urgency needed for treatment [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H874203818"><span class="h2">Blue toe syndrome</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Digital ischemia with intact large vessel circulation, also called the "blue toe" syndrome, is a variation of acute limb ischemia, except that the size of the embolic material is small enough to travel into the end arteries [<a href="#rid25">25,26</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8184.html" rel="external">"Embolism from atherosclerotic plaque: Atheroembolism (cholesterol crystal embolism)", section on 'Blue toe syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>The patient will often have intact pedal pulses, but there is inadequate circulation to the individual toe(s). In patients who do not have concomitant neuropathy or other sensory deficits, this condition is extremely painful. The toe will often become discolored, hence this syndrome's moniker. The clinical course after the acute insult varies, sometimes with complete resolution, other times with chronic pain/nerve damage but with preservation of the toe, and at other times with progression to gangrene and need for toe amputation. Unless extensive, there is minimal threat of major (above-ankle) amputation. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1706523702"><span class="h2">Subclinical progression to chronic ischemia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In contrast to acute limb ischemia, repeated emboli to the lower extremities can manifest with a stepwise deterioration of distal arterial flow from individual embolic events that have either no or mild symptoms. </p><p>Disruption of the lower extremity outflow circulation can become sufficiently severe to cause rest pain or tissue loss. The resultant clinical presentation is similar to chronic peripheral artery disease but with an embolic rather than atherosclerotic or other etiology [<a href="#rid27">27,28</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8208.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease"</a>.)</p><p>Subclinical progression can appear clinically and is angiographically similar to other common pathologies that predominantly affect the tibial vessels, such as patterns of peripheral artery disease in patients with diabetes or renal failure, Buerger's disease, vasculitis, or repetitive arterial trauma. </p><p>Subclinical progression can be difficult to treat because the reduced arterial outflow limits the available treatment options and durability of treatment. </p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1389686556"><span class="h1">CLINICAL EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The clinical evaluation identifies the nature of the clinical presentation, grades the severity of ischemia, and considers the potential sources of embolization, all of which are used to determine the appropriate course of treatment and to institute treatment to prevent future embolic events. A systematic approach is used to avoid missing potential embolic sources that can lead to recurrent embolism. The extent and timing of the clinical evaluation largely depends on the nature of the clinical presentation. (See <a class="local">'Clinical presentations'</a> above.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For acute limb ischemia, management of the limb takes priority over determining the source of the embolus. The evaluation focuses primarily on what is necessary to make appropriate treatment decisions, namely determining clinical severity, defining the anatomy, and identifying comorbidities that may influence treatment. Identifying the suspected embolic source may need to be deferred until after treatment is begun. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For other presentations (eg, subclinical progression, blue toe syndrome), acute treatment options may be limited, and the emphasis is on preventing future embolic events. </p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1859388065"><span class="h2">History and physical</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The history should evaluate risk factors associated with lower extremity embolism. (See <a class="local">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A history of atrial fibrillation, valve replacement, structural heart defects, or known valvular problems may point toward a potential cardiac source, but it must be kept in mind that for some people, cardiac disease may be undiagnosed. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients who are anticoagulated, it is important to identify the reason for anticoagulation and whether the medication is being taken regularly and as prescribed, as well as when the last dose was taken. For patients taking <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="10050" href="/z/d/drug information/10050.html" rel="external">warfarin</a> for atrial fibrillation, a nontherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) increases the risk for embolization. In a Veterans Administration study of over 34,000 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, low INR (&lt;2.0) increased the risk for systemic embolization (relative risk 6.3; 95% CI 4.4-8.9) [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Coexisting peripheral artery disease (PAD) may alter the manner in which an embolic event presents. It is important to determine the baseline symptoms, which may help determine the acuity of the current symptoms and, after treatment, whether there has been a return to baseline. For patients with diabetes and PAD, a history of any baseline neurologic deficits is important.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For the patient with a known history of aneurysmal disease or a family history of aneurysms, it is important to consider all potential aneurysm sites. Aneurysm in one location increases the risk for aneurysms in other locations. Patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm have a prevalence of approximately 20 percent for popliteal aneurysms, many of which may not be easily detected on physical exam [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Up to 80 percent of patients with one peripheral aneurysm have multiple aneurysms, and in patients with a popliteal aneurysm, the incidences of aortoiliac and bilateral popliteal aneurysms are approximately 60 and 50 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid31">31</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The patient should also be asked about any recent catheterization procedures.</p><p></p><p>A thorough examination evaluates for signs of acute limb ischemia (six Ps) and any signs of chronic limb ischemia. For the lower extremity, this involves evaluating the femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8213.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of acute lower extremity ischemia", section on 'Six Ps'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8184.html" rel="external">"Embolism from atherosclerotic plaque: Atheroembolism (cholesterol crystal embolism)", section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8208.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease", section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>Often in acute presentations, the history and physical examination may be all that is necessary to guide therapy. As an example, an absent femoral pulse in the affected extremity but a normal or near-normal pulse examination in the unaffected extremity in a patient with an appropriate history (eg, atrial fibrillation) may be all that is needed to proceed to embolectomy.

As such, we obtain a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT). For patients in whom thrombolysis will be considered, a baseline fibrinogen level should be included with the coagulation profile.

Even in the setting of acute limb ischemia, CT angiography can usually be quickly accomplished while preparing the patient for intervention. The information gained from CT angiography may also be helpful for deciding whether to pursue open surgery or catheter-based intervention as well as aiding with the specifics of the chosen approach. As an example, if an open approach would be favored, then arterial puncture for angiography, which comes with its own risks, can be avoided. The benefits of CT angiography must be weighed against any potential risks (eg, treatment delays, worsening renal function). </p><p>The objective is to obtain good imaging of the lower extremity vasculature as well as the abdominal and pelvic inflow. Although complete vascular imaging would be desirable, it is often very difficult to get good-quality images of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and bilateral lower extremities with a single contrast bolus. In this setting, evaluation of the chest can be deferred until the postoperative period, if still needed. (See <a class="local">'Subsequent diagnostic evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Magnetic resonance (MR) angiography has limitations when evaluating acute embolic disease, one of which is the additional time needed to complete the study. The extent of calcium within the walls of the vessels is particularly relevant for deciding the best way to obtain proximal and distal control of the artery during open surgery. Calcium is poorly visualized, and the spatial resolution may also be limited for evaluating ulcerative plaques or irregular atheroma, but this can vary by available equipment and protocols.

An alternative agent may be used in those with contraindications to heparin. Patients should remain anticoagulated and monitored for progression of ischemia throughout any vascular imaging.

On the other hand, an embolus to a distal vessel (eg, tibial artery) may be best treated with thrombolysis. In general, older thrombus (eg, from aneurysm sac) does not respond well to thrombolysis, and thrombolysis has no effect on nonthrombotic material, so if either is strongly suspected, surgery may be the preferred treatment. In patients who have previously undergone surgery, reoperative fields can make surgical exposure more difficult, increasing the risk for complications. In addition, peripheral artery disease can make an embolectomy more challenging. High-grade stenoses can make it difficult to pass embolectomy catheters, and calcified plaque tends to pop the embolectomy balloon. Arterial dissection can also occur from the catheter passing behind the plaque. Passing an embolectomy through a recent stent or vascular anastomosis increases the risk of dislodging the stent or rupturing the vessel. However, in such complicated instances, an endovascular-first strategy with catheter-based thrombectomy may allow for treatment of the acute change with the addition of other endovascular adjuncts as needed.</p><p>Thrombolysis is generally a safe and effective alternative to surgery for appropriately selected patients [<a href="#rid39">39,40</a>]. However, failure of thrombolysis can lead to progression of ischemia to a higher degree of limb threat that may necessitate conversion to immediate surgical revascularization to reduce the risk of limb loss. Although the success of thrombolytic therapy may be limited by the time required to dissolve thrombus and severity and duration of ischemia, when subsequent revascularization is needed, the magnitude and complexity of the procedure is frequently less for those receiving compared with not receiving prior thrombolytic therapy. (See <a class="local">'By etiology/anatomy'</a> below and <a class="local">'Intra-arterial thrombolysis'</a> below and <a class="local">'Open embolectomy'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2468998411"><span class="h3">Immediately threatened extremity</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most patients with an immediately threatened extremity, surgical revascularization is the most appropriate initial treatment. (See <a class="local">'Open embolectomy'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with an immediately threatened limb are generally not good candidates for thrombolysis. Although pharmacologic thrombolysis may successfully dissolve the embolus, the time required is usually too long for it to be an acceptable alternative to surgery. Progression to an unsalvageable limb can occur in as little as four to six hours if prompt revascularization is not performed. Thus, open embolectomy is preferred; however, some clinicians may initiate thrombolysis in selected clinical circumstances, such as if the neurologic deficits are mild and open revascularization represents an excessive risk for the patient. If thrombolysis is to be considered at all, the limb needs be closely monitored to identify any signs of deterioration, which can happen quickly. In addition, there needs to be expedient operating room availability in the event of clinical worsening to convert emergently to open surgical revascularization for appropriate candidates. </p><p>With technical advancements and greater availability of catheter-based thrombectomy systems, we often will start with this approach for more distal embolizations as we can remove thrombus expeditiously and potentially treat the source at the same setting in selected cases of dissection, ulcerated plaque, or aneurysm. Thrombolysis can be added if needed, and by removing some of the occlusive material the improvement in flow may be sufficient to provide more time for thrombolysis to be effective. In addition, percutaneous thrombectomy can provide an image-guided thrombectomy while avoiding reoperative surgery, which is associated with higher rates of dehiscence and surgical site infection. In addition, for those with prosthetic graft, avoiding graft exposure helps reduce the risk of prosthetic graft infection.</p><p>Depending upon the duration and severity of the ischemia, a fasciotomy may be required to prevent the development of compartment syndrome following reperfusion.

Vascular imaging prior to surgery is usually not necessary since the level of amputation is determined by clinical findings and by the viability of tissues at the time of surgery. Every effort should be made to preserve as many joints as possible to decrease the work of ambulating with a prosthetic, which improves the likelihood for successful rehabilitation. Delays in amputation of a nonviable extremity can result in infection, myoglobinuria, acute renal failure, and hyperkalemia. However, if these risks can be monitored, we often provide a couple days of therapeutic anticoagulation as long as the patient is not developing any of these issues. By anticoagulating and allowing for collateral flow to develop, a longer residual limb may result which improves postamputation function.

These clinical features may be all that is needed prior to taking the patient to the operating room.

Occlusion of the distal vessels can be the direct result of embolization or can be due to low flow from a more proximally lodged embolus.

Sometimes, applying low doses of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA; 2 to 4 mg) through the catheter into the affected vessel can dissolve the embolized material, particularly when embolus is very distal.

However, revascularization may be accompanied by adverse cardiac events due to sudden release of acid and potassium from the tissue in cases of advanced ischemia. </p><p>For patients with large emboli that lodge at/near the femoral bifurcation, an open embolectomy is an expedient solution that can be performed on almost any patient. If comorbidities increase the risk for general anesthesia, a femoral cutdown and embolectomy can be performed under regional or local anesthesia. </p><p>Either a transverse or longitudinal incision can be made over the common femoral artery. If the vessel is soft and healthy, a transverse arteriotomy is made for embolectomy, which prevents luminal narrowing on primary repair. If the artery is diseased, we generally prefer to use the longitudinal incision because it provides greater flexibility for additional exposure if a concomitant endarterectomy and patch angioplasty becomes necessary. </p><p>From the single arteriotomy, Fogarty balloon catheters can be passed proximally into the iliac artery and distally into the superficial and deep femoral arteries, and often down to the popliteal artery. A #5 Fogarty is often sufficient for the common femoral and iliac arteries, and a #4 Fogarty is typically used in the superficial femoral artery, although smaller or larger catheters may be necessary as the circumstances dictate. To embolectomize down to the popliteal artery from the groin, a #3 Fogarty catheter will often be necessary. Once strong inflow and backbleeding are obtained with clean passes of the Fogarty embolectomy catheters, intraoperative completion arteriography is performed to evaluate the adequacy of distal blood flow. Intraoperative administration of a thrombolytic agent directly into the distal vessels may be necessary if small emboli are still present in the runoff vessels. </p><p>If needed, additional exposures of the below-knee popliteal artery at the tibial trifurcation and/or distal tibial/pedal vessels can be used to ensure adequate flow. Passing embolectomy catheters into tibial vessels requires extreme care as these vessels are easily injured. A #2 Fogarty is generally used for tibial vessels. Very distal thrombus can sometimes be treated with localized intra-arterial tPA injection. Spasm of otherwise healthy vessels or dissection of the arteries can occur with embolectomy. If spasm is suspected, intra-arterial administration of a vasodilator such as <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9706" href="/z/d/drug information/9706.html" rel="external">nitroglycerin</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9739" href="/z/d/drug information/9739.html" rel="external">papaverine</a> will often resolve the issue. If a dissection is flow limiting, angioplasty and/or stenting may be required. </p><p>If embolectomy fails, bypass grafting may become necessary, although for purely embolic events without baseline peripheral artery disease, this is rarely necessary. For immediately threatened limbs, prosthetic graft (ie, polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE]) is often chosen to avoid the time needed for vein harvest, which expedites restoration of blood flow with the tradeoff of decreased expected patency.

Compared with open bypass, transcatheter embolectomy with or without adjunctive treatments likely has lower amputation-free survival in cases of acute limb ischemia affecting below-knee vessels as well as in diseased native vessel occlusion similar with other interventions [<a href="#rid48">48</a>]. This is most likely related to the complexity of the presenting disease process rather than a specific failure of the technology, given that open embolectomy also has better outcomes in vessels above compared with below the knee.

Compared with open procedures, the general advantages include less pain, faster recovery time, and less perioperative morbidity and mortality. A combination of open and endovascular approaches can sometimes be used to treat multiple areas suspected to be sources of embolus [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. </p><p>Endovascular stent-grafts have been used to exclude thoracic or abdominal aortic and popliteal sources of lower extremity embolization. At all sites, adequate sealing above and below the affected area is necessary. When a stent-graft is used to cover an area that is suspected of having been an embolic source, it is important to avoid manipulations that may cause intraprocedural embolization.

Most patients will need to be anticoagulated for at least three months. For patients who do not have a surgically correctible cause of their embolic event, the benefits versus risk of anticoagulation need to be considered. Patients with ongoing atrial fibrillation and a prior embolic event are at a significantly increased risk of stroke or other embolic event and often warrant lifelong anticoagulation unless there is some other compelling factor.

However, it is clear that, in spite of optimal therapy, acute embolism is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality [<a href="#rid53">53,54</a>].

Some patients will experience a subclinical progressive loss of outflow vessels from recurrent embolism leading to a chronic peripheral artery disease-like picture. (See <a class="local">'Clinical presentations'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Etiologies</strong> – A variety of etiologies  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef58846" href="/z/d/graphic/58846.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) can potentially lead to embolization of the lower extremities, and understanding these should guide an efficient and thorough clinical evaluation, treatment, and source control. The history and physical examination may be sufficient to determine the most likely etiology and to initiate treatment. (See <a class="local">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Vascular imaging</strong> – We suggest obtaining CT angiography because it provides valuable information about the location of the disease and level of baseline atherosclerotic plaque burden. Even in the setting of acute limb ischemia, CT angiography can usually be quickly accomplished while preparing the patient for intervention, but imaging can be deferred if it will delay treatment. (See <a class="local">'Vascular imaging'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial management</strong> – For those who present with acute limb ischemia, anticoagulation typically with a heparin (bolus followed by infusion) and intravenous fluid therapy should be immediately initiated prior to making plans for intervention. These can be started while awaiting evaluation by a specialist trained to treat the embolic event. (See <a class="local">'Initial management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Approach to limb management</strong> – Options for managing lower extremity embolism include open embolectomy, thrombolysis, and transcatheter thrombectomy. Factors such as anatomy, degree of limb threat, runoff, suspected etiology, and patient factors will guide the choice of one over the other. (See <a class="local">'Approach to limb management'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients without a femoral pulse who have a normal vascular exam on the contralateral side, open embolectomy is generally the best procedure, though exceptions may exist. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients who have embolized or thrombosed their tibial runoff, transcatheter thrombectomy with or without thrombolytic therapy may improve outflow, leading to better options for subsequent open and/or endovascular revascularization. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>For patients whose history suggests that the embolic material is chronic thrombus (eg, mural thrombus from aneurysm, aortic thrombus) or nonthrombotic material (eg, tumor, embolized device fragments), open embolectomy or transcatheter embolectomy are better options compared with thrombolysis. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Subsequent evaluation and treatment</strong> – Once the acute limb issues have been attended to, the subsequent diagnostic evaluation is focused on identifying the suspected embolic source, typically using echocardiography or additional vascular imaging. Once the source is known, additional intervention to remove or exclude the source from the circulation is generally preferred over anticoagulation alone. For patients with coronary heart disease equivalents, treatment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8907" href="/z/d/drug information/8907.html" rel="external">aspirin</a> and statins should be a component of their medical therapy.
