(See <a class="local">'Address presumed cause for hypoxemia'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnostic evaluation</strong> – Once the patient is stable, we perform the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A thorough clinical assessment. (See <a class="local">'History and examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>An ABG and basic laboratory tests (eg, chemistries, complete blood count, liver function tests, coagulation studies, troponin level, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level). (See <a class="local">'Arterial blood gas'</a> above and <a class="local">'Laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Chest imaging (radiography and/or ultrasonography) and electrocardiography. (See <a class="local">'Chest imaging (radiography and/or ultrasonography)'</a> above and <a class="local">'Electrocardiography'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Narrowing the differential</strong> – Following initial testing, the etiology can usually be determined or narrowed to a few possibilities (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef138668" href="/z/d/graphic/138668.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef138669" href="/z/d/graphic/138669.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). If needed, subsequent testing can be appropriately tailored (eg, echocardiogram, computed tomography of the chest and abdomen, specialized cultures, COVID-19 testing, toxin screening). (See <a class="local">'Narrowing the differential'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In some patients, the etiology of hypoxemia may be more subtle or multifactorial and require additional testing. Important considerations include pulmonary embolism, nonrespiratory infections, mechanical shunt, hypo-or hyperthyroidism, pulmonary hypertension (PH), or interstitial or alveolar lung diseases. (See <a class="local">'Patients with unclear etiology after initial testing'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Monitoring</strong> – For patients who are comfortable and receiving minimal oxygen requirements, intermittent monitoring by clinical evaluation every four to six hours is reasonable. For patients who require advanced support, we evaluate clinically every one to two hours and also obtain an ABG after the first one to two hours; we advocate a low threshold for intubation in this population. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Patients who improve</strong> – For patients who improve, we de-escalate oxygen supplementation to the lowest possible level or to the patient's baseline oxygen requirement. We do not routinely perform ambulatory or nocturnal oximetry unless indicated (eg, frail patients, tenuous respiratory status, suspected PH, slowly resolving lung disease). (See <a class="local">'Patients who improve'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Patients with increasing oxygen needs</strong> – For patients with escalating oxygen needs, we either increase oxygen supplementation and/or trial NIV and determine the reason for clinical deterioration (eg, progression or complication of the underlying disorder or second etiology such as fluid overload, pulmonary embolism, aspiration). Should patients fail these noninvasive options, intubation is typically indicated. (See <a class="local">'Patients with escalating oxygen needs'</a> above.)</p><p></p></div><div class="headingAnchor" id="references"><ol id="reference"><li class="breakAll">Kollef M, Isakow W.
