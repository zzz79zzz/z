         Aortic regurgitation (AR) is a common finding in children undergoing echocardiography. It rarely occurs as an isolated lesion since it is usually associated with aortic stenosis (AS) or a ventricular septal defect (VSD). The latter disorders are discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5775.html" rel="external">

         All forms of AR produce a similar hemodynamic abnormality. The inability of the aortic valve leaflets to remain closed during diastole results in a portion of the left ventricular (LV) stroke volume leaking back from the aorta into the LV. The added volume of regurgitant blood produces an increase in LV end-diastolic volume. According to Laplace's law, the increase in LV end-diastolic volume causes an elevation in wall stress. The heart responds with compensatory myocardial hypertrophy, referred to as eccentric LV hypertrophy. Eccentric LV hypertrophy is characterized by elevated LV mass, but normal mass-to-volume ratio, and returns wall stress towards a normal level [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The combination of hypertrophy and chamber enlargement raises the total stroke volume. The net effect is that forward stroke volume and, therefore, cardiac output are initially maintained despite the regurgitant lesion. Although the LV volume is increased, end-diastolic pressure is normal due to an increase in ventricular compliance. Thus, the heart initially adapts well to chronic AR, functioning as a very efficient and compliant high-output pump.
        </p>
        <p>
         Severe AR results in increased end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes. When compensatory eccentric hypertrophy eventually fails to maintain normal wall stress in the face of increasing volumes, systolic function becomes impaired [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Without intervention, progressive LV dysfunction develops. Reduced aortic diastolic pressures from excessive runoff, especially during exercise, may impair coronary perfusion. Increased left atrial pressure may lead to pulmonary edema. (See

         AR commonly occurs following surgical or transcatheter intervention for AS. Among patients with congenital valvar AS who are treated with transcatheter balloon aortic valvulotomy (BAV), most have new or increased AR that, in one report, was moderate to severe in 13 percent after the procedure and in 38 percent at almost four years [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. The risk is increased in patients undergoing repeat BAV. (See

         The physical examination in children with AR is often subtle because most have mild disease. In addition, some of the classic findings in adults are seldom found in children, even in those with moderate to severe AR. Nevertheless, it is useful to review the classic findings that are seen in more severe disease because they can often establish the clinical diagnosis.

         </span>
         Both examination of the peripheral pulses and auscultation of the heart are particularly important. The increased stroke volume results in abrupt distension of the peripheral arteries and an elevation in systolic pressure. Regurgitation back into the left ventricle (LV) then leads to a rapid decline in pressure, with quick collapse of the arteries, and a low diastolic pressure that can fall below 30 mmHg in severe disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         The net effect is a wide pulse pressure, which is manifested on examination as a "water hammer" or Corrigan pulse. This finding may be best appreciated by palpation of the radial or brachial arteries (exaggerated by raising the arm) or the carotid pulses. (See

         Exaggerated or bounding pulses and these physical signs are not specific for AR, since they can be seen in any condition associated with a marked increase in stroke volume, other aortic runoff lesions, or a hyperdynamic circulation. Causes of a hyperdynamic circulation include anemia, fever, thyrotoxicosis, large arteriovenous fistula, patent ductus arteriosus, and severe bradycardia.

         The combination of LV enlargement and forceful systolic function results in the apical impulse being displaced laterally and inferiorly as well as being diffuse and hyperdynamic. A prominent pulsation (and occasionally a thrill) may be felt at the sternal notch due to concurrent dilatation of the ascending aorta.

         The intensity of the murmur does not correlate well with the severity of AR. However, the timing and duration of the murmur may be helpful.

         As the regurgitation becomes more severe, the murmur extends through more of diastole, may become holodiastolic, and is often rougher in quality.

         In very severe regurgitation with ventricular decompensation, the murmur may become soft or even absent. This change in character reflects the near equivalence of aortic diastolic and LV end-diastolic pressures, which markedly diminishes regurgitant flow. A similar situation can occur when AR is acute and the LV end-diastolic pressure is very high.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The site at which the murmur is best heard varies with the cause. The murmur is heard best along the left sternal border, at the third and fourth intercostal space, when AR is due to valvular disease. In contrast, abnormalities of the aortic root produce murmurs that are best heard at the right sternal border and apex.
        </p>
        <p>
         A systolic murmur can be heard in many patients. It typically resembles the ejection type of murmur heard in aortic stenosis (AS), ie, a crescendo-decrescendo harsh murmur beginning after S1. This murmur does not necessarily reflect concurrent AS, since the increased ejection rate and large stroke volume across the aortic valve can lead to a "functional" stenosis. However, as noted above, AR often occurs in association with other cardiac lesions that produce a systolic murmur, such as valvar AS or ventricular septal defect (VSD). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5775.html" rel="external">
          "Valvar aortic stenosis in children"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         A second type of diastolic murmur (the Austin Flint murmur) may also be appreciated. This murmur is a mid- to late-diastolic rumble, heard at the apex. It is the result of antegrade turbulent diastolic blood flow from the left atrium competing with the retrograde regurgitant flow from the aorta. The latter impinges upon the anterior mitral valve leaflet opening, causing some functional stenosis. The murmur may be confused with that of mitral stenosis. Distinguishing features from mitral stenosis include the absence of both a loud S1 and an opening snap of the mitral valve. (See

         Echocardiography is used to diagnose and evaluate the degree of regurgitation. It also evaluates the anatomy of the lesion, identifies any accompanying disorders, and assesses ventricular function (

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Serial echocardiographic assessments are used to guide management, including timing of aortic valve surgery, if necessary [

        </p>
        <p>
         Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is a useful adjunctive imaging test, particularly for patients with poor acoustic windows or those with equivocal findings on echocardiography. CMR provides accurate measurement of the degree of regurgitation (regurgitant fraction), left ventricle (LV) chamber volumes, and systolic function. In a series of adult patients with chronic AR, CMR resulted in the reclassification of AR severity in some patients compared with echocardiography and had the potential to add important diagnostic and prognostic information [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Other noninvasive tests reveal abnormalities but provide only adjunctive additional information to echocardiography. The chest radiograph is often remarkable for a prominent ascending aorta. An enlarged LV may be seen with significant regurgitation. With moderate or greater regurgitation, the electrocardiogram frequently reveals LV hypertrophy and, with advanced disease, ST-T changes due to ischemia. Cardiac catheterization is usually unnecessary; it is used only to evaluate associated lesions.

         </span>
         Few studies are available on the clinical course of AR. Most cases of AR are mild, symptoms are unusual, and the patient remains stable for many years. Progression occurs in some patients, while infective endocarditis may cause acute progression.
        </p>
        <p>
         The natural history of isolated congenital AR was described in seven children who did not have Marfan syndrome [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The diagnosis was made in infancy in five. Three patients were asymptomatic through follow-up at 8, 10, and 20 years, while four required valve replacement at age 3, 10, 15, and 20 years for progressive severity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Dilatation of the aorta is common in children with Marfan syndrome and other connective tissue disorders such as Loeys-Dietz and Ehlers-Danlos syndromes and may progress with time. One report followed 52 patients with Marfan syndrome through childhood and adolescence [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Aortic root dilation was present in 43 and AR in 13 (25 percent). The AR was diagnosed at a mean age of 14.6 years (none before five years) and was initially mild in all but one patient. At a mean follow-up of 7.9 years, aortic abnormalities progressed in 13, requiring aortic surgery in 10 for aortic root dilation or dissection. There is further progression in adulthood [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. (See

          "Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis of Marfan syndrome and related disorders"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Dilation of the aortic root and/or the ascending aorta are also frequently encountered in patients with bicuspid aortic valve and can similarly contribute to progressive AR. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8157.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of bicuspid aortic valve in adults", section on 'Aortic regurgitation'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         As noted above, AR can occur in association with ventricular septal defect (VSD) (see
         <a class="local">
          'Etiology'
         </a>
         above). One report described long-term follow-up (1946 to 1989) in 92 patients who had VSD and audible AR [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Onset of AR occurred at a median age of 5.3 years. The aortic valve was bicuspid in 10 percent and tricuspid in the remainder. Surgery was performed in 72 patients, including VSD closure and valvuloplasty in 50, VSD closure and aortic valve replacement in 15, and VSD closure alone in seven. (See

         Children with AR should be followed by a pediatric cardiologist at least yearly to monitor for the development of symptoms, increasing left ventricular (LV) dilation, or worsening LV systolic function. More frequent evaluation is recommended in patients with moderate to severe AR or for those in whom the rate of change in their regurgitation is unclear.
        </p>
        <p>
         The majority of children remain asymptomatic, even with severe AR. As a result, serial echocardiographic assessment, including measurement of ventricular dimensions, volumes, and function, is crucial in determining the timing of surgical repair. As discussed above, monitoring with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) provides more accurate measurement of the degree of regurgitation, particularly in patients with poor acoustic windows.
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients who develop symptoms of heart failure, develop signs or symptoms of ischemia with exertion, or have a decline in LV function are generally referred for surgical intervention, as discussed below. (See

         The use of ACE inhibitors in this setting is supported by limited observational data in children and by indirect evidence from studies in adults with chronic AR.

In a report of 20 children (mean age 14.3 years) with asymptomatic chronic AR who were treated with

         ]. Captopril therapy was also associated with significant reductions in LV end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions, end-diastolic and end-systolic indexes, and LV mass index. There are no published data supporting the long-term use of vasodilators in patients with less severe AR in the absence of clinically significant LV enlargement.

          Valve repair

         – Valve repair is effective for AR caused by balloon aortic valvulotomy (BAV) in children with congenital aortic stenosis (AS). Valve repair can also be used for truncal valves or prolapse of one or more cusps associated with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) [

        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In one report, 21 patients ages 9 months to 15 years had surgical repair of AR following BAV [

         ]. The extent of AR, LV end-diastolic dimension, and proximal regurgitant jet/aortic annulus diameter ratio were significantly decreased following repair. All patients survived and were asymptomatic at an average follow-up of 30 months. None required reoperation for late failure, although 20 percent needed reintervention by three years.

          Valve replacement
         </strong>
         – Aortic valve replacement usually requires a mechanical prosthesis and systemic anticoagulation. Bioprosthetic valves reduce the need for anticoagulation but have a failure rate in children as high as 20 percent due to valve degeneration and progressive calcification [

          18,19
         </a>
         ]. Variations of this technique that include single-leaflet replacements have been described. A small case series in pediatric patients showed encouraging early results [

          Causes
         </strong>
         – Aortic regurgitation (AR) is a common finding in children undergoing echocardiography. It rarely occurs as an isolated lesion. AR is most commonly associated with bicuspid aortic valve, aortic stenosis (AS; particularly in children who have undergone balloon valvotomy), or a ventricular septal defect (VSD). AR also can be seen in patients with Marfan syndrome and other connective tissue disorders, genetic disorders (eg, Turner syndrome and osteogenesis imperfecta), other congenital heart defects (eg, tetralogy of Fallot, truncus arteriosus), and acquired infections such as endocarditis or rheumatic heart disease.

          Physical findings
         </strong>
         – The physical examination varies depending upon the degree of AR. The classical findings of AR consist of wide pulse pressure, lateral and inferior displacement of a diffuse and hyperdynamic apical pulse, and the presence of a high-pitched diastolic murmur (which is often blowing in quality) (

          Diagnosis
         </strong>
         – The diagnosis of AR is made by echocardiography. Serial echocardiographic assessments are used to guide management, including the need and timing of aortic valve surgery. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is a useful adjunctive imaging test, particularly in patients with poor acoustic windows or those with equivocal findings on echocardiography. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Clinical course
         </strong>
         – Most pediatric cases of AR are mild, asymptomatic, and remain stable over many years. In children with bicuspid aortic valve or connective tissue disorder (eg, Marfan syndrome), AR may be associated with dilatation of the aorta, which can progress over time. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Clinical course'

         above.)

         <strong>
          Management
         </strong>
         – Children with AR should be followed yearly by a pediatric cardiologist for the development of symptoms, increasing left ventricular (LV) dilation, or worsening LV systolic function. More frequent evaluation is recommended in patients with moderate to severe AR or for those in whom the rate of change in their regurgitation is unclear. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Monitoring'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Medical management
         </strong>
         – For children with moderate or greater AR, symptomatic AR, and/or AR associated with hypertension, we suggest vasodilator therapy (

          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). We suggest an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (eg,

          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). This is because ACE inhibitors are usually are well tolerated in children.

          Surgical management
         </strong>
         – For children with signs or symptoms of heart failure, evidence of ischemia with exertion, or decline in LV systolic function, we suggest surgical valve intervention (ie, valve repair or replacement) (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). The choice between repair and replacement depends upon the cause of AR and the presence of other anatomic abnormalities. (See
