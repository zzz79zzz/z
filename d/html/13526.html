         Subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy (SCIT) may be administered using several different schedules. This topic review will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of accelerated immunotherapy schedules and the indications for their use and will provide several specific examples of protocols that have been used successfully for aeroallergen SCIT. There are few data addressing how frequently accelerated schedules are used by allergy specialists in different areas of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
         Traditional SCIT schedules and accelerated schedules for Hymenoptera SCIT are discussed separately. (See

         SCIT is divided into two phases: build-up and maintenance. Accelerated schedules of immunotherapy involve shortening the length of the build-up phase, while the maintenance phase remains the same.
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The build-up phase involves serial injections of increasing amounts of allergen. During this phase, tolerance to the allergen is gradually induced, and the patient's immune response to the allergen is modified from a T helper type 2 (Th2) phenotype to a T helper type 1 (Th1) phenotype [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. In conventional SCIT schedules, the build-up phase involves one or two injections per week and lasts three to six months. Conservative and moderate examples of conventional SCIT schedules are shown  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef60803 graphicRef72555" href="/z/d/graphic/60803.html" rel="external">
          table 1A-B
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         The maintenance phase of SCIT involves ongoing injections of an immunizing dose of allergen, usually at intervals of three to six weeks. During the maintenance phase, the immune transformation becomes complete. This phase is usually extended for a period of three to five years because shorter durations of treatment are associated with an increased likelihood of symptomatic relapse once therapy is discontinued [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The length of the build-up phase depends upon the frequency of the injections and the incremental dose increase between consecutive injections. Thus, accelerated schedules involve administering more injections per visit, increasing the dose more between consecutive injections, or both.
        </p>
        <p>
         Accelerated schedules generally fall into one of two categories:
        </p>
        <p class="headingAnchor" id="H11675165">
         <span class="h2">

         </span>
         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Cluster schedules involve the administration of several injections (two to three) of increasing dose at 30-minute intervals in one day  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef69088" href="/z/d/graphic/69088.html" rel="external">
          table 2
         </a>
         ). The patient typically returns on one or more
         <strong>
          nonconsecutive
         </strong>
         days, several days per week. Two days per week is a common approach, although up to four days per week (ie, every other day) is also possible. Maintenance is achieved in four to eight weeks, depending upon the spacing of the visits.

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Rush schedules involve administering injections of increasing dose at 15- to 60-minute intervals over one to three consecutive days until a target dose (usually slightly less than the maintenance dose) is achieved. The remainder of the build-up phase proceeds using a traditional schedule until maintenance is achieved, usually in less than eight weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ultra-rush immunotherapy is an even more rapid dosing schedule for immunotherapy, in which an effective maintenance dose is reached within one day. Ultra-rush is usually applied to Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy. Accelerated forms of venom immunotherapy are reviewed separately. (See

         Predictable advantages of accelerated schedules include increased patient convenience and more rapid induction of clinical benefit:

         <strong>
          Greater convenience
         </strong>
         – Inconvenience is the most common reason patients discontinue conventional immunotherapy, and accelerated schedules involve fewer office visits.

         <strong>
          More rapid onset of clinical benefit
         </strong>
         – Accelerated schedules induce the immunologic changes that occur during the build-up phase more rapidly than conventional schedules. Thus, patients experience clinical benefit sooner.

         <strong>
          Reduced risk of dosing errors
         </strong>
         – Dosing errors are one of the leading causes of systemic allergic reactions during SCIT. Rush schedules involve fewer doses overall during the build-up phase, and these doses are administered over a more concentrated time period, so dosing errors are reduced.

         <a href="#rid4">
          4

         Accelerated forms of immunotherapy should not be recommended to patients who are at increased risk for developing systemic allergic reactions in response to the injections or who have comorbid medical conditions that would reduce their chances of surviving anaphylaxis. Accelerated protocols are not appropriate for patients with any of the following:

          RISK OF SYSTEMIC ALLERGIC REACTIONS

         The primary disadvantage of accelerated immunotherapy schedules with aeroallergens is the increased risk of systemic allergic reactions during the condensed build-up phase. There are no convincing data that one type of aeroallergen is better tolerated than another (eg, perennial allergens versus pollens) in accelerated protocols.
        </p>
        <p>
         Accelerated schedules for aeroallergen SCIT are associated with higher rates of systemic allergic reactions compared with conventional schedules, although most reactions are mild. The use of premedications can significantly reduce the incidence of systemic allergic reactions, but even with premedication and the fact that low-risk patients are generally chosen for accelerated protocols, systemic allergic reaction rates are higher than those of conventional schedules. In general, the most accelerated protocols have the highest rates of systemic allergic reactions.

         Systemic allergic reactions occur in up to one-third of patients treated with rush protocols, even with premedication and careful patient selection, although most are mild. Specific protocols and reaction rates are reviewed below. (See
         <a class="local">

         </span>
         Systemic allergic reactions occur in up to 6 percent of patients in most studies of cluster protocols. This rate is similar to that seen with most conventional SCIT protocols using traditional weekly build-up schedules and multiple allergens [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11-17
         </a>
         ]. Systemic allergic reactions induced by SCIT using conventional schedules and risk factors for these reactions are reviewed in greater detail separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/394.html" rel="external">
          "Anaphylaxis induced by subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy"

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         With both accelerated and conventional schedules of SCIT, the risk of systemic allergic reactions is greatest during the build-up phase. The vulnerability seen during this initial phase has been attributed to the fact that the patient is exposed to even more of the allergen than at baseline because he or she is receiving it through the immunotherapy in addition to natural exposure before immunologic protection has been achieved. Therefore, shortening the build-up phase would be desirable in theory [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. However, giving the same amount of allergen in a shorter period of time necessitates a more intense exposure, and patients are variable in their ability to tolerate this.

         Systemic allergic reactions with accelerated protocols are uncommon following the first few injections. Instead, they tend to occur in the final doses of the 1:10 volume per volume (v/v) strength or in the 1:1 v/v strength (if the protocol extends into this strength).

         A 2016 retrospective review of 11,982 patients compared systemic allergic reaction rates over five years for 9229 patients in a private allergy practice who received weekly build-up, 2576 who received nine-visit cluster, and 177 who were given two-day rush [

They also received prednisone (30 mg twice daily) and ranitidine (150 mg twice daily) on all three days. Younger children received age- and weight-adjusted doses. Seventy-three percent of children in the placebo group experienced systemic allergic reactions, compared with 22 percent in the premedication group, and the reactions were more severe, although all responded to treatment. The systemic allergic reactions began between 30 and 120 minutes after the injections, and the most common eliciting dose was 0.3 mL of 1:10 v/v. The incidence of local reactions was also reduced by premedication.

         Following this study, most subsequent studies of rush protocols have used combinations of H1 antihistamines and glucocorticoids for premedication.

For that reason, we do not recommend initiating accelerated SCIT during a pollen season if the patient is to receive injections for that specific pollen, because during this season, the patient is exposed to pollen in the air in addition to the doses of immunotherapy, resulting in an increased total cumulative dose of pollen exposure and an increased risk for systemic allergic reactions. Given that immunotherapy is a nonurgent procedure, all steps should be taken to perform accelerated SCIT during a time that is most convenient and safe for both the patient and the clinician.

         The composition of the immunotherapy prescription and preparation of the extracts are not different from what would be used for conventional immunotherapy, although it is desirable to limit the number of injections required to deliver the relevant allergens. It is the authors' practice to use solutions mixed for each patient individually, combining compatible allergens, usually into one or two solutions. If this results in two solutions, we administer one solution per arm. In the authors' practice, we do not use more than two solutions, because the patient's arms already become quite sore from the multiple injections required.

         The following protocols have been used successfully in clinical practice and reported in the literature. In these protocols, concentrations have been expressed for the purposes of comparison using an accepted nomenclature system, which calls for a volume per volume (v/v) representation (with 1:1 representing the undiluted maintenance concentrate "red vial") [

          15

        </p>
        <p>
         Ideally, concentrations are assigned a standard color vial used to represent that v/v concentration: silver 1:10,000, green 1:1000, blue 1:100, yellow 1:10, and red 1:1 [

         , based upon patient/insurance preferences). The time between doses was lowered from 30 to 15 minutes. After the rush component was completed, build-up continued with a conventional weekly schedule until maintenance was reached, as in other rush protocols. In a report of 893 patients treated with this approach, 2 percent (18 of 893 patients) experienced systemic allergic reactions (which were not graded), although one-half of these reactions occurred during the conventional build-up phase, after the rush portion. One patient had anaphylactic shock and required

         It is common practice to terminate cluster or rush immunotherapy (RIT) in a patient who develops a systemic allergic reaction and convert to a conventional schedule. Other approaches have not been reported.
        </p>
        <p>
         As with conventional immunotherapy, patients who develop systemic allergic reactions should be treated for anaphylaxis and observed for a period of time once symptoms have resolved. Patients with mild-to-moderate systemic allergic reactions who respond promptly and completely to treatment can usually be observed in the clinic for two hours and discharged to home. However, it may be more appropriate to hospitalize a patient with a more severe reaction or with symptoms that do not respond promptly to treatment. Likewise, patients who live far from medical care or have little home support may be better served by hospitalization. There is a risk of biphasic reactions with anaphylaxis from any cause, and the risk factors for recurrent symptoms are unclear, although these have rarely been reported in the RIT literature. Deciding on the best immediate aftercare for a patient with a systemic allergic reaction obviously requires clinical judgement. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/396.html" rel="external">
          "Biphasic and protracted anaphylaxis", section on 'Possible risk factors'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         The patient should then return in one week to resume injections and should be changed to the conventional build-up schedule. We (the authors) believe it important not to extend this time period by even a few days, as it is our observation that patients who wait longer than one week tend to experience more systemic allergic reactions in the remaining build-up. We resume treatment with the dose that caused the reaction. Patients should premedicate with an H1 antihistamine prior to that visit and all future visits.

         A novel approach has been reported, in which the accelerated build-up portion of the immunotherapy is administered with a subcutaneous infusion pump, rather than as individual injections [
         <a href="#rid34">
          34
         </a>
         ]. The study described 46 cat- and 20 dog-allergic patients who received three sessions (1:10 (v/v), 1:2 (v/v), and 1:1 (v/v) of the maintenance dose concentration) of subcutaneous infusions, each over 30 minutes, without premedication. This was followed by monthly maintenance injections. Of the patients who received cat extract, 8.1 percent had a systemic reaction; none of the dog-allergic patients had systemic reactions. These rates are comparable to the studies of other accelerated protocols with premedication, suggesting that infusions may be a safer way to administer the build-up doses. While this approach may provide greater control of extract absorption, further investigation is needed before it can be recommended, and it would be helpful to know if premedication could reduce the systemic reaction rate further.

         Cluster schedules involve the administration of several injections of increasing dose in one day. The patient returns on one or more nonconsecutive days, two to four days per week, and maintenance dose is achieved in four to eight weeks  (

         Rush schedules involve administering injections of increasing dose at 15- to 60-minute intervals over one to three consecutive days until a target dose (usually slightly less than the maintenance dose) is achieved. The remainder of the build-up phase proceeds using a traditional schedule until maintenance is achieved, usually in less than eight weeks.

         <strong>
          Safety and contraindications
         </strong>
         – Compared with traditional aeroallergen SCIT schedules, accelerated schedules carry an increased risk of systemic allergic reactions. Accordingly, accelerated aeroallergen SCIT should not be offered to patients who are at increased risk for developing systemic allergic reactions in response to the injections or who have comorbid medical conditions that would reduce their chances of surviving anaphylaxis.

          Premedication
         </strong>
         – To reduce the incidence of systemic allergic reactions, we recommend premedication for all patients undergoing accelerated forms of immunotherapy (

          Grade 2B
         </a>

         For patients undergoing rush immunotherapy (RIT), we suggest a more extensive regimen of premedication that includes an H1 antihistamine and a glucocorticoid, starting at least one day before the day of injections (

          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Most protocols administer a combination of an oral glucocorticoid and H1 and H2 antihistamines, with or without an antileukotriene agent. (See
