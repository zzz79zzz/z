         Untreated HIV infection and HIV-related immunosuppression significantly increase the risk of acquiring opportunistic infections due to bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. These opportunistic infections (OIs) were a major source of morbidity and mortality in patients with HIV prior to the development of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) and still occur today, mostly in patients who are not receiving ART. Strategies for the prevention of OIs involve the use of antimicrobials, immunizations, and public health measures.
        </p>
        <p>
         An overview of these different strategies will be reviewed here. More detailed discussions of the treatment and prevention of specific opportunistic infections are discussed elsewhere.

         Antimicrobial agents can be administered to decrease the risk of developing an OI.

         ART is the most important strategy for preventing OIs. The widespread use of effective ART starting in the mid-1990s has led to a dramatic reduction in the incidence of OIs as illustrated in the studies below:

          ●
         </span>
         In a cohort study of 2410 patients in Switzerland from 1995 to 1997, the incidence of any OI decreased from 15.1 per 100 person-years in the six months before initiating ART to 7.7 and 2.6 per 100 person-years in the first three and six months after starting ART, respectively [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. The rate continued to decrease and was 2.2 per 100 person-years between 9 and 15 months after starting ART.

         In a multicenter study of more than 8500 patients with HIV in the United States, the rate of OIs declined from 140 per 1000 person-years in 1995 (prior to the introduction of potent ART) to less than 20 per 1000 person-years in 2007 [

         An analysis of 1255 patients who had at least one CD4 count &lt;100 cells/microL found that the incidence of a major OI (

          Pneumocystis jirovecii
         </em>
         pneumonia, MAC, and/or cytomegalovirus retinitis) declined from 21.9 per 100 person-years in 1994 to 3.7 per 100 person-years by mid-1997 [

         Because ART results in the restoration of cellular immunity, the vast majority of patients who discontinue antimicrobial therapy after adequate immune recovery are no longer at risk for developing an OI. (See

         Restoring cellular immunity with antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the best way to prevent OIs. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3773.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         A number of infections can also be prevented by immunization (eg,
         <em>
          Streptococcus pneumoniae
         </em>
         , hepatitis B virus). Vaccine efficacy may be compromised in advanced disease; thus, some providers may choose to wait on certain immunizations until ART has been started and some degree of immune recovery has occurred. A detailed discussion of immunizations in patients with HIV is found elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3706.html" rel="external">

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Additional preventive strategies are needed for individuals with HIV who have evidence of significant immunosuppression. Such patients are usually those who are not receiving ART (eg, those who are unaware of their diagnosis, have recently started therapy, or are prescribed ART but are not adherent to their treatment). These additional strategies include:

         <strong>
          Avoiding exposure
         </strong>
         − For certain pathogens, patients can prevent infection by avoiding exposure. As an example, patients without evidence of prior exposure to
         <em>
          Toxoplasma gondii
         </em>
         should avoid contact with cat feces (eg, changing cat litter) or eating undercooked meat. The risk of infection with other pathogens can also be reduced by appropriate precautions; such pathogens include
         <em>
          Bartonella henselae, Bartonella quintana, Coccidioides
         </em>
         spp

          Antimicrobial therapy

         In selected rare patients (eg, those with highly chaotic psychosocial situations) who are at extremely high risk for poor adherence, we may elect to prescribe only ART at first, and not risk distracting the patient with agents for OI prevention. Since ART is the most effective intervention to improve prognosis and prevent OIs, clinicians should prioritize HIV ART. If preventive therapy is still needed once they start ART, it can still be initiated at a later time.

Furthermore, some patients may have asymptomatic infection with MAC that becomes evident after starting ART due to the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. In this setting, if single-drug therapy with
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9041" href="/z/d/drug information/9041.html" rel="external">
          azithromycin
         </a>
         were used for prophylaxis, it might select for macrolide drug resistance. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3755.html" rel="external">
          "Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections in persons with HIV", section on 'Treatment failure'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, on rare occasion, there may be a temporary delay in initiating ART among those with a CD4 count &lt;50 cells/microL (eg, patient refusal). Unless there are concerns that the patient may have active MAC infection (eg, fevers, weight loss), MAC prophylaxis should be initiated and continued until ART is started. If there is concern for active infection, a mycobacterial blood culture should first be obtained, and prophylaxis should be delayed for 7 to 10 days, pending the results. A more detailed discussion of MAC prophylaxis is presented elsewhere. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3755.html" rel="external">

         Patients should be educated about the signs and symptoms of opportunistic infections and/or screened for evidence of disease, especially if they are severely immunocompromised. As an example, we do not administer therapy to prevent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection to those who are seropositive because of cost, risk of resistance, and lack of proven survival benefit. Such patients should be educated about the signs and symptoms of CMV disease, such as CMV retinitis (eg, increased floaters, decreased visual acuity). In addition, some experts recommend yearly ophthalmologic exams for all patients with a CD4 count &lt;50 cells/microL to identify CMV and/or other infections that have ocular manifestations. However, this screening strategy for asymptomatic patients is typically not needed since most patients who start ART will have prompt recovery of their CD4 cell count to &gt;50 cells/microL. (See

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10

         Prior to the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART), opportunistic infections (OIs) were the principal cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with HIV. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Epidemiology of opportunistic infections'

         </span>
         Restoring cellular immunity with ART is the best way to prevent OIs. However, additional strategies are needed for individuals with HIV who have evidence of significant immunocompromise. Such strategies include avoiding specific exposures and/or the use of antimicrobial agents or vaccines. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Approach to infection prevention'
         </a>

         Antimicrobial therapy is typically initiated according to CD4 cell count thresholds
         <strong>
          .
         </strong>
         For certain patients, the decision to initiate antimicrobial therapy also depends upon prior exposure to the pathogen. (See
         <a class="local">
          'When to administer antimicrobial therapy'

         Patients should be educated about the signs and symptoms of opportunistic infections and/or screened for evidence of disease, especially if they are severely immunocompromised. (See
