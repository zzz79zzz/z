The public has become well aware of this relationship and many have embarked on voluntary exercise programs based upon the assumption that exercise will lead to effective prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Regular physical exercise is often recommended as a means of primary and secondary ASCVD prevention [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>].</p><p>The role of exercise and fitness in the primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD will be reviewed here. Overall benefits and risks associated with exercise, specific guidance on engaging in exercise for adults, and the adverse cardiovascular effects of sedentary behavior (ie, prolonged sitting) are presented separately [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2786.html" rel="external">"The benefits and risks of aerobic exercise"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/120020.html" rel="external">"Exercise prescription and guidance for adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/107636.html" rel="external">"Exercise for adults: Terminology, patient assessment, and medical clearance"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2975783342"><span class="h1">OUR APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Both individuals with and without known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) benefit from life-long regular physical activity. In the settings of both primary and secondary prevention, we encourage at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week. We also encourage incorporating resistance training (muscle strengthening activity) at least twice weekly, as it may confer additional cardiovascular benefit [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Type, intensity, and duration of exercise'</a> below and <a class="local">'Resistance training'</a> below.)</p><p>We encourage individuals who are unable to engage in aerobic physical activity to reduce sedentary behavior and engage in lower intensity activities, such as walking. Engaging in as little as one hour per week of exercise can significantly lower the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and mortality.</p><p>Exercise is contraindicated in those with severe, unstable, or life-threatening cardiovascular conditions, including unstable angina, high-grade arrhythmias, and decompensated heart failure. Prior to initiating vigorous physical activity, patients should undergo risk assessment with a physical activity history and, in some cases, exercise testing. A general approach to assessing individuals for participation in exercise appears in an algorithm and is discussed separately  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116688" href="/d/graphic/116688.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>) (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/107636.html" rel="external">"Exercise for adults: Terminology, patient assessment, and medical clearance", section on 'Medical assessment and clearance for exercise'</a>). Patients who have recently experienced an acute coronary event warrant special consideration for risk stratification for engaging in exercise. This is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/67.html" rel="external">"Overview of the nonacute management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction", section on 'Stress testing'</a>.)</p><p>These recommendations are consistent with guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h1">PRIMARY PREVENTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A number of studies have shown a strong inverse relationship between leisure time activity and energy expenditure, habitual exercise, and fitness and the risk of coronary disease and death  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef51658" href="/d/graphic/51658.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) [<a href="#rid10">10-33</a>]. Although most observations were made in men, studies suggest similar cardiovascular benefit from exercise and fitness in women [<a href="#rid10">10,11,20-24</a>], across different racial groups [<a href="#rid21">21,30</a>], in older adult patients [<a href="#rid33">33</a>], and in different countries around the world [<a href="#rid6">6-8,30,34</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h2">Benefits of exercise</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Exercise is associated with reductions in cardiovascular mortality and events. The overall benefit of exercise on the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) was demonstrated in a report from the INTERHEART study of patients from 52 countries; regular physical activity was associated with an odds ratio for first MI of 0.86 [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Lack of such activity accounted for 12 percent of the population-attributable risk.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h3">Type, intensity, and duration of exercise</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although virtually any type of exercise is beneficial, more intense and frequent exercise generally confers greater cardiovascular benefit [<a href="#rid26">26,35</a>]. We encourage a combination of aerobic activity and resistance training. Nevertheless, engaging in as little as one hour per week of exercise can significantly lower the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and mortality. (See <a class="local">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Types – </strong>Although multiple types of exercise have been associated with cardiovascular benefit, the combination of moderate to vigorous physical activity with resistance training has been associated with optimal clinical outcomes.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Aerobic exercise – In a cohort of 44,452 male health professionals (age 40 to 75), several types of aerobic exercise were associated with a significant reduction in CHD risk [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Running for one hour or more per week – RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.44-0.77</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Rowing for one hour or more per week – RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.68-0.99</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Brisk walking for 30 minutes or more per day – RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.67-1.00</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Lifting weights for 30 minutes or more per week – RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.61-0.98</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Running may be particularly beneficial. In a prospective observational cohort study of 55,137 persons (mean age 44 years; 26 percent women), participants completed a four-question survey regarding the duration, distance, frequency, and speed of any running or jogging that they performed [<a href="#rid35">35</a>]. After a mean follow-up of nearly 15 years, runners had a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular mortality compared with nonrunners (hazard ratio [HR] 0.55 [95% CI 0.46-0.65]). The benefit was similar for all runners, even those who ran less than 51 minutes per week.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Resistance training – In a nationwide prospective cohort study (N = 500,705) that compared the cardiovascular benefits of various types of exercise, the combination of muscle strengthening activity (MSA) and moderate and/or vigorous physical activity was associated with optimal reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Trials have also demonstrated that adding resistance training to aerobic physical activity causes greater reductions in cardiovascular risk factors (eg, hemoglobin A1C, lipid levels, and blood pressure) than aerobic physical activity alone [<a href="#rid7">7,36</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Timing</strong> – Different patterns of physical activity appear to confer similar cardiovascular benefits. A retrospective analysis of 89,573 individuals in the UK Biobank cohort compared a "weekend warrior" pattern (at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week with at least 50 percent occurring over 1 to 2 days) with a "regular" pattern (at least 150 minutes of physical activity distributed more evenly during the week) [<a href="#rid37">37</a>]. Both "weekend warrior" and "regular" patterns were associated with similarly lower rates of incident atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke, compared with physical activity of less than 150 minutes per week.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Quantity – </strong>Greater exercise is associated with larger reductions in CHD risk. As an example, an observational study of male runners found a 30 percent lower estimated 10-year CHD risk in runners who averaged more than 64 km/week (40 miles/week), compared with those who averaged less than 15 km/week (9.3 miles/week) (absolute risk difference of 2 percent) [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. Similarly, in the above-mentioned cohort study analyzing the cardiovascular benefits of various combinations of exercise type and quantity, the optimal quantity for reducing cardiovascular mortality was more than 150 minutes of moderate aerobic physical activity plus some vigorous aerobic physical activity plus two or more sessions of MSA weekly [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Intensity</strong> – The cardiometabolic benefits of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) are superior or at least comparable to the traditional moderate-intensity continuous exercise [<a href="#rid39">39,40</a>]. HIIT, defined as intense bouts of exercise that elicit ≥80 percent maximal heart rate, interspersed by periods of lower-intensity exercise or by rest, improves cardiometabolic health in a time-efficient manner. At least 12 weeks of HIIT has been shown to significantly improve aerobic capacity (maximum oxygen uptake), resting blood pressure, heart rate, and waist circumference and percent body fat in overweight/obese population [<a href="#rid40">40</a>].</p><p></p><p>The range of findings on the beneficial effects of exercise in different groups can be illustrated by the following observations.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H97910739"><span class="h3">Men</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Physical activity habits were analyzed in 10,269 Harvard alumni (mean age 58) in a retrospective study over 12 years [<a href="#rid14">14-16</a>]. Those men who engaged in moderately vigorous sports activity (defined as total physical activity levels &gt;4200 kJ/week or brisk walking, recreational cycling or swimming, home repair, and yard work for 30 minutes per day on most days) had a 23 percent lower risk of death than those who were less active. The improvement in survival with exercise was equivalent and additive to other lifestyle measures such as cessation of smoking, control of hypertension, and avoidance of obesity. This reduction in risk was also seen in men with multiple coronary risk factors [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p>Regular walking also appears to be beneficial in older men. This was illustrated in a report from the Honolulu Heart Program of 707 retired nonsmoking men (mean age 69) who were capable of participating in a low-intensity activity on a daily basis [<a href="#rid41">41</a>]. The distance walked was measured at baseline and mortality data, then collected over a 12-year period. After adjustment for age, men who walked more than two miles per day (range two to eight miles [3.2 to 12.8 km]) had a significantly lower mortality rate than those who walked less the one mile (1.6 km) per day (23.8 versus 40.5 percent, risk factor adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.8).</p><p>The individual's perception of the intensity of physical activity also appears to affect risk. In a review of 7337 men (mean age 66 years) who were followed for a mean of 5.3 years [<a href="#rid17">17</a>], the men who perceived their exercise intensity as moderate or strong had a significant reduction in their adjusted risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) compared with those who perceived their exercise intensity as weak or less intense (RR 0.66 to 0.72). This relationship applied even to men who were not fulfilling the current recommendations for exercise intensity and duration.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1621647591"><span class="h3">Women</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Nurses' Health Study of 72,488 women between 40 and 65 years of age found that brisk walking or vigorous exercise was inversely related to the risk of a coronary event; in a multivariate analysis, women in increasing quintile groups for energy expenditure had age-adjusted RRs for coronary events of 0.88, 0.81, 0.74, and 0.66, indicating a graded benefit from exercise [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Sedentary women who became active in mid-life or later had a lower incidence of coronary events compared with those who remained inactive.</p><p>Virtually identical findings were noted in a review of over 70,000 postmenopausal women in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study in which prolonged sitting predicted an increase in cardiovascular risk [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p>Healthy women also benefit from light to moderate exercise; the benefit is again related to the duration of exercise. This was demonstrated in a review of almost 40,000 healthy women (mean age 54 years) in the Women's Health Study [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. With a multivariate analysis, the RRs of CHD for walking 1 to 59 minutes, 1 to 1.5 hours, and 2 or more hours per week were 0.86, 0.49, and 0.48, respectively; there was no association with walking pace.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1908568962"><span class="h3">Twins</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Finnish Twin Cohort study of almost 8000 same-sex twin pairs found an odds ratio for death of 0.66 in occasional exercisers and 0.44 in conditioning exercisers compared with their sedentary twins [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Conditioning exercisers were defined as those who reported exercising at least six times per month with an intensity corresponding to at least vigorous walking for a mean duration of 30 minutes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h2">Benefits of fitness</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In addition to the amount of exercise, the degree of cardiovascular fitness, as determined by the duration of exercise and maximal oxygen uptake on a treadmill compared with age- and sex-specific normal values, is also associated with a reduction in CHD risk and overall and cardiovascular mortality [<a href="#rid10">10,12,17,23,24,27-29,31,32,42,43</a>]. Although early-phase clinical trials show significant cardiometabolic benefits of HIIT, long-term clinical trials to investigate the effects of HIIT on morbidity and mortality are warranted.</p><p>This section will emphasize studies evaluating the relationship between fitness and long-term outcomes in asymptomatic adults. The importance of exercise capacity when exercise testing in performed in patients with known or suspected CHD is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1548.html" rel="external">"Prognostic features of stress testing in patients with known or suspected coronary disease", section on 'Exercise capacity'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Men</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The importance of fitness in men has been illustrated in numerous observational studies, all of which have shown an inverse relationship between level of fitness and mortality [<a href="#rid12">12,29,31,42,44</a>]. In the largest study, 18,102 men (mean age 58.4 years) underwent a symptom-limited exercise test without evidence of ischemia between 1986 and 2011 and were followed for a median of 10.8 years [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. A threshold group of patients were identified whose level of fitness was associated with no change in mortality (compared with the general population), with all-cause mortality inversely and significantly associated with level of fitness as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Least fit – &gt;2 metabolic equivalents (METs) below threshold (HR for mortality 1.52; 95% CI 1.39-1.67)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Low-fit – 0 to 2 METS below threshold (HR 1.21; 95% CI 1.12-1.31)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Moderate-fit – 0 to 2 METS above threshold (HR 0.71; 95% CI 0.65-0.78)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fit – 2.1 to 4 METs above threshold (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.54-0.70)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Most fit – &gt;4 METs above threshold (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.39-0.55)</p><p></p><p>For each additional 1 MET in exercise capacity, mortality risk was 12 percent lower. Age-specific exercise thresholds identifying fitness were established in this cohort and serve as a useful guide to interpreting a patient's level of fitness following a standard exercise test:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Age &lt;50 years – 8 to 9 METs</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Age 50 to 59 years – 7 to 8 METs</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Age 60 to 69 years – 6 to 7 METs</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Age ≥70 years – 5 to 6 METs</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h3">Women</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Similar benefits from fitness have been described in women [<a href="#rid10">10,11,23,24,42,43,45</a>]. The magnitude of this effect is illustrated by the following observations.</p><p>A report from a Lipid Research Clinics study included 2994 asymptomatic women (mean age 47) who underwent exercise testing at study entry and were then followed for 20 years [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. There were 427 deaths (14 percent), of which 147 (5 percent) were due to cardiovascular causes. Exercise-induced ST segment depression (≥1.0 mm) did not increase the risk of cardiovascular death (age-adjusted HR 1.02). By contrast, women who were below the median for either exercise capacity or heart rate recovery, both of which were considered measures of fitness, were at increased risk: those below the median for both variables were at highest risk (multivariable-adjusted HR 3.5 compared with those above the median for both variables).</p><p>In a study from the St James Women Take Heart Project, 5721 asymptomatic women (mean age 52) underwent a symptom-limited, maximal stress test [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. A nomogram was developed, based upon age and achieved exercise capacity in METs (calculated from the speed and degree of incline of the treadmill), that permitted estimation of the percentage of predicted exercise capacity.</p><p>Predicted exercise capacity in METs = 14.7 - (0.13 x age)</p><p>This formula was validated in a referral cohort of 4471 women with cardiovascular symptoms.

A possible alternative is performance on a long-distance corridor walk. This was assessed in a study of 3075 community-dwelling adults who were 70 to 79 years of age [<a href="#rid46">46</a>]. The patients were instructed to walk 400 m (about one-quarter of a mile) with encouragement at each lap. At a mean of 4.9 years, participants who failed to complete the walk were at significantly greater risk for developing mobility limitation and mobility disability, with a trend toward increased mortality. Among those who completed the test, each additional minute required was associated with significant increases in mortality and incident CVD (adjusted HR 1.29 and 1.20, respectively) as well as mobility limitation and disability.

However, the absolute risk of sudden death during any particular episode of exercise is low (1 per 1.51 million episodes of exercise in the Physicians' Health Study) [<a href="#rid66">66</a>], and habitual exercise diminishes the risk of sudden death.

There are several reasons for this limitation:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Successful, randomized clinical trials require good adherence in order to show a difference between the groups at the end of the study. In the case of exercise, it is not possible from an ethical or practical standpoint to prevent those assigned to the control group from engaging in exercise (drop-ins).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Long-term adherence in the group assigned to exercise is often diminished by noncompliance (dropouts).

When compared with the least active individuals, the most active individuals had a 30 to 40 percent lower risk of developing CHD or cardiovascular disease (CVD) [<a href="#rid69">69,70</a>]. This inverse association between amount of exercise and risk of CHD or CVD appears to be present regardless of age, sex, race, or ethnicity although comparative data are limited [<a href="#rid69">69</a>].</p><p>Unfortunately, observational data is subject to bias, since the decision to exercise is only one of the many choices made in adopting a healthy lifestyle. As examples, a heart healthy diet, abstinence from cigarette smoking, and regular medical care may contribute to the improved health of those who also get regular exercise. Thus, attribution of exercise as a prevention of CHD is confounded by other favorable reductions in risk characteristics.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20"><span class="h1">THE EXERCISE PRESCRIPTION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In 2018, the US Department of Health and Human Services issued guidelines for healthy activity levels in adults and older adults [<a href="#rid71">71</a>].
