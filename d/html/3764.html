         </span>
         Soon after the recognition of the HIV epidemic, the potential consequences of exposure to body fluids from persons with HIV prompted the development of policies and procedures designed to reduce the risk of HIV transmission in health care personnel (HCP). The incidence of needlestick injuries has subsequently been reduced by advances in education, safer sharps disposal, engineering changes (eg, needleless devices, safety needles), and personal protection. However, institutions and health care professionals must continue to observe and improve these measures to minimize risk.

         This topic will discuss the procedures to follow after HCP have had significant contact with body fluids from a patient infected with HIV. Other related topics include:

         The risk of transmission of HIV infection following inadvertent exposure varies widely depending upon the type of exposure. The risk is increased when the source has a high viral load, the volume is large, and the exposure is deep. All known seroconversions have occurred with exposure to blood, bloody fluids, or viral cultures. Health care personnel (HCP) at highest risk of transmission are those who have been inoculated percutaneously with blood from a source patient with HIV who is not on suppressive antiretroviral therapy and/or has a detectable viral load.

         The risk of becoming infected with HIV after exposure to body fluids from a patient with HIV is low. In the United States, there were 58 confirmed and 150 possible cases of occupationally acquired HIV reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 1985 to 2013; there was only one confirmed case from 2000 to 2012 [

         A review of prospective studies of seroconversion following occupational exposure to a source with HIV in the era before the introduction of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) found the following [

         A CDC case-control study of needlestick injuries from a source with HIV in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy included 33 cases who seroconverted and 655 controls [

         The HIV viral load is another important risk factor for transmission based upon studies of sexual transmission in discordant couples and rates of perinatal transmission [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-10
         </a>
         ]. Early studies in HCP did not directly address this issue because they were based upon data obtained before viral load measurement was routinely available [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,6
         </a>
         ]. The observed correlation of transmission risk with a source with late-stage AIDS is thought to be a surrogate for high HIV viral load.

         Among HCP, nurses have reported the most frequent blood and body exposures (55.6 percent in 2021), followed by physicians who are residents or fellows (10.1 percent), attending physicians (6.3 percent), nonlab technologists (5.1 percent), and certified nursing assistants/home health aides (4.9 percent) [

        <p>
         In a study conducted at five academic medical centers, fatigue associated with long work hours and sleep deprivation among medical trainees was associated with a threefold increase in the risk of needlestick injuries [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12
         </a>
         ]. A survey performed among 699 surgeons-in-training at 17 medical centers found that the mean number of needlestick injuries by the fifth (final) year of residency was 7.7, and that 99 percent of residents had at least one needlestick injury [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Furthermore, approximately one-half had a needlestick injury involving a high-risk patient, and more than half of the most recent injuries had not been reported; the most common reason was lack of time. Despite the concerning number of exposures in this study, there has never been a confirmed case of HIV transmitted to a surgeon through occupational exposure in the United States.

         <a href="#rid1">

         Of these cases, 49 workers sustained a percutaneous exposure (puncture/cut injury), five had mucocutaneous exposures, two had both percutaneous and mucocutaneous exposures, and two had an unknown route of exposure. Forty-nine exposures were to blood from a source with HIV, one to visibly bloody fluid, four to an unspecified fluid, and four to concentrated virus in a laboratory.

         Exposed HCP were nurses (24), clinical laboratory technicians (16), nonsurgical physicians (6), and others (11). Twenty-six of these HCP developed the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). There were no confirmed seroconversions in surgeons and no seroconversions after exposure from a suture needle.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, 150 cases of possible occupationally acquired HIV infection occurred among HCP in the United States. These individuals lacked a documented workplace exposure, but their job responsibilities might have exposed them to HIV [

         The management of health care personnel (HCP) immediately after a significant exposure to blood or body fluids from patients with HIV is critically important in reducing the likelihood of transmission and in ensuring that the legal rights of the employee and the institution are upheld.

        <p>
         All institutions should have a readily available policy for managing such exposures. In the United States, such a policy is required and must comply with regulations of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) (see

         After an HCP has been exposed to blood or other body fluids, the initial response should be immediate cleansing of the exposed site. For skin exposures, the area should be washed with soap and water. Small wounds and punctures may also be cleansed with an antiseptic, such as an alcohol-based hand hygiene agent. Alcohol is virucidal to HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV); other antiseptics, such as iodophors, chloroxylenol (PCMX), and

        <p>
         For mucosal surface exposure, the exposed mucous membranes should be flushed with a copious amount of water. Eyes should be irrigated with

         Clinical information on the source patient and the recipient HCP should be documented. This includes risk factors and serologic tests for HIV and hepatitis B and C. The nature and time of the exposure should also be described. If the source patient is known to have HIV, it is critical to determine the most recent viral load and antiretroviral treatment history, including any drug resistance.

         If testing in the source patient is delayed, PEP should still be initiated while awaiting test results.

If acute HIV is suspected, testing for HIV RNA should be performed. (See

         Risk assessment is particularly important for HCP to make educated decisions about PEP, since the consequences are great and the stress is extraordinary.

         All percutaneous or sharps injuries from a source with HIV is considered an exposure (even if the HCP had no evidence of bleeding). Although the risk of HIV infection after a percutaneous injury averages 3/1000, it varies greatly depending on the inoculum size (source viral load and volume of blood), the depth of penetration, and exposure to a hollow bore versus suture needle.

         In the event of HIV infection post-exposure, the greatest risk of transmission to other individuals is in the first 6 to 12 weeks, due to the high viral load of acute infection. Exposed HCP should be instructed on measures to reduce the potential risk of HIV transmission to others. This usually means condom use or abstinence from sex and refraining from blood, plasma, organ, tissue, and semen donation until the final follow-up HIV serology (four to six months post-exposure) is negative.

         ]. (See

         The best available clinical evidence for PEP comes from a case-control study that evaluated HCP with percutaneous exposures to HIV-infected blood in the United States and Europe between 1987 and 1994 [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. There were 33 cases (HCP who became infected with HIV) and 665 controls (HCP who did not become infected). Risk factors for seroconversion were deep injury, injury by device with visible blood contamination, injury with needle from source blood vessel, and terminal illness in the source. In a multivariate analysis controlling for these risk factors, cases were significantly less likely to have taken

         </a>
         after exposure than controls (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.06-0.52). This study has several methodological limitations, including retrospective design, heterogeneity of data source, and small number of events. Nevertheless, the cumulative data from this study in addition to the results from other prevention models (eg, studies of HIV perinatal transmission and PEP in primates) overall support the efficacy of PEP.

         prevents HIV transmission is incompletely understood. The benefit in reducing maternal-infant transmission cannot be entirely explained by a reduction in plasma levels of HIV RNA [
         <a href="#rid30">
          30
         </a>
         ]. It is known that older PEP regimens that included zidovudine were not perfect, since there have been at least six reported cases of HCP who contracted HIV infection despite receiving a zidovudine-containing combination regimen within two hours of exposure [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. This drug is no longer generally recommended due to poor tolerance resulting in suboptimal adherence.

        <p>
         Subsequent data show that combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) is significantly better than

         in reducing perinatal transmission. Three drug regimens have been shown to reduce the transmission rate to 0.5 percent [

         We offer PEP to HCP with a percutaneous mucous membrane or nonintact skin exposure to blood or bloody body fluids of a patient with known HIV infection. If the HIV status of the source patient is unknown, we offer PEP while awaiting HIV testing, particularly if the source patient is at high risk for HIV infection (eg, injection drug users, men who have sex with men) or has symptoms suggesting HIV infection. If the source patient cannot be identified (ie, HIV testing not possible), we offer PEP if the exposure occurred in a high-risk setting (eg, a needlestick from a sharps container in an HIV clinic or a needle exchange program).
        </p>
        <p>
         In all cases, the decision to administer PEP must weigh the risk of infection with HIV against the toxicity and inconvenience of PEP, though the risk of side effects is much less with contemporary regimens. (See

         PEP should be initiated as soon as possible. The goal is to start within one to two hours (or earlier) after exposure, often using a "starter pack" with appropriate drugs that are immediately available. It is likely that a delay in initiating PEP can reduce efficacy. This concept is supported in primate models of PEP [
         <a href="#rid26">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         For most HCP, we do not initiate PEP if more than 72 hours have elapsed after the initial exposure; PEP is likely to be less effective when administered after that period of time [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. However, we do offer PEP after a longer interval to patients with a very high-risk exposure (eg, sharps injuries from a needle that was in an artery or vein of a source patient with HIV). For such HCP, The United States Public Health Service suggests that PEP can be offered up to one week after the exposure [

         We administer a three-drug regimen for HCP who opt for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). This approach is supported by the United States Public Health Service, the International Antiviral Society-USA panel, and the World Health Organization [

        </p>
        <p>
         For most HCP, we suggest one of the following once-daily integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-based regimens, provided the source does not have detectable virus with known resistance to these agents [

        <p>

This differs from persons with HIV who require life-long treatment; in such patients, TAF/FTC is typically preferred as part of a combination antiretroviral regimen to reduce the risk of kidney and bone toxicity.

         If the source patient is known to have HIV, it is important to obtain information about the patient's antiretroviral treatment history and review their past viral genotypes to see if drug-resistant virus is present. Resistant strains that were documented in the past on a prior regimen should be considered in drug selection for PEP. Although there are no studies examining this issue, it is appropriate to tailor a regimen by selecting antiretroviral medications to which the source HIV is believed to be sensitive. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3772.html" rel="external">
          "Interpretation of HIV drug resistance testing"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         However, PEP should
         <strong>
          not
         </strong>
         be delayed if information on resistance testing is not immediately available [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19
         </a>
         ]. In this situation, a regimen with a high barrier to resistance (dolutegravir-, bictegravir-, or darunavir-containing regimens) should be used pending the results. The regimen can then be modified if needed when resistance testing is completed.
        </p>
        <p>
         These complex cases are best managed by an experienced HIV provider or with assistance from the HIV help-line (888-448-4911). An HIV specialist can help design the appropriate regimen. As examples:

         If the source patient has a history of drug resistance, but has viral suppression on the current ART, a PEP regimen using the same medications, or medications with similar patterns of susceptibility, is generally appropriate, if safe and well tolerated.

         If the source patient is taking ART but still has detectable viremia, it makes clinical sense to choose other medications that are unlikely to show cross-resistance. In general, a regimen such as TDF/FTC plus boosted

          Risk of acquiring HIV
         </strong>
         – For health care personnel (HCP), the risk of acquiring HIV after an exposure to body fluids from a patient with HIV is very low. The average risk of seroconversion after a needlestick injury from a source patient with HIV who is not receiving suppressive antiretroviral therapy is about 3 per 1000 with no prophylaxis. However, this varies greatly depending on the inoculum size (source viral load and volume of blood), the depth of penetration, and exposure to a hollow bore versus suture needle. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Risk of transmission of HIV'

         <strong>
          Initial management
         </strong>
         – The first response to a percutaneous exposure should be to wash the area thoroughly with soap and water; for punctures and small lacerations, cleaning the area with an alcohol-based hand hygiene agent is reasonable. Exposed mucous membranes should be irrigated copiously with water or

          HIV testing after an exposure
         </strong>
         – HCP should promptly report possible HIV exposures to their occupational health department so the HCP and the source patient can be screened for HIV as soon as possible. All institutions should have a readily available policy for managing such exposures. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Documentation of the exposure'

         Testing with a fourth-generation antibody-antigen test is usually sufficient. However, for source patients, testing for HIV RNA should also be performed if they are suspected of or are at risk for having acute HIV (eg, persons with symptoms of acute HIV infection, those who injected drugs or engaged in high-risk sexual behaviors in the last four weeks).

          Indications for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)
         </strong>
         – For HCP with a percutaneous, mucous membrane, or nonintact skin exposure to potentially infectious body fluids, the decision to administer PEP must weigh the risk of HIV infection with the potential toxicity of PEP. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Indications for prophylaxis'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>

         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         We offer PEP if the source has known HIV infection. If the HIV status of the source patient is unknown, we offer PEP while awaiting HIV testing results, particularly if the source patient has symptoms consistent with acute HIV infection or is at high risk for HIV infection.
        </p>
        <p>

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         If the source cannot be identified, we offer PEP if the exposure occurred in a setting where the source is at significant risk for HIV infection (eg, a needlestick from a sharps container in an HIV clinic or a needle exchange program).

         <strong>
          Timing of PEP
         </strong>
         – If the decision is made to administer PEP, it should be started as early as possible after the exposure (ideally within one to two hours). For most HCP, we do not initiate PEP if more than 72 hours have elapsed after the initial exposure. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Regimen selection for PEP
         </strong>
         – For most HCP, we suggest a three-drug regimen using an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (eg,
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="90345" href="/z/d/drug information/90345.html" rel="external">
          dolutegravir
         </a>
         or bictegravir) plus either
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8527" href="/z/d/drug information/8527.html" rel="external">
          tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-emtricitabine
         </a>
         (TDF/FTC) or
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="107645" href="/z/d/drug information/107645.html" rel="external">
          tenofovir alafenamide-emtricitabine
         </a>
         (TAF/FTC) (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). An alternative regimen that combines tenofovir-emtricitabine with a boosted protease inhibitor (eg, ritonavir-boosted
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8842" href="/z/d/drug information/8842.html" rel="external">
          darunavir
         </a>
         ) is also acceptable. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Regimen selection'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         However, there are special considerations for selected populations. As an example, bictegravir should be avoided in persons who are or could become pregnant. In addition, TDF should generally be avoided in persons with reduced kidney function. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Persons of childbearing potential/persons who are pregnant'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Duration of PEP
         </strong>
         – PEP should be continued for four weeks, although the duration needed to achieve maximal benefit is not known. PEP can be discontinued if testing shows that the source patient is HIV negative. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Duration of therapy'

         <strong>
          Monitoring on PEP
         </strong>
         – People receiving PEP should be monitored for adverse reactions to the drugs and for drug toxicity. (See

         <strong>
          Follow up HIV testing
         </strong>
         – For all HCP who had an exposure to HIV, repeat HIV testing with an antibody-antigen test should be performed at six weeks and four months post-exposure. If a test that only measures antibody is used, repeat HIV testing should occur at six weeks, three months, and six months following exposure. (See
         <a class="local">

          Assessing risk of transmission of other bloodborne pathogens

         – HCP who have had a potential exposure to HIV are also at risk of exposure to hepatitis B and C virus. Management after an exposure to hepatitis B and C viruses is discussed separately. (See
