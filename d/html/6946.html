The choice of treatment is determined by a variety of factors, including risk stratification, patient preference, clinician judgment, and resource availability. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6943.html" rel="external">"Localized prostate cancer: Risk stratification and choice of initial treatment"</a>.)</p><p>Although there are few randomized trials comparing RT with radical prostatectomy, the trials completed to date and observational data suggest that outcomes with either EBRT or brachytherapy (using adequate dosing schedules and contemporary treatment techniques) are similar to those with radical prostatectomy when men with clinically localized prostate cancer are stratified based on clinical tumor (T) stage, pretreatment serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and Gleason score [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p>The use of EBRT in the initial treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer will be reviewed here. The application of these techniques to men with low-, intermediate-, and high-risk prostate cancer is discussed separately, as is the role of brachytherapy for treatment of localized prostate cancer. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6940.html" rel="external">"Initial approach to low- and very low-risk clinically localized prostate cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6947.html" rel="external">"Initial management of regionally localized intermediate-, high-, and very high-risk prostate cancer and those with clinical lymph node involvement"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6923.html" rel="external">"Brachytherapy for low-risk or favorable intermediate-risk, clinically localized prostate cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H111715232"><span class="h1">RISK STRATIFICATION AND THE SELECTION OF THE INITIAL TREATMENT APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The initial evaluation of men with suspected prostate cancer should include clinical staging based on a digital rectal examination by an experienced clinician to assess the extent of disease, a pretreatment serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the Gleason score/grade group in the initial biopsy, and the number and extent of cancer involvement in the biopsy cores. This information allows the stratification of men into clinical risk categories according to the primary tumor, as defined by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118962" href="/d/graphic/118962.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). This risk stratification system has been utilized in guidelines for treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer from the American Urological Association (AUA)/American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO)/Society of Urologic Oncology (SUO), which have been largely endorsed by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>].</p><p>Imaging studies (radionuclide bone scan, computed tomography [CT] of the abdomen and pelvis, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) are used selectively to assess for extraprostatic extension, regional adenopathy, or distant metastases, depending on the initial clinical stage and estimate of risk. Imaging for distant disease is not routinely recommended for very low- and low-risk prostate cancer according to the clinical staging system described above, while skeletal scintigraphy and cross-sectional imaging (of the pelvis with or without abdominal imaging) are recommended for those with intermediate- and high-risk disease [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. MRI of the prostate is often obtained in men with low- and very low-risk disease to ensure that high-grade disease has not been overlooked.</p><p>The Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) uses the clinical stage of disease (or pathologic stage in those who have undergone prostatectomy), the baseline serum PSA, the histologic grade group (based on the Gleason score), and the extent of prostate involvement (as determined at the time of surgery) to divide patients into prognostic stage groups  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110728" href="/d/graphic/110728.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110729" href="/d/graphic/110729.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). Among patients without distant metastases, these groups can also be used for selection of initial treatment according to risk, although we prefer to use the clinical risk categories as defined by the NCCN. It should be noted that detailed evaluation of histology, and the impact of tumor size (rather than just the number of positive cores) and gene expression profiling are not fully captured by these risk groups.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4083777660"><span class="h2">Guidelines from expert groups</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In general, active surveillance is preferred for men with very low- or low-risk prostate cancer and a reasonable life expectancy, although definitive therapy could be offered to select patients with low-risk disease who may have a high probability of progression on active surveillance [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>]. For men with higher risk disease and a reasonable life expectancy, definitive treatment using EBRT, with or without brachytherapy, or radical prostatectomy is an appropriate option.</p><p>The guidelines from the AUA/ASTRO/SUO and ASCO endorse shared decision making, which explicitly considers cancer severity (risk stratification), patient values and preferences, life expectancy, pretreatment general functional status and genitourinary symptoms, expected post-treatment functional status, and potential for salvage treatment [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>].</p><p>Regarding the specific role of RT, the following recommendations are available from the AUA/ASTRO/SUO, which have largely been endorsed by ASCO [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clinicians may offer single-modality EBRT or brachytherapy for patients who elect RT for low-risk prostate cancer.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clinicians may offer EBRT or brachytherapy, alone or in combination, for favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clinicians should offer androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as an adjunct to either EBRT alone or EBRT combined with brachytherapy; clinicians should inform men that the addition of ADT increases the likelihood and severity of treatment-related effects on sexual function in most men and can cause other systemic side effects.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clinicians should inform men considering proton beam therapy that it offers no clinical advantage over other forms of definitive treatment.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Clinicians should inform men with localized prostate cancer considering brachytherapy that it has similar effects to EBRT with regard to erectile dysfunction and proctitis but can exacerbate urinary obstructive symptoms. For men with intractable non-cancer-related obstructive lower urinary function, surgical approaches may be preferred. If RT is used for these patients or those with a previous significant transurethral resection of the prostate, low-dose-rate brachytherapy should be avoided.</p><p></p><p>Risk stratification and treatment options appropriate for each risk category are discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16992.html" rel="external">"Initial staging and evaluation of males with newly diagnosed prostate cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6940.html" rel="external">"Initial approach to low- and very low-risk clinically localized prostate cancer"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6947.html" rel="external">"Initial management of regionally localized intermediate-, high-, and very high-risk prostate cancer and those with clinical lymph node involvement"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3132396"><span class="h1">ANATOMIC CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goal of radiation therapy (RT) for men with localized prostate cancer is the delivery of a tumoricidal dose of radiation while minimizing radiation to the surrounding normal tissues [<a href="#rid6">6</a>].</p><p>RT planning must take into account the volume and anatomic distribution of both the tumor and the normal structures [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. The prostate gland is a midline structure that lies in close proximity to the rectum and bladder. Thus, the major toxicities of normal tissue irradiation are gastrointestinal and genitourinary.</p><p>Definitive RT is usually delivered to the entire prostate gland because of the multifocal nature of prostate cancer and the inability to accurately localize all malignant areas within the gland by noninvasive means. Treatment fields are further individualized based on the estimated risk of seminal vesicle and regional lymph node involvement [<a href="#rid8">8,9</a>]. The lymphatic drainage of the prostate gland is through a periprostatic network that drains into both the external and internal iliac lymph nodes (together referred to as the pelvic nodes) [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>].</p><p>Higher clinical stage, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration, and Gleason score are associated with an increased risk of both seminal vesicle and pelvic lymph node involvement [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. The serum PSA and Gleason score have been incorporated into the anatomic stage prognostic groups of the eighth (2017) Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging system  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110728" href="/d/graphic/110728.html" rel="external">table 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110729" href="/d/graphic/110729.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). For patients at high risk of relapse, RT to the whole pelvis, which encompasses the bilateral lymph node regions, is sometimes utilized.

Our specific recommendations for treatment are consistent with guidelines from the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and the American Urological Association (AUA) [<a href="#rid3">3,14</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>If intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is available, we suggest its use over three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), particularly in men in whom pelvic nodal irradiation is being considered (ie, those with a predicted risk of pelvic nodal metastases of 15 percent or higher) and in those undergoing hypofractionated or ultrahypofractionated therapy. (See <a class="local">'Intensity-modulated radiation therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Where available, we suggest the use of image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) for daily localization of the prostate prior to each treatment. (See <a class="local">'Benefit of image-guided radiation therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>An adequate dose of radiation is necessary for optimal tumor control. For men undergoing conventional fractionation RT (1.8 to 2 Gy per fraction), we prefer a dose of 76 Gy or higher. (See <a class="local">'Dose'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For most men who do not need pelvic nodal irradiation, we suggest prostate RT be delivered using moderate hypofractionation RT rather than conventional fractionation RT. Given the greater potential for toxicity, we prefer conventional fractionation EBRT regimens if pelvic nodal irradiation is needed. Another option is to use moderate hypofractionation to treat the prostate, and conventional fractionation to treat the pelvic lymph nodes. Either approach is acceptable.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The optimal regimen for hypofractionation has not been established; several are endorsed, including 60 Gy in 20 fractions and 70 Gy in 28 fractions. (See <a class="local">'Moderate hypofractionation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>We consider stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to be an appropriate alternative to conventional fractionation RT for carefully selected men with low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer who do not need nodal irradiation. Outside of the context of a clinical trial, we suggest not pursuing SBRT for men with high-risk prostate cancer who have chosen EBRT, unless whole-pelvis irradiation is contraindicated and the logistics prohibit a conventional course. (See <a class="local">'Stereotactic body radiation therapy (ultrahypofractionation)'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A role for charged particle irradiation, such as proton irradiation, as an alternative to EBRT is not established, and we suggest not pursuing this strategy outside of the context of a clinical trial. (See <a class="local">'Particle irradiation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">EXTERNAL BEAM RADIATION THERAPY TECHNIQUES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Conformal techniques, particularly intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT), are the contemporary standard of care when EBRT is used to treat localized prostate cancer. These conformal techniques allow higher doses to the target while minimizing radiation to normal tissues compared with older two-dimensional approaches. This improved targeting permits a decrease in toxicity and an improvement in the therapeutic index [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) delivers radiation to a three-dimensional volume using imaging studies and computer software to precisely target RT delivery by delineating the prostate gland and its surrounding structures. Because treatment margins are smaller than those with older techniques, the volume of normal tissue receiving a clinically significant radiation dose is reduced.</p><p>The prostate, rectum, and bladder are identified on axial pelvic CT images. Treatment planning computers then calculate the dose in three dimensions, and the beam arrangements are planned to the prostate target volume (the gross tumor volume [GTV]) plus a margin of grossly normal surrounding tissue, termed the clinical target volume (CTV) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The planning target volume (PTV) is the final treatment volume that encompasses the GTV, the CTV, and a margin for any error that results from daily setup and prostatic motion [<a href="#rid8">8,17</a>]. Either multileaf collimation or Cerrobend blocks are used to shape the treatment portals. Dose-volume histograms, which are the visual representation of the dose received by a particular target volume, permit the radiation oncologist to assign a specific RT dose to a particular volume of tissue, maximizing the delivery of the highest doses to the areas at highest risk.</p><p>Conventional schedules for RT using highly conformal techniques use a daily dose of 1.8 to 2 Gy for 38 to 45 fractions (total dose ≥76 Gy).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Intensity-modulated radiation therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If IMRT is available, we suggest its use, particularly in men in whom pelvic nodal irradiation is being considered (ie, those with a predicted risk of pelvic nodal metastases of 15 percent or higher) and in those undergoing hypofractionated or ultrahypofractionated therapy.</p><p>IMRT is an advanced form of 3D-CRT that can create a dose distribution around a complex and irregular target volume  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72560" href="/d/graphic/72560.html" rel="external">image 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54616" href="/d/graphic/54616.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. In contrast to 3D-CRT, in which a uniform intensity is administered to a defined field, IMRT delivers nonuniform beam intensities to the target volume by changing the intensity of the beam. The nonuniform beam intensity can be generated by varying the opening of the RT beam (collimator) with a fixed gantry position or by changing the beam opening during an arc [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Alternatively, the beam intensity in IMRT can also be modulated by the gantry speed, as in rotational/arc delivery approaches. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/89528.html" rel="external">"Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment", section on 'Intensity-modulated radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p>IMRT can safely escalate the dose to the prostate while reducing complications from irradiation of the surrounding normal tissue, especially the rectum. The high degree of conformality of the RT field permits further dose escalation to the tumor target compared with 3D-CRT.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">IMRT versus 3D-CRT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is considered the standard of care in RT treatment centers; in both the United States and Europe, it has largely replaced older forms of non-modulated three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) [<a href="#rid20">20-22</a>], and it is specifically recommended over 3D-CRT in patients undergoing moderately hypofractionated or ultrahypofractionated EBRT in a combined American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO)/American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/American Urological Association (AUA) guideline [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Moderate hypofractionation'</a> below.)</p><p>Although there are no randomized trials comparing IMRT with 3D-CRT, IMRT appears to be less toxic at equivalent tumor doses of radiation by reducing the exposure of normal tissue to radiation. Furthermore, IMRT may have important dosimetric advantages in treating pelvic lymph nodes [<a href="#rid18">18,23</a>], where it allows better coverage while reducing radiation to the rectum, colon, small bowel, bladder, and penile structures [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>].</p><p>The toxicity of IMRT was compared with that of 3D-CRT in the high-dose arm of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0126 prostate cancer trial [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. In that study, 763 patients were randomly assigned to receive 79.2 Gy; of these, 257 were treated with IMRT, and 492 were treated with 3D-CRT. Grade 2 or higher genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicity was significantly less frequent with IMRT compared with 3D-CRT (15.1 versus 9.7 percent).</p><p>IMRT may have increased toxicity when the escalated radiation doses are compared with the lower doses with older 3D-CRT techniques. In a single-institution series of 1571 men treated for localized prostate cancer, IMRT was used to treat 741 patients to a dose of 81 Gy, while 830 men were treated with 3D-CRT at lower doses (358 at ≤70.2 Gy and 472 at 75.6 Gy) [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Acute urinary symptoms requiring treatment were significantly more frequent with IMRT than 3D-CRT (37 versus 22 percent), while acute rectal symptoms were uncommon with either modality (3 and 1 percent, respectively). Late urinary tract toxicity (frequency or urgency, incontinence, hematuria, stricture) was significantly more frequent in patients treated with IMRT (20 versus 12 percent). Patients treated with IMRT had a significantly decreased frequency of grade ≥2 gastrointestinal toxicity at 10 years (5 versus 13 percent with 3D-CRT).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2318448063"><span class="h3">Whole-pelvis versus prostate-only radiation therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The pathologic status of the regional lymph nodes is typically unknown (pNX) in men with clinically localized prostate cancer who are managed with RT. Various clinical and pathologic parameters have been used to estimate the likelihood of regional lymph node involvement and thus select patients for whole-pelvis radiation therapy (WPRT) [<a href="#rid28">28,29</a>]. Based on currently available results, WPRT may be considered in cases with clinical lymph node involvement or in some cases where there is no clinical suspicion but the estimated risk of lymph node involvement is greater than 15 percent. There is no consensus on what tool to use to estimate which men have a risk of nodal involvement that exceeds 15 percent.
