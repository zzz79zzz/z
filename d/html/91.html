PCI is preferred for most patients if it can be performed by an experienced operator with less than a 90-minute delay from presentation to the emergency department. However, fibrinolysis remains an important therapeutic modality, due in part to limited availability of primary PCI in some locations. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/80.html" rel="external">"Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Selecting a reperfusion strategy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/72.html" rel="external">"Primary percutaneous coronary intervention in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: Determinants of outcome"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/55.html" rel="external">"Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: The use of fibrinolytic therapy"</a>.)</p><p>The principle reasons for preference of PCI over fibrinolysis is the relatively high frequency of failure of fibrinolysis to establish reperfusion, early reocclusion after apparently successful fibrinolysis, and increased bleeding complications with fibrinolysis. (See <a class="local">'Primary failure'</a> below and <a class="local">'Threatened reocclusion or reinfarction'</a> below.)</p><p>This topic will review the roles of angiography followed by PCI (or coronary artery bypass graft surgery [CABG] if indicated) for failed fibrinolysis or threatened reocclusion and of retreatment with fibrinolytic drugs for threatened reocclusion. The use of routine angiography after fibrinolysis is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/80.html" rel="external">"Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Selecting a reperfusion strategy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">IMPORTANCE OF RESTORATION OF NORMAL FLOW</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The mortality benefit after fibrinolytic therapy in patients with STEMI is related to the degree to which flow has been restored in the infarct-related artery. In the cardiac catheterization laboratory, patency of the infarct-related artery is usually graded according to the Thrombosis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) classification system. In clinical trials of fibrinolysis, patency is usually measured at 60 to 90 minutes after the administration of fibrinolytic therapy:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>TIMI 0 refers to the absence of any antegrade flow beyond a coronary occlusion.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>TIMI 1 flow is faint antegrade coronary flow beyond the occlusion, although filling of the distal coronary bed is incomplete.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>TIMI 2 flow is delayed or sluggish antegrade flow with complete filling of the distal territory.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>TIMI 3 flow is normal flow that fills the distal coronary bed completely.</p><p></p><p>Only TIMI 3 (normal) flow is associated with a mortality benefit after fibrinolysis  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75629" href="/d/graphic/75629.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70952" href="/d/graphic/70952.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1-6</a>]. The magnitude of this effect was illustrated in a meta-analysis of five trials of almost 4000 patients [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Short-term mortality (ranging from in-hospital to 30 days in the different trials) was 3.7, 7, and 8.8 percent among patients with TIMI grade 3, 2, and 0/1, respectively. (See <a class="local">'Primary failure'</a> below.)</p><p>Additionally, in patients who undergo diagnostic angiography after fibrinolysis, both TIMI 0/1 and 2 flow are associated with increased mortality compared with those with TIMI 3 (normal) flow [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H7"><span class="h1">PRIMARY FAILURE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Primary failure of fibrinolysis is best treated with immediate percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients should be referred to a facility with PCI capability immediately after fibrinolysis in most cases, so that failed fibrinolysis can be managed expeditiously. This strategy will avoid the need to consider repeat fibrinolysis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/53.html" rel="external">"Percutaneous coronary intervention after fibrinolysis for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction", section on 'Patients treated at non-PCI hospitals or in an ambulance'</a>.)</p><p>Primary failure based on clinical criteria is common. Using angiographic criteria of TIMI 3 flow within 90 minutes, failure is seen in 40 to 45 percent of patients [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H563767460"><span class="h2">Clinical manifestations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Primary failure of fibrinolysis is often clinically suspected by persistent or worsening chest pain (particularly if associated with other symptoms such as dyspnea and diaphoresis), persistent or worsening ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram (ECG), hemodynamic instability, and/or heart failure [<a href="#rid8">8</a>].</p><p>However, these parameters do not predict failed fibrinolysis in all patients [<a href="#rid9">9-11</a>]. Chest pain alone is subjective, especially if improved, and many patients do not have complete ST-segment elevation resolution [<a href="#rid8">8,12</a>]. In addition, ST-segment elevation resolution and patency of the infarct-related artery are not always correlated. As a result, in the absence of clear indications of reperfusion, the clinician must maintain a high index of suspicion for primary failure [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. Persistent chest pain or the absence of at least 50 percent of the initial ST-segment elevation on a follow-up ECG 60 to 90 minutes after fibrinolytic therapy are suggestive of lack of adequate reperfusion and warrant early referral for coronary angiography [<a href="#rid14">14-16</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Primary failure'</a> above.)</p><p>The potential lack of correlation between ST-segment elevation and TIMI flow grade was illustrated in the TIMI 14 trial of 444 patients with an interpretable ECG who underwent angiography at 90 minutes after fibrinolytic therapy [<a href="#rid10">10,17</a>]. TIMI 3 flow was present in only 79 percent of patients with complete (≥70 percent) ST-segment resolution and was also present in 44 to 50 percent of patients with partial or no ST-segment resolution. The latter patients were at increased risk for mortality, as the lack of complete ST-segment resolution was presumably due to extensive microvascular dysfunction [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3135885958"><span class="h2">Diagnosis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Primary failure can be suspected based on the patient's symptoms and ECG (see <a class="local">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above). The diagnosis is confirmed with coronary angiography.</p><p>Primary failure is defined as persistent occlusion of the infarct-related artery (TIMI grade 0/1 epicardial flow) at the time of coronary angiography. TIMI grade 0/1 occurred in 27 percent and was associated with a higher short-term mortality rate than TIMI 3 flow (8.8 versus 3.7 percent) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Since mortality is also increased in patients with TIMI 2 flow, some have also considered TIMI 2 flow a sign of failed therapy  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75629" href="/d/graphic/75629.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70952" href="/d/graphic/70952.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). (See <a class="local">'TIMI grade 2 flow'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to patency of the epicardial coronary arteries, adequacy of microvascular flow, as determined by the myocardial perfusion grade, can also be assessed during angiography. Myocardial perfusion grade may also be an important predictor of long-term benefit [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Primary failure'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1750235969"><span class="h2">Management</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients who are diagnosed with or strongly suspected of a primary failure of fibrinolysis should receive an additional attempt at reperfusion. We prefer rescue PCI over repeat fibrinolysis.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Rescue PCI</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Rescue or salvage PCI is defined as PCI performed within 12 hours of failed fibrinolysis (primary failure) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. If rescue PCI (usually with stenting) is performed, it appears to be important that it be undertaken quickly. In general, we begin to mobilize patients with apparent failure to the cardiac catheterization laboratory at approximately 45 to 60 minutes following fibrinolysis such that, when necessary, rescue PCI may be performed as close to 90 minutes after fibrinolysis as possible. Accordingly, because 40 to 45 percent of patients who receive fibrinolytic therapy will experience primary failure, we generally recommend that all who present at non-PCI-capable hospitals are transferred to a PCI-capable hospital as soon as possible after administration of the fibrinolytic agent. We do not recommend that a decision to transfer be deferred until it is determined whether primary failure has occurred or not. PCI or, if appropriate, bypass surgery is recommended in patients with less than TIMI grade 3 flow.</p><p>Revascularization may be deferred in patients with TIMI 3 flow who are hemodynamically stable [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. However, observational data suggest that even patients with TIMI 3 flow have reduced mortality if PCI of the infarct-related artery is performed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/53.html" rel="external">"Percutaneous coronary intervention after fibrinolysis for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction"</a>.)</p><p>Early randomized trials comparing rescue PCI (most patients underwent balloon angioplasty rather than stenting) with conservative therapy in patients with failed fibrinolysis found a trend toward lower mortality and lower risks of heart failure and reinfarction with rescue PCI [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Subsequently, stenting was shown to be superior to balloon angioplasty [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p>The REACT trial randomly assigned 427 patients with STEMI and failed fibrinolysis to conservative medical therapy, repeat fibrinolysis with a fibrin-specific agent, or rescue PCI (69 percent with stenting). Failed fibrinolysis was defined as less than 50 percent ST-segment elevation resolution within 90 minutes after therapy [<a href="#rid21">21,22</a>]. PCI was performed within 12 hours of the onset of pain if angiography revealed less than TIMI grade 3 flow and more than 50 percent stenosis in the infarct-related artery. (See <a class="local">'Procedural issues'</a> below and <a class="local">'TIMI grade 2 flow'</a> below.)</p><p>The following significantly improved outcomes were noted with rescue PCI:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A higher rate of event-free survival (primary endpoint of death, reinfarction, stroke, or severe heart failure) at six months (85 versus 69 and 70 percent compared with repeat fibrinolysis or conservative therapy, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.43 [95% CI 0.26-0.72] and 0.47 [95% CI 0.28-0.79]) and at one year (82 versus 64 and 68 percent, adjusted HR 0.44 [95% CI 0.28-0.71] and 0.51 [95% CI 0.32-0.83], respectively).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A lower rate of all-cause mortality at a median follow-up of 4.4 years (6.2 versus 12.7 and 12.8 percent compared with repeat fibrinolysis or conservative therapy).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A higher rate of freedom from revascularization at one year (85 versus 67 percent compared with repeat fibrinolysis or conservative therapy).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h4">TIMI grade 2 flow</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The above studies largely evaluated the efficacy of rescue PCI in patients, most of whom had failed fibrinolysis (TIMI grade 0/1 flow), although some patients with TIMI grade 2 flow were enrolled. Thus, the optimum treatment in patients with TIMI grade 2 flow is less well studied [<a href="#rid18">18,23,24</a>]. As noted above, patients with TIMI grade 2 flow have higher mortality rates than those with TIMI grade 3 (normal) flow: 7 versus 3.7 percent in a meta-analysis  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75629" href="/d/graphic/75629.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70952" href="/d/graphic/70952.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>) [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Importance of restoration of normal flow'</a> above.)</p><p>Additional evidence to support rescue PCI for patients with TIMI grade 2 flow comes from an analysis of 668 patients (105 of whom were treated with rescue PCI) with TIMI grade 2 or 3 flow at angiography in the TIMI 10B trial [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. Rescue PCI was associated with a trend toward reduction in mortality at two years (4 versus 11 percent).</p><p>Although the evidence to support rescue PCI for patients with TIMI grade 2 flow is less robust than that for TIMI grade 0/1, we suggest this approach. This is based on the inclusion of such patients in REACT and the increasing data suggesting benefit from routine angiography and PCI after fibrinolysis when appropriately timed. (See <a class="local">'Rescue PCI'</a> above and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/53.html" rel="external">"Percutaneous coronary intervention after fibrinolysis for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1398020693"><span class="h3">Procedural issues</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Depending on the fibrinolytic agent chosen, the half-life of fibrinolytic activity may range from 50 to 90 minutes. Consequently, there is likely to be at least some fibrinolytic still on board when proceeding with rescue PCI. This may have an impact on decisions made at the time of PCI regarding the use of adjunctive antiplatelet and antithrombin therapy. Although large randomized clinical trials have not been performed to guide decisions, some reasonable options for adjunctive therapy are as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Use of adjunctive IIb/IIIa glycoprotein inhibitors</strong> – Because of the potential increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage associated with the combined use of IIb/IIIa inhibitors and fibrinolytic agents, it is wise to use caution when using it during rescue PCI. Factors to consider include the thrombus burden identified during coronary angiography, the age of the patient, the type of fibrinolytic used, and the time passed since the fibrinolytic agent was administered. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94.html" rel="external">"Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Antiplatelet therapy", section on 'Intravenous agents'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Choice of oral P2Y12 inhibitor</strong> – Because most guidelines recommend that <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8921" href="/d/drug information/8921.html" rel="external">clopidogrel</a> 300 mg be administered at the time of administration of a fibrinolytic agent, in most circumstances, clopidogrel will already be on board. It is our practice at the time of rescue PCI to complete a standard 600 mg load of clopidogrel by administering another 300 mg. If no clopidogrel has yet been given, it would be the interventionalist's choice regarding which P2Y<sub>12</sub> agent to administer. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/94.html" rel="external">"Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Antiplatelet therapy", section on 'Our approach to early DAPT'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Choice of antithrombin agent</strong> – Because heparin is often started at the time of fibrinolytic agent administration, it seems reasonable to continue with heparin as the antithrombin agent during rescue PCI. Adjusting the dose according to the measured activated clotting time (ACT) may be accomplished in a similar manner as during standard PCI. Although not much data exist regarding the use of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8792" href="/d/drug information/8792.html" rel="external">bivalirudin</a>, in some circumstances, such as the presence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, its use may be considered. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/92.html" rel="external">"Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Management of anticoagulation", section on 'Primary percutaneous coronary intervention'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Radial or femoral access</strong> – In most patients, we prefer radial rather than femoral artery access in order to decrease the likelihood of significant bleeding after fibrinolysis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/1562.html" rel="external">"Periprocedural complications of percutaneous coronary intervention", section on 'Radial artery access'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Direct stenting and predilation</strong> –<strong> </strong>Direct stenting (stenting without predilation of the coronary lesion) may improve myocardial perfusion and the incidence of death, MI, or heart failure compared with conventional stenting in patients who undergo PCI after fibrinolysis. This was illustrated in an observational study in which the choice of procedure was at the discretion of the treating physician [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Among patients with occluded infarct-related arteries, the likelihood of achieving TIMI myocardial perfusion grade 3 was significantly greater with direct stenting (54 versus 25 percent with conventional stenting).</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1761331728"><span class="h3">Repeat fibrinolysis</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Repeat fibrinolysis for failed primary fibrinolysis is usually considered when access to PCI is not available. However, it is not well studied. A 2007 meta-analysis included three trials that randomly assigned 410 patients to repeat fibrinolysis (all with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8478" href="/d/drug information/8478.html" rel="external">alteplase</a>) or conservative therapy with follow-up between in-hospital discharge and six months [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality, reinfarction, or stroke between the two groups, and both treatments were inferior to rescue PCI.

Patients should be referred to a facility with PCI capability soon after fibrinolysis in most cases. This strategy will avoid the need to consider repeat lysis, except in rare cases.</p><p>After apparently successful fibrinolysis by clinical criteria, early recurrence of ischemia or ST segment shifts on the ECG has been observed in 20 to 30 percent of patients [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>] and thrombotic coronary reocclusion at the time of angiography in 5 to 15 percent [<a href="#rid4">4,28-31</a>]. Reinfarction occurs in 3 to 5 percent and is clinically silent in over 50 percent of cases [<a href="#rid31">31-34</a>].</p><p>Demographic and clinical variables have not proven very helpful in predicting which patients will develop reocclusion [<a href="#rid28">28,29,31,32</a>].
