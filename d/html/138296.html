The evaluation of patients with ischemic stroke and a PFO is reviewed elsewhere.

In the setting of a patient ≤60 years of age and no other evident source of stroke despite a comprehensive evaluation, PFO closure is warranted if the RoPE score is &gt;6 and/or there is a large shunt or atrial septal aneurysm. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1100.html" rel="external">"Stroke associated with patent foramen ovale (PFO): Evaluation", section on 'RoPE score'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1100.html" rel="external">"Stroke associated with patent foramen ovale (PFO): Evaluation", section on 'PASCAL classification'</a> and <a class="local">'Benefit'</a> below.)</p><p>Given the high prevalence of PFO in the general population and the low risk of stroke related to PFO, there is always some degree of uncertainty about the causal relationship between PFO and an embolic-appearing ischemic stroke with no other evident stroke mechanism despite a comprehensive evaluation [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. The possibility that the PFO is an "innocent bystander" and that another mechanism is responsible for the stroke is particularly applicable to older patients and to those with known risk factors for stroke (eg, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking) [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. Causality can best be inferred in younger patients with no other apparent etiology for stroke [<a href="#rid5">5</a>], particularly if DVT is present (as a potential source for paradoxical emboli).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2013103775"><span class="h2">Selection criteria</span></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>PFO associated stroke</strong> – Selected patients with PFO with all of the following characteristics are candidates for percutaneous PFO closure  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef138535" href="/z/d/graphic/138535.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Age ≤60 years</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Embolic stroke topography (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1100.html" rel="external">"Stroke associated with patent foramen ovale (PFO): Evaluation", section on 'Is the stroke embolic?'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>No other evident source of stroke despite a comprehensive evaluation (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1100.html" rel="external">"Stroke associated with patent foramen ovale (PFO): Evaluation", section on 'Exclusion of other sources of ischemic stroke'</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A possible, probable, or definite likelihood that the stroke was causally related to the PFO according to the PASCAL classification system  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef134674" href="/z/d/graphic/134674.html" rel="external">table 1</a>), which incorporates the RoPE score and high-risk features of the PFO on echocardiogram  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef97895" href="/z/d/graphic/97895.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) (<a class="calc calc_professional" href="/z/d/html/119897.html" rel="external">calculator 1</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>No concurrent indication for anticoagulation (see <a class="local">'Special considerations in anticoagulated patients'</a> below)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">For most patients without a concurrent indication for anticoagulation who are ≤60 years of age with a possible, probable, or definite likelihood by PASCAL that the stroke was causally associated with the PFO, we suggest percutaneous PFO device closure in addition to antiplatelet therapy.

Furthermore, a patient-level meta-analysis demonstrated that risk of atrial fibrillation after PFO closure increases with age [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Thus, decisions about PFO closure for such patients should be based upon an individualized assessment of potential risks and benefits and patient preferences. PFO closure is not performed in most patients &gt;60 years old in this setting but may be an option for selected patients such as younger patients in this age range who have low estimated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Exceptions</strong> – Among patients who otherwise meet criteria for percutaneous PFO closure, management may differ in the following clinical settings:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Concurrent indication for anticoagulation</strong> – If otherwise indicated, PFO device closure may be temporarily deferred for patients with a concurrent indication for short-term anticoagulation (≤1 year); the benefit of PFO device closure is uncertain for patients with a concurrent indication for long-term anticoagulation, as discussed below.

(See <a class="local">'Benefit'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Note that the evidence from a 2021 meta-analysis [<a href="#rid6">6</a>] supporting the use of the PASCAL classification was published after the 2018 European position paper on the management of patients with PFO [<a href="#rid7">7</a>], the 2019 Clinical Commissioning Policy for PFO closure from the National Health Service in England [<a href="#rid8">8</a>], the 2020 American Academy of Neurology practice advisory [<a href="#rid9">9</a>], and the 2021 stroke prevention guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Therefore, recommendations from these guidelines did not incorporate the PASCAL classification.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4240491584"><span class="h2">Special considerations in anticoagulated patients</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with venous thromboembolism that is provoked by a known event or an identifiable transient risk factor are generally treated with anticoagulation for 3 to 12 months, and anticoagulation is generally the sole antithrombotic therapy required. In such cases, PFO device closure, if otherwise indicated, can be postponed until anticoagulation is stopped. For patients assigned to PFO closure in the RESPECT trial, the incidence of venous thromboembolism more than 30 days postprocedure was higher among those with a history of overt deep vein thrombosis than for those without such a history [<a href="#rid11">11</a>].</p><p>For patients with an embolic-appearing stroke who have an indication for chronic (&gt;12 months) anticoagulation (eg, unprovoked or recurrent deep venous thrombosis), the benefit of PFO closure is uncertain. For such patients, we suggest individualized, multidisciplinary, shared decision-making that accounts for the risks of thrombosis, embolism, and intervention in determining whether to proceed with chronic anticoagulation alone or to also perform percutaneous PFO closure. For most patients with a concurrent indication for anticoagulation &gt;1 year, PFO closure is not performed, given its uncertain benefit. PFO closure may be an option for selected patients such as those who experience recurrent embolic stroke without other identified cause while therapeutically anticoagulated and those who are no longer anticoagulated.</p><p>Excepting venous thromboembolism, most common indications for anticoagulation are also potential higher-risk mechanisms for embolic stroke, such as atrial fibrillation and prosthetic heart valves. For patients with these conditions, cardiogenic embolism is the most likely cause of the stroke, and a PFO likely to be an incidental finding; in these settings, the presence of a PFO does not generally alter management.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H23072275"><span class="h2">Informed decision-making</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Consideration of PFO closure, including benefits, risks, and alternative treatment options, must be discussed with the patient by the neurologist and cardiologist. The patient should understand the immediate and long-term potential benefits and risks of treatment options (including decreased risk of recurrent stroke and increased risk of atrial fibrillation with PFO percutaneous device closure) in order to make an appropriately informed decision that accounts for their own values and preferences.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1662503289"><span class="h1">PERCUTANEOUS PFO CLOSURE</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H987058134"><span class="h2">Indications and exclusions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Selection criteria for candidates for percutaneous PFO closure are discussed above. (See <a class="local">'Patient selection for PFO closure'</a> above.)</p><p>Exclusions to percutaneous device closure include the presence of an inferior vena cava filter, elevated bleeding risk or coagulopathy, and vascular, cardiac, or PFO anatomy that is unsuitable for device placement.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1580714703"><span class="h2">Benefit</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The balance of evidence from randomized controlled trials suggests that percutaneous PFO closure is more effective for preventing recurrent ischemic stroke than antiplatelet therapy alone for highly selected patients who have an apparently embolic (seemingly cryptogenic) ischemic stroke and a PFO [<a href="#rid11">11-14</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Percutaneous PFO closure'</a> above.)</p><p>Clinical trial evidence suggests that PFO percutaneous device closure is more effective than antiplatelet therapy alone for reducing the risk of recurrent stroke in select patients aged ≤60 years with an embolic-appearing ischemic stroke who have a PFO with a right-to-left interatrial shunt and who have no other identified stroke cause or mechanism. The risk of recurrent stroke with device closure is reduced by approximately 60 percent compared with medical therapy (eg, from approximately 5 to 2 percent during a three- to six-year period) [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]; the corresponding number needed to treat to prevent one recurrent stroke during this period is approximately 30. The patients most likely to benefit may be those with a large right-to-left interatrial shunt and/or an associated atrial septal aneurysm (ASA), characteristics that suggest an increased risk for paradoxical embolism.</p><p>Almost all randomized controlled trials of percutaneous PFO closure have reported point estimates suggesting that PFO closure is more effective than medical therapy for reducing recurrent stroke rates. These results were not statistically significant by intention-to-treat analyses in the first three trials (CLOSURE I [<a href="#rid16">16</a>], PC [<a href="#rid17">17</a>], and RESPECT [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]), but were significant in later trials (RESPECT extended follow-up [<a href="#rid11">11</a>], REDUCE [<a href="#rid14">14</a>], and CLOSE [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]). The trials that found clear benefit for PFO device closure were likely positive because of several factors. First, these latter trials enrolled subjects when off-label PFO closure had waned to some extent, and thus it is possible that patients who were more likely to benefit were included in these studies. Furthermore, to varying degrees for the individual studies, they included a requirement for neuroimaging confirmation of stroke prior to enrollment, excluded lacunar infarcts, provided longer follow-up, and selected patients with PFO features (ie, large shunt size or presence of an associated ASA) that may portend an increased risk of paradoxical embolism. Meta-analyses of closure trials consistently show that patients in the PFO closure groups had increased rates of newly detected atrial fibrillation compared with the medical therapy groups [<a href="#rid15">15,19</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Adverse effects'</a> below.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Meta-analyses</strong> – In a 2018 meta-analysis that included four trials (PC [<a href="#rid17">17</a>], RESPECT extended follow-up [<a href="#rid11">11</a>], REDUCE [<a href="#rid14">14</a>], and CLOSE [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]) with 2531 subjects and follow-up ranging from 3.2 to 5.9 years, PFO closure reduced the risk of recurrent stroke from 5.1 percent with medical therapy to 1.8 percent (absolute risk reduction [ARR] 3.3 percent, 95% CI 6.2-0.4 percent) [<a href="#rid15">15,20</a>]. Based on these data, the number needed to treat with PFO device closure to prevent one recurrent stroke was approximately 30. Similarly, a separate 2018 meta-analysis that included the same trials, with follow-up ranging from 2.1 to 5.3 years, found that PFO closure reduced the risk of recurrent stroke from 4.1 percent with medical therapy to 1.2 percent (ARR 3.1 percent, 95% CI 5.1-1.0 percent) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Both meta-analyses excluded the CLOSURE I trial because it used the STARFlex PFO closure device, which was associated with higher complication and lower procedural success rates than the PFO closure devices used in the other trials and is no longer available [<a href="#rid15">15,19</a>]. Other meta-analyses of PFO closure have generally reported similar findings [<a href="#rid21">21-29</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">A 2021 meta-analysis of individual patient data (n = 3740) from six randomized controlled trials, with a median follow-up of 57 months, found that PFO closure reduced the annualized incidence of stroke compared with medical therapy alone (0.47 versus 1.09 percent, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.41, 95% CI 0.28-0.60) [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. Importantly, the risk reduction for recurrent stroke with PFO closure varied among subgroups with different probabilities that the stroke was causally related to the PFO, as determined by the Risk of Paradoxical Embolism (RoPE) score  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef97895" href="/z/d/graphic/97895.html" rel="external">table 2</a>) and a modified PFO-associated stroke causal likelihood (PASCAL) classification  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef134674" href="/z/d/graphic/134674.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). For the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke with PFO closure compared with medical therapy alone, patients with high RoPE score (ie, higher risk PFO) had an HR of 0.21 (95% CI 0.11-0.42), while those with a low RoPE score (ie, lower risk PFO) had an HR of 0.61 (95% CI 0.37-1.00). However, patients categorized by the PASCAL classification as probable, possible, or unlikely to have a PFO-associated stroke had HRs of 0.10 (95% CI 0.03-0.35), 0.38 (95% CI 0.22-0.65), and 1.14 (95% CI 0.53-2.46), respectively. Thus, the PASCAL score provides greater discrimination of who is likely to benefit from closure and by what degree, compared with the RoPE score alone. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1100.html" rel="external">"Stroke associated with patent foramen ovale (PFO): Evaluation", section on 'RoPE score'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1100.html" rel="external">"Stroke associated with patent foramen ovale (PFO): Evaluation", section on 'PASCAL classification'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Individual trials</strong> – The individual trials used the broad term "cryptogenic" rather than "PFO-associated" stroke but aimed to enroll the latter, and reported the following results:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In the CLOSURE I trial, 909 adult patients ≤60 years old with a PFO and cryptogenic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) were randomly assigned either to PFO device closure (n = 447) or to medical therapy (n = 462) [<a href="#rid16">16</a>].

Several meta-analyses have confirmed that PFO closure increases the risk of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter [<a href="#rid6">6,15,19,21-23,26,33</a>], with a risk difference (ie, absolute risk increase) of 3.4 percent in one of the meta-analyses [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Of note, atrial fibrillation is a frequent complication of cardiac surgery, which is relevant for patients undergoing cardiac surgery with concomitant PFO closure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1011.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation and flutter after cardiac surgery"</a>.)</p><p>One concern about new onset atrial fibrillation is its potential long-term impact on the risk of stroke and other embolic events, but limited information is available on the clinical course of postprocedural atrial fibrillation. The management of new-onset atrial fibrillation after PFO closure (whether by device or surgery) is similar to that after cardiac surgery generally, as reviewed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1011.html" rel="external">"Atrial fibrillation and flutter after cardiac surgery"</a>.)</p><p>Other complications, all rare, include hematoma at the puncture site, device migration, device embolization, device erosion, and device thrombosis with possible and recurrent ischemic stroke. (See <a class="local">'Recurrent ischemic stroke'</a> below.)</p><p>Device erosion is rare (0.2 to 0.3 percent of cases) after device closure of atrial septal defects (ASDs), in most cases occurring during the first six months after implantation [<a href="#rid34">34,35</a>], and may be rarer with device closure of PFOs. Device erosion can lead to cardiac perforation with pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, and fistula formation or may rarely create an atrial septal defect [<a href="#rid36">36,37</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2766327485"><span class="h2">Preprocedural imaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients with an embolic infarct and no other evident source of stroke who are being considered for PFO closure should undergo transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to confirm that the intracardiac shunt is caused by a PFO, to define atrial septal anatomy (including thickness of rims around the PFO) and suitability for device closure, and to exclude other causes of embolic stroke (eg, intracardiac thrombus, mass or vegetation) or shunt [<a href="#rid38">38</a>]. The atrial septum is carefully examined to determine whether there are one or more concomitant ASDs and/or an atrial septal aneurysm (defined as a redundant mobile interatrial septal tissue in the region of the fossa ovalis with phasic excursion of at least 10 to 15 mm). The length of the PFO tunnel is also assessed. If a PFO is accompanied by one or more secundum-type ASDs, the location and size of these defects are examined to determine whether all the defects can be closed percutaneously by one or two devices and whether a surgical approach might be preferred.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H466938532"><span class="h2">Procedure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Percutaneous PFO closure should be performed using an approved PFO closure device. Access to the right atrium is established via the right femoral vein, and the PFO is crossed with a guidewire or catheter under fluoroscopic and echocardiographic (either TEE or intracardiac) guidance [<a href="#rid34">34</a>]. After the left atrium is accessed, an exchange-length stiff guidewire is advanced into a pulmonary vein. Balloon sizing may be used to determine the size of the device (typically twice the size of the balloon-stretched diameter of the defect). After the balloon is withdrawn, the delivery system is advanced into the left atrium over the guidewire. The device and the delivery system are flushed prior to insertion and the catheters aspirated to avoid air embolism. The left-sided occluder is opened in the left atrium and retracted against the interatrial septum before the right-sided occluder is opened. After device position is confirmed by echocardiography, the closure device is released from the delivery system. Echocardiography is performed after device release to assess for residual shunting and presence of any complications.</p><p>The echocardiographic guidance is achieved by intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) or TEE. ICE, performed via a second venous access to the right atrium, is generally preferred, as it avoids the general anesthesia and intubation required for TEE [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. When TEE is not used, the percutaneous closure procedure (with ICE) is generally performed with conscious sedation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3835631836"><span class="h2">Antithrombotic therapy during the procedure</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients undergoing percutaneous device closure routinely receive antithrombotic therapy prior to, during, and following the procedure, though specific regimens vary.

The overall freedom from an ischemic episode at one and four years was 93 and 83 percent, respectively. The recurrent events were transient ischemic attacks (there were no cerebral infarctions), one of which was attributed to giant cell arteritis. Transesophageal echocardiography showed that the closures were intact in all patients, implying that paradoxical embolization was not the cause of the ischemic events.</p><p>In patients with high cardiovascular risk and an incidentally discovered PFO, surgical closure may actually increase the risk of postoperative stroke. This conclusion comes from a retrospective study of over 13,000 adults without a prior diagnosis of PFO or atrial septal defect who had cardiothoracic surgery [<a href="#rid43">43</a>]. A PFO was detected intraoperatively in 2277 patients, and closure was performed at the discretion of the surgeon in 28 percent. Using propensity-matched analysis, the risk of perioperative stroke was significantly higher in patients who had surgical PFO closure than in those who did not (2.8 versus 1.2 percent; odds ratio 2.47, 95% CI 1.02-6.0).
