It is characterized by deficits in intellectual and adaptive functioning of varying severity with onset before 18 to 22 years of age [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. ID encompasses a broad spectrum of functioning, disability, needs, and strengths. It is an important public health issue because of its prevalence and the need for support services. ID affects approximately 1 percent of the population. Its management requires early diagnosis and intervention, including access to health care and appropriate supports.</p><p>The definition and diagnosis of ID, as well as assessment of needs for support, are reviewed here. Other aspects of ID are discussed separately:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6189.html" rel="external">"Intellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6191.html" rel="external">"Intellectual disability (ID) in children: Management, outcomes, and prevention"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">TERMINOLOGY</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3050791390"><span class="h2">Global developmental delay</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Global developmental delay (GDD) is the preferred term to describe intellectual and adaptive impairment in infants and young children &lt;5 years old who fail to meet expected developmental milestones in multiple areas of functioning. GDD may be used as a provisional diagnosis until comprehensive standardized testing can be accurately and reliably completed [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Not all children with GDD meet criteria for ID as they grow older.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H385880598"><span class="h2">Intellectual disability</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Intellectual disability (ID) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that begins in childhood and is characterized by limitations in both intelligence and adaptive skills, affecting at least one of three adaptive domains (conceptual, social, and practical), with varying severity  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef90174 graphicRef95384" href="/d/graphic/90174.html" rel="external">table 1A-B</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. The extent of adaptive impairment is key to defining ID and its severity. </p><p>As discussed above, the term ID usually is applied to children meeting criteria at approximately five years of age, while GDD is the preferred term in children &lt;5 years. However, a diagnosis of ID can be made earlier if the child meets ID criteria. In some cases, this can be important for obtaining appropriate supportive services.</p><p>The diagnostic criteria and severity classification for ID are described in detail below. (See <a class="local">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> below and <a class="local">'Severity classification'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H259161892"><span class="h2">Syndromic versus nonsyndromic intellectual disability</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ID may be further categorized as syndromic or nonsyndromic ID. The term syndromic ID is applied when intellectual and adaptive impairment occurs with other physical or comorbid symptoms that may be recognizable as a syndrome. When ID occurs without features of a possible recognizable syndrome, the term nonsyndromic ID is used.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H900951044"><span class="h1">EPIDEMIOLOGY, RISK FACTORS, AND CAUSES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the general population, the prevalence of global developmental delay (GDD) is estimated to be 1 to 3 percent and the prevalence of ID is approximately 1 percent; most cases are mild [<a href="#rid3">3-5</a>].</p><p>The causes of ID are extensive and include conditions that interfere with brain development and functioning. Among the known causes of ID, the majority are genetic conditions. A minority of cases are due to acquired causes such as teratogens, toxins, infections, trauma, birth asphyxia, and nutritional deficiencies.</p><p>The epidemiology and causes of ID are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6189.html" rel="external">"Intellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause", section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6189.html" rel="external">"Intellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause", section on 'Causes'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H167151114"><span class="h1">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H167159851"><span class="h2">Presentation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The cause of ID and the severity of impairment affect when and how a child presents. Mild delays are more common than severe delays, and gross motor functions are usually relatively spared.</p><p>Children with severe ID present earlier than those with mild ID. Severely affected children are usually recognized before two years of age. Most children with mild impairment present with delayed language or are detected by routine developmental surveillance and screening. However, some children with mild ID may be undetected until school age. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/615.html" rel="external">"Developmental-behavioral surveillance and screening in primary care"</a>.)</p><p>Patients with specific dysmorphic features due to a genetic syndrome (eg, Down syndrome) may be diagnosed in infancy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2917.html" rel="external">"Down syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p>Parental concerns that may alert the pediatrician to the possibility of ID include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Language delay – Language delay with global developmental delay (GDD) suggests cognitive impairment but should be distinguished from primary language disorder (persistent difficulty acquiring or using language) or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with or without ID. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/616.html" rel="external">"Etiology of speech and language disorders in children"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/628.html" rel="external">"Autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents: Evaluation and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Immature behavior, play, or self-help skills – Social skills/interrelatedness generally correlate with the child's level of cognitive functioning.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Learning difficulties. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/613.html" rel="external">"Specific learning disorders in children: Evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A younger sibling "overtaking" the child.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H167151304"><span class="h2">Associated conditions</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H529931049"><span class="h3">Comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders and mental health problems</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Other neurodevelopmental disorders are approximately five times more likely in children with ID compared with their peers. Comorbid neurodevelopmental and mental health disorders affect approximately 30 to 70 percent of children with ID but often go unrecognized. This can adversely impact learning, functioning, quality of life, and adaptation. Behavioral and emotional problems are more likely, even if impairment is insufficient to meet diagnostic criteria for a specific mental health disorder [<a href="#rid6">6,7</a>].</p><p>Neurodevelopmental disorders associated with ID include the following  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118431" href="/d/graphic/118431.html" rel="external">table 2</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ASD</strong> – ASD commonly co-occurs with ID. In one study, 28 percent of children with ID had comorbid ASD; one-half of these cases were not diagnosed during routine care [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. When both ID and ASD are present, intelligence quotient (IQ) scores are less stable, particularly in young children.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The diagnostic features of ASD, including impairments in social communication, must be identified and distinguished from social and communication delays of ID alone. The child with concurrent ASD usually "misses" specific social communication and social interaction milestones or features typically expected at or by the child's general developmental level. Some children may have behaviors that appear autistic (eg, stereotypic hand movements, social anxiety, gaze aversion with strangers) but may not meet the full diagnostic criteria for ASD. However, characteristic ASD features can become more obvious over time. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/627.html" rel="external">"Autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents: Clinical features", section on 'Impaired social communication and interaction'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">ASD occurs commonly in syndromic ID, particularly fragile X syndrome, in which the prevalence of ASD ranges from 25 to 47 percent [<a href="#rid9">9-11</a>]. ASD is somewhat less common in children with Down syndrome (&lt;10 percent) [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. Tuberous sclerosis, Angelman syndrome, Rett syndrome, Joubert syndrome, and Cohen syndrome are also associated with having comorbid ASD [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/595.html" rel="external">"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children and adolescents: Terminology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis", section on 'Associated conditions and syndromes'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</strong> – Children with ID may have comorbid ADHD, with inattentiveness incongruent to their developmental level of functioning. ADHD is common in children with Down syndrome (44 percent in one study) [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. It is the most common neurobehavioral diagnosis in boys with fragile X syndrome. In children with ID, ADHD may occur along with other comorbid neurodevelopmental or learning disorders [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. ADHD must be distinguished from situational inattentiveness (ie, apparent only in certain circumstances such as academic learning), difficulty comprehending and following rules and expectations, anxiety, medication side effects, or simply demands that are too high. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/624.html" rel="external">"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis", section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Learning disabilities</strong> – Children with ID commonly have difficulties in general and academic learning. These are pertinent to consider individually even if they are attributed to ID (eg, phonologic difficulties frequently cause reading deficits in individuals with mild ID) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. When learning function is disproportionately affected, beyond what is expected for the child's ID, and not explained by another factor (eg, vision or hearing impairment), the child is considered to have a specific learning disorder in addition to ID [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/610.html" rel="external">"Specific learning disorders in children: Clinical features"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Feeding and</strong> <strong>eating disorders</strong> – Abnormal feeding and eating behaviors include pica (persistently eating substances that are not food) and rumination disorder (repeated regurgitation of undigested food into the mouth, during or shortly after eating). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2093.html" rel="external">"Eating disorders: Overview of epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Pica'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2093.html" rel="external">"Eating disorders: Overview of epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Rumination disorder'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Depression and anxiety</strong> – Depressive and anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are frequent treatable comorbid conditions in children and adolescents with ID. Depression may present as aggressive or irritable behavior, fatigue, diminished performance, changes in sleep, or weight gain. Clinical suspicion and assessment aided by annual adolescent screening for depression are important [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Depression and/or anxiety can be triggered by relocation, caregiver changes, and effects of medication (eg, beta blockers, neuroleptic drugs) or associated conditions (eg, hypothyroidism). Assessing severely impaired children with limited communication can be challenging, and atypical presentation is more likely with increasing ID severity. Children with ID are at increased risk of suicidal ideation and for substance abuse. Screening is advised to identify these disorders, which impact functioning.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Movement disorders</strong> – Stereotyped behaviors, stimulating movement, and motor mannerisms are common in severe ID. Stereotypic movement disorder (including possible self-injury) affects up to approximately 15 percent of children with ID. Stereotypic movements are more common among children with severe or syndromic ID (eg, Rett syndrome). Triggers of stereotypic movements may include social isolation, stress, pain, anxiety, fear, sensory impairment, or disordered sleep [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Developmental coordination disorder can also impact everyday motor tasks. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6232.html" rel="external">"Hyperkinetic movement disorders in children", section on 'Stereotypies'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/594.html" rel="external">"Developmental coordination disorder: Clinical features and diagnosis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Self-injurious behaviors</strong> – Self-injurious and aggressive behaviors occur commonly in individuals with ID who have limited communication when they are experiencing stress, depression, or anxiety [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. Aggressive or self-injurious behavior can also result from side effects of sedative-hypnotic and neuroleptic medication. Self-injurious behavior is also a characteristic feature of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6232.html" rel="external">"Hyperkinetic movement disorders in children", section on 'Lesch-Nyhan syndrome'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H82409940"><span class="h3">Medical and physical conditions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Numerous medical and physical conditions are commonly associated with ID  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118431" href="/d/graphic/118431.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Care should be taken to promptly identify these conditions. When a genetic cause is identified, the patient should be evaluated for comorbid conditions known to be associated with the specific syndrome (eg, hypothyroidism in patients with Down syndrome).</p><p>Medical and physical conditions commonly associated with ID include the following  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118431" href="/d/graphic/118431.html" rel="external">table 2</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cerebral palsy.

This should include interventions to improve dental hygiene and gingival health, reduce bruxism (teeth grinding), and prevent dental trauma [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. An array of orodental pathologies can contribute to behavioral disturbances children with ID or be a missed cause of pain in an impaired child.

Risk factors that predispose to obesity include altered or inappropriate eating habits, underlying genetic syndromes, less physical activity, chronic health conditions, and psychotropic medication use [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>]. Children with ID should be monitored with serial measures of weight, height, and body mass index and by review of risk factors.

However, it is helpful to recognize categories of severity when considering needs and interventions. The severity of ID is defined according to the level of adaptive impairment and the level of support needed  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95384" href="/d/graphic/95384.html" rel="external">table 1B</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. While the definition of ID is similar according to both the DSM-5 and the AAIDD, different categories are used to define severity.

The extent of adaptive impairment is key to defining ID and its severity. The term ID replaces the older term of "mental retardation." Global developmental delay (GDD) is the term applied to children under five years of age who fail to meet expected developmental milestones and have significant impairments in multiple developmental areas of functioning. (See <a class="local">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Clinical features</strong> – The cause of ID and the severity of impairment affect when and how a child presents. Children with severe ID present earlier than those with mild ID. Most children with ID have mild impairment and present with delayed language or are detected by routine developmental surveillance and screening. (See <a class="local">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Associated conditions</strong> – Numerous medical, physical, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric conditions are associated with ID  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118431" href="/d/graphic/118431.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). Care should be taken to promptly identify these conditions. (See <a class="local">'Associated conditions'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Screening for GDD and ID</strong> – In addition to performing routine developmental and behavioral screening at the 9-month, 18-month, and 24- or 30-month visits and screening for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) at the 18- and 24-month visits, screening with a validated instrument should also be performed any time a parent or clinician has concerns about the child's development  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef116108 graphicRef116107" href="/d/graphic/116108.html" rel="external">table 3A-B</a>). Developmental-behavioral screening in primary care is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/615.html" rel="external">"Developmental-behavioral surveillance and screening in primary care"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Comprehensive evaluation</strong> – If a screening test suggests developmental delay, comprehensive developmental-behavioral evaluation is warranted. A stepwise approach is favored according to the needs of the individual. The evaluation generally includes the following:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A focused history and comprehensive physical examination. (See <a class="local">'History'</a> above and <a class="local">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Referral to a developmental pediatrician, pediatric neurologist, and/or psychologist for a comprehensive neurodevelopmental evaluation. (See <a class="local">'Assessment of adaptive function'</a> above and <a class="local">'Assessment of intellectual function'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>A comprehensive school-based evaluation, if appropriate, which helps to determine educational and individual support needs. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/613.html" rel="external">"Specific learning disorders in children: Evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Formal assessment of speech, language, and communication.

(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6189.html" rel="external">"Intellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause", section on 'Approach to diagnostic testing'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Additional assessments as appropriate (eg, referral to a child psychiatrist if there are psychiatric comorbidities; evaluation by occupational and physical therapists to assist in assessing functional impairments, strengths, needs, and supports; social work referral to assess child and family needs). (See <a class="local">'Other assessments'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Diagnosis</strong> – The diagnosis of ID is based upon identifying impairments in <strong>both</strong> adaptive and intellectual functioning, with onset before the age of 18 years. Assessment of intellectual and adaptive functioning should be performed using standardized, valid, and reliable instruments  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118432" href="/d/graphic/118432.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). The instrument used should be appropriate for the child's level of functioning and take into account the child's age, language, culture, communication, socioeconomic status, and disability profile. Other factors such as ease of administration and examiner experience may also be considered. The tool should have current norms since out-of-date norms falsely inflate scores. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Severity classification</strong> – The severity of ID is defined by the degree of impairment in adaptive functioning and the level of support needed rather than by intellectual function or intelligence quotient (IQ) score  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef95384" href="/d/graphic/95384.html" rel="external">table 1B</a>).
