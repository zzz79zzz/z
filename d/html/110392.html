The approach to therapy is often the same, though it is worth noting that patients with syndromic causes of HCM are often excluded from studies of medical and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy. In addition, the prognosis is generally worse for syndromic HCM, as discussed below.

Worsening of the LVOT gradient, particularly when volume-depleted, can lead to hypotension, lightheadedness, and syncope. For those with symptomatic nonobstructive HCM, cardiac output is reliant on preload, and volume depletion can lead to low cardiac output.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Avoidance of medications that may increase the LVOT gradient</strong> – Medications that can increase the LVOT gradient should be avoided, including:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Vasodilators</strong> – Vasodilators, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12643" href="/z/d/drug information/12643.html" rel="external">nifedipine</a>, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12603" href="/z/d/drug information/12603.html" rel="external">amlodipine</a>), and <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12646" href="/z/d/drug information/12646.html" rel="external">nitroglycerin</a> can produce a decrease in peripheral resistance with an increase in LVOT obstruction and filling pressures, thereby resulting in hypotension and/or worsening heart failure (HF) symptoms [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Diuretics</strong> – By reducing preload, diuretics can result in less LV filling and a smaller LV chamber, and, therefore, greater outflow obstruction.

In our practice, we generally initiate pharmacologic therapy (usually with a beta blocker) if the LVOT gradient is moderate or higher (ie, ≥50 mmHg at rest). Part of the rationale for treating patients with a moderate or high LVOT gradient even in the absence of apparent symptoms is that some pediatric patients, particularly young children, may not reliably report symptoms. Thus, it is difficult to establish whether the patient is truly asymptomatic. However, other experts do not treat asymptomatic patients regardless of the LVOT gradient.</p><p>When the decision is made to start treatment in an asymptomatic patient, we generally start with a beta blocker. A nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (eg, <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12879" href="/z/d/drug information/12879.html" rel="external">verapamil</a>) is another reasonable option.

A nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (usually <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="12879" href="/z/d/drug information/12879.html" rel="external">verapamil</a>) is a reasonable alternative option for monotherapy in patients ≥1 year who are intolerant of beta blockers due to side effects.
