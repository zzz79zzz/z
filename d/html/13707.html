         The design and execution of a fusiform ellipse are fundamental skills of skin surgery. The purpose of this procedure is to remove a skin specimen and, in the process, produce a cosmetically acceptable linear scar. Although the nomenclature for the procedure may vary depending upon the design (eg, elliptical, fusiform, tangent-to-circle), the purpose remains the same.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since the design of most skin excisions involves sharp, not blunt, points at each end, the most appropriate description of this design is either fusiform or tangent-to-circle, and not elliptical  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96128" href="/z/d/graphic/96128.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The principles of the fusiform ellipse, such as anatomy, skin tension, tissue movement, and suturing technique, are the same principles necessary to perform more advanced skin surgery, such as advancement flaps, curvilinear excisions, and M- or S-plasties. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/114188.html" rel="external">
          "Overview of flaps for soft tissue reconstruction", section on 'Skin'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic will discuss the design and execution of the fusiform/elliptical excision. Skin biopsy techniques, Mohs surgery, the principles of graft and flaps for reconstructive surgery, and head/neck anatomic danger zones are discussed separately. The prevention and treatment of skin surgery complications are also discussed separately.

         The indications for the fusiform ellipse are the removal of benign or malignant skin lesions and the biopsy of dermatoses or inflammatory disorders in anatomic locations where a linear scar is acceptable. Specific anatomic locations that are particularly amenable to the fusiform ellipse include the trunk, arms, legs, scalp, forehead, and cheek.

         Appropriate margins must be defined before removing benign or malignant skin lesions. Recommended margins for common indications are as follows:

         Medications, including over-the-counter supplements, should be reviewed for items that may increase the risk of postoperative bleeding.

          DESIGN OF THE FUSIFORM ELLIPSE

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The first step in the design of a fusiform ellipse is to carefully outline the clinical margins of the lesion itself, and then outline the appropriate amount of additional tissue to remove around it (margins) using a marker. Finally, the fusiform ellipse is drawn around this.
        </p>
        <p>
         As a rule of thumb, it is most advantageous to orient a fusiform ellipse so that it parallels or lies within a relaxed skin tension line while patients are in an anatomically neutral position, such as sitting or standing, rather than recumbent. In addition, the author considers two other factors when orienting a fusiform ellipse: maximum tension during activity and local tissue laxity. Various schematics of relaxed skin tension lines in different anatomic locations are available as a guide  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57566 graphicRef50913" href="/z/d/graphic/57566.html" rel="external">

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important to manipulate the skin surrounding the lesion with the patient in the anatomically neutral position by gently pinching between the index finger and thumb in order to fully evaluate the most appropriate orientation for the fusiform ellipse. Generally, orienting the fusiform ellipse along the axis of greatest laxity, which is usually along a relaxed skin tension line, will produce the least noticeable final scar  (

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         In areas of relatively high skin tension, such as the back, forearm, or leg, it may be prudent to orient the long axis of the fusiform ellipse along the axis of greatest tension during movement. It is helpful to have the patients assume a position of maximum tension for each anatomic area (eg, standing, squatting, crossing arms in front of the chest) when determining the appropriate orientation of the fusiform ellipse. At times (especially on the back) this orientation may be different from the relaxed skin tension lines, and rarely even perpendicular to them.
        </p>
        <p>
         With the proper orientation of the fusiform ellipse in mind, the lines connecting the circle and the tips of the ellipse should be marked. The most common design for a fusiform ellipse involves a length-to-width ratio in the range of 3:1 to 4:1 and corresponding angles at the apices in the range of 30 degrees. In most instances, these ratios facilitate adequate tissue removal while minimizing or eliminating a standing tissue cone ("dog ear"  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96324" href="/z/d/graphic/96324.html" rel="external">

         )) once the surgical defect has been linearized with sutures.
        </p>
        <p>
         The lines that connect the circle to the tips of the ellipse may be either curved or straight and thereby result in either a fusiform or tangent-to-circle (rhombic) shape  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96128" href="/z/d/graphic/96128.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The tangent-to-circle is simpler to design, easier to execute (it is easier to cut a straight line than a curved line), and removes less tissue. One potential disadvantage of the tangent-to-circle is the possibility of a small gap that tends to develop in the center of the linear repair at the point where the paired tangential lines oppose each other. This phenomenon tends to be most common when performing surgery on the scalp. However, this gap is easily negated with meticulous suturing or designing the opposing tangents to be slightly offset [

The appropriate depth for most fusiform excisions is the mid-to-upper adipose layer except for certain locations such as the scalp (subgaleal plane), arm/leg (above fascia), and the cartilaginous portions of the ear/nose (above perichondrium). A scalpel or iris scissors should be utilized to extend the incision in a uniform plane below the fusiform specimen so that the sides and base of the surgical defect form a 90 degree angle.

          —
         </span>
         The main purpose of suturing the wound that results from the excision of a fusiform ellipse is to facilitate the healing and achieve a well-hidden, thin linear scar. The wound edges of a fusiform ellipse are most commonly reapproximated with two layers of sutures. The first, or buried, layer of sutures should be placed on the dermis and subcutis and should be composed of absorbable material that is generally of 4-0 or 3-0 caliber on the trunk, scalp, and extremities and 5-0 or 4-0 on the face. A variety of suture materials may be utilized to reapproximate the epidermal edges. The most common option is nylon and is generally 5-0 or 6-0 caliber for the face and 5-0 or 4-0 caliber for the trunk, scalp, and extremities. Alternatives to nylon suture are staples, fast-absorbing gut (generally 5-0 caliber), or 2-octyl cyanoacrylate.
        </p>
        <p>
         A buried vertical mattress suture is the mainstay for reapproximating of wound edges in skin surgery. A simple mantra that can help conceptualize the technique is "deep to superficial, superficial to deep." The purpose of the buried vertical mattress suture is to optimize wound edge eversion (and thereby optimize the final aesthetic outcome) while burying the surgical knot in the deep dermis/superficial adipose tissue. In order to obtain adequate wound eversion and minimize "dead space" at the base of the wound, the first throw of the suture should enter the reticular dermis at the junction of the adipose tissue  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96131" href="/z/d/graphic/96131.html" rel="external">
          figure 3
         </a>
         ). The suture should then pass through the dermis along the natural curve of the needle to a maximum height in the papillary dermis and then exit the dermis approximately 1 to 2 mm below the apex of the suture path in the dermis.
        </p>
        <p>
         This technique should be mirrored exactly on the opposing wound edge. Depending upon the wound tension, buried sutures may be placed every 0.5 to 1 cm. The extent to which the wound edge is everted must be carefully considered. Too much eversion may result in a "rope-like" scar, while insufficient eversion may result in a depressed scar. With the wound edges sufficiently approximated, the alignment of the epidermal edges should be reinforced with either simple or running sutures or cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive.

The wound may then be resutured or allowed to heal by second intention. In either case, a seven-day course of oral antibiotics that cover common skin contaminants (eg,

Commonly, the lengths of the arcs on each side will be unequal. Therefore, it is important to follow the "rule of halves" in order to minimize the development of standing tissue cones  (

         <strong>
          Design of the fusiform ellipse
         </strong>
         – The design and execution of a fusiform ellipse are fundamental skills of skin surgery. The first step in the design of a fusiform ellipse is outlining the clinical margins of the lesions with a marker and determining the appropriate amount of additional tissue to remove. As a rule of thumb, the long axis of the ellipse should be parallel or lie within a relaxed skin tension line  (

         </a>
         ) while patients are in an anatomically neutral position. (See

          'Design of the fusiform ellipse'

         above.)

         <strong>
          Incision
         </strong>
         – The incision is made through the dermis at 90 degrees to the surrounding skin, in a single motion that avoids cross-hatching. The appropriate depth is in most cases the mid-to-upper adipose layer. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Excision'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Suturing
         </strong>
         – The main purpose of suturing the wound is to facilitate healing and achieve a well-hidden, thin linear scar. The wound edges of a fusiform ellipse are usually reapproximated with two layers of sutures. The first, or buried, layer of sutures should be placed on the dermis and subcutis and should be made with absorbable material that is generally of 4-0 or 3-0 caliber on the trunk, scalp, and extremities and 5-0 or 4-0 on the face. A variety of suture materials may be utilized to reapproximate the epidermal edges. The most common option is nylon and is generally 5-0 or 6-0 caliber for the face and 5-0 or 4-0 caliber for the trunk, scalp, and extremities. Alternatives to nylon suture are staples, fast-absorbing gut (generally 5-0 caliber), or 2-octyl cyanoacrylate. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Suturing'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Postoperative care
         </strong>
         – The postoperative bandage is made of a thin layer of white petrolatum followed by a pressure dressing consisting of nonstick gauze, a layer of regular gauze, and adhesive tape. It can be removed after 24 hours and the patient may shower immediately. The timing of suture removal varies based on the anatomic site. Sutures on the face may be removed between five and seven days after surgery. In all other locations, the sutures are removed after 10 to 14 days. (See
