         Insulin therapy is the mainstay of treatment for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The goal of insulin therapy is to replace the deficient hormone and attain normoglycemia. However, this goal remains elusive because of the difficulty in replicating the minute-to-minute variations of endogenous (physiologic) insulin secretion directly into the portal vein versus delivery of exogenous insulin, which is absorbed from the subcutaneous injection or infusion site into the systemic circulation. The acute and chronic complications of diabetes are largely attributable to hyperglycemia as a consequence of the failure of exogenous insulin delivery to completely mimic physiologic insulin secretion.
        </p>
        <p>
         Many different insulin preparations and delivery systems are available. The selected regimen is individualized for the child and family/caregiver to fit their lifestyle and optimize adherence while providing optimal glycemic control. Input from the patient, if age-appropriate, and family regarding timing of meals and snacks, school/daycare, and physical activity is important to ensure optimal glycemic control and minimize glycemic variability and episodes of hypoglycemia. As a result, the optimal types of insulin and regimen will vary among children and can change for an individual child over time.
        </p>
        <p>
         This topic review will focus on monitoring of glycemic control and details of insulin therapy, including dosing and dose adjustment, as well as options for administration, including insulin pumps and related devices.

         The goal of management in both children and adults is to maintain glucose control as near to normal as safely possible, by balancing the risks of long-term complications of diabetes against the short-term risks of hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). General targets are the same for all age groups but may vary depending on individual patient characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
         Monitoring glycemic control has three components:

         Hemoglobin A1c – Hemoglobin A1c (A1C; also called blood glycated hemoglobin or glycohemoglobin) is used to evaluate long-term glycemic control. (See

         Blood glucose – Frequent measurements of blood glucose are used to monitor for hypo- and hyperglycemia and are used to adjust insulin dosing and carbohydrate intake. These measurements can be taken by capillary sampling (fingerstick) and measurement with a home blood glucose meter, or with a device for continuous subcutaneous glucose monitoring. (See

         We suggest a target
         <strong>
          A1C of &lt;7 percent
         </strong>
         (53 mmol/mol) for most children and adolescents who have access to comprehensive diabetes care to avoid microvascular and macrovascular complications, consistent with guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. To achieve a target A1C of &lt;7 percent, target blood glucose levels are approximately 70 to 144 mg/dL (4 to 8 mmol/L) before meals and 70 to 180 mg/dL (4 to 10 mmol/L) overall.
        </p>
        <p>
         Glycemic targets should be further tailored to the individual patient [

         For long-term management, if this can be achieved without severe hypoglycemia or excessive burden of care (eg, for those with access to continuous glucose monitoring [CGM] and other advanced diabetes technology). These lower A1C levels are often achievable without increasing the risk of severe hypoglycemia when using contemporary technology, including newer insulins, smart pumps, continuous glucose sensors, and algorithm-controlled insulin delivery [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3-5

          •
         </span>
         For children whose A1C is lower than expected because of conditions that lead to more rapid red cell turnover. In these patients, it is preferable to use serum fructosamine as a measure of glycemic control. Alternatively, for those using a CGM, CGM metrics such as percent time in range and the glucose management indicator (GMI) may be used for this purpose.
        </p>

         In contrast, a less stringent goal (such as A1C &lt;7.5 percent) may be appropriate for children with limited ability to articulate symptoms of hypoglycemia; those without access to tools for optimal insulin delivery (analog insulin formulations, supplies to regularly check capillary blood glucose concentrations, a CGM, or advanced insulin delivery technology); those with lifestyle or psychosocial considerations that may preclude or be exacerbated by efforts to achieve lower glycemic targets; or those whose A1C does not reflect their overall glycemic control (such as patients who are "high glycators").

         <span class="glyph">
          ●

         Even less stringent A1C goals (such as &lt;8 percent) may be appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, or extensive comorbid conditions.

         Hyperglycemia in adults and children with T1DM is associated with micro- and macrovascular complications, and increasing evidence suggests that hyperglycemia may also have adverse effects on the brain of the prepubertal child [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,6-9
         </a>
         ]. The greatest risk reduction of retinopathy and other complications is achieved by maintaining A1C below 7 percent, but there are additional incremental benefits if lower A1C targets can be achieved [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. In the past, the ADA set higher A1C targets for young children because of concerns that more stringent targets might increase the risk for hypoglycemic episodes. However, observational studies and clinical experience with modern management methods (when available) suggest that the target of &lt;7 percent does not significantly increase the risk for severe hypoglycemia and that targets of &lt;6.5 percent may be safely achievable. The benefits of stringent glycemic control are based in part on extensive evidence from adult populations with diabetes, which is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1751.html" rel="external">
          "Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 1 diabetes mellitus"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important to recognize that patients with erratic diabetes control and wide glycemic excursions may achieve an A1C similar to that of patients with more stable glucose levels if the mean blood glucose levels are similar. Reducing glycemic variability is an important goal of therapy because it reduces the risk for hypoglycemia and may also be important for preventing long-term complications [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. Thus, serial measurements of blood glucose, in addition to A1C, are needed for a complete assessment of glycemic control and this is best achieved with a CGM. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Blood glucose monitoring'

         Overall glycemic control – Optimal glycemic control requires frequent glucose monitoring and appropriate adjustment of the insulin dose. Serial fingerstick blood glucose or CGM allows the child and family/caregiver to become familiar with the patient's glycemic response to different types and amount of food, exercise, and stress. Frequent monitoring has been shown to improve glycemic control in children [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,11,12
         </a>

         Detect hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia – Frequent glucose monitoring is also important to detect acute episodes of hyper- and hypoglycemia [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13
         </a>
         ]. Children and their parents/caregivers show poor ability to detect high or low blood glucose levels based on symptoms alone. In a study that compared self-reporting of hypoglycemia with glucose meter results, children aged 6 to 11 years and their parents failed to detect approximately one-half of the episodes of clinically significant hypoglycemia (&lt;55 mg/dL) [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Episodes of hyperglycemia are even more likely to go unrecognized by the patient; regular glucose monitoring helps detect these episodes, prompting both adjustments in insulin dosing and monitoring for ketosis that can prevent or abort DKA. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Testing for ketosis'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Unfortunately, adherence to a schedule of blood glucose monitoring is often suboptimal. Adherence is highest in children under the age of six years and decreases with increasing age [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. Predictors of a lower frequency of monitoring include lower self-esteem, high-stress life events, and inadequate parental support [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Psychosocial support and parental supervision may help optimize the frequency of monitoring in older children.
        </p>
        <p>
         Options for glucose monitoring include multiple daily fingersticks or use of one of several types of devices for CGM (preferred). Selection of the method depends upon the patient's needs and preferences and device availability; considerations for each method are outlined below. (See

          Technology
         </strong>
         – CGM is performed with a subcutaneous sensor that continuously measures interstitial fluid glucose levels. Most CGM devices available for clinical use give real-time feedback to the patient and family/caregiver. They do not directly control insulin administration but provide glucose readings to permit finer control of insulin administration by patients and their families. This type of CGM also provides information about rates of change of rising or falling glucose levels and has alarms that alert patients when glucose levels reach predefined high and low thresholds [
         <a href="#rid19">
          19,20
         </a>
         ]. While earlier versions of the CGM devices were used in conjunction with conventional capillary (fingerstick) blood glucose monitoring for calibration, newer devices do not require such calibration [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. However, confirmatory fingerstick blood glucose measurements may also be required when the patient's symptoms are not consistent with the sensor glucose readings and, sometimes, during sensor warm-up periods.

         Time in range – This refers to the proportion of time that CGM readings are within the target range and is now the preferred method of assessing glycemic control and the efficacy of any insulin regimen. The range is typically set at 70 to 180 mg/dL (3.9 to 10 mmol/L), and the usual goal is to spend &gt;70 percent of time in this range. Some patients striving for tighter control may set a lower and narrower target range. Some guidance uses the term "time in target" to refer to the narrower range of 70 to 140 mg/dL (3.9 to 7.8 mmol/L) [

         Average sensor glucose and GMI – The CGM download also provides measures of average sensor glucose over a period of time (eg, 7 days, 14 days, or longer) and the corresponding GMI, or the average A1C level that would be expected based on the average glucose measured in a larger number of individuals with diabetes. The GMI is ideally derived from at least 14 days of CGM data (eg, average sensor glucose of 54, 70, 144, 180, and 250 mg/dL would correspond to a GMI of 4.6, 5.0, 6.8, 7.6, and 9.3 percent, respectively). Because the laboratory measurement of A1C reflects glycemic control over a longer duration (approximately three months) and is affected by variable rates of glycation of hemoglobin, the GMI typically is not identical to the measured A1C.

          Efficacy
         </strong>
         – CGM devices have moderate efficacy for patients who are willing to use them consistently. In a randomized 26-week trial in 153 adolescents and young adults, participants managed with CGM had a small but significant improvement in glycemic control (A1C 8.9 percent at baseline and 8.5 percent at 26 weeks), whereas those managed with standard fingerstick blood glucose monitoring had no improvement (A1C 8.9 percent at baseline and at 26 weeks) [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ]. Mean time in the target range and satisfaction with the CGM system were significantly higher for patients managed with CGM compared with blood glucose monitoring. This study selected patients with reasonably good adherence to blood glucose monitoring and glycemic control (A1C 7.5 to 10.9 percent), so the findings may not be applicable to a broader population of adolescents who might be less adherent than the cohort that was studied. A randomized trial in 143 younger children (two to eight years old) found that, while CGM use did not alter time spent in target range, it did reduce the time spent in the hypoglycemic range by approximately 40 minutes daily, reduced glucose variability, and improved parents' well-being [

         Adherence to and efficacy of CGM in adolescents is generally lower than in adults, but advances in this technology have lowered the burden of using these devices and may improve usage in less adherent populations.

         CGM can be incorporated into insulin pump therapy. Depending on the system, the sensor glucose values are used to adjust the insulin dose manually, semi-automatically, or automatically. The types of devices are described below. (See

         When blood glucose is monitored by fingerstick (also termed capillary glucose measurements or self-monitoring of blood glucose [SMBG]), measurements should be obtained at least four times per day and, if possible, ideally six times per day (in the fasting state, before meals and large snacks, before and after exercise, at bedtime, and if the child has symptoms of hypoglycemia) [

         More frequent monitoring is often required, depending on age, patterns of food intake, and exercise activity, as well as during illness. Even more frequent monitoring (eg, 7 to 10 times daily or continuous monitoring) becomes necessary in very young children because of their variable feeding and activity patterns [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ] and in patients who have multiple meals and snacks during the day and require blood glucose checks before administration of a premeal bolus of insulin. Patients also need blood glucose monitoring before, during, and after periods of increased physical activity to safeguard against hypoglycemia. Because of these intensive monitoring requirements, CGM should be offered if at all possible to reduce patient burden and improve adherence. (See

         Blood glucose is typically monitored using a blood glucose meter, which requires a small sample of blood (0.3 to 1 microliter) obtained by fingerstick.

The dose varies with the carbohydrate content of food and the blood glucose level. For younger children in whom intake is unpredictable, rapid-acting insulin can be administered after the meal if necessary. However, the goal should be to administer the insulin dose as soon as the parent or caregiver knows how many grams of carbohydrate the child will reliably eat, in order to avoid carbohydrate-insulin mismatch and high followed by low blood glucose levels.

         Intermediate-acting NPH (neutral protamine hagedorn) insulin is usually given in a targeted manner in combination with long-acting insulins. The intermediate-acting insulin provides some coverage for meals. For example, NPH insulin given before breakfast will cover lunch, which may be useful for young children who do not have a school nurse to administer rapid-acting insulin before lunch. The use of intermediate-acting insulin fell out of favor once long-acting insulin preparations became available, given the higher risk of hypoglycemia with the former, particularly when food intake is not timed to match the peak of insulin action. Intermediate-acting insulin is occasionally still used in special situations, such as in combination with short-acting insulin to cover overnight continuous feeds in patients with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes or as a fixed combination with short- or rapid-acting insulin for twice-daily administration in patients poorly adherent to more frequent insulin administration regimens. It is also often used in resource-limited situations because it is much less expensive.

         Needle and syringe – An advantage of needle and syringe is that NPH (neutral protamine hagedorn) and short- or rapid-acting insulins can be mixed in a single injection, thereby reducing the number of injections. However,

         and detemir cannot be mixed with any other form of insulin and must be administered separately. The smallest needle available is 31 gauge and 6 mm (15/64") in length. This small size is used for most patients and is particularly helpful for younger children. Syringes are available in 30 (0.3 mL), 50 (0.5 mL), and 100 (1 mL) unit sizes.

         In infants and toddlers who receive their insulin by syringe, the insulin dose may be so small that dilution is required to allow for easier and more precise administration. The smallest dose of insulin that can be accurately administered without dilution using a syringe is 0.5 units. Many insulins can be diluted either at a specialized pharmacy or at home with proper training. Specific diluent for many insulin preparations is available from the insulin manufacturer. Some insulin pumps can deliver much smaller doses of insulin, of the order of 0.025 units at a time, often obviating this problem.

The smallest needle available is 33 gauge and 4 mm in length, and the smaller needles are preferred for younger children. Although mixed insulin preparations are available in pens, these are not tailored to the needs of children. Mixed insulin pens are usually reserved for individuals who are limited in their ability to make dosing decisions and, as a result, glycemia is not usually as strictly controlled.

         Insulin management can be categorized as "intensive" or "conventional," depending on the frequency and type of insulin dosing. In general, intensive regimens are recommended because they are more likely to meet glycated hemoglobin (A1C) targets and have better clinical outcomes [

         An intensive regimen provides insulin in a manner that more closely approaches physiologic insulin secretion than does conventional therapy. It consists of a basal dose of insulin to suppress lipolysis and hepatic glucose production, with additional premeal and pre-snack boluses of rapid-acting insulin to minimize postprandial elevation of blood glucose. The prandial boluses are adjusted according to the carbohydrate content of meals as well as the measured current blood glucose level. This approach allows greater flexibility than the conventional regimen in terms of timing and carbohydrate content of meals. Insulin regimens administered using an insulin pump are also considered intensive. (See

         A conventional regimen was traditionally used for diabetes management, but this approach is uncommon today because it is unlikely to achieve optimal glycemic control. This type of regimen typically consisted of fixed doses of an intermediate-acting insulin (NPH [neutral protamine hagedorn]) at least twice a day (at breakfast and a second dose either at dinner or bedtime), with a rapid-acting (ie, lispro, aspart, or glulisine) or short-acting ("regular") insulin given two or three times a day. Because the doses are fixed, this type of regimen requires lifestyle adjustment so that meals and vigorous physical activity occur on a relatively fixed daily schedule. Two-thirds of the total daily dose is administered before breakfast (two-thirds as NPH and one-third as rapid- or short-acting insulin) and one-third before dinner and at bedtime (one-third to one-half as rapid- or short-acting insulin before dinner and two-thirds to one-half as NPH at bedtime). The dose of NPH can be split such that a portion is delivered before dinner and the remainder at bedtime.

         A modified-intensive regimen is sometimes used in children and offers the benefit of fewer injections during school hours (useful when a school nurse is not available) and flexibility around meals while at home. Such a regimen includes the administration of an intermediate-acting insulin (NPH) with rapid-acting insulin (based on carbohydrate counting) at breakfast and

         The MDI regimen combines a basal dose(s) of insulin using a long-acting insulin analog with prandial boluses of rapid-acting insulin before each meal and snack.

         – Prandial doses of a rapid-acting insulin are given before each meal or snack. The dose varies from meal to meal and day to day, depending upon the estimated amount of carbohydrates to be consumed, as well as on the premeal blood glucose level and recent or anticipated exercise. In young children with variable and unpredictable food intake during meals and snacks, prandial insulin is often administered immediately after the meal or snack so that the dose can be adjusted to reflect the actual amount of carbohydrates consumed. This strategy is not optimal for blood glucose control and should be converted to premeal boluses as soon as is developmentally possible.

          Technique
         </strong>
         – Insulin pumps deliver a basal rate (small aliquots infused every few minutes, evenly spaced over an hour) of rapid-acting (or rarely, short-acting) insulin subcutaneously. In addition, premeal/pre-snack boluses are administered to minimize increases in postprandial glucose concentrations. Insulin is delivered through a subcutaneously inserted catheter that is replaced at two- to three-day intervals. Information on insulin administration, frequency of catheter site changes, and frequency and timing of premeal insulin boluses can be downloaded from a memory chip within the pump.

         Insulin pump therapy relies on frequent blood glucose monitoring with appropriate adjustment of insulin infusion rates by the patient or parent/caregiver. The pump also can be used in conjunction with a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device; this approach is known as sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy. These systems are described briefly below and in more detail separately. (See

          Efficacy
         </strong>
         – Considerable clinical evidence suggests that insulin pump therapy is similar to or somewhat better than MDI in achieving glycemic control and avoiding hypoglycemic episodes [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,5,38,39
         </a>
         ]. In a 2019 meta-analysis of randomized trials involving children and adolescents, insulin pump therapy modestly reduced A1C compared with MDI (-0.23 percent, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.11 percent) [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39
         </a>
         ]. Severe hypoglycemia occurred less frequently in the insulin pump group, but the finding was not statistically significant (15 versus 22 percent; odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.44-1.12). Episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) were uncommon in both groups (2 versus 1 percent, respectively). Successful use of insulin pump therapy has been reported in children as young as two years of age [

          43
         </a>
         ], glycemic control (A1C) was poor in both treatment groups and did not differ between groups. Moreover, children treated with an insulin pump had higher resource utilization, including emergency department visits and annual total costs, compared with MDI. These findings contrast with meta-analyses in children who have had diabetes for a longer duration [
         <a href="#rid39">
          39

         Like MDI therapy, insulin pump therapy requires frequent blood glucose monitoring, counting dietary carbohydrates, judging the impact of exercise on insulin requirements, and making the appropriate adjustments to insulin infusion rates. Without this commitment, the benefits of this regimen are not attained. Before initiation of insulin pump therapy, the patient and family must be informed and accept the significant work required by this therapeutic approach, as well as given the training and support required to implement it. The beneficial effect of the insulin pump is maintained only if the child and family continue to devote time and effort to glycemic monitoring and control.

         Although multiple studies have demonstrated an improvement of diabetes control with the insulin pump compared with MDI, decreased adherence to the pump protocol can occur over time and is associated with deterioration in control.

          Risk of infusion set failure
         </strong>
         – All insulin pumps, including hybrid closed-loop (HCL) systems, run the risk of failure to infuse insulin. This may be related to occlusion or kinking of the tubing, displacement of the catheter from the subcutaneous site, or, less likely, failure of the pump mechanism. Failure of insulin delivery can quickly lead to hyperglycemia, ketosis, and DKA because only rapid- or short-acting insulin is used in insulin pumps and patients do not have a long-acting subcutaneous depot of insulin on board. As a result, CGM and/or frequent blood glucose checking is essential for children on insulin pump therapy [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ]. Education of patients and caregivers regarding recognition and management of infusion set failures is essential. If persistent hyperglycemia occurs and does not respond to bolus insulin administration through the pump, the initial correction dose of and insulin should be administered by syringe or insulin pen and the infusion set should be replaced and checked before resuming use of the pump.

          Other considerations
         </strong>
         – Other considerations regarding the choice of regimen include the greater cost of the insulin pump and its supplies compared with those of syringes and needles or insulin pens used in MDI therapy, as well as potential complications of pump therapy, such as skin infection at the site of placement of the infusion set, and minor dermatologic changes such as nodules or scars at the catheter site [

         – This is a partially closed-loop glucose monitoring and insulin infusion system that automatically stops the insulin infusion in response to a selected low blood glucose threshold (low glucose suspend) or when an inbuilt algorithm predicts impending hypoglycemia (predictive low-glucose suspend [PLGS]) and has been approved by the FDA [

         For most children and adolescents, we suggest an HCL system, if available, rather than other continuous insulin delivery systems. These systems have been associated with greater time in range and a reduction in time below range compared with standard insulin pumps. Two categories of closed-loop pumps are described below:

          HCL system
         </strong>
         – In clinical trials, HCL systems modestly improved glycemic outcomes compared with sensor-augmented insulin pumps. In our clinical experience, most children and families have high satisfaction with newer HCL devices and can learn to use them effectively with appropriate training and support. This includes preschool-aged children [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. As with any insulin pump, the most significant risk with these systems is hyperglycemia due to infusion set failure (eg, a kink in the tubing or other malfunction), which can be mitigated by educating the family about how to monitor glucose and ketone concentrations and address this problem. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Insulin pump'
         </a>
         above.)

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         An HCL system automatically increases, decreases, and suspends basal insulin delivery in response to CGM and predicts sensor glucose in the next 30 minutes. Newer systems (advanced HCL systems) are also able to administer a correction bolus (no more than once an hour) if sensor glucose is predicted to be above a particular number (eg, 180 mg/dL) in the next 30 minutes, based on the programmed insulin sensitivity. If certain parameters are met that predict low blood glucose, the insulin infusion is automatically suspended. These systems still require user input to administer an insulin bolus (based on the patient's insulin:carbohydrate ratio) before meals. Optional settings are available for sleep and exercise.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         While this type of device employs the insulin:carbohydrate ratio used in traditional insulin pump systems, one system allows modification of the "active insulin time" but not the insulin sensitivity (correction) factor, while another still uses the insulin sensitivity factor. One system automatically reverts to manual pump mode (ie, an open-loop system that requires user input) if blood glucose values are high or low for specified periods of time or when there are difficulties calibrating the system. These systems can also be used as open-loop systems if not used with CGM. (See

         Adolescents &gt;14 years – In a six-month randomized trial, use of an HCL system compared with a sensor-augmented insulin pump increased time in glycemic target range (71 versus 59 percent; risk-adjusted difference 11 percent, 95% CI 9-14), improved A1C levels, and modestly reduced time spent in a hypoglycemic state (eg, &lt;54 mg/dL, 0.29 versus 0.35 percent) [

Hyperglycemia was less common in participants using the ACL system (time with glucose &gt;250 mg/dL 11.8 versus 20.4 percent), although brief episodes of hyperglycemia were common and most were related to infusion set failure.

          —

         The first step is to estimate total insulin requirement. This is based upon the body weight, age, and pubertal stage of the child and whether or not the child presents in ketoacidosis or is on medications that may increase insulin resistance (such as glucocorticoids). In general, the newly diagnosed child requires an initial total daily insulin dose of 0.3 to 1 units/kg/day. Prepubertal children usually require relatively low starting doses (0.3 to 0.7 units/kg/day). Higher doses (eg, 0.7 to 1 units/kg/day) are needed in pubertal children, patients in ketoacidosis, or patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy. This estimated dose will be adjusted up or down as needed depending on the child's response to the initial regimen. After adjustment, the total insulin dose may be as low as 0.25 units/kg/day (or even lower) for some children during the "honeymoon period." Following the "honeymoon" period, prepubertal children typically require 0.7 to 1.0 units/kg/day and pubertal children 1 to 1.5 units/kg/day.

However, some children do better with a morning dose (eg, those who tend to have nocturnal hypoglycemia) or with two divided doses (eg, when a single daily dose of insulin glargine does not have a 24-hour duration of action). Detemir insulin is typically given twice daily.

This concentrated form of glargine has a longer duration of action than glargine 100U and is helpful in those with high insulin needs and those who prefer morning basal dosing without the need for an additional evening basal dose for adequate coverage.

          Notes:
         </strong>
         This equation is a rough estimate, and the actual carbohydrate ratio also depends on other factors. The equation tends to underestimate the amount of prandial insulin needed for older children and tends to overestimate the dose for younger children. Some endocrinologists prefer to use a factor of 450 rather than 500 for younger children, and toddlers and very young children may do better with a factor of 250 or 330; ie, they require relatively more prandial and less basal insulin. Many children require a lower ICR for breakfast than for meals later in the day. Obesity and the associated insulin resistance may lead to greater insulin requirements. If short-acting (regular) insulin (rarely used in MDI or pump regimens), a factor of 450 should be used rather than 500.

         The planned insulin regimen should be adjusted periodically based on overall glycemic control (as indicated by hemoglobin A1c [A1C], time in range, and other CGM metrics) and episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Frequent review and adjustment of the regimen is essential because insulin dosage varies substantially between individuals and also changes over time [

         Insulin dose adjustments are usually made in increments or decrements of 10 to 20 percent at a time, based on fingerstick blood glucose readings or the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) output. Frequent dose adjustments (eg, daily) are often needed during the first few weeks after diagnosis.

         The total daily insulin dose after the honeymoon phase is between 0.7 and 1.5 unit/kg/day. A typical range for prepubertal children is 0.7 to 1 unit/kg/day [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ], though very young children may need lower doses. During puberty, the daily insulin requirement rises, typically to 1 to 1.5 units/kg/day because of an increase in insulin resistance from high growth hormone concentrations.

         Basal insulin should be approximately 30 to 60 percent of the total daily dose; the lower target is appropriate for children who are growing rapidly, and the higher target is appropriate for those on a low-carbohydrate diet.

         The basal regimen may be adjusted with different rates at different times of the day. As an example, some children require a higher basal rate in the early morning hours because of an increase in counterregulatory hormones and between breakfast and lunch (when they are sedentary at school) and a lower rate during and for a variable period after exercise (depending on the duration and nature of exercise).

         For patients using an insulin pump, some devices can be programmed to prolong the prandial insulin ("extended") bolus to improve control of postprandial hyperglycemia. The bolus can be administered in a "dual-wave" or "square-wave" pattern [
         <a href="#rid79">
          79,80
         </a>
         ]. For dual-wave administration, the mealtime insulin dose is divided into a bolus followed by a continuous infusion (higher than the basal rate) over two hours; this is useful for meals with varied glycemic content and especially high fat. For square-wave administration (also known as extended bolus), the dose of insulin is given as a continuous infusion over two hours; this is useful for patients who plan to snack over an extended period of time, as might occur in social settings.

         A few weeks after the diagnosis and initiation of insulin therapy, a period of decreasing exogenous insulin requirement occurs, commonly referred to as the "honeymoon" or remission phase of diabetes. During this period, the remaining functional beta cells secrete some endogenous insulin, resulting in reduced exogenous requirement. Close monitoring of blood glucose is mandatory since hypoglycemic episodes are likely if the insulin dose is not appropriately adjusted. Nonetheless, a stringent A1C target (eg, &lt;6.5 percent) is recommended during the honeymoon phase and can be safely achieved with close glycemic monitoring and dose adjustments [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. The duration of this phase is variable and may last several months to several years. Rising blood glucose levels, A1C, and increasing exogenous insulin need indicate the end of this phase.

          Target hemoglobin A1c (A1C)
         </strong>
         – We suggest that insulin therapy be designed to achieve a target A1C of &lt;7 percent for most children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), rather than a higher A1C threshold (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">
          Grade 2B
         </a>
         ). However, glycemic targets should be tailored to the individual patient. Less stringent goals may be appropriate for individual patients, such as those with increased risks for severe hypoglycemia or those with psychosocial challenges that may be exacerbated by the need for tighter control. Other patients may safely use more stringent targets. (See

          Types of insulin regimens
         </strong>
         – For all children and adolescents with T1DM, we recommend an intensive insulin regimen (ie, consisting of a basal dose of insulin together with premeal boluses of a rapid-acting insulin) rather than a conventional regimen (consisting of fixed doses of intermediate-acting insulin with rapid- or short-acting insulin given two or three times a day) (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_2" rel="external">
          Grade 1B
         </a>
         ). The approximate time of onset, peak activity, and duration of action of the most commonly used insulins are shown in the table  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef61880" href="/z/d/graphic/61880.html" rel="external">
          table 1
         </a>
         ). Intensive compared with conventional therapy improves glycemic control and decreases long-term complications of diabetes. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Value of an intensive regimen'

         <strong>
          Intensive insulin therapy
         </strong>
         – Intensive insulin therapy can be delivered by insulin pump (a device that delivers a continuous subcutaneous infusion of a rapid-acting insulin supplemented by boluses before each meal or snack) or multiple daily injections (MDI). A variety of insulin pump regimens are available: standalone pump therapy without continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), pump therapy combined with CGM (sensor-augmented pumps), and algorithm-driven pumps (ie, hybrid closed-loop [HCL] systems that automatically use sensor glucose values to determine rates of insulin delivery). All of these require extensive training, commitment, and work for the patient and family/caregiver. The choice depends upon the needs and preferences of the patient and family, cost considerations, and clinician preferences. Our general approach is as follows (see
         <a class="local">
          'Types of intensive regimens'
         </a>
         above):

         <strong>
          Continuous insulin delivery (insulin pump)
         </strong>
         – For most children, we suggest some form of continuous insulin delivery system rather than MDI (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Continuous insulin delivery systems (with or without CGM) appear to modestly improve glycemic control compared with MDI and may be associated with improved quality of life. In most cases, we suggest an HCL or advanced HCL system, if available, rather than other systems (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). In clinical trials, these systems improved glycemic outcomes compared with sensor-augmented insulin pumps. In our clinical experience, most children and families have high satisfaction with newer HCL devices and can learn to use them effectively with appropriate training and support.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Special training is required for safe use of either type of device, including vigilance for failure of insulin infusion (eg, a kink in the tubing or other malfunction), which can lead to ketoacidosis. Cost considerations may be another limitation. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          MDI
         </strong>
         – This technique consists of injections of a long-acting insulin analog once or twice daily and short-acting insulin before each meal and snack. If rapid-acting insulin analogs are not locally available, short-acting insulins are sometimes used. While continuous insulin therapy (insulin pump) is generally preferred over MDI for long-term management of T1DM, MDI is often used in newly diagnosed patients as they acclimate to the diagnosis before converting to pump therapy.

         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Blood glucose monitoring
         </strong>
         – Frequent blood glucose monitoring is required for optimal glycemic control. The frequency of monitoring depends upon the risk of hypoglycemic episodes, insulin regimen selected, and level of physical activity.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         For most children, we suggest treatment guided by CGM rather than fingersticks for blood glucose monitoring, provided that such a device is available and the patient or caregivers are able to use the device safely (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). CGM appears to modestly improve glycemic control in patients who consistently use the device and generally reduces treatment burden. (See

         <strong>
          Converting to an insulin pump
         </strong>
         – When converting from an MDI regimen to insulin pump therapy, the starting insulin dose depends on the patient's current diabetes control and total daily insulin dose. For patients with excellent control on an MDI regimen, the initial total daily insulin dose for pump therapy is 10 to 20 percent less than for MDI  (
