         The epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous layer are the tissue layers of concern during skin laceration repair:

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         The epidermis and dermis are tightly adhered and clinically indistinguishable; together, they constitute the skin  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70895" href="/z/d/graphic/70895.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Dermal approximation provides the strength and alignment of skin closure.

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">

         </span>
         The subcutaneous layer is mainly comprised of adipose tissue. Nerve fibers, blood vessels, and hair follicles are located here  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54157" href="/z/d/graphic/54157.html" rel="external">
          figure 2
         </a>
         ). Although this layer provides little strength to the repair, sutures placed in the subcutaneous layer may decrease the tension of the wound and improve the cosmetic result.

         The healing process of skin occurs in several stages, as summarized here and discussed in detail separately  (

         Hemostasis – Hemostasis and clot formation occur within minutes of superficial skin injury in healthy patients. The fibrin matrix stabilizes the wound and serves as an initial scaffold for wound healing.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Inflammation – Inflammation promotes vascular permeability, local vasodilation, and cellular migration and, in the absence of infection or other causes of impaired wound healing, is complete by three days. Polymorphonucleocytes engulf and enzymatically digest bacteria, foreign material, and necrotic tissue.

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Proliferation – Endothelial cells arise from basal cells in the epithelium and bridge clean wounds within two days after suturing, providing a barrier that is waterproof. However, this superficial layer is thin and easily disrupted.
        </p>
        <p>

         <span class="glyph">

         Remodeling – Fibroblasts derived from mesenchymal cells proliferate near the wound site approximately 24 hours after injury. Building upon the fibrin matrix, they produce essential elements for wound contraction and scar formation, including collagen.

        <p>

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Collagen formation is necessary to restore tensile strength to the wound. The process begins within 48 hours of the injury and peaks in the first week. Collagen production and remodeling continue for 6 to 12 months.

         Sutures are appropriate to use for primary closure of skin lacerations when the wound extends through the dermis and is likely to cause excess scarring if the wound edges are not properly opposed. Sutures are preferred when the wound requires careful approximation (eg, lacerations that cross skin tension [Langer's] lines  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50913" href="/z/d/graphic/50913.html" rel="external">
          figure 4
         </a>
         ) or that span important structures such as the eyebrow or vermillion border).
        </p>
        <p>
         The appropriateness of primary closure with sutures is also determined by the age of the wound, wound location, and patient factors that impact the risk of wound infection as summarized below and discussed separately in detail (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6328.html" rel="external">
          "Minor wound evaluation and preparation for closure", section on 'Type of closure'

         Clean, uninfected lacerations on any part of the body in healthy patients may be closed primarily for up to 18 hours following the injury without a significant increase in the risk of wound infection.
        </p>

         Because of the lower risk of infection or poor wound healing, facial wounds may be closed primarily up to 24 hours following the injury in all patients. In selected patients (no signs of infection, otherwise healthy patient, and easily approximated wound), closure of facial wounds may occur up to 48 to 72 hours after injury.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>

         Some lacerations that meet criteria for closure with sutures may also be amenable to closure with staples, skin adhesives, or wound closure tapes. The table provides guidance for selecting among the wound closure methods  (

         Depending upon the provider's experience and ability to follow the wound until full healing, strong concern about cosmetic outcome by either the patient or family may also be a reason for referring a laceration to a surgeon for closure. However, for experienced providers, the outcome of clean skin lacerations in low-risk patients (eg, healthy children) is similar regardless of who performs the primary closure.

         For most patients, infiltration of local anesthesia is effective for pain control during laceration repair. The choice of agent depends on several factors, including the duration of the procedure, need for hemostasis, patient sensitivity to catecholamines, and patient allergy to local anesthetics  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56799" href="/z/d/graphic/56799.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). Subcutaneous infiltration of local anesthetics, including methods to decrease the pain of injection and techniques for direct infiltration, is discussed separately. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6324.html" rel="external">
          "Subcutaneous infiltration of local anesthetics"
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         For children with uncomplicated facial or scalp lacerations, we suggest initial pain control with topical lidocaine-epinephrine-tetracaine (LET) rather than infiltrative anesthesia. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6338.html" rel="external">
          "Clinical use of topical anesthetics in children", section on 'Agents for laceration repair'
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Regional anesthesia provides full local anesthesia without distorting tissues adjacent to the wound. This approach permits better approximation for complex lacerations on the face, ear, and lip. In addition, full local anesthesia is difficult to achieve by direct infiltration in some body regions (eg, fingers, toes, tongue, sole of foot). Regional anesthesia in these sites permits greater patient comfort.

         In children and older anxious patients, use of nonpharmacologic (behavioral) interventions help alleviate anxiety and may prevent the need for procedural sedation. Child life specialists are experts in applying these techniques when performing laceration repair in children. (See

         When local or regional anesthesia and nonpharmacologic interventions are not sufficient, then minimal sedation is usually successful  (

         The use of clean rather than sterile gloves does not increase the risk of wound infection and is an acceptable practice for uncomplicated skin lacerations undergoing suturing in the ambulatory setting. For example, in a multicenter trial of 816 children and adults undergoing laceration repair, the rate of wound infection was similar between providers using sterile gloves (6.1 percent) or clean gloves (4.4 percent; relative risk 1.4, 95% CI 0.8-2.5) [

         <strong>
          Absorbable
         </strong>
         – An absorbable suture is made from either natural mammalian collagen or synthetic polymers, breaks down in the body, and does not require removal [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,5
         </a>
         ]. Different types of absorbable suture degrade at different rates. Absorbable suture forms a secure knot after three ties (throws). Some absorbable sutures (eg, polyglactin 910 [Vicryl] and poliglecaprone 25 [Monocryl]) handle well during suturing, while others can break easily (eg, fast-absorbing gut) or are more difficult to handle (eg, polyglycolic acid [Dexon sutures], polydioxanone [PDS], or polyglyconate [Maxon]).

         <strong>
          Nonabsorbable
         </strong>
         – Nonabsorbable sutures are made from synthetic materials such as nylon, polybutester, polypropylene, or natural silk and require removal after placement. Because a synthetic nonabsorbable suture tends to maintain its shape (memory) and not adhere to itself as tightly during knot tying when compared with absorbable suture or natural silk, these sutures require up to five ties (throws) to make a secure knot [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3,5
         </a>
         ]. When compared with absorbable sutures, synthetic nonabsorbable sutures have better handling and will stretch to handle wound swelling. They also come in a variety of colors to make them easier to see during suturing and suture removal.

         For all skin lacerations, the goal is to provide a suture that minimizes the risk of excess inflammation or infection and maintains its tensile strength during the initial stages of healing (see
         <a class="local">
          'Wound healing'
         </a>
         above); the rate of healing varies by body site and individual patient factors such as age and comorbidities that may slow healing (eg, diabetes mellitus or use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications). Thus, suture selection for traumatic skin lacerations must take into account wound location, wound characteristics, and patient factors to ensure choice of the correct suture size, material, and needle:

         <strong>
          Size
         </strong>
         – Suture size is commonly indicated by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) system and is a measure of tensile strength as well. Tensile strength is defined as the amount of weight required to break a suture divided by its cross-sectional area. In the USP system, the number of zeros inversely correlates with size: The higher the number of zeros, the smaller the size and the lower the strength. For example, a 3-0 suture has a diameter that is approximately two to four times larger than a 6-0 suture  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef129828" href="/z/d/graphic/129828.html" rel="external">

         ).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         In general, larger suture size is associated with greater inflammation and scarring [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,3,5
         </a>
         ]. Thus, a smaller suture (eg, USP 5-0 or 6-0) is used for repairs that require close approximation and/or are in regions of cosmetic importance (eg, face, ear, or nailbed) [
         <a href="#rid6">

          Suture material
         </strong>
         – The type of suture material (absorbable versus nonabsorbable) is primarily determined by the skin layer being closed and, for percutaneous sutures, the site-specific timing for wound healing:

          Percutaneous closure
         </strong>
         – Options for percutaneous closure include nonabsorbable synthetic sutures, fast-absorbing gut, polyglactin 910 (Vicryl Rapide), and chromic gut:

          Synthetic nonabsorbable suture
         </strong>
         – Monofilament nonabsorbable sutures (eg, nylon, polypropylene, and polybutester) theoretically promote the least inflammation relative to braided or absorbable sutures and are easy to handle [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. All three sutures have elasticity, which permits stretching if wound swelling should occur, followed by return to their prior length once swelling resolves. Polypropylene has the greatest elasticity. The major disadvantage of nonabsorbable sutures compared with absorbable sutures is the need for the patient to return for suture removal.

         <strong>
          Fast-absorbing gut
         </strong>
         – Fast-absorbing gut is heat treated to accelerate tensile strength loss and absorption, which typically occur by six days [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. It is frequently used for closure of small, low-tension wounds on the face, particularly if suture removal will be difficult (eg, young, uncooperative child or when return for suture removal is not assured) [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. If fast-absorbing gut is used for wounds with higher tension, placement of dermal sutures with a synthetic absorbable suture (eg, polyglactin 910 [Vicryl] or Monocryl) may decrease wound tension and provide support once the fast-absorbing gut has dissolved.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent3">
         Fast-absorbing gut is tan and can be difficult to see during suturing. Furthermore, it easily breaks during tying, especially when it becomes dried out [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Sterile application of a petroleum coating (eg, antibiotic ointment such as
         <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9052" href="/z/d/drug information/9052.html" rel="external">
          bacitracin
         </a>
         [Polysporin]) is used by some clinicians to improve handling and to decrease brittleness. Based on one small randomized trial in 14 patients, coating the suture does not appear to impair its absorption [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. However, in this study, absorption varied significantly among individuals. Thus, patients should be advised to return for suture removal at five days if the fast-absorbing gut stitches are still present. (See

          Polyglactin 910 (Vicryl Rapide)
         </strong>
         – Polyglactin 910 (Vicryl Rapide) is a synthetic absorbable suture for approximation of the skin and mucosa. Almost all of its tensile strength is lost by 10 to 14 days, and the suture begins to "fall off" in 7 to 10 days as the wound heals [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Thus, it may be appropriate for skin closure in sites where persistence of suture for one week or longer is appropriate (eg, scalp, trunk, extremities, palm, or sole) and when suture removal would be difficult (eg, lacerations located under casts).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent3">
         Initial evidence found increased inflammation and scarring for Vicryl Rapide relative to fast-absorbing gut or nonabsorbable sutures indicated that it may not be the best choice for percutaneous lacerations, especially for traumatic facial lacerations or other locations of cosmetic importance [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. More recent evidence from a split-scar trial in 105 adults undergoing Mohs surgery suggests that cosmetic outcomes may be similar to synthetic nylon suture [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10
         </a>
         ]. However, more evidence from large randomized controlled trials is needed before Vicryl Rapide is considered an equivalent suture choice for percutaneous closure compared with nonabsorbable sutures or fast-absorbing gut.

         <strong>
          Chromic gut
         </strong>
         – Similar to Vicryl Rapide, chromic gut retains tensile strength for 10 to 14 days and may be used for repair of fingertip and nailbed lacerations, under a cast or splint, or when follow-up is not assured on scalp lacerations.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Evidence suggests that cosmetic outcomes or frequency of wound complications after repair of traumatic skin lacerations or surgical wounds are similar when lacerations are percutaneously closed with either nonabsorbable or absorbable sutures [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10-13
         </a>
         ]. For example, in a meta-analysis of 19 trials (1748 patients) comparing the efficacy of nonabsorbable sutures with absorbable sutures for skin closure of surgical and traumatic lacerations, absorbable and nonabsorbable sutures had equivalent cosmetic outcomes and no significant difference for wound infection or wound dehiscence, although follow-up was insufficient in several studies [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11
         </a>
         ]. However, evidence from large randomized controlled trials of suture closure of traumatic skin lacerations are lacking. Thus, the clinician should choose suture material for a specific patient based upon other factors such as need and ease of removal, clinician preference based on handling characteristics, and whether or not follow-up for suture removal can be assured.

          Dermal closure

         – Dermal closure requires the use of absorbable suture that retains tensile strength until the collagen formation stage of wound healing is well established (see

          'Wound healing'

         Polyglactin 910 (Vicryl) is a lubricated, braided synthetic material with excellent handling and smooth tie-down properties [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. It retains significant tensile strength for three to four weeks. Complete absorption occurs in 60 to 90 days. It has decreased tissue reactivity compared with catgut as well as improved tensile strength and knot strength.

         Monocryl is a monofilament suture that has superior pliability for easier handling and tying of knots. Its monofilament quality gives it a theoretical advantage over braided sutures for contaminated wounds requiring deep sutures [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. This suture is often used by plastic surgeons at our institution for facial lacerations closed with subcuticular running sutures. All of its tensile strength is lost by 21 days postimplantation.

        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         Other absorbable sutures such as polyglycolic acid (Dexon), polydioxanone (PDS), or polyglyconate (Maxon) are acceptable alternatives for dermal closure but may be more difficult to handle during suturing and have potential for promoting more inflammation during healing.

         – Because of the difficulty of suture removal, intraoral and tongue lacerations should be closed using absorbable suture. Chromic gut or Vicryl Rapide retain tensile strength for 10 to 14 days in the mouth but are more rapidly absorbed in the oral cavity than other absorbable sutures, making them good choices for this environment. Fast-absorbing gut is broken down too rapidly by enzymes in the saliva to provide adequate time for wound healing and should not be used. Repair of tongue and intraoral lacerations are discussed in greater detail separately. (See

         The body of the needle is the portion that is grasped by the needle holder during the procedure. The body determines the shape of the needle and is curved for cutaneous suturing. The curvature may be one-fourth, three-eighths, one-half, or five-eighths circle. For traumatic skin lacerations, the most commonly used curvature is the three-eighths circle, requiring only minimal pronation of the wrist for large and superficial wounds. The one-half and five-eighths circles were devised for suturing in confined spaces, such as the oral cavity.

         Conventional cutting – Cutting edge is located on the inside (concave) curvature of the needle and perpendicular to two other opposing cutting edges. This needle type may be prone to cutout of tissue because the inside cutting edge cuts toward the edges of the incision or wound. Thus, conventional cutting needles should be avoided for closure of skin lacerations.

         The suture is then tied using a surgeon's knot (nonabsorbable suture) or a square knot (absorbable suture)  (

         Once tied, the knot is positioned to one side or the other of the wound so that the knot does not interfere with wound healing at the margin.

         To ensure proper apposition of the wound without excess tissue on one side (also called a "dog ear"), the clinician places the first stitch at the midline of the wound  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef129832" href="/z/d/graphic/129832.html" rel="external">
          figure 16
         </a>
         ). The next two stitches go on each side of the first stitch, midway between the center stitch and the wound corners [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ]. Additional bisecting stitches are placed until the wound is properly aligned.
        </p>
        <p>
         The number of sutures needed to close a wound varies depending upon the length, shape, and location of the laceration. In general, sutures are placed just far enough from each other so that no gap appears in the wound edges.

         The dermal or buried suture approximates the dermis just below the dermal-epidermal junction, thereby improving the cosmetic result in both situations. To reduce the amount of inflammation and risk of wound infection, simple interrupted stitches are placed to reduce the amount of suture material placed below the skin.

        <p>
         Absorbable suture material must be used for dermal or buried sutures. The knot should be buried away from the skin surface of the wound so that it will not interfere with epidermal healing. This knot orientation is accomplished by inverting the suture loop using the following technique  (

         Before tying the knot, pulling the two ends longitudinally along the course of the wound helps to bring the two sides of the wound together more effectively compared with pulling the ends perpendicular to the wound margin [

          Vertical mattress suture
         </strong>
         – The vertical mattress suture is recommended for wounds under tension and for those with edges that tend to invert (fall or fold into the wound) [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,19
         </a>
         ]. It acts as a deep and superficial closure all in one stitch. Vertical mattress sutures are well suited for body regions with thin or lax skin or reduced subcutaneous tissue (eg, the shin) that do not provide adequate subcutaneous tissue for dermal closure [

         The needle is then rotated 180° in the needle holder, and the direction of the suture loop is reversed (backhanded). The needle entrance is at a distance from the wound edge, crossing through the dermal tissue and exiting through the skin on the opposite side at an equal distance from the wound edge. This is the far-far portion. This stitch approximates the dermal structures.

         Alternatively, in the traditional vertical mattress technique, the deeper bites are performed first, followed by the smaller wound edge bites.

          Horizontal mattress suture

         – A horizontal mattress suture also achieves wound eversion in areas of high skin tension [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,19
         </a>
         ]. In addition, horizontal mattress sutures distribute tension along the length of the laceration.

        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         The needle is introduced into the skin in the usual manner and brought out on the opposite side of the wound  (

          figure 21

         ). A second bite is taken along the opposite side, approximately 0.5 cm from the first exit site, and is brought back to the original starting side, also 0.5 cm from the initial entry point.

        <p>

         Both vertical and horizontal mattress sutures can cause excess tension at the wound margin, which can lead to skin ischemia with wound breakdown [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. To decrease the chance of this complication, clinicians may alternate mattress stitches with simple interrupted stitches or only use a mattress suture at the point of maximal tension.

         A disadvantage to this technique is that, if the stitch breaks, then wound dehiscence may occur. Furthermore, good wound eversion is more difficult to achieve with running sutures, which may increase the risk of scarring [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2,3
         </a>
         ]. For these reasons, this technique is avoided on the face or other cosmetically important regions and should only be performed by properly trained and experienced providers.

         The subcuticular running suture is often used by plastic surgeons and other experienced providers to close straight lacerations on the face. An absorbable suture, such as Monocryl or Vicryl, is used. The suture is anchored at one end of the laceration, and then a plane is chosen in the dermis or just deep to the dermis in the superficial subcutaneous fascia  (

         ). Mirror-image bites are taken horizontally in this plane for the full length of the laceration. The final bite leaves a trailing loop of suture so a final knot can be tied. The wound is then reinforced with adhesive tape [

         </strong>
         – Either an open or semiocclusive dressing such as a polymer film (eg, Tegaderm, Cutifilm, Blisterfilm, or Bioculsive) can keep the sutures dry. Polymer films may permit the patient to shower more easily without getting the wound wet and permit examination of the wound for signs of infection without removing the dressing.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The dressing should be left in place for at least 24 hours, after which time, wounds can be left open to air. An antibiotic ointment can be applied to the wound as well, with instructions to apply the ointment two times per day at home until suture removal.

         The use of a topical antibiotic ointment is supported by a randomized blinded trial of 426 adults undergoing traumatic laceration repair with sutures in which topical ointment containing

         sulfate significantly reduced the rates of wound infection when compared with a petroleum ointment control (5 to 6 versus 18 percent, respectively) [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. In another randomized and blinded study of 177 children with minor wounds, most of which were grazes, abrasions, and cuts, individuals who treated the wound with topical antibiotics also had significantly lower rates of infection (1.6 percent) compared with placebo (12.5 percent), although the rate of infection in the control group was higher than expected [

        </p>
        <p>
         Topical antibiotics have not been shown to prevent infection or hasten healing after minor skin surgery (eg, punch biopsy or skin excision); petrolatum ointment is suggested instead to avoid potential contact dermatitis. (See

         Occlusion of the wound helps to maintain a moist environment, which enhances wound healing (see

          "Basic principles of wound management", section on 'Wound dressings'

         ). Small crossover trials evaluating surgical wounds also indicate that occlusion of the wound increases the speed of re-epithelialization, although complete healing appears to occur at approximately the same time when compared with uncovered wounds [

         For patients with lacerations closed with a nonabsorbable (eg, nylon, polypropylene) suture, we advise gentle cleaning using mild soap and water or one-half-strength peroxide 24 hours after closure to prevent crusting over the suture knots. Furthermore, these patients may be allowed to shower or wash the wound with soap and water without risking increased rates of infection.
        </p>
        <p>
         Lacerations closed with percutaneous absorbable sutures may also be gently cleaned 24 to 48 hours after placement, although some experts advise keeping the stitches dry until the suture is mostly absorbed (typically, five days for fast-absorbing gut or 7 to 10 days for Vicryl Rapide).

         Prolonged soaking of stitches including swimming in chlorinated water should be avoided because of the theoretical risk of premature loss of suture tensile strength with wound dehiscence. Patients with sutures should also not swim in natural bodies of water, because of a potential increased risk of infection.

         In a trial of 857 patients who underwent minor skin excisions that were repaired with a nonabsorbable suture and were dressed with dry gauze, those who washed the wound site within 12 hours after suture placement and left the wound open had similar infection rates to those who kept their wounds dry and covered for at least 48 hours (8.4 versus 8.9 percent, respectively) [

          26,27

         Proper wound preparation is the essential measure for preventing wound infection after suturing simple lacerations. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6328.html" rel="external">

         For healthy patients with uncomplicated traumatic skin lacerations, we recommend local wound care without prophylactic antibiotics. All patients should receive instructions advising that they return for evaluation if they develop any signs of wound infection (eg, pain, redness, swelling, drainage of pus, or fever).
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence does not support the use of prophylactic antibiotics to reduce wound infections in healthy patients with clean traumatic skin lacerations. In a meta-analysis of seven trials (1701 total patients with a total of 110 wound infections), prophylactic antibiotics in healthy patients with wounds other than bite wounds did not decrease the infection rate (odds ratio 1.2, 95% CI 0.8-1.7; mean infection rate among controls 6 percent) [

         A caregiver is an important advocate for their child, and their concerns need to be addressed with patience and understanding. It is inevitable that the clinician will encounter some caregivers who demand a plastic surgeon for simple laceration repairs or sedation for a laceration that easily could be managed with patient distraction, topical and/or injectable anesthetics, and an assistant to help hold the child still. The best approach is to listen first and to suggest reasonable alternatives later.
        </p>
        <p>
         In some instances, there is no choice but to call the surgeon. At other times, caregivers will listen to the explanation that for a simple, clean laceration, the cosmetic outcome will be acceptable whether repaired by a surgeon or another clinician. At times, it is also an issue of plastic surgeon availability.
        </p>
        <p>
         In cases where a caregiver demands sedation for a simple laceration, they must understand that sedation has risks that are unnecessary if a reasonable and safe alternative exists. The use of distraction methods and the use of topical anesthetics should also be explained to the caregiver. Child life specialists, if available, can provide invaluable assistance in this scenario, along with an assistant to hold the child still. The child life specialist can adequately distract many patients by reading books with the patient, playing a video, or providing visual imagery. (See

         The anxious and uncooperative patient is a challenge that, at times, can be managed with an assistant to hold the child still and similar methods of distraction and imagery but, at other times, leaves no choice but to sedate the patient to repair the laceration.

          Indications

         – Sutures are appropriate when the depth of the wound will lead to excessive scarring if the wound edges are not properly apposed. Concern about wound infection is the main reason not to close a wound primarily (see

         Clean, uninfected lacerations on any part of the body in healthy patients may be closed primarily for up to 18 hours following the injury without a significant increase in the risk of wound infection.

         Because of the lower risk of infection or poor wound healing, facial wounds may be closed primarily up to 24 hours following the injury in all patients. In selected patients (no signs of infection, otherwise healthy patient, and easily approximated wound), closure of facial wounds may occur up to 48 to 72 hours after injury.

          Pain control
         </strong>
         – For most patients, infiltration of local anesthesia is effective for pain control during laceration repair  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56799" href="/z/d/graphic/56799.html" rel="external">
          table 3
         </a>
         ). Topical lidocaine-epinephrine-tetracaine (LET) rather than infiltrative anesthesia is suggested for pain control in children with uncomplicated facial or scalp lacerations. Regional anesthesia provides full local anesthesia without distorting tissues adjacent to the wound in selected wound sites. Nonpharmacologic (behavioral) interventions also alleviate anxiety and may prevent the need for procedural sedation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Pain control'
         </a>
         above.)
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         When local or regional anesthesia and nonpharmacologic interventions are not sufficient, minimal sedation is usually successful  (

         To enhance healing, we suggest that lacerations repaired with sutures be initially covered with an open (eg, sterile gauze or adhesive bandage) or semiocclusive (eg, polymer film) dressing (

          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). The dressing should be left in place for at least 24 hours, after which time, wounds can be left open to air. (See

         For patients with lacerations closed with a nonabsorbable (eg, nylon or polypropylene) suture, we advise gentle cleaning using mild soap and water or one-half-strength peroxide 24 hours after closure to prevent crusting over the suture knots. Furthermore, these patients may be allowed to shower or wash the wound with soap and water without risking increased rates of infection. Lacerations closed with percutaneous absorbable sutures may also be gently cleaned 24 to 48 hours after placement, although some experts advise keeping the stitches dry until the suture is mostly absorbed (typically, five days for fast-absorbing gut or 7 to 10 days for Vicryl Rapide).
