         To meet the increased metabolic needs during a normal pregnancy, there are changes in thyroid physiology that are reflected in altered thyroid function tests [

         During pregnancy, serum TBG concentrations rise almost twofold because estrogen increases TBG production and TBG sialylation, which results in decreased clearance of TBG [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. To maintain adequate free thyroid hormone concentrations during this period, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) production by the thyroid gland must increase. The TBG excess leads to an increase in both serum total, but not free, T4 and T3 concentrations. Levels of total T4 and T3 rise by approximately 50 percent during the first half of pregnancy, plateauing at approximately 20 weeks of gestation, at which time a new steady state is reached and the overall production rate of thyroid hormones returns to prepregnancy rates.

         Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is one of a family of glycoprotein hormones, including TSH, with a common alpha subunit and a unique beta subunit. However, there is considerable homology between the beta subunits of hCG and TSH. As a result, hCG has weak thyroid-stimulating activity [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. In a human thyroid cell culture assay, as an example, 1 microU of hCG was equivalent to 0.0013 microU of TSH [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Serum hCG concentrations increase soon after fertilization and peak at 10 to 12 weeks. During this peak, total serum T4 and T3 concentrations increase. Serum free T4 and T3 concentrations increase slightly, usually within the normal range, and serum TSH concentrations are appropriately reduced [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. However, in 10 to 20 percent of normal women, serum TSH concentrations are transiently low or undetectable [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5-7
         </a>
         ]. In a report of 63 women with extremely high hCG concentrations (&gt;200,000 international units/L), TSH was &lt;0.2 microU/mL in 67 percent of samples, and free T4 was above 1.8 ng/dL in 32 percent of samples. All women whose hCG was greater than 400,000 international units/L had a suppressed TSH concentration [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Very high levels of hCG can be seen in multiple pregnancies (ie, twins, triplets, etc) and in hyperemesis gravidarum. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7868.html" rel="external">
          "Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and causes", section on 'hCG-mediated hyperthyroidism'

         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         This transient, usually subclinical, hyperthyroidism should be considered a normal physiologic finding. It is not known if this action of hCG benefits the mother or fetus. Later in pregnancy, as hCG secretion declines, serum free T4 and T3 concentrations decline and serum TSH concentrations rise slightly to or within the normal range.

         </span>
         Because of the changes in thyroid physiology during pregnancy, the Guidelines of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) for the Diagnosis and Management of Thyroid Disease during Pregnancy and the Postpartum recommend using population-based, trimester-specific reference ranges for TSH and assay method and trimester-specific reference ranges for serum free T4 [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Unfortunately, many commercial laboratories currently do not provide these reference ranges. When trimester-specific reference ranges for free T4 are not available and free T4 levels appear discordant with TSH, measurement of total T4 may be superior to free T4. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Assessment of thyroid function'
         </a>
         below.)
        </p>
        <p>
         In the absence of population and trimester-specific normal ranges, ATA guidelines suggest the following for interpretation of thyroid function tests [

         The upper reference range for total T4 increases by approximately 5 percent per week, beginning at week 7. At approximately 16 weeks, total T4 (and T3) levels during pregnancy are 1.5-fold higher than in nonpregnant women (due to TBG excess).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The extent of the downward shift in the reference range for TSH during pregnancy varies with different racial and ethnic groups [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,10
         </a>
         ]. In one of the largest population-based studies (over 13,000 pregnant women), the reference range (2.5
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         to 97.5
         <sup>
          th
         </sup>
         percentile) for TSH in the first trimester was 0.08 to 2.99 mU/L [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12
         </a>
         ]. However, other studies in different populations suggest a more modest reduction in the upper limit of normal of TSH of only 0.5 to 1.0 mU/L [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ]. In several population studies, the lower limit of the reference range for TSH in healthy pregnant women during the first trimester ranged from 0.03 to 0.1 mU/L [
         <a href="#rid11">
          11,12,15-17
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Most studies report a progressive decrease in measured free T4 during pregnancy [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,18,19
         </a>
         ]. However, direct free T4 measurements may be unreliable in some patients due to changes in binding proteins during pregnancy. Measurement of free T4 in the dialysate or ultrafiltrate of serum samples using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry appears to be the most reliable, and when this method is used, free T4 concentrations were shown to decrease modestly with advancing gestational age, particularly between the first and second trimester [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20,21
         </a>
         ]. This assay is relatively expensive and not universally available. Other free T4 assays (and probably free T3 assays) frequently fail to meet performance standards in pregnant patients, owing to increases in TBG and decreases in albumin concentrations that cause the immunoassay to be unreliable [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18
         </a>
         ]. To compensate, assay kits should provide different free T4 normal ranges for pregnant patients, usually lower than those of nonpregnant patients. (See

         When evaluating thyroid tests during pregnancy, we typically measure TSH and free T4 (if there is a trimester-specific reference range) and/or total T4. It is not uncommon to find free T4 levels to be at or below the reference range for nonpregnant adults in association with normal serum TSH levels, a finding related to free T4 assay inaccuracy due to changes in binding proteins. In such settings where free T4 measurements appear discordant with TSH measurements, total T4 should also be measured.
        </p>
        <p>
         For patients whose initial thyroid tests show
         <strong>
          subclinical
         </strong>
         thyroid disease or isolated changes in free T4, we repeat the thyroid tests in a couple of weeks to confirm the abnormality, as the findings may vary even when using pregnancy-specific reference ranges [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22,23
         </a>
         ]. In a Danish study of 1466 pregnant women, 89 had a high TSH in the first trimester, but only 44 (49 percent) were elevated approximately two weeks later; 47 had a suppressed TSH, but only 19 (40 percent) were subnormal on repeat testing [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ]. Among women with isolated changes in free T4, &lt;20 percent were similarly abnormal in the repeat sample. Confirmation of an abnormal TSH was more likely with a higher initial TSH deviation or when antithyroid antibodies were positive.

          Iodine requirements

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         Iodine requirements are higher in pregnant than in nonpregnant women due both to the increase in maternal T4 production required to maintain maternal euthyroidism and an increase in renal iodine clearance. Severe maternal iodine deficiency during pregnancy results in a reduction in maternal T4 production, inadequate placental transfer of maternal T4, and impairment of fetal neurologic development. However, markedly excessive iodine intake may also be harmful as it can lead to fetal hypothyroidism and goiter.
        </p>
        <p>
         The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 250 mcg of iodine daily during pregnancy and lactation. The National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine) recommends daily iodine intake of 220 mcg during pregnancy and 290 mcg during lactation. For women in the United States to achieve this level of daily intake, the ATA recommends supplementation with 150 mcg of iodine daily during pregnancy and lactation, which is the dose included in the majority of prenatal vitamins marketed in the United States, though pregnant women should verify the iodine content in their own prenatal vitamin [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24
         </a>
         ] (see

          "Nutrition in pregnancy: Dietary requirements and supplements"
         </a>
         ). The WHO sets the tolerable upper intake amount for iodine as 500 mcg daily for pregnant women, while the National Academy of Medicine uses 1100 mcg daily for adults and pregnant women &gt;19 years of age.

         At term, fetal serum T4, T3, and TSH concentrations differ substantially from those in the mothers. Serum TSH concentrations are higher, serum free T4 concentrations are lower, and serum T3 concentrations are one-half those of the mothers. Soon after birth, serum TSH concentrations rapidly increase to 50 to 80 mU/L and then fall to 10 to 15 mU/L within 48 hours. Serum T3 and T4 concentrations rapidly increase to values slightly higher than those in normal adults.

         The extent to which maternal thyroid hormones cross the placenta is controversial, but maternal thyroid hormones are critical for growth and development in the first trimester when the fetus has no functional thyroid of its own. In infants with congenital absence of the thyroid, cord serum concentrations range from 20 to 50 percent of the concentrations in normal infants [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26

         Overt hyperthyroidism (low TSH, with free T4 and/or T3 levels that exceed trimester-specific normal reference ranges or total T4 and T3 that exceed 1.5 times the nonpregnant range) is relatively uncommon during pregnancy, occurring in 0.1 to 0.4 percent of all pregnancies [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28
         </a>
         ]. Subclinical hyperthyroidism (low TSH, normal free T4 and T3 using trimester-specific normal reference ranges or total T4 and T3 that are less than 1.5 times the nonpregnant range) is usually transient, and in the first trimester of pregnancy, is considered a normal physiologic finding. In a Chinese study of 42,492 mothers, subclinical hyperthyroidism in early pregnancy was present in 1.3 percent and persisted until the third trimester in only 21 percent of cases [

         Although hyperthyroidism from any cause can complicate pregnancy, Graves' disease and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-mediated hyperthyroidism are the most common causes of hyperthyroidism. Graves' disease usually becomes less severe during the later stages of pregnancy due to a reduction in TSH-receptor antibody concentrations or, rarely, mediated by a change in the activity of TSH-receptor antibodies from stimulatory to blocking. hCG-mediated hyperthyroidism usually occurs transiently in the first half of gestation and is typically less severe than Graves' disease.

         The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism during pregnancy should be based primarily upon a finding of a suppressed (&lt;0.1 mU/L) or undetectable (&lt;0.01 mU/L) serum TSH value and elevated thyroid hormone levels that exceed the reference ranges for pregnancy [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. If a TSH level is &lt;0.1 mU/L, free T4 (or free T4 index) and total T3 (or free T3) should be obtained. In the event that free thyroid hormone levels are discordant with serum TSH and clinical findings, total T4 should be measured. It should be recalled that 10 to 20 percent of normal women have a subnormal or suppressed serum TSH in the first trimester, usually in association with normal free T4 levels.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most pregnant women with significant overt hyperthyroidism in the first trimester will have a serum TSH below that which is seen in asymptomatic, healthy pregnant women (ie, &lt;0.01 mU/L), associated with an elevated free T4 and/or free T3 (or total T4 and/or total T3) measurement.

         hCG-mediated hyperthyroidism is usually transient and does not require treatment. Treatment options for pregnant women with overt hyperthyroidism due to Graves' or nodular thyroid disease are limited because therapy may be harmful to the fetus. However, a good fetal and maternal outcome depends upon controlling the mother's hyperthyroidism. Most women are treated with thionamides. The goal of thionamides is to reduce and maintain the mother's serum free T4 concentration in the high-normal range for nonpregnant women using the lowest dose [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9

         When iodine nutrition is adequate (as in the United States), the most common cause of hypothyroidism during pregnancy is chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis. In iodine-deficient areas, iodine deficiency itself is associated with hypothyroidism and goiter. Other causes of hypothyroidism, such as prior radioiodine ablation, prior surgical removal of the thyroid, or disorders of the pituitary or hypothalamus, can also occur in pregnant women. (See

         A good fetal and maternal outcome depends upon treating maternal hypothyroidism with thyroid hormone (T4). The goal of treatment is to maintain the mother's serum TSH in the population and trimester-specific reference range (approximately 0.1 to 4.0 mU/L if local reference ranges are not available). Women with preexisting hypothyroidism who become pregnant need more T4 during pregnancy. Dose requirements increase, on average, 30 percent during pregnancy and may increase by as much as 50 percent, and the increase occurs as early as the fifth week of gestation. The treatment of newly diagnosed and preexisting hypothyroidism is reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See

TSH levels were higher in TPO-positive than TPO-negative women (3.8 versus 1.5 mU/L), but TSH levels in the cord blood did not differ between positive and negative women. Elevated titers of TPO antibodies during pregnancy did not predict the verbal and nonverbal cognitive function of the children when tested at 2.5 years. However, children of euthyroid mothers with positive TPO antibodies were at higher risk of attention deficit/hyperactivity problems (odds ratio [OR] 1.77, 95% CI 1.15-2.72). When the analysis was adjusted for maternal TSH level, the association was attenuated but remained significant (OR 1.56).

In a meta-analysis of euthyroid women with TPO antibodies that included three studies of levothyroxine treatment beginning in the first trimester of pregnancy, there was no effect of levothyroxine on miscarriage, but there was a significant reduction in the preterm birth rate (6.2 versus 11.7 percent, RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31-0.92) [

         The decision to treat euthyroid women with elevated TPO antibodies with T4 or to monitor for the development of hypothyroidism during pregnancy is controversial. Most pregnant women are unlikely to know their antithyroid antibody status because universal screening is not routinely done.

         In TPO antibody-positive, euthyroid pregnant women who are not treated with thyroid hormone, TSH should be measured every four weeks during the first trimester and, if stable, once during the second and third trimesters to monitor for the development of hypothyroidism. If TSH rises above the population and trimester-specific upper limit of normal (approximately 4 mU/L), we begin treatment with T4. (See

         TSH should also be measured at three and six months postpartum to monitor for the development of postpartum thyroiditis. (See

         Goiter during pregnancy is common in regions where iodine intake is low, occurring in 16 to 70 percent of women in iodine-deficient regions of Western Europe. Increased urinary iodine excretion during pregnancy may further deplete thyroidal iodine stores by as much as 40 percent [
         <a href="#rid57">
          57

         <a href="#rid25">
          25
         </a>
         ]. Studies from Europe show that iodine deficiency relative to the nonpregnant state leads to mild thyroid enlargement detectable sonographically (mean increase in volume 18 percent), a change that is clinically detectable in some women [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,58
         </a>

         Goiter during pregnancy is rare in the United States (an iodine-sufficient region). In the United States, any thyroid growth during pregnancy should be considered potentially abnormal, requiring further investigation with thyroid function testing and possibly thyroid sonography [

         A pregnant woman found to have a thyroid nodule should be evaluated in the same way as if she were not pregnant. TSH and ultrasound should be performed. Thyroid radionuclide scanning is contraindicated during pregnancy. The indications for fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of the nodule are the same as in nonpregnant patients [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,61,62
         </a>
         ]. (See

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         FNA is safe to perform during pregnancy. However, if there is no evidence of nodular growth, concerning ultrasound features (eg, extension beyond the thyroid or extension adjacent to the trachea or recurrent laryngeal nerve), or development of cervical lymph nodes during the period of observation, many endocrinologists defer FNA until after pregnancy [
         <a href="#rid63">
          63
         </a>
         ]. If surgery is required during pregnancy, the optimal timing is the second trimester. Therefore, the timing of a follow-up ultrasound to assess growth of the nodule should be mid-second trimester if the nodule was first noted in early pregnancy. If the nodule was first noted in later pregnancy, follow-up ultrasound can be deferred to the postpartum period.
        </p>
        <p>
         If FNA is performed, subsequent management varies according to the biopsy results. Rarely, benign nodules require surgery during the second trimester due to rapid growth and/or the development of compressive symptoms. When FNA shows indeterminate cytology (follicular neoplasm, atypia of undetermined significance, or follicular lesion of undetermined significance), molecular testing can either be done during pregnancy or, frequently, patients are followed and further evaluation (molecular testing, thyroid scan when indicated, surgery) is delayed until after delivery as most of these nodules are benign, although reported malignancy rates vary from 6 to 52 percent [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9
         </a>
         ]. Rarely, second trimester surgery is indicated due to rapid growth or the emergence of lymphadenopathy associated with a suspicious indeterminate nodule. (See

         In areas of mild to moderate iodine deficiency, the prevalence of thyroid nodules during pregnancy varies between 3 and 21 percent [

          64-66

          Timing of surgery
         </strong>
         – Women with differentiated thyroid cancer require surgery. However, given the typically indolent nature of thyroid cancer, thyroidectomy is usually delayed until the postpartum period to minimize maternal and fetal complications [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71,77
         </a>
         ]. This approach does not appear to have a negative impact on prognosis, as illustrated by the results of a retrospective study of 61 pregnant women with thyroid cancer, of whom 77 percent delayed surgery until after delivery [
         <a href="#rid71">
          71
         </a>
         ]. There was no difference in the outcome after 20 years (recurrence or distant metastases) as compared with those women having surgery in the second trimester or nonpregnant women.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         Surgery during pregnancy is sometimes indicated for rare patients with larger, more aggressive or rapidly growing cancers, or in the presence of extensive nodal or distant metastasis. The safest time for any type of surgery during pregnancy is the second trimester [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,67,78
         </a>
         ]. However, in one retrospective study of 201 pregnant women undergoing thyroid or parathyroid surgery (92 women underwent thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer), pregnant women had significantly higher rates of surgical complications (11 versus 4 percent) and endocrine-specific complications (16 versus 8 percent) than nonpregnant women [
         <a href="#rid79">
          79
         </a>
         ]. Endocrine-specific complications were defined as maternal hypoparathyroidism, hypocalcemia, or recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. In this study, 50 of the 201 procedures were considered to be urgent [
         <a href="#rid79">
          79
         </a>
         ]. Higher surgeon volume (ie, surgical expertise) was a predictor of lower complication rates.

          Monitoring of women not undergoing surgery
         </strong>
         – When surgery for biopsy-proven thyroid cancer is deferred, the patient should be monitored during pregnancy with thyroid ultrasound performed during each trimester. In a study of 19 women with biopsy-proven papillary thyroid cancer who were monitored with ultrasound during gestation, there were no clinically significant increases in the size of the cancer and no patient developed cervical nodal metastases [

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         If, by 24 weeks, there is a significant increase in thyroid cancer size (50 percent in volume or 20 percent in diameter in two dimensions), surgery might be considered during the second trimester [
         <a href="#rid9">
          9,62
         </a>
         ]. The development of nodal metastases is a clear indication for surgical intervention. However, if the lesion remains stable or increases minimally in size or if the cancer is diagnosed in the second half of pregnancy, surgery may be performed after delivery. In such cases where thyroid surgery is deferred, we suggest thyroid hormone suppressive therapy with a goal of maintaining the TSH in the range of 0.3 to 2.0 mU/L.

         In women previously treated with radioiodine for thyroid cancer, pregnancy should be delayed for at least six months to ensure that thyroid hormone levels have normalized (if they had been withdrawn from thyroid hormone) and that additional radiation treatment is not required. Fertility and pregnancy outcomes after radioiodine therapy are reviewed in detail separately. (See

          81,83

         ]. However, in a study of 37 women who became pregnant versus 87 women who did not become pregnant following surgery and radioiodine for lung metastases, the 5- and 10-year progression-free survival rates were similar: 94.5 and 63.2 percent in the pregnancy group and 89.8 and 58.1 percent in the nonpregnancy group, respectively [
         <a href="#rid84">
          84
         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
         In women with persistent disease, thyroid hormone suppression therapy should continue, and preconception TSH goals should remain the same. To maintain the same degree of TSH suppression, most women will require an increase in

Postpartum thyroiditis is characterized by transient hyperthyroidism or transient hyperthyroidism followed by transient or, not infrequently, permanent hypothyroidism. Postpartum exacerbation of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is characterized by postpartum progression of autoimmune destruction. It may cause a transient or permanent increase in thyroid hormone requirements. In one study, for example, more than 50 percent of women with Hashimoto's thyroiditis required an increase in their pregestational T4 dose in the postpartum period [

          Thyroid physiology
         </strong>
         – To meet the increased metabolic needs during a normal pregnancy, there are changes in thyroid physiology that are reflected in altered thyroid function tests. The major changes in thyroid function during pregnancy are an increase in serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentrations and stimulation of the thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]) receptor by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Together, these changes lead to an increase in both serum total thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations and a reduction in serum TSH. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Thyroid physiology'

         <strong>
          Trimester-specific reference ranges
         </strong>
         – Because of the changes in thyroid physiology during normal pregnancy, thyroid function tests should, whenever possible, be interpreted using population and trimester-specific TSH and T4 reference ranges for pregnant women. If the laboratory does not provide trimester-specific reference ranges for TSH (mU/L), a TSH reference range of approximately 0.1 to 4 mU/L can be used. Total T4 and total T3 levels during pregnancy are 1.5-fold higher than in nonpregnant women. Reference ranges for free T4 are assay method-specific, and trimester-specific reference ranges should be provided with the assay kits. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Trimester-specific reference ranges'

         <strong>
          Assessment of thyroid function
         </strong>
         – When evaluating thyroid tests during pregnancy, we typically measure TSH and free T4 (if there is a trimester-specific reference range) and/or total T4. In such settings where free T4 measurements appear discordant with TSH measurements, total T4 should also be measured. For patients whose initial thyroid tests show
         <strong>
          subclinical
         </strong>
         thyroid disease or isolated changes in free T4, we repeat the thyroid tests in a couple of weeks to confirm the abnormality as the findings may vary even when using pregnancy-specific reference ranges. (See

          TPO antibodies in euthyroid women
         </strong>
         – An increased rate of fetal loss and premature delivery has been reported in euthyroid women with high serum antithyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody concentrations. In view of conflicting data regarding the efficacy of

         </a>
         (T4) for reducing the risk of miscarriage, there is not a consensus approach to the management of euthyroid (TSH ≤4 mU/L), TPO-positive women. Some experts, including one editor of this topic, do not treat euthyroid, TPO-positive pregnant women. Since carefully monitored thyroid hormone treatment is safe, however, other experts offer T4 treatment (50 mcg) to selected women based on clinical characteristics (eg, history of miscarriage, preference for intervention, TSH &gt;2.5 mU/L). (See

         Euthyroid women with high serum TPO antibody concentrations are at risk for developing hypothyroidism. In antibody-positive, euthyroid pregnant women who are not treated with thyroid hormone, TSH should be measured every four weeks during the first trimester and, if stable, once during the second and third trimesters to monitor for the development of hypothyroidism.

          Thyroid cancer
         </strong>
         – Given the typically indolent nature of differentiated thyroid cancer, most women with newly diagnosed differentiated thyroid cancer can delay thyroidectomy until the postpartum period to minimize maternal and fetal complications. Surgery during pregnancy is sometimes indicated for rare patients with larger, more aggressive or rapidly growing cancers, or in the presence of extensive nodal or distant metastasis. The safest time for any type of surgery during pregnancy is the second trimester. (See
         <a class="local">

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         When surgery for thyroid cancer is deferred, the patient should be monitored during pregnancy with thyroid ultrasound performed during each trimester. In such cases where thyroid surgery is deferred, we suggest thyroid hormone suppressive therapy (
