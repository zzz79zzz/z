Determining the optimal pressure settings is of paramount importance to eliminate apneas and to help assure patient adherence to therapy.</p><p>Selecting a titration method to determine the optimal pressure in patients with CSA is discussed in this topic. An overview of the treatment of CSA, selection of a titration method for patients with obstructive sleep apnea, and PAP therapy for hypoventilation syndromes are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7675.html" rel="external">"Central sleep apnea: Treatment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5114.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular and chest wall diseases: Patient selection and alternative modes of ventilatory support"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5116.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive ventilatory support and mechanical insufflation-exsufflation for patients with respiratory muscle dysfunction"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7714.html" rel="external">"Noninvasive positive airway pressure therapy for the obesity hypoventilation syndrome"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4301931"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS AND CAUSES OF CSA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CSA syndromes are characterized by the absence of both airflow and ventilatory effort during sleep. CSA is usually best diagnosed during an attended in-laboratory polysomnographic (PSG)-based sleep test but can occasionally be diagnosed on a home sleep apnea test (HSAT). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7701.html" rel="external">"Central sleep apnea: Risk factors, clinical presentation, and diagnosis", section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>CSA can be primary (ie, idiopathic CSA) or secondary to other conditions (Cheyne-Stokes breathing, medical conditions such as stroke or heart failure, suppressant drug or substance use, high altitude periodic breathing, or treatment-emergent CSA). Alternatively, CSA can be classified as hyperventilation-related (eg, Cheyne-Stokes breathing, primary CSA) or hypoventilation-related (eg, central nervous system diseases, drugs or substances)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef106782" href="/d/graphic/106782.html" rel="external">table 1</a>). There is also a subset of conditions primarily associated with alveolar hypoventilation (neuromuscular diseases, severe thoracic cage disorders such as kyphoscoliosis) in which CSAs or hypopneas may be present. In many of these conditions, central apnea is not the only or even dominant type of sleep-disordered breathing that is present. It is therefore prudent that the clinician be aware of the proportional spectrum of sleep-disordered breathing type in a given patient such that an appropriate modality targeted at the major type of sleep-disordered breathing is chosen. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/99553.html" rel="external">"Polysomnography in the evaluation of sleep-disordered breathing in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Hypoventilation syndromes without apneic events may be central (eg, spinal cord injury) or peripheral (eg, myasthenia gravis), and when severe enough may be treated with noninvasive PAP, the details of which are discussed separately. (See <a class="local">'Patients with central hypoventilation syndromes'</a> below and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5121.html" rel="external">"Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Clinical manifestations and evaluation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4301971"><span class="h1">PRINCIPLES AND GOALS OF PAP</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3761008991"><span class="h2">General principles</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Most cases of CSA are associated with a medical disorder (eg, stroke, heart failure) or medications (eg, opioid). In this population, the primary form of therapy is treatment of the associated medical condition when possible, or removal of the offending medication. The clinician needs to be aware of potential dynamic changes in the severity of CSA related to these factors. This fact also emphasizes the need for medical optimization prior to sleep evaluation. Over time, improvement or resolution of the underlying cause may result in a reduced need for PAP therapy, necessitating re-titration at variable time points. (See <a class="local">'Goals of PAP titration in CSA'</a> below and <a class="local">'Caveats of PAP titration in CSA'</a> below.)</p><p>PAP titration for the common causes of CSA, including heart failure, opioid use, and treatment-emergent sleep apnea, is discussed in the sections below. (See <a class="local">'Patients with CSA and heart failure'</a> below and <a class="local">'Patients with CSA and opioid use'</a> below and <a class="local">'Patients with treatment-emergent CSA'</a> below.)</p><p>It should be noted that most data regarding care of patients with CSA come from the heart failure population.</p><p>An overview of specific treatments for CSA, and the data that supports PAP therapy in patients with CSA are reviewed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7675.html" rel="external">"Central sleep apnea: Treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H622741622"><span class="h2">Goals of PAP titration in CSA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goal of PAP titration is to determine the minimal pressure required to resolve all apneas, hypopneas (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI]) and other sleep-related respiratory events, in all stages of sleep and in all sleep positions. The use of AHI as an outcome measure comes as an inference from data gathered predominantly in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>]. However, in many instances, this goal may not be achieved due to the caveats outlined in the section below.</p><p>Due to the caveats associated with PAP titration in this population (see <a class="local">'Caveats of PAP titration in CSA'</a> below), it is difficult to define a "failure" of any therapy that is tried. While some experts use AHI &lt;15 as a goal of therapy (and treat AHI ≥15 as a "failure," or a reason to change and adjust therapy) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>], others use a more strict criterion of AHI &lt;5 as a definition of success.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1883747861"><span class="h2">Caveats of PAP titration in CSA</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In contrast with patients who have OSA, PAP therapy may not eliminate all sleep-disordered breathing events in those with CSA, such that titration to this goal is challenging, especially in the absence of alternate well-defined goals. In addition, ventilatory instability associated with high loop gain can lead to overventilation and hypocapnia, which, in turn, can worsen central apnea, particularly when PAP is administered at higher pressures, a phenomenon termed "pressure toxicity" [<a href="#rid4">4,5</a>], or when bilevel PAP is employed. Worsening CSA due to this phenomenon can, in turn, lead to an increase in sleep fragmentation and poor adherence.</p><p>Thus, PAP titration with the goal of resolving all central sleep-disordered breathing events may not be feasible in many patients with CSA syndromes. For this reason, attended in-laboratory PAP titrations are preferred with supervised polysomnographic (PSG) monitoring so that fine adjustments can be made to achieve the maximal pressure or optimal PAP modality that allows a minimum number of residual central apneas.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4301989"><span class="h1">PATIENTS WITH CSA AND HEART FAILURE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The management of sleep-disordered breathing in patients with heart failure should focus on optimizing heart failure medications as well as treating sleep-disordered breathing with PAP. If clinically significant CSA persists despite maximal medical management, continuous PAP (CPAP) is the typical first-line PAP modality used in this population. Most patients should undergo a titration for CPAP in an attended in-laboratory setting. Titration for second-line modes (adaptive servo-ventilation [ASV] and bilevel PAP ventilation) are reserved for those who fail CPAP. (See <a class="local">'Continuous PAP'</a> below and <a class="local">'Patients with CSA and heart failure who fail continuous PAP'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4301995"><span class="h2">Continuous PAP</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>CPAP provides positive pressure at a relatively constant level throughout inspiration and expiration. Two types of sleep-disordered breathing are common among patients with heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and CSA with Cheyne-Stokes breathing (CSA-CSB). The rationale for using CPAP in patients with heart failure is the correction of airway collapse that is associated with obstructive events but also transiently present at the end of central apneas and may lead to ventilatory overshot, hyperventilation, and oscillatory apneas in susceptible individuals [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>] (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7682.html" rel="external">"Sleep-disordered breathing in heart failure"</a>). Although in-laboratory CPAP titrations and in-hospital "acclimation trials" are sometimes used to determine the optimal CPAP in patients with CSA, there are no comparative data between these titration methods and no official guidelines to direct clinicians. Thus, many centers, including ours, perform attended in-laboratory CPAP titrations for this population. We feel that compared with the acclimation trial, an in-laboratory CPAP titration offers an opportunity to explore and troubleshoot mask interfaces and gives an ability to quickly correct or adjust settings that are clearly not working, thus improving the patient's first experience of PAP, which is an important predictor of long-term compliance.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1116875649"><span class="h3">Attended in-laboratory PAP titration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In a sleep laboratory setting, CPAP is initiated as the first modality at the lowest pressure (usually 4 or 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) and gradually raised to eliminate <strong>obstructive</strong> events during sleep as determined by polysomnography (PSG). If <strong>central</strong> apneas or hypopneas persist at this point, the following are options:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>CPAP may be ramped up in 1 to 2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O intervals to no greater than an additional 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O to assure that no residual obstruction (hypopneas, respiratory effort-related arousals [RERAs]) is present, and then gradually brought down to a setting where obstruction is resolved and the number of central apneas is the lowest (ie, the "optimal pressure") [<a href="#rid9">9,10</a>]. We prefer this method, as it assures that obstruction is no longer playing a role, which is important when further adjustments based on the interrogation of the device are needed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Alternatively, some experts avoid ramping up pressure and allow a stabilization period of 10 minutes to occur [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. Concerns about "pressure toxicity" and potential hemodynamic effects of high PAP in patients with CSA and heart failure has led some centers to place a pressure limit on the titration and refrain from using CPAP pressures of &gt;10 to 18 cm H<sub>2</sub>O [<a href="#rid10">10-13</a>]. These pressure limits for CPAP are arbitrary and center-specific.</p><p></p><p>If central apneas persist at this point, low flow supplemental oxygen can be added [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. This is especially true in patients with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;45 percent for whom use of adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) may be harmful [<a href="#rid14">14</a>]. The caveat here is that although the addition of oxygen decreases central apnea activity acutely, if the patient does not have significant hypoxemia (SpO<sub>2</sub> &lt;88 percent), they may not qualify for oxygen.</p><p class="bulletIndent1">If no control of central apnea activity is accomplished at this stage, and there is sufficient time left during the sleep study (&gt;60 minutes), we typically transition to ASV in a multimodality protocol in patients with normal systolic left ventricular function. (See <a class="local">'Adaptive servo-ventilation'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4294378476"><span class="h3">Unattended in-home "acclimation" continuous PAP trial</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>An alternative and less common strategy to a formal in-laboratory CPAP titration, is to initiate CPAP at empiric settings. In the largest randomized study of patients with CSA and heart failure (CANPAP), empiric pressure of 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O was applied in-hospital for the night without PSG monitoring and subsequently raised in increments of 2 or 3 cm H<sub>2</sub>O to a level of 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O over two to three nights, with a goal of acclimating the patient to CPAP [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. This acclimation strategy has been followed by other centers, with acclimation taking place during the day in a one- to two-hour session [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>]. This trial is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7675.html" rel="external">"Central sleep apnea: Treatment", section on 'Efficacy'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7675.html" rel="external">"Central sleep apnea: Treatment", section on 'Titration'</a>.)</p><p><strong>Choosing in-laboratory or in-home titration</strong> — Most experts choose in-laboratory settings because of the difficulties associated with PAP titration in this population outlined above. In addition, home sleep apnea tests, although validated to assess for obstructive sleep have not been sufficiently validated to accurately identify or monitor CSA, and automatically titrating PAP devices have not been validated to treat CSA. (See <a class="local">'Caveats of PAP titration in CSA'</a> above.)</p><p>Acclimation trials may be offered to those unable to come to the laboratory for a sleep study.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H436878626"><span class="h3">Other titration methods</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3872704344"><span class="h4">Multimodality titration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some centers, including ours, employ a strategy of titrating CPAP and then ASV if necessary, in a sequential fashion, during the same night (multimodality titration study), when feasible. Although this approach is of unproven efficacy, it has the advantages that it may speed up the process, reduce costs, and achieve the main goal of lowering the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), as would testing with separate modalities on separate nights [<a href="#rid18">18</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2217548200"><span class="h4">Auto-titration</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although there are single reports describing the use of auto-titrating devices to determine the CPAP pressure in treatment of CSA [<a href="#rid19">19</a>], this approach is not recommended [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. These devices are more commonly used to titrate PAP in patients with OSA, which is discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/99556.html" rel="external">"Mode selection for titration of positive airway pressure in adults with obstructive sleep apnea"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7677.html" rel="external">"Titration of positive airway pressure therapy for adults with obstructive sleep apnea"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2867386511"><span class="h1">PATIENTS WITH CSA AND HEART FAILURE WHO FAIL CONTINUOUS PAP</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Although there is not a universally accepted definition of continuous PAP (CPAP) "failure" in a setting of treatment of CSA, we define it as the residual apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 5 or above, with &gt;50 percent of residual events of central origin. Options for PAP therapy in this population are limited to adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) and bilevel PAP (BPAP) in a spontaneous/timed (S/T) mode. Typically, ASV is preferred because in comparative studies, it achieved a better control of CSA than did BPAP-S/T [<a href="#rid18">18,21</a>]. However, these modes, particularly ASV, are of limited benefit and potentially harmful in those with a low left ventricular ejection fraction (≤45 percent), such that treatment with oxygen may be the only alternative therapy in this population [<a href="#rid14">14,22</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1686712074"><span class="h2">Patients with ejection fraction &gt;45 percent</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4302213"><span class="h3">Adaptive servo-ventilation</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ASV uses proprietary algorithms to provide variable amounts of pressure that alternate between expiratory and inspiratory phases of the respiratory cycle with a physician pre-set or automatic back-up rate during periods of central apnea. It is used as second-line therapy for patients with CSA and a preserved ejection fraction (&gt;45 percent) who have failed or do not tolerate CPAP. Although there is no universally accepted definition of such failure, we consider ASV if residual AHI is ≥5. ASV is limited to those with preserved ejection fraction, as a lack of efficacy and an increased cardiovascular mortality has been reported in heart failure patients with CSA and a low ejection fraction (≤45 percent) [<a href="#rid14">14,22</a>]. Patients in whom ASV is indicated should have a formal attended in-laboratory ASV titration with polysomnographic (PSG) monitoring. Empiric, untitrated application of ASV, with the expiratory PAP (EPAP) based on the AHI that has been documented in one study, is not routinely recommended [<a href="#rid23">23</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/7675.html" rel="external">"Central sleep apnea: Treatment", section on 'Patients with ejection fraction ≤45 percent'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4096802548"><span class="h4">Devices</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>ASV is a form of bilevel device that alternates between an expiratory pressure (which may be constant or variable) and inspiratory pressure. The difference between the expiratory and inspiratory pressure ("pressure support") varies from breath to breath. The greater the difference in pressure support, the greater the tidal volume that is delivered. The device is equipped with a feedback circuit that allows it to measure the respiratory output from the patient (either in the form of peak flow or minute ventilation) to individually regulate delivered pressure support. Thus, in periods of increased patient respiratory effort (hyperpnea), the machine's support decreases, while in periods of decreased patient effort (hypopnea/apnea), the machine's support increases [<a href="#rid24">24,25</a>]. The device alternates between expiratory and inspiratory pressure with a physician-preset or automatic back-up rate in periods of central apnea. The algorithms seek to provide a steady level of mild hypoventilation, which may be useful in patients with CSA related to hyperventilation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3137124663"><span class="h4">Titration modules</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Proprietary algorithms employed by individual devices vary such that direct supervision by the technologist in an in-laboratory PSG-monitored setting is preferred; this allows for individual adjustments, which may or may not follow the protocol suggested by the manufacturer of the device. ASV does not perform well when mask leak is high; assuring good mask fit is especially important in the ASV titrations. Most experts use ASV devices that require several pressure limits to be defined in advance but devices that employ an auto-titrating protocol to determine expiratory pressure are also available. The titration method for each type of device is different:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>ASV devices with set pressures</strong> – Settings for expiratory pressure and pressure support as well as a back-up rate need to be set manually before titration.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Expiratory pressure</strong> – The expiratory pressure needed to overcome obstruction may be known from the prior CPAP titration, even if it was not successful in controlling central events. In this instance, we and others set expiratory pressure on ASV at the level of CPAP pressure that controlled obstruction [<a href="#rid26">26,27</a>].

This technology is similar to the auto-titrating technology used in CPAP devices. ASV devices with variable expiratory pressure do not require manual alterations of pressures, but auto-adjust expiratory pressures within the preset range in response to the airway obstruction encountered during individual breaths, while delivering pressure support for each breath [<a href="#rid27">27,35</a>]. Typically, the minimum expiratory pressure is set at the level known to control obstruction, and the maximum expiratory pressure is limited to 15 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. The use of autotitrating technology may reduce the need for supervised testing. Although in a clinical trial setting, the unsupervised "autotitrations" using the device's algorithm have been successfully performed [<a href="#rid36">36</a>], our practice is still to initiate it during a supervised PSG.

In this population, BPAP should only be used with a back-up respiratory rate because BPAP without a back-up rate may exacerbate hyperventilation, hypocapnia, and hypoxemic events associated with worsening central apnea. (See <a class="local">'Caveats of PAP titration in CSA'</a> above.)</p><p>Titration for BPAP in the S/T mode should be performed in an attended in-laboratory setting with PSG monitoring.

In this instance, we set expiratory pressure on BPAP-S/T at the level of CPAP pressure that controlled obstructive events. If the pressure needed to overcome airway obstruction is not known, or no obstructive apnea is present, then the expiratory pressure (EPAP) is initiated at the lowest setting (4 to 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) and gradually increased, typically in 1 cm H<sub>2</sub>O increments, to eliminate obstruction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Inspiratory pressure</strong> – We initially set the inspiratory pressure (IPAP) to 4 to 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O above the EPAP and raise it in tandem with the increases of the EPAP until all obstruction is controlled.

In patients with persistent CSA who are on maximum medical therapy, we typically treat with CPAP or CPAP with oxygen. Sometimes oxygen is used alone without CPAP. Rarely, some patients have less frequent central apnea events in the non-supine position such that positional therapy including elevation of the head of bed and/or avoiding sleeping in the supine position is advised for selected patients [<a href="#rid37">37</a>].

For that reason, in most cases, bilevel PAP (BPAP) modalities (eg, adaptive servo-ventilation [ASV] or BPAP in the spontaneous/timed [S/T] mode) is used with better success than continuous PAP (CPAP), which is typically insufficient to fully control sleep-disordered breathing in this population. However, data directly comparing these modalities are sparse, and most data come from small case series and our experience [<a href="#rid35">35,39-42</a>]. In patients whose central apneas are due to opioid use and cannot be controlled to reach an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) &lt;5 by CPAP, ASV with an auto-titrating expiratory pressure is typically the first-line mode of PAP therapy. For those who fail ASV, we perform titration of BPAP-S/T. In patients with CSA due to opioids, we monitor transcutaneous carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels, a measure of hypoventilation, throughout the polysomnogram, although this technology is not always feasible and this approach is unproven.

With subsequent evidence of uncontrolled TE-CSA (based on the lack of symptomatic improvement or evidence of residual sleep-disordered breathing on interrogation of the device), an in-laboratory retitration study is then needed.
