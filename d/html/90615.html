Early recognition that a patient's airway may be difficult to manage allows the clinician to plan the anesthetic to minimize the potential for serious airway-related morbidity.</p><p>In the unanticipated difficult airway, a pre-formulated strategy for airway management may reduce the likelihood of adverse outcomes [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Difficulty may occur with facemask ventilation, placement of a supraglottic airway (SGA), laryngoscopy, and/or tracheal intubation. Other significant airway-related complications include aspiration of gastric contents, laryngospasm, and bronchospasm. These airway problems may occur in combination, leading to serious morbidity and mortality [<a href="#rid2">2</a>].</p><p>This topic will review patient factors that predict difficult airway management, the development of strategies for the initial management of the predicted difficult airway in the operating room environment, management of the unanticipated difficult airway during induction of general anesthesia, and extubation of the patient with a difficult airway. A general approach to airway management and specific techniques and devices used to manage the airway are discussed separately, as is an approach to the difficult airway during emergency intubation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91218.html" rel="external">"Airway management for induction of general anesthesia"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/260.html" rel="external">"Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/275.html" rel="external">"Approach to the difficult airway in adults for emergency medicine and critical care"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/98733.html" rel="external">"Supraglottic devices (including laryngeal mask airways) for airway management for anesthesia in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1136745317"><span class="h1">DEFINITIONS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For the purpose of this topic, the difficult airway is defined as the situation in which the anesthesia clinician experiences difficulty with ventilation by mask or supraglottic airway (SGA), difficulty with tracheal intubation, or both. Specifically:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Difficult mask or SGA ventilation</strong> – Inability of an unassisted anesthesia clinician to maintain alveolar oxygen delivery or reverse signs of inadequate ventilation</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Difficult SGA placement </strong>– Requires multiple attempts</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Difficult laryngoscopy</strong> – Inability to visualize any portion of the vocal cords after multiple attempts</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Difficult tracheal intubation</strong> – Inability to place a tracheal tube into the larynx and trachea after multiple attempts</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3052647100"><span class="h1">RECOGNITION OF THE DIFFICULT AIRWAY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>All patients undergoing anesthesia should have a complete history and anesthesia-focused physical examination, including assessment of the airway  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef108981" href="/z/d/graphic/108981.html" rel="external">table 1</a>) and factors that may influence airway management. One goal of this evaluation is to predict the risk of difficulty with ventilation and intubation. Prediction that a patient will be at risk for difficult mask ventilation, ventilation with a supraglottic airway (SGA), or intubation leads to different airway management strategies, particularly when more than one airway technique is likely to be problematic. The airway history and examination, including factors that predict difficulty with airway management, are discussed more fully separately (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91218.html" rel="external">"Airway management for induction of general anesthesia", section on 'Airway assessment'</a>). While these predictive factors are useful for developing an airway management plan, it is important to note that the majority of difficult airways are unanticipated [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Difficult mask ventilation</strong> – Predictors of difficult mask ventilation include male sex, obstructive sleep apnea, absence of teeth, presence of a beard, and other clinical features  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94434" href="/z/d/graphic/94434.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). The degree of difficulty varies and depends on both the number of predictive factors and the skill of the clinician. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91218.html" rel="external">"Airway management for induction of general anesthesia", section on 'Difficult mask ventilation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Difficult SGA ventilation</strong> – Factors that predict difficulty ventilating with a SGA include reduced mouth opening; absence of teeth; male sex; obesity; and glottic, hypopharyngeal, and subglottic pathology  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94436" href="/z/d/graphic/94436.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91218.html" rel="external">"Airway management for induction of general anesthesia", section on 'Difficult supraglottic airway device use'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Difficult tracheal intubation</strong> – Clinical features that predict difficult intubation are presented in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94433" href="/z/d/graphic/94433.html" rel="external">table 4</a>). Those with the highest predictive value for a difficult direct laryngoscopy are a prior history of a difficult intubation, a short thyromental distance, and decreased range of motion of the neck. The greater the number of positive findings, the more likely intubation will be difficult. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91218.html" rel="external">"Airway management for induction of general anesthesia", section on 'Difficult intubation'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H881472472"><span class="h1">IMPORTANCE OF AN ALGORITHMIC APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and other organizations have developed guidelines for management of the patient with a difficult airway that include algorithms to aid in clinical decision-making [<a href="#rid1">1,4-6</a>].(See <a class="local">'Society guideline links'</a> below.)</p><p>The guidelines from the ASA were updated in 2021, including new algorithms and infographics  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef134460" href="/z/d/graphic/134460.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef135096" href="/z/d/graphic/135096.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Important points in the new guidelines and graphics are as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The new guidelines emphasize oxygenation prior to and throughout attempts at airway management.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assessing the success of attempts at airway management should be primarily based on the detection of end tidal CO<sub>2 </sub>after each attempt at airway management, regardless of the airway device or technique used. The role of clinical measures (eg, chest rise and fall, misting, skin color) are considered secondary to CO<sub>2</sub> detection.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Airway management attempts with each device or technique should be limited to three, with another attempt permitted by a more experienced airway operator.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The new guidelines provide more robust guidance for extubation than prior ASA guidelines.</p><p></p><p>A fundamental recommendation of these guidelines is for the performance of a thorough, pre-management assessment of the airway and other mitigating patient factors, with the goal of identifying patients at risk. Advanced recognition enables the practitioner to formulate a specific management plan that includes the possibility of securing the airway before induction of general anesthesia (ie, awake intubation). The algorithms that appear in guidelines proceed through specific decision points based on the success of the initial plan and the likelihood of success of backup techniques. Structured training and use of these algorithms for difficult airways may decrease airway-related morbidity [<a href="#rid7">7,8</a>]. Experienced personnel and specialized airway equipment are critical when airway management is difficult.</p><p>The importance of evaluation, planning, and an algorithmic approach to difficulty with airway management was demonstrated by an analysis of closed malpractice claims related to difficult intubation from 2000 to 2012 [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. Airway management was judged to have been inappropriate in 73 percent of 102 assessed claims, and included inadequate evaluation, failure to plan for difficult intubation, failure to use a supraglottic airway for rescue, delay in calling for help, and perseveration on failed techniques.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H881472485"><span class="h1">AIRWAY APPROACH ALGORITHM</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Our approach to developing an initial airway management strategy for the patient with a predicted difficult airway is summarized in the Airway Approach Algorithm  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94754" href="/z/d/graphic/94754.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. This algorithm consists of a series of five clinical questions that lead the clinician to one of two entry points of the ASA Difficult Airway Algorithm  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef134460" href="/z/d/graphic/134460.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef135096" href="/z/d/graphic/135096.html" rel="external">figure 1</a>): awake intubation or intubation after induction of general anesthesia. The goal of this approach is to avoid entering the emergency pathway of the algorithm (ie, the "cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate," scenario). The questions used to direct airway management in the Airway Approach Algorithm include the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Is airway control required?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Could laryngoscopy be difficult?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Could supraglottic ventilation be used?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Is there risk of aspiration?</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Will the patient tolerate a period of apnea?</p><p></p><p>The answers to these questions are combined to create a strategy for airway management.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1482509313"><span class="h1">PLANNING THE ANESTHETIC APPROACH</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The plan for anesthesia and airway management for the patient with a predicted difficult airway may differ from the standard approach. The following discussion is applicable to the anesthetic care of these patients based on clinical assessment or prior history of difficulty. Creation of a general strategy for airway management is discussed more fully elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91218.html" rel="external">"Airway management for induction of general anesthesia", section on 'Creation of a strategy for airway management'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H183541"><span class="h2">Regional versus general anesthesia</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If appropriate for the surgical procedure, regional or local anesthesia may be preferable for the patient with a potentially difficult airway. Some patients, however, may require unanticipated airway manipulation or conversion to general anesthesia if the regional technique fails or is insufficient to complete the surgical procedure [<a href="#rid1">1,4,11</a>]. Thus, a plan must still be in place to manage the airway for patients having regional anesthesia [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]. In some cases, general anesthesia with elective management of the airway may be preferred to avoid an emergency difficult intubation should conversion become necessary (eg, due to inadequate regional block). This decision should be made on a case-by-case basis based on the likelihood of the regional anesthetic being successful and sufficient for the duration of the case, the degree of predicted airway difficulty, access to the airway during the case, the clinician's experience, and the availability of specialized airway equipment and skilled assistance [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H881472517"><span class="h2">Timing of airway control</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients <strong>without</strong> a predicted difficult airway typically undergo anesthetic induction prior to intubation.

Although the SGA has a high success rate following difficulty with both mask ventilation and direct laryngoscopy, there are patients for whom SGA use is likely to be difficult or to fail  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef94436" href="/z/d/graphic/94436.html" rel="external">table 3</a>) [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/91218.html" rel="external">"Airway management for induction of general anesthesia", section on 'Difficult supraglottic airway device use'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>The stomach is not empty</strong> – Patients predicted to be difficult to intubate who have not fasted or who are otherwise at high risk for regurgitation and aspiration of gastric contents  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef98506" href="/z/d/graphic/98506.html" rel="external">table 5</a>) should be intubated awake and in control of their airway reflexes whenever possible [<a href="#rid1">1,5</a>]. Airway topicalization can compromise airway protective reflexes and should be performed selectively, but thoroughly, in patients at high risk of aspiration. In such patients, the oropharynx can be anesthetized, and topical glossopharyngeal nerve blocks can be performed to blunt the gag reflex, but laryngeal and subglottic anesthesia should be avoided until immediately prior to intubation. This can be accomplished by spraying local anesthetic solution through the flexible intubation scope as it is advanced during the process of laryngoscopy and intubation. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/89917.html" rel="external">"Flexible scope intubation for anesthesia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The key to awake intubation in the patient with a full stomach is a smooth course, with avoidance of gagging, coughing, and vomiting. Whenever possible, the intubation should not be rushed. Rather, adequate time should be allowed for full local anesthetic effect. The rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII) technique, which relies on the ability to intubate rapidly, may not be appropriate for the patient who may be difficult to intubate. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/94214.html" rel="external">"Rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII) for anesthesia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>The patient will not tolerate an apneic period</strong> – The risk of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) desaturation is greatest in patients with certain risk factors (eg, patients who are obese, are pregnant, or have pulmonary disease, as well as pediatric patients)  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56716" href="/z/d/graphic/56716.html" rel="external">figure 2</a>). When difficult laryngoscopy is anticipated, awake intubation should be considered even when mask or SGA ventilation is predicted to be easy.</p><p></p><p>The goal of awake intubation is to preserve spontaneous ventilation and patient cooperation while intubation is accomplished. Pediatric patients and those with cognitive disability, altered mental status, or extreme anxiety may not tolerate airway procedures while awake. When awake intubation is indicated but not feasible, induction of anesthesia with techniques that maintain spontaneous ventilation (eg, inhalation induction) may reduce the occurrence of failed airways [<a href="#rid10">10</a>]. A higher level of vigilance for the risk of aspiration or loss of the airway must be maintained. This may include preparations for an immediate surgical airway. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/263.html" rel="external">"Emergency cricothyrotomy (cricothyroidotomy) in adults"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3743067262"><span class="h3">Airway management after induction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The Airway Approach Algorithm  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94754" href="/z/d/graphic/94754.html" rel="external">algorithm 2</a>) includes two scenarios in which it is appropriate to proceed with anesthetic induction prior to airway management:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Laryngoscopy is not predicted to be difficult – If laryngoscopy is not predicted to be difficult after a focused review of the patient's history and a physical evaluation of the airway, airway management can be attempted after induction of general anesthesia. Because of the relatively low sensitivities, specificities, and predictive values of the commonly performed airway exams, this determination is based in large part on clinical experience, including experience with the specific technique to be used (eg, direct or indirect laryngoscopy).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Laryngoscopy is predicted to be difficult, but ventilation by mask or SGA is predicted to be adequate, the patient is not at increased risk for aspiration, <strong>and</strong> the patient will tolerate an apneic period.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3654914303"><span class="h2">Choice of induction technique</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Intravenous (IV) medication is used for induction of general anesthesia for most adult patients. If difficult airway management is predicted, IV induction is used when there is a high likelihood of successful ventilation by mask, SGA, or tracheal intubation and the patient is not at significant risk of gastric contents aspiration or rapid oxyhemoglobin desaturation. When maintenance of spontaneous ventilation throughout airway management is preferred, an inhalation induction may be used, though IV access should be established prior to inhalation induction. (See <a class="local">'Inhalation induction'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3743067273"><span class="h1">PLANNING THE AIRWAY MANAGEMENT APPROACH</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1136745059"><span class="h2">Choice of airway device</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Tracheal intubation is considered by many to be the definitive method of airway control for patients receiving general anesthesia. Not every patient, however, requires tracheal intubation, including the patient with a potentially difficult airway. Regardless of the technique chosen for airway management, a backup plan must be in place, with the necessary expertise and equipment immediately available. Techniques for use and various types of airway management devices are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/269.html" rel="external">"Devices for difficult airway management in adults for emergency medicine and critical care"</a>.)</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Facemask</strong> – Apart from the patient breathing spontaneously (with or without a general anesthetic), facemask ventilation is the most basic of airway management techniques. It can be used for short cases when the anesthesiologist will have full access to the patient's airway throughout the procedure, in patients without contraindications to application of a tight-fitting facemask (eg, facial fractures). An advantage to facemask airway management for the patient who may be difficult to intubate is that spontaneous ventilation can be maintained throughout the anesthetic.

For example, when blood or secretions soil the airway, a bladed technique such as video-assisted or direct laryngoscopy may allow better visualization of the larynx. Awake placement of a laryngeal mask airway (LMA), a type of SGA, has been described, either to facilitate tracheal intubation or for ventilation for the anesthetic. These techniques are discussed separately. Airway management techniques are discussed separately.

Repeated attempts at intubation should not delay noninvasive airway ventilation or emergency invasive airway access. We prefer to use an intubating SGA as the initial rescue device after two failed attempts at direct laryngoscopy if mask ventilation is not adequate. An intubating SGA permits immediate ventilation and may facilitate intubation with a standard-size endotracheal tube, without the need for an airway exchange catheter. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/98733.html" rel="external">"Supraglottic devices (including laryngeal mask airways) for airway management for anesthesia in adults", section on 'Supraglottic airways as conduits for intubation'</a>.)</p><p>Repeated instrumentation of the airway may lead to bleeding, edema, and deterioration of the ability to ventilate. For this reason, laryngoscopy attempts with any particular device should be limited. Data suggest that complications increase when more than two attempts at direct laryngoscopy are made [<a href="#rid39">39</a>]. Intubating conditions should be optimized between attempts; for example, by improving head and neck position, changing laryngoscope blade, using a different device, or by having a more experienced clinician manage the airway.</p><p>Following initially unsuccessful attempts at intubation, no single subsequent technique is superior to others in all circumstances. For example, in one series of 698 patients with both difficult mask ventilation and difficult laryngoscopy, intubation was eventually successful with direct laryngoscopy in 177, direct laryngoscopy with bougie introducer in 284, VL in 163, and other techniques in 73; one patient required emergent cricothyrotomy [<a href="#rid40">40</a>]. These devices and their use are discussed elsewhere.

In a large, multicenter retrospective study of failed DL utilizing the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Database, in 1619 rescue attempts, VL resulted in the highest success rate (92 percent), compared with FSI (78 percent), use of an SGA as a conduit for intubation (78 percent), or the use of a lighted stylet (77 percent) [<a href="#rid41">41</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H346443"><span class="h1">THE FAILED AIRWAY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The inability to either ventilate or intubate a patient is termed a "failed airway."

After failure of multiple attempts at intubation and facemask or SGA ventilation, emergency invasive airway access should be performed. A reasonable approach is to use no more than three attempts at intubation or SGA ventilation before performing an emergency invasive airway. An additional attempt by a clinician with higher skill may be warranted [<a href="#rid1">1</a>].
