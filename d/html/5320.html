As compared with TTE, TEE offers superior visualization of posterior cardiac structures because of close proximity of the esophagus to the posteromedial heart with lack of intervening lung and bone. This proximity permits use of high-frequency imaging transducers that afford superior spatial resolution.</p><p>The first practical clinical use of TEE was described in 1976 when a modified rigid endoscopic probe with single M-mode crystal was used [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Since that time, TEE technology has evolved rapidly with developments in flexible endoscopic probe technology, phased-array ultrasound systems, and crystal miniaturization and real time three-dimensional (3D) imaging. Current TEE probes allow for both two-dimensional (2D) and 3D imaging as well M-mode, spectral Doppler, and color flow Doppler. The versatility of these transducers permits improved penetration with lower frequency imaging and superior spatial resolution with higher frequency imaging. Additional developments have focused on further probe miniaturization/pediatric probes and improvement of 3D echocardiography capability. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5316.html" rel="external">"Echocardiography essentials: Physics and instrumentation"</a>.)</p><p>The indications, potential complications, and normal views associated with TEE will be reviewed here. The role for TEE in the evaluation of specific cardiac abnormalities is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5294.html" rel="external">"Transesophageal echocardiography in the evaluation of the left ventricle"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5327.html" rel="external">"Transesophageal echocardiography in the evaluation of aortic valve disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5329.html" rel="external">"Transesophageal echocardiography in the evaluation of mitral valve disease"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9886539"><span class="h1">INDICATIONS FOR TEE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Both TTE and TEE have a variety of clinical indications and applications. In most patients, TEE provides superior image quality, particularly for posterior cardiac structures which are nearer to the esophagus and less well visualized on transthoracic echocardiography as they are more distant from the anterior TTE transducer. Because of its moderately invasive nature, however, TEE is reserved for selected indications in which the potential benefits of making a diagnosis outweigh the risks associated with the procedure. For many but not all clinical situations, a TTE study precedes the TEE as the TTE study may obviate or help guide the TEE.</p><p>How often TEE is used for a particular indication varies from institution to institution. However, TEE is most commonly performed to evaluate for a potential cardiac source of embolus, to assess valves for endocarditis, or to exclude left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombi in patients with atrial fibrillation [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In a large series from the 1990s, the most common clinical indications for TEE were to evaluate for cardiac source of embolism, endocarditis, prosthetic heart valve dysfunction, native valvular disease, and aortic dissection or aneurysm [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Although thoracic computed tomography is frequently used for the assessment of aortic aneurysm/dissection, TEE may still be utilized for diagnosis in some acute scenarios. In current practice, TEE is also performed with many cardiac surgical procedures, especially those involving congenital or valve repairs, both to verify preoperative diagnosis and anatomy and to monitor the success of the procedure [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. In addition, TEE is commonly used for imaging guidance during noncoronary percutaneous cardiac interventions, such as transcatheter mitral valve repair and transcatheter left atrial appendage closure. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8190.html" rel="external">"Clinical features and diagnosis of acute aortic dissection", section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>TTE remains the initial test of choice for most patients requiring an echocardiogram. However, TEE should be performed as the initial test in certain life-threatening situations or in situations where TTE is likely to be nondiagnostic. Clinical situations in which TEE should be considered as the initial test include [<a href="#rid5">5</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Suspected acute aortic pathology (ie, dissection, transsection, intramural hematoma).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Suspected prosthetic valve dysfunction (thrombus, pannus ingrowth, vegetation, or regurgitation).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Suspected complications of endocarditis (eg, fistula, abscess).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Evaluation for left atrial/LAA thrombus in a patient with atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter to facilitate clinical decision-making regarding anticoagulation, cardioversion, or ablation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Evaluation of source of embolism in a young (&lt;50 years) patient for whom a TEE would be performed if the TTE was normal.</p><p></p><p>In 2011 the American College of Cardiology Foundation, in conjunction with numerous professional societies, issued Appropriate Use Criteria for Echocardiography [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. While appropriate use criteria are not intended to be an exhaustive list of TEE indications, the following indications for TEE were all considered appropriate:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>To diagnose infective endocarditis in patients with moderate or high pretest likelihood (ie, patients with prosthetic valves, certain pathogens).

Indications for TEE in the critically ill are similar to standard TEE indications in all patients. However, certain scenarios in a critically ill patient may be more quickly and thoroughly investigated with TEE as the initial diagnostic procedure, including [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unexplained hypotension.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unexplained hypoxemia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Suspected complications following a myocardial infarction (ie, acute mitral regurgitation, ventricular septal defect, free wall rupture with cardiac tamponade).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Uncertain volume status.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Blunt chest trauma.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Unexplained hemodynamic instability.</p><p></p><p>In a review of 83 TEE studies performed in the critical care setting, unexpected findings were observed in 25 percent of patients, resulting in a change in management in 17 percent or a referral for invasive examination in 22 percent. In 16 percent of cases, surgical intervention was performed based on TEE without further examination [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2904159"><span class="h1">PATIENT PREPARATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients undergoing a TEE, the suggested preprocedure assessment, preparation, and monitoring during and after the procedure is similar to gastrointestinal endoscopy. A detailed discussion of this is presented separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2567.html" rel="external">"Gastrointestinal endoscopy in adults: Procedural sedation administered by endoscopists"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h1">SAFETY OF TEE EXAMINATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Guidelines for TEE competence have been published by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. Although considered moderately invasive and generally performed with conscious sedation, TEE is safe in experienced hands and may be completed in almost all patients when performed by a trained clinician [<a href="#rid3">3,9-11</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/264.html" rel="external">"Procedural sedation in adults in the emergency department: General considerations, preparation, monitoring, and mitigating complications"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2567.html" rel="external">"Gastrointestinal endoscopy in adults: Procedural sedation administered by endoscopists"</a>.)</p><p>Prior to beginning the TEE, all patients should have a history and physical examination performed, focusing on factors that increase the risk of an adverse outcome (eg, medication allergies, prior difficult intubation or airway problems, odynophagia or dysphagia). Absolute contraindications include the following conditions [<a href="#rid12">12</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Perforated viscus</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Esophageal stricture</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Esophageal tumor</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Esophageal perforation/laceration</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Esophageal diverticulum</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Active upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed</p><p></p><p>In addition, patients with one or more of the following conditions are at increased risk for complications from TEE (relative contraindications):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Altered mental status or an uncooperative patient.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of radiation to head, neck, or mediastinum.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of GI surgery.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Recent upper GI bleed.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of Barrett esophagus.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Esophageal varices.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Active esophagitis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Active peptic ulcer disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Symptomatic hiatal hernia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Tenuous cardiorespiratory status (consider endotracheal intubation prior to TEE for airway protection).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Surgical interposition of the esophagus.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>History of odynophagia or dysphagia (consider screening endoscopy and/or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9180" href="/z/d/drug information/9180.html" rel="external">barium</a> swallow prior to TEE).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Cervical spine arthritis with reduced range of motion or atlantoaxial joint disease (for example, in patients with Down Syndrome).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Severe thrombocytopenia (less than 50k), elevated international normalized ratio (greater than 4), or prolonged partial thromboplastin time (&gt;150 seconds).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Obstructive sleep apnea/airway compromise (consider sedation by anesthesia).</p><p></p><p>Patients with recent or active esophageal perforation, tear, or hemorrhage should likely not undergo TEE except in extreme situations where the benefits are thought to outweigh the risks. In a patient with a difficult esophageal intubation, the assistance of a trained gastroenterologist or an anesthesiologist, who may directly visualize the glottis with a laryngoscope, can facilitate successful esophageal intubation. Careful attention to posterior pharyngeal anesthesia with topical <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9558" href="/z/d/drug information/9558.html" rel="external">lidocaine</a> and patient reassurance help to facilitate the esophageal intubation and minimize the degree of sedation that is required. The use of a smaller/pediatric probe should also be considered if initial esophageal intubation is unsuccessful. We avoid transgastric imaging in patients with a history of gastric surgery.</p><p>If required, TEE may be performed in patients who are unable to cooperate by using a greater level of sedation and prophylactic endotracheal intubation for airway protection. For situations in which the risk of TEE is high, intracardiac echocardiography may be an alternative study which can provide the needed information.</p><p>Serious complications are extremely rare in patients undergoing TEE, having been estimated at less than 1 in 5000 [<a href="#rid3">3,9</a>]. While death during TEE has been rarely reported, complications such as esophageal perforation, gastrointestinal bleeding, pharyngeal hematoma, and methemoglobinemia are more likely to occur but only rarely are fatal.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Esophageal perforation</strong> – There is a very low risk of esophageal perforation. This was illustrated in a study of 10,000 consecutive patients undergoing TEE in which there was one case of hypopharyngeal perforation, two cases of cervical esophageal perforation, and no fatalities [<a href="#rid13">13</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Gastrointestinal bleeding</strong> – An increased risk of bleeding should be considered among patients with thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;50 k), those who have received thrombolytic therapy or chronic anticoagulation, and patients with other bleeding diatheses. Patients with esophageal varices and no active or recent variceal bleeding do not appear to be at an increased risk of serious complications from TEE [<a href="#rid14">14-16</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pharyngeal hematoma</strong> – This upper respiratory tract complication occurs from direct trauma to the posterior pharynx and may result in the acute airway compromise [<a href="#rid17">17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Methemoglobinemia</strong> – Methemoglobinemia is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of topical <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9092" href="/z/d/drug information/9092.html" rel="external">benzocaine</a> and related agents used for posterior pharyngeal anesthesia (eg, two deaths in a review of 132 benzocaine cases reported to the United States Food and Drug Administration) [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. In a series of over 28,000 TEEs performed at a single center, the incidence of methemoglobinemia was 0.07 percent (1 case per 1499 TEE studies) [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. Methemoglobinemia should be suspected clinically by the development of cyanosis in the presence of a normal arterial PO2 [<a href="#rid20">20</a>]. Pulse oximetry is inaccurate in monitoring oxygen saturation in the presence of methemoglobinemia, and cannot be used to make the diagnosis. Issues related to the diagnosis and treatment of methemoglobinemia are discussed separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7094.html" rel="external">"Methemoglobinemia"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>TEE examination is rarely associated with bacteremia [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. Professional society guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis do <strong>not</strong> recommend prophylaxis for patients undergoing TEE [<a href="#rid22">22,23</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2147.html" rel="external">"Prevention of endocarditis: Antibiotic prophylaxis and other measures"</a>.)</p><p>Minor complications are seen in fewer than 1 in 500 examinations [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. These may include transient bronchospasm, transient hypoxia, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, transient atrial fibrillation, minimal hemoptysis, or vomiting. Minor complications generally resolve spontaneously without specific treatment following termination of the procedure. A higher rate of complications has been reported in procedures requiring TEE guidance (eg, transcatheter aortic valve implantation, transcatheter mitral valve repair, percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion), with increasing risk of complications as the duration of the procedure increases [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h1">THE NORMAL HEART AND GREAT VESSELS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As with TTE examinations, we believe a complete TEE examination should include imaging of all cardiac chambers, valves, and great vessels, regardless of the indication for the study, as patient condition permits. In 2002, a scientific statement from the American Heart Association made recommendations for standardized segmentation and nomenclature for tomographic imaging of the heart for all modalities  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55080 graphicRef64968 graphicRef65139" href="/z/d/graphic/55080.html" rel="external">figure 1A-C</a>) [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. Follow-up TEE studies (eg, to monitor resolution of an atrial appendage thrombus) may be focused.</p><p>A standard comprehensive approach to imaging is recommended, but each individual study should be modified to reflect the specific clinical indication. As an example, a patient undergoing TEE examination for evaluation of LAA thrombus should include a careful, focused examination of the appendage in a continuum of imaging planes from 0° to 180°. On the other hand, an examination in a patient with suspected endocarditis should include extensive imaging of all cardiac valves.</p><p>This section will describe the normal cardiac anatomy as visualized sequentially during a routine multiplane TEE study. Following intubation of the esophagus, the probe is advanced in most adult patients to a depth of 28 to 30 cm from the incisors, coming to rest in the proximal-to-mid esophagus.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H10"><span class="h2">Horizontal plane</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H11"><span class="h3">Four-chamber view</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In the horizontal (0°) imaging plane, a four-chamber view of the heart can be seen, demonstrating the left atrium, mitral valve, left ventricle (LV), right atrium, tricuspid valve, and right ventricle (RV)  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76441" href="/z/d/graphic/76441.html" rel="external">image 1</a>). Doppler examination of transmitral inflow and mitral regurgitation may be performed. The RV and LV are frequently foreshortened in this position and the true apex is rarely seen (due to foreshortening and the distance from the imaging probe). Slight withdrawal of the probe permits imaging of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) and aortic valve  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76441" href="/z/d/graphic/76441.html" rel="external">image 1</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H12"><span class="h3">Mitral valve</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The mitral valve should be evaluated in several imaging planes, particularly when mitral valve pathology is suspected. Comprehensive mitral valve imaging is essential for diagnosis and perioperative evaluation. Mitral valve imaging using TEE has excellent correlation with surgical findings. Three-dimensional echocardiography may be helpful for characterization of mitral valve anatomy [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5329.html" rel="external">"Transesophageal echocardiography in the evaluation of mitral valve disease"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5322.html" rel="external">"Three-dimensional echocardiography"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13"><span class="h3">Left atrial appendage</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>With the transducer positioned in the mid-esophagus, at the base of the heart, the LAA may be examined for thrombus and for decreased contractile function. Use of left-sided contrast may aid in differentiation between normal trabeculae and thrombi. While the LAA length is similar in all imaging planes, its width, accessory lobe visualization and cross-sectional area may vary considerably [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/5313.html" rel="external">"Contrast echocardiography: Clinical applications"</a>.)</p><p>We typically record pulsed Doppler spectra from the mouth of the LAA and left upper pulmonary vein  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54962" href="/z/d/graphic/54962.html" rel="external">image 2</a>). Normal LAA flow typically consists of prominent ejection and inflow components after the P wave on the ECG [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. LAA ejection and inflow velocities are independent of transducer orientation [<a href="#rid27">27</a>]. Among patients in sinus rhythm, LAA ejection velocity is typically &gt;0.5 m/s, with depressed LAA ejection velocity defined as &lt;0.2 m/s [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H14"><span class="h3">Pulmonary veins</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The four major pulmonary veins can readily be identified during the TEE study. The left upper pulmonary vein is best identified in the proximal esophageal level in the horizontal plane, immediately adjacent to the LAA, while the left lower pulmonary vein is often identified with posterior (counterclockwise) rotation of the probe at 110 to 135 degree crystal orientation. The right upper pulmonary vein is easily identified running near parallel with the superior vena cava with the probe rotated anteriorly (clockwise) and the crystal in approximately the 90 degree orientation. Further anterior rotation demonstrates the right lower pulmonary vein.</p><p>Similar to the Doppler evaluation of the LAA, pulmonary vein Doppler flow is typically assessed with pulsed Doppler with the sample volume positioned approximately 1 cm within the entrance of the pulmonary vein. Normal pulmonary venous flow in adults is biphasic with a predominant systolic flow [S wave] [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. With increasing severity of mitral regurgitation, there will be attenuation/decrease in the pulmonary vein S wave and increase in the height of the diastolic flow [D wave]. With severe mitral regurgitation, there is reversal of the expected forward flow in the S wave Doppler spectra. Color Doppler is often helpful to visualize extension of the mitral regurgitation jet into the pulmonary veins.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H15"><span class="h3">Pulmonary artery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>With the transducer imaging plane in the horizontal (0°) position, the TEE probe is rotated anteriorly and withdrawn slightly to visualize the main pulmonary artery, right main pulmonary artery, and left main pulmonary artery  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69255" href="/z/d/graphic/69255.html" rel="external">image 3</a>). The patient may cough or note posterior "irritation" during imaging at this level in the proximal esophagus, and diligent care is required to avoid extubating the TEE probe from the esophagus.

The interatrial septum is evaluated at various crystal orientations with color flow Doppler to assess for evidence of an atrial septal aneurysm, an atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale.

Advancement and retraction of the probe in this plane will allow for imaging of the LVOT and ascending aorta, respectively. Color flow Doppler interrogation for aortic regurgitation may also be performed in this orientation.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H18"><span class="h2">Vertical plane</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In contrast to the multiple maneuvers (anteflexion, retroflexion, retraction, advancement) of the TEE probe and transducer tip required for imaging in the horizontal plane, imaging in the vertical (90°) plane primarily involves simple anterior and posterior rotation of the probe. We begin imaging in the vertical (90°) plane with posterior structures and then rotate the probe anteriorly. The most posterior structure is the coronary sinus and left lower pulmonary vein  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68047" href="/z/d/graphic/68047.html" rel="external">image 7</a>).

Anterior rotation of the probe at this crystal position also results in a favorable orientation for assessment of the tricuspid valve, right atrial appendage, and interatrial septum. Assessment of atrial septal defects or aneurysms, as well as right atrial appendage thrombi, is readily performed. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1418.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of atrial septal defects in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Returning to the vertical (90°) orientation, further rotation of the probe anteriorly allows for imaging of the pulmonic valve and main pulmonary artery  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57980" href="/z/d/graphic/57980.html" rel="external">image 9</a>).

Continuous-wave Doppler may allow for velocity assessment of the tricuspid regurgitation jet from this orientation.</p><p>With further anterior rotation, the superior vena cava, right atrial appendage, body of the right atrium, interatrial septum, and inferior vena cava and Eustachian valve may be seen (the bicaval view)  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71051" href="/z/d/graphic/71051.html" rel="external">image 10</a>). Color flow Doppler evaluation of the interatrial septum and/or the injection of agitated <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9929" href="/z/d/drug information/9929.html" rel="external">saline</a> contrast may allow for identification of an atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale in this orientation, or such examination may be performed in the 135° orientation previously described.

Particular diligence is required during probe advancement in patients with a large hiatus hernia to avoid curling of the transducer tip in the distal esophagus. Increased depth penetration is often needed and we customarily change to a lower imaging frequency upon entering the stomach. Anteflexion of the probe permits imaging of the left ventricle in a short axis view at the level of the mitral valve and papillary muscles  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73013" href="/z/d/graphic/73013.html" rel="external">image 13</a>). The imaging transducer is then rotated to the vertical (90°) imaging plane to allow for visualization of the inferior and anterior left ventricular walls, mitral leaflets and left atrium  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73013" href="/z/d/graphic/73013.html" rel="external">image 13</a>). Slight anterior rotation of the probe will allow for visualization of the LVOT and aortic valve. This view may be especially helpful for Doppler assessment for aortic valve or LVOT gradients.</p><p>Further anterior rotation of the probe and rotation of the multiplane imaging transducer to 100 to 120° imaging plane allows for imaging of the right atrium, tricuspid valve, right ventricle, and right ventricular outflow tract  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61239" href="/z/d/graphic/61239.html" rel="external">image 14</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H20"><span class="h2">Gastric imaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Advancement of the probe to a length of 42 to 45 cm from the incisors into the fundus of the stomach with maximum anteflexion results in an "apical four or five chamber" equivalent view of the heart  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62623" href="/z/d/graphic/62623.html" rel="external">image 15</a>).

The probe is then gently retracted during continuous imaging of the descending aorta. Annotations may be made on the screen as to the distance from the incisors at 2 to 3 cm intervals or the specific level of any abnormalities.</p><p>Transducer rotation to the vertical (90°) imaging plane allows for longitudinal imaging of the descending thoracic aorta. Color flow Doppler confirms the direction of blood flow  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79300" href="/z/d/graphic/79300.html" rel="external">image 16</a>). Further retraction is made with imaging in the horizontal (0°) imaging plane.</p><p>As the probe is withdrawn into the proximal esophagus (28 cm from the incisors), the transverse aorta may be seen as the aortic lumen appears to elongate  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54091" href="/z/d/graphic/54091.html" rel="external">image 17</a>). The probe is then gently retracted with slight flexion and anterior rotation to view the ascending aorta. Color flow Doppler demonstrates normal aortic flow and, in some cases, flow within the superior vena cava may be seen. Transducer rotation into the vertical (90°) plane at this level may allow for imaging of the pulmonary valve and main pulmonary artery  (<a class="graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80660" href="/z/d/graphic/80660.html" rel="external">image 18</a>).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H283547770"><span class="h2">Three-dimensional imaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Three-dimensional echocardiographic imaging is a useful adjunct for the assessment of ventricular volumes and ejection fraction, evaluation of valvular and other structural cardiac abnormalities, and for guidance of transcatheter structural interventions [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].

Careful consideration of the risks and benefits of TEE as well as available alternative imaging should be made when patients are suspected or known to have active COVID infection. Appropriate airborne precaution personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers during performance of TEE in patients with suspected or known COVID-19 or other airborne infection includes use of fit-tested N95 or other respirators (eg, a powered air-purifying respirator), eye protection (such as a disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face), gloves, and a gown. Operating room cap and shoe covers should be worn when the TEE is performed in the operating room setting. While the American Society of Echocardiography recommends a minimum of droplet precaution level PPE (surgical or N95 mask, eye protection, gloves, gown) for performance of TEE in patients without COVID infection [<a href="#rid32">32</a>], some experts recommend the use of airborne precautions regardless of patient COVID status when performing aerosol generating procedures during the COVID pandemic. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/127501.html" rel="external">"COVID-19: Infection prevention for persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection", section on 'Aerosol-generating procedures/treatments'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to PPE for caregivers, special attention should be paid to TEE-related equipment to minimize the risk of transmission. Following the procedure, all equipment should be thoroughly wiped down according to local infection control protocols. Sufficient time should be allotted between TEE studies to allow adequate air exchange in the procedure room between cases [<a href="#rid33">33</a>]. Use of high-efficiency particular air (HEPA) filter or other airflow management systems should be considered to reduce the time required to achieve adequate airflow exchange in the room. In COVID-19-positive or suspected-positive patients, in an effort to minimize risk of transmission to the provider, some centers utilize probe covers that are external to the patient so that the operator is not in direct contact with the contaminated probe [<a href="#rid34">34,35</a>].</p><p>During TEE in COVID-19-positive or suspected-positive patients, the risk of viral aerosolization may be higher for nonintubated patients due to the potential for coughing.

Because of its moderately invasive nature, however, TEE is generally reserved for selected indications in which the potential benefits of making a diagnosis outweigh the risks associated with the procedure. For many indications, a TTE study is performed first as it may obviate the need for TEE and/or help to guide the TEE.

However, TEE should be performed as the initial test in certain life-threatening situations or in situations where TTE is likely to be nondiagnostic, including (see <a class="local">'Indications for TEE'</a> above):</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Suspected acute aortic pathology (ie, dissection, transsection, intramural hematoma).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Suspected prosthetic valve dysfunction.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Suspected complications of endocarditis (eg, fistula, abscess).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Evaluation for left atrial/left atrial appendage thrombus in a patient with atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter to facilitate clinical decision-making regarding anticoagulation, cardioversion, or ablation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Evaluation of source of embolism in a young patient for whom a TEE would be performed if the TTE was normal.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>There are few absolute contraindications to TEE examination (eg, significant esophageal pathology or perforated viscus). However, patients with altered mental status, tenuous cardiorespiratory status, recent or active esophageal tear or hemorrhage, coagulopathies, thrombocytopenia, esophageal stricture, Zenker diverticulum, or severe cervical spine arthritis with reduced range of motion are at increased risk of TEE complications.
