PCT is a cutaneous porphyria caused by deficient activity of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) in the liver. Hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP) is an extremely rare condition caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the <em>UROD</em> gene. </p><p>This topic discusses the management and prognosis of PCT and HEP. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic evaluation are presented separately.

(See <a class="local">'Indications for treatment'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Individuals with subclinical PCT (porphyrin elevations that are diagnostic for PCT but without skin manifestations) may be treated or monitored and advised to avoid modifiable susceptibility factors. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7108.html" rel="external">"Porphyria cutanea tarda and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Susceptibility factors'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Primary therapies</strong> – The preferred initial treatment for PCT associated with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is treatment with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy.

Evaluation of iron status is important in determining which of these therapies to pursue.

(See <a class="local">'Sunlight avoidance until porphyrins normalize'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Susceptibility factors</strong> – Individual PCT patients have different combinations of overt or underlying susceptibility factors that may influence choice of treatment [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Modifiable factors include smoking, alcohol and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic HCV infection, HIV infection, estrogens, and iron supplements. Genetic susceptibility factors may include heterozygosity for a pathogenic variant in <em>UROD</em> (found in approximately 20 percent of patients) and the <em>HFE</em> C282Y variant. (See <a class="local">'Postdiagnostic testing'</a> below and <a class="local">'Counseling regarding susceptibility factors'</a> below and <a class="local">'Treatment for HCV infection'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Monitoring </strong>– After treatment and disease remission, plasma or urine porphyrin levels can be monitored.

Most type 2 patients present sporadically (with no family history of PCT). Type 3 refers to patients with relatives with PCT but without<em> a UROD</em> mutation; some may ha<em>ve HFE</em> mutations.

The following laboratory testing is indicated:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Complete blood count (CBC) including platelet count</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Serum ferritin</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Serum chemistries and creatinine</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Liver function tests</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Bilirubin</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Alkaline phosphatase</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST])</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Albumin</p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Prothrombin time</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/89950.html" rel="external">"Screening and diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C virus infection"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>HIV testing – (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3736.html" rel="external">"Screening and diagnostic testing for HIV infection"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><em>UROD</em> genetic testing is part of determining the multiple susceptibility factors that differ among individual patients. Patients who are heterozygous for a <em>UROD</em> mutation are classified as having type 2 (familial) PCT [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Erythrocyte UROD activity is expected to be half-normal in such individuals with PCT who may experience disease onset at an earlier age and have fewer additional susceptibility factors. Patients with HEP have biallelic <em>UROD</em> variants and erythrocyte UROD activity is more markedly decreased (typically, &lt;20 percent of normal). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7108.html" rel="external">"Porphyria cutanea tarda and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Disease classification'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7108.html" rel="external">"Porphyria cutanea tarda and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'Significance of pathogenic variants in the UROD gene'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><em>HFE </em>genetic testing – Onset of PCT may be earlier in patients with biallelic <em>HFE</em> mutations and fewer additional susceptibility factors may be present.

Therefore, imaging to assess for underlying advanced liver disease is important for all patients with PCT. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3625.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in adults", section on 'Radiographic examinations'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3617.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of alcohol-associated fatty liver disease and cirrhosis", section on 'Imaging studies'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>HCC surveillance</strong> – Surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is appropriate for any patient with evidence of advanced hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis after treatment of PCT.

This pattern of increased porphyrins is not completely specific for PCT, and other porphyrias such as variegate porphyria (VP) should be considered [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Longitudinal observations to determine how many of individuals found to have subclinical PCT will develop overt PCT without treatment are lacking. However, susceptibility factors should be identified and reduced when possible, and porphyrin levels monitored at intervals of three to six months to determine if further increases or decreases are occurring. Patients previously treated for active PCT who have recurrent elevations in porphyrins may be retreated before skin lesions reappear. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Heterozygosity for </strong><strong><em>UROD </em></strong><strong>pathogenic variant without porphyrin elevation </strong>– Individuals identified as heterozygous for a pathogenic variant in <em>UROD </em>who lack porphyrin elevations can be counseled to avoid factors associated with overt PCT and their porphyrin levels monitored perhaps yearly, but these individuals do not require primary therapy. This applies to individuals who have genetic testing for any reason (first-degree relative identified with PCT and a <em>UROD</em> pathogenic variant, secondary finding from genetic testing done for another reason) (see <a class="local">'Considerations for relatives'</a> below). However, longitudinal observations of such individuals are lacking.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4120310054"><span class="h2">Choice of primary therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The following considerations influence the choice of primary therapy  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef141254" href="/z/d/graphic/141254.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>HCV status</strong> – For individuals with chronic HCV infection, growing experience suggests that DAA treatment is effective primary therapy for PCT and is the treatment of choice rather than phlebotomy or low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8541" href="/z/d/drug information/8541.html" rel="external">hydroxychloroquine</a> [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. (See <a class="local">'Treatment for HCV infection'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If there is substantial iron overload, therapeutic phlebotomies can also be started concurrently or (preferably) after cure of HCV infection. Because inflammation in the liver due to HCV can contribute to ferritin elevation by inducing an acute phase response, the degree of iron overload can be more meaningfully assessed after successful antiviral therapy. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Institutional preference</strong> – Phlebotomy is preferred at most centers for treatment of PCT not associated with chronic HCV, based on greater experience. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Iron status</strong> – Phlebotomy is also attractive because PCT is an iron-related disease.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Iron overload or homozygous</strong><strong><em> HFE</em></strong><strong> C282Y or H63D</strong> – For individuals with iron overload, phlebotomy is clearly preferred because it treats PCT and prevents organ injury from excess iron.

However, phlebotomy may be expensive, inconvenient, and uncomfortable, and may cause syncope or anemia in some patients. As a result, compliance with phlebotomy can be challenging [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent3"><span class="glyph">-</span>Advantages of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8541" href="/z/d/drug information/8541.html" rel="external">hydroxychloroquine</a> include greater ease of use and lower cost.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Pregnancy</strong> – Experience with treatment of PCT during pregnancy is lacking. However, low-dose <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8541" href="/z/d/drug information/8541.html" rel="external">hydroxychloroquine</a> for treatment of any condition is contraindicated during pregnancy.

PCT is very rare in children and when present in a child is usually associated with familial (type 2) disease. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">When possible, before testing relatives, genetic testing of the <em>UROD</em> and <em>HFE</em> genes should be performed on the index patient first. Relatives do not require testing if no disease variants are identified in the index patient. Testing the index patient first is also important so that if a genetic component exists, relatives can be tested for the correct gene and the correct variant in that gene.

In a study that measured porphyrin levels in 16 unaffected relatives of patients with PCT who carried the familial <em>UROD</em> variant, six (38 percent) had increased urinary porphyrins [<a href="#rid57">57</a>]. </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The likelihood of developing symptomatic disease and the benefit of treating asymptomatic carriers with elevated porphyrin levels is unknown, but primary therapy is unlikely to be needed.

(See <a class="local">'Counseling regarding susceptibility factors'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">If the index patient has tested positive for <em>HFE</em> C282Y or another gene variant associated with iron overload, relatives can be counseled regarding the inheritance, advantages and disadvantages of testing, optimal age for testing, and clinical implications.

Avoid in individuals who are pregnant, lactating, use alcohol or hepatotoxic medications, or have advanced liver or kidney disease, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, psoriasis, or retinal disease (unless cleared by an ophthalmologist).
