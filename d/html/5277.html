Some symptoms such as aphasia or encephalopathy clearly indicate a CNS source. However, the distinction may be more difficult for other presentations, such as numbness or weakness in the lower extremities. In these instances, both CNS and PNS disorders must be considered.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1401172412"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>It is important to ask the patient detailed questions about pain, location of symptoms, the time course of illness, and features that may localize symptoms to the CNS. Both CNS and PNS disorders can be present simultaneously; in such a situation, even detailed questioning of a patient may not identify the source.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H585731820"><span class="h3">Location of symptoms</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The distribution of symptoms on the body may be used to differentiate CNS from PNS pathology. Signs or symptoms affecting the face, arm, and leg on one side of the body (eg, hemiparesis, hemisensory deficit) almost always indicate CNS pathology. Rarely, patients with PNS disease will report symptoms in the arm and leg on one side. In such cases, the condition may be generalized, but the patient may only be aware of deficits on the most severely affected side. Generally, weakness or sensory loss confined to one limb suggests a peripheral nerve source.</p><p>Localization is less clear when weakness or sensory loss is bilateral or when the symptoms are painless. For example, a patient who presents with painless sensory loss and numbness in the feet may have a polyneuropathy or a spinal cord lesion. Complaints of poor coordination or unsteady gait can be due to either primarily central or peripheral dysfunction. Bilateral leg weakness can be either central or peripheral.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2113472312"><span class="h3">Time course</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Abrupt onset of symptoms (seconds) almost always indicates CNS pathology (eg, stroke, seizure) with the exception of diplopia, which may indicate CNS or PNS pathology. Acute onset of weakness or sensory loss in an awake, alert patient who is not performing an activity or maintaining an unusual posture is likely to be central in origin, while symptoms that come on after maintaining one position for a prolonged time are probably peripheral in origin. Examples of the latter include hand paresthesias while driving in a patient with carpal tunnel syndrome and penile numbness after prolonged bicycling (secondary to compression of the pudendal nerve in the perineum). Disorders that develop over days or weeks and those with onset during sleep may be more difficult to classify.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H657965244"><span class="h3">Pain</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Extremity pain in addition to neurologic complaints is suggestive of a peripheral nervous system process. However, some CNS disorders can be accompanied by pain.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Many patients develop a chronic pain syndrome several months to years after spinal cord injury. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4839.html" rel="external">"Chronic complications of spinal cord injury and disease", section on 'Pain syndromes'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with stroke can also experience pain, particularly if the stroke was localized to the brainstem, thalamus, or parietal cortex. In most cases, the pain affects the upper and lower extremities on one side. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3324.html" rel="external">"Central neuropathic facial pain", section on 'Central poststroke pain'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/131658.html" rel="external">"Neuropalliative care of stroke", section on 'Pain'</a>.)</p><p></p><p>Pain often originates from outside the nervous system, for example due to an arthritic joint. These patients may also complain of weakness secondary to the pain induced by movement of the joint or limb.</p><p>Pain that is position-dependent or brought on with activity (such as calf or thigh pain with walking in patients with spinal stenosis) is more likely of peripheral than central origin. In addition, pain that radiates into a very discrete area is unlikely to be central. However, random or diurnal fluctuations in pain are common in many peripheral and central disorders and may not help with localization.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1194037080"><span class="h3">Features suggestive of central nervous system disease</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Symptoms such as impaired consciousness, cognitive difficulties, language disturbance, behavior change, or difficulty completing complex motor tasks point to CNS pathology. Neurologic symptoms with associated nausea, vomiting, or headaches also suggest CNS disease.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1616251578"><span class="h2">Neurologic examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The neurologic examination plays an important role in differentiating central and peripheral nervous system disease [<a href="#rid1">1,2</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3255920731"><span class="h3">Cranial nerves</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many generalized neuromuscular diseases affect the cranial nerves to some extent. Mild degrees of facial or bulbar weakness can be present in myopathies and neuromuscular junction disorders. Similar findings, including eye movement abnormalities, can be identified in patients with polyradiculoneuropathies such as in Miller-Fisher syndrome, a variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5137.html" rel="external">"Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Cranial nerve signs are often subtle (especially when symmetric) and may manifest mainly as overactivation of the frontalis muscle, mild ptosis, or subtle eye movement abnormalities or nasality to the voice. Bilateral facial weakness can escape notice. Clues include incomplete eye closure and a smooth uncreased face. Examination of the tongue for atrophy and fasciculations is also important, especially when considering the diagnosis of motor neuron disease.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2187937156"><span class="h3">Reflexes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Examination of the deep tendon reflexes is perhaps the single most important test in determining whether a condition is peripheral or central. Brisk reflexes, especially if associated with a "pathologic" sign, such as the Babinski reflex or Hoffman sign, indicate central pathology.</p><p>The Brissaud reflex is useful when the great toe is absent or is paralyzed by polyneuropathy. In this sign, stroking the sole of the foot elicits contraction of the tensor facia lata at the hip. A positive Brissaud sign indicates upper motor neuron pathology, analogous to the Babinski sign. </p><p>Hyporeflexia or areflexia points to a peripheral source. However, in rapidly evolving CNS conditions, such as spinal cord compression or infarction, reflexes can initially be absent due to spinal shock. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4819.html" rel="external">"Acute traumatic spinal cord injury", section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3192319062"><span class="h3">Motor examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Observation of the muscles may yield useful information before examining strength. Atrophy of muscles isolated to a specific root(s) or peripheral nerve places the etiology in the peripheral nervous system. Mild disuse atrophy occurs in patients with motor lesions of the CNS, but severe reduction in muscle bulk is not typically observed with central lesions alone. Fasciculations suggest a peripheral process.</p><p>Increased tone on passive movement of the extremities suggests a CNS process. Side-to-side comparison is helpful in distinguishing subtle abnormalities. Normal or decreased tone is found in most peripheral processes.</p><p>Weakness caused by upper motor neuron (CNS) etiologies generally follows a specific pattern. For example, in patients with weakness due to stroke, the extensor muscles in the arm (deltoid, triceps, wrist, and finger extensors) and flexor muscles in the leg (iliopsoas, hamstrings, and foot dorsiflexors) are weakest. Hemiplegia is straightforward to localize, but a patient with an incomplete spinal cord lesion who has only unilateral lower extremity weakness may prove a greater diagnostic challenge.</p><p>Weakness caused by radiculopathy, plexopathy, or nerve entrapments is usually restricted to only a specific group of muscles. Rarely, however, a patient with a stroke may present with relatively isolated weakness, perhaps just of the hand.</p><p>Peripheral symptoms that cause generalized weakness often affect the neck extensor muscles prominently and may lead to a "dropped head syndrome". As examples, myasthenia gravis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome can all produce marked neck extensor weakness. This pattern is very atypical in most central disorders.</p><p>Symmetric generalized weakness is more likely peripheral than central and may suggest myopathy or diffuse polyneuropathy, although cervical myelopathy or brainstem lesions can also cause generalized weakness. Symmetric proximal weakness involving both the arms and legs is usually associated with myopathy, demyelinating polyneuropathy, or neuromuscular junction disease and is unlikely to be central in etiology.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2116947153"><span class="h3">Sensory examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Sensory loss that follows a specific nerve or root territory and can be brought on by position changes is suggestive of a peripheral process. Examples include numbness in the fingers with wrist flexion (Phalen maneuver) in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome or sensory loss over the lateral thigh with prolonged standing in patients with meralgia paresthetica.</p><p>Determining which sensory modalities are most affected is useful. A peripheral source is more likely when all modalities are affected to some extent, although peripheral processes may also present with predominant loss of only one or two modalities (eg, reduced pain and temperature sensation in patients with a polyneuropathy affecting small unmyelinated fibers). Some central processes, such as syringomyelia, also may present with one or two modalities affected, such as reduced pain and temperature sensation and preserved light touch in the arm.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2112161530"><span class="h3">Coordination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Abnormal coordination without associated weakness or sensory loss suggests a central source. A central process should also be considered if coordination is affected out of proportion to weakness or sensory deficits. However, some patients with weakness or sensory loss due to peripheral nerve disease may have a considerable degree of incoordination.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3229559170"><span class="h3">Gait</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Many central disorders are accompanied by changes in gait, such as the festinating gait of a patient with Parkinson disease, the hemiplegic gait of a patient with a stroke, or the "frontal" gait in a patient with normal pressure hydrocephalus. Gait disorders are often idiopathic or multifactorial in origin, especially in older adults. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4910.html" rel="external">"Approach to abnormal gait in adults"</a>.)</p><p>Peripheral disorders also occasionally have stereotypical gait abnormalities. A steppage gait, where the patient needs to lift the knees up high to overcome weakness in foot dorsiflexors, can be seen in patients with polyneuropathy such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. A waddling gait is characteristic of patients with proximal muscle weakness, as with myopathy. An antalgic gait occurs when posture and walking are altered in order to avoid or reduce pain. It arises from musculoskeletal rather than neurologic problems.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1986819968"><span class="h2">Other important distinctions</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A number of situations may present diagnostic dilemmas.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bilateral numbness and tingling in the feet are suggestive of a polyneuropathy, but other causes are also possible. Lumbosacral polyradiculopathy (eg, from lumbar stenosis) commonly presents with predominant distal sensory symptoms with little back or radiating pain or discomfort. Bilateral compression neuropathies (eg, bilateral peroneal or tibial neuropathies) occasionally affect the legs and need to be considered. Spinal cord conditions, including degenerative disease or myelitis, can also present with predominantly distal lower extremity symptoms. Determining whether the symptoms are due to a central (eg, spinal cord) versus a peripheral process can usually be accomplished by neurologic examination. Hyperreflexia and increased tone suggest a central process, whereas reduced reflexes and normal tone suggest a peripheral process. Symmetric involvement (by history and examination) suggests polyneuropathy, while asymmetric findings generally suggest compression neuropathies or polyradiculopathy.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Acute onset of painless unilateral hand and finger extension weakness is suggestive of an upper motor neuron condition, although an acute radial neuropathy can produce identical signs. In radial neuropathy, however, the brachioradialis usually is also weak, as a muscle not typically affected in central processes such as a stroke. Thus, examining the strength of this muscle (and its bulk during contraction compared with the normal side) can help make the distinction between these two entities. The brachioradialis flexes the elbow with the hand midway between pronation and supination, and during contraction it can be palpated radially in the proximal forearm.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Urgency and incontinence usually suggest upper motor neuron dysfunction. Patients with bladder difficulties from lower motor neuron symptoms typically present with weak streams and overflow incontinence. Distinguishing between these complaints can be challenging since many patients simply note an increased frequency of urination. Urodynamic studies may be useful when bladder difficulties are the predominant complaint. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/6874.html" rel="external">"Female urinary incontinence: Evaluation"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Fatigue is a nonspecific complaint that may be hard to sort out. It is important to clarify what the patient means by fatigue, as many individuals use fatigue as a synonym for "weakness" or "sleepy."</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Generalized fatigue is usually not a symptom of peripheral nervous system disease, although it may be a sequela of polio (ie, post-polio syndrome) and Guillain-Barré syndrome [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. The mechanism for fatigue in these disorders is uncertain.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Weakness, not fatigue per se, tends to be the hallmark of most neuromuscular junction and muscle diseases. For example, patients with myasthenia report double vision or head drop at the end of the day.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Many patients with CNS demyelination, as in multiple sclerosis, complain of fatigue.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients experiencing depression commonly report fatigue related to impaired sleep or anhedonia.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients with preexisting moderate or severe peripheral nervous system disease, a superimposed central process can be very difficult to identify. As an example, a patient with diabetes mellitus and polyneuropathy who presents with progressive leg weakness, fever, and absent reflexes in the lower extremities may lead a clinician to suspect an acute polyneuropathy. However, these symptoms may also be due to a thoracic epidural abscess. A Babinski sign was absent due to atrophy of leg muscles and loss of sensory nerve fibers from chronic diabetic polyneuropathy. As a general principle, though, if the effector organs are not working normally, a central process cannot be excluded by examination.</p><p></p><p>Even the most experienced neurologist may have difficulty correctly identifying symptoms as peripheral or central. In most acute situations, it is more important to exclude a possible central process since substantial neurologic recovery in the CNS is unlikely. As an example, excluding stroke should be prioritized above eliminating a radial neuropathy in patients with acute hand weakness.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">CLINICAL DISTINCTION AMONG NERVE, MUSCLE, AND NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION DISEASE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with symptoms that localize to the peripheral nervous system (PNS), differentiating among disorders of the peripheral nerve, muscle, or neuromuscular junction can often be made from the clinical setting. As examples:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The diagnosis of diabetic polyneuropathy in a patient with long-standing diabetes mellitus who presents with classic "stocking-glove" sensory loss is relatively straightforward. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5272.html" rel="external">"Screening for diabetic polyneuropathy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In patients taking drugs that can interfere with muscle function (eg, antimalarial, glucocorticoid, or cholesterol-lowering medications), proximal weakness may indicate a myopathy. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5171.html" rel="external">"Glucocorticoid-induced myopathy"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5166.html" rel="external">"Drug-induced myopathies"</a>.)</p><p></p><p>However, patients with disorders of nerves, muscle, or the neuromuscular junction can present with a similar constellation of symptoms. In addition, even when the process is localized to the nerve, it is not always clear if the origin is in the central or peripheral nervous system.</p><p>Diseases of the nerve (eg, polyneuropathy), muscle (eg, myopathy), and neuromuscular junction (eg, myasthenia gravis) may present with varying degrees of sensory loss, weakness, and pain. Nevertheless, specific patterns of the sensory and motor disturbance may help differentiate among these disorders.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">History</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Focal sensory loss in the absence of a known central nervous system (CNS) lesion suggests a peripheral lesion occurring somewhere along the length of the nerve between the nerve root and the most distal fibers. Identifying the distribution of sensory loss is paramount and is discussed in further detail below. The loss of certain modalities (eg, vibration or sharp/dull discrimination) may also help identify the source.</p><p>Weakness can arise from dysfunction of motor neuron, nerve, neuromuscular junction, or muscle. Weakness tends to be a difficult symptom for patients to quantify and localize. Frequently patients will complain of pain and associated weakness. However, since pain may limit the action and mobility of a joint, the finding of weakness in the setting of pain may not indicate true neurologic dysfunction. Patients who complain of painless weakness generally have significant abnormalities on examination. Similar to sensory loss, the distribution of weakness is extremely important. (See <a class="local">'Motor'</a> below.)</p><p>Cranial nerve complaints can be very useful in localizing symptoms. In the absence of CNS disease, diplopia is likely secondary to a neuromuscular junction defect. Progressive dysarthria or dysphagia without associated eye symptoms suggests motor neuron disease (eg, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Less frequently, myopathies or acute motor polyneuropathies (such as the Miller-Fisher variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome) can present with dysarthria and eye movement abnormalities. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5172.html" rel="external">"Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults: Treatment and prognosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4"><span class="h2">Neurologic examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The neurologic examination should focus upon the distribution of muscle weakness and sensory loss and the deep tendon reflexes.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H5"><span class="h3">Motor</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The distribution of muscle weakness is an important distinguishing feature. Proximal weakness is most consistent with a myopathy or neuromuscular junction disorder. Weakness in these individuals is usually symmetric, with involvement of head extensors and flexors, although mild asymmetries are not unusual. However, some patients with myasthenia may present with or develop predominately distal weakness. Repetitive movements may increase the weakness in myasthenia gravis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5170.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis"</a>.)</p><p>If the weakness involves predominantly only one extremity, it is useful to determine if the lesion is in the distribution of a single root, a region of the plexus, or a single nerve territory; this requires a detailed knowledge of the anatomy. The examination can be confounded if multiple lesions are superimposed in a single limb (eg, a simultaneous radiculopathy plus a focal mononeuropathy, or multiple mononeuropathies).</p><p>Observation of the muscles themselves is often helpful. Important features include the presence of fasciculations, whether the muscle produces a painful cramp after activation, and the presence of atrophy. Such findings may occur in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5156.html" rel="external">"Epidemiology and pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6"><span class="h3">Sensory</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Root lesions may cause sensory loss in a dermatomal pattern  (<a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53006" href="/d/graphic/53006.html" rel="external">figure 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81709" href="/d/graphic/81709.html" rel="external">figure 2</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50419" href="/d/graphic/50419.html" rel="external">figure 3</a>), though the overlap of dermatomal territories usually precludes mapping the area of numbness by examination. By contrast, sensory loss due to single nerve lesion can often be mapped with pin or touch on examination. Numbness in a single nerve territory might suggest an entrapment neuropathy.</p><p>Multiple areas of numbness in different extremities point to a mononeuropathy multiplex. In axonal polyneuropathies, "glove and stocking" sensory loss is most prominent, initially affecting the feet and later the hands.

Globally depressed or absent reflexes are frequently associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5172.html" rel="external">"Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults: Treatment and prognosis"</a>). Reflexes are generally preserved in muscle disease unless it is severe. Neuromuscular junction disorders do not follow a clear pattern: in myasthenia gravis, reflexes are generally normal; in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, reflexes are reduced or absent. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5170.html" rel="external">"Clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H8"><span class="h3">Additional signs</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bulbar and ocular signs suggest CNS disease but, if fluctuating or slowly progressive, may point to a neuromuscular condition. Patients with myasthenia gravis, if presenting with limb weakness, will usually have a degree of diplopia and fatigable ptosis on examination of the extraocular muscles. Atrophy and fasciculations of the tongue may suggest amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</p><p>Checking the Tinel test, that is, tapping over a nerve to test for reproduction of pain and paresthesia  (<a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58010" href="/d/graphic/58010.html" rel="external">picture 1</a>), might be helpful. A patient with intermittent numbness of the leg and a markedly positive Tinel sign over the fibular neck may have a peroneal neuropathy. However, the sensitivity and specificity of this test is generally low (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5288.html" rel="external">"Carpal tunnel syndrome: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis", section on 'Provocative maneuvers'</a>). Multiple Tinel signs can be present in patients with polyneuropathy; in one study, the sensitivity and specificity of this finding was 79 and 42 percent, respectively [<a href="#rid4">4</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H9"><span class="h2">Skin examination</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Skin findings may be subtle but can help identify the source.

Unusual color changes with pain can point to complex regional pain syndrome accompanying a peripheral nerve lesion.

Myopathic processes are usually painless, including polymyositis, dermatomyositis, toxic myopathies, and inclusion body myositis. Generally, muscle pain is confined to patients with acute rhabdomyolysis, a few metabolic myopathies (such as McArdle disease), and myopathies associated with connective tissue disease (the pain perhaps secondary to joint involvement rather than muscle involvement itself).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Myopathies may be superimposed upon polyneuropathies. As an example, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9293" href="/d/drug information/9293.html" rel="external">colchicine</a> can produce a severe myopathy, usually associated with a polyneuropathy. Patients with connective tissue diseases may also have both polyneuropathy and myopathy. In a critically ill patient who develops flaccid generalized weakness, the major considerations in the differential diagnosis are critical illness myopathy and critical illness polyneuropathy or very often a combination of the two.

It is often worth performing these tests prior to ordering additional blood tests. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/5145.html" rel="external">"Overview of electromyography"</a>.)</p><p>Electrodiagnostic studies are tailored for patients individually; the clinician should carefully consider what they are looking for when referring a patient for these tests. The electromyographer should be given some background information, although too much data (eg, results of radiologic studies) may bias the examiner. Similarly, the referring clinician should avoid narrowing the question too much; in a patient with proximal arm pain and hand numbness, asking to rule out only carpal tunnel syndrome may cause the electromyographer to miss a plexopathy or radiculopathy. The electromyographer typically performs a brief history and physical examination, which can help tailor the study. Referral to a neurologist or neuromuscular specialist before performing EMG/NCS is useful in particularly complex or confusing cases.</p><p>NCS and EMG can identify a wide variety of neuromuscular conditions quickly and can also provide useful information about severity and prognosis. Conditions commonly diagnosed by NCS and EMG include focal neuropathies, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, ulnar neuropathy at the elbow or wrist, and peroneal neuropathy at the knee. Cervical or lumbar radiculopathies are a common electrodiagnostic finding and EMG can be very useful to differentiate root impingement from orthopedic conditions such as rotator cuff or hip pathology that can mimic root disease. NCS/EMG can identify polyneuropathies affecting large, myelinated fibers. NCS are used to support the diagnosis of Guillain-Barre’s syndrome and CIDP, and EMG is critical to the diagnosis of ALS. Repetitive stimulation studies and single-fiber EMG have great value in diagnosing neuromuscular junction disorders. EMG is also useful in the setting of muscle diseases, such as acute inflammatory myopathy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H26"><span class="h3">Limitations</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Superimposed processes may make interpretation of the EMG/NCS difficult. As an example, underlying diabetic neuropathy can complicate the diagnosis in a patient with radiculopathy.</p><p>Many technical factors also play a role in the accuracy and interpretability of a study.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Conduction velocity will slow and response amplitude will increase if the patient's limbs are cool. Thus, a patient may be inadvertently diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome or polyneuropathy if the hand is cool.

Nevertheless, EMG of the paraspinal and certain deep other muscles is usually not performed in these individuals, to avoid the possibility of hematoma formation. This can also limit interpretation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Routine NCS are safe in patients with pacemakers, although high-intensity proximal stimulation of nerves (for example, at Erb's point in the shoulder or stimulation at the root level) is avoided.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>EMG/NCS can only evaluate large, myelinated neurons. Only a few nerves in the arms (median, radial, and ulnar) and legs (posterior tibial, deep peroneal, and sural) are routinely studied. These nerves are easily accessible to stimulation and are frequently involved in neurogenic illness. However, many diseases, especially those that are painful, affect smaller myelinated or unmyelinated nerve fibers, and EMG/NCS may therefore be entirely normal. Thus, the absence of electrophysiologic evidence for a polyneuropathy does <strong>not</strong> mean that one does not exist.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>EMG/NCS is an uncomfortable test; occasionally, patients are unable to complete a study. The electromyographer must make choices between one test and another to avoid excessive procedures. In addition, evaluation of motor units may be difficult if patients are not able to provide good effort (activation) on the EMG portion of the study. Explaining the procedure ahead of time may avoid some of these difficulties.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Electromyographers may have very limited training or may perform studies infrequently, which can lead to incorrect diagnoses.
