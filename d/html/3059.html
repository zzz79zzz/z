Immunosuppressive therapy is used to treat active focal (class III) or diffuse (class IV) LN or lupus membranous nephropathy (class V LN), whereas it is <strong>not</strong> usually used to treat minimal mesangial (class I), mesangial proliferative (class II), or advanced sclerosing (class VI) LN.</p><p>The treatment of focal or diffuse LN has two main components: initial therapy with antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive agents to slow or halt kidney injury, followed by long-term subsequent immunosuppressive therapy to control the chronic autoimmune processes of systemic lupus erythematosus and to foster repair of damaged nephrons.</p><p>The initial and subsequent therapy of focal or diffuse LN will be reviewed here. Other aspects related to LN are discussed elsewhere:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3056.html" rel="external">"Lupus nephritis: Diagnosis and classification"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3092.html" rel="external">"Lupus nephritis: Treatment of focal or diffuse lupus nephritis resistant to initial therapy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3066.html" rel="external">"Kidney transplantation in adults: Issues related to lupus nephritis"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>(See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3093.html" rel="external">"Lupus nephritis: Therapy of lupus membranous nephropathy"</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2257394524"><span class="h1">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2375885571"><span class="h2">Goals of therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The goal of immunosuppressive therapy is resolution of inflammatory and immunologic activity, with achievement of a complete response.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2423442861"><span class="h2">Definitions of response</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There is no consensus definition of <strong>complete response</strong> in patients with focal or diffuse lupus nephritis (LN) who are treated with immunosuppressive therapy. Most definitions of complete response have incorporated the following elements:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>A substantial reduction in protein excretion</strong> – Clinical studies have used various definitions of a proteinuria response. The Lupus Nephritis Collaborative Study Group, for example, defined a complete proteinuria response as protein excretion ≤0.33 g/day [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Large randomized trials such as the Aspreva Lupus Management Study (ALMS), Lupus Nephritis Assessment with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">Rituximab</a> (LUNAR), and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8526" href="/z/d/drug information/8526.html" rel="external">Abatacept</a> and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">Cyclophosphamide</a> Combination Efficacy and Safety Study (ACCESS) trials defined a complete proteinuria response as ≤0.5 g/day [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>], whereas the Euro-Lupus Nephritis Trial (ELNT) used a definition of &lt;1.0 g/day [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Subsequent studies found that a proteinuria level of &lt;0.7 to 0.8 g/day at month 12 after initiation of initial therapy was the best predictor of a favorable long-term kidney outcome [<a href="#rid6">6-8</a>]. In light of these data, the <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16479" href="/z/d/drug information/16479.html" rel="external">Belimumab</a> International Study in Lupus Nephritis (BLISS-LN), which evaluated the addition of belimumab to standard therapy for initial therapy of LN, utilized a proteinuria level of ≤0.7 g/day as a component of the renal response primary efficacy endpoint [<a href="#rid9">9</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">The 2019 European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (formerly known as European League Against Rheumatism)/European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (EULAR/ERA-EDTA) guidelines recommend as goals of therapy a decrease in proteinuria of ≥25 percent by three months, ≥50 percent by six months, and proteinuria below 0.5 to 0.7 g/day by 12 months of initial therapy. Patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria at baseline may require an additional 6 to 12 months to reach <em>complete clinical response</em> [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Improvement or stabilization of the serum creatinine</strong> – Kidney function in patients with a complete clinical response has also been defined differently in different studies, including a normal serum creatinine [<a href="#rid2">2</a>], a serum creatinine &lt;1.2 mg/dL (106 micromol/L) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>], a serum creatinine ≤1.4 mg/dL (124 micromol/L) [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], or a serum creatinine within 15 to 25 percent of the baseline value [<a href="#rid3">3,4</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Improvement of the urinary sediment</strong> – Some but not all definitions of complete response in clinical studies have required an improvement in the urinary sediment. Several studies specified a reduction in the number of red blood cells (RBCs) to ≤10 high-power field or ≤5 RBC/high-power field [<a href="#rid1">1,4</a>], whereas others also required the absence of RBC casts [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. We believe that attaining an inactive urinary sediment (ie, no or rare dysmorphic RBCs and no RBC casts) is an essential component of a complete response. It is important to recognize that urinary RBCs are not always indicative of glomerular injury, because they can originate from multiple sources in the genitourinary tract.</p><p></p><p>A clinical "response" is not synonymous with histologic "remission." Only a repeat kidney biopsy demonstrating the absence of active inflammatory lesions can establish a complete remission. In some studies, repeat biopsies have demonstrated a discordance between clinical and histologic disease activity [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. Thus, some experts routinely perform repeat kidney biopsies in their patients treated for focal or diffuse LN (regardless of the clinical response to therapy). However, in common practice, most patients treated for focal or diffuse LN do not undergo repeat kidney biopsies to determine the histologic effects of therapy. Rather, patients are typically followed with clinical measures such as serum creatinine, urine protein excretion, and urine microscopy. These parameters are used to judge the clinical response to therapy. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring the response to therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Not all successfully treated patients who have a histologic remission have a complete clinical response. The reasons for this discordance are as follows:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Proteinuric chronic kidney disease can result from irreversible scarring despite resolution of inflammation.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hematuria may persist for various reasons (for example, cyclophosphamide-induced bladder injury).</p><p></p><p>As with complete renal response, there is no uniformly accepted definition of <strong>partial renal response</strong>. The definition of partial response is less stringent than that for complete response; most definitions require a reduction in proteinuria of &gt;50 percent from baseline and to less than 3.5 g/day.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H740454999"><span class="h2">Importance of prompt therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The likelihood of a successful initial outcome is greater if therapy for LN is initiated relatively early in the course of the disease. A single episode of LN can lead to irreversible nephron loss, and every subsequent LN flare contributes to organ damage. Early therapy is crucial to prevent subsequent decreases in kidney function [<a href="#rid11">11,14,15</a>]. Delaying therapy because of presumed mild disease can be associated with increased glomerular injury, progressive tubulointerstitial fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis, and therefore a lesser response to immunosuppressive drugs and a poorer long-term kidney outcome [<a href="#rid16">16-18</a>].</p><p>Patients with persistent, relapsing, or remitting mild hematuria and/or subnephrotic-range proteinuria often have a "smoldering" but active disease that causes progressive kidney injury [<a href="#rid19">19</a>]. At first, there may be little or no elevation in the serum creatinine since adaptive glomerular hyperfiltration in the less involved nephrons can initially maintain the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) despite marked nephron loss [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p>By contrast, prompt diagnosis after the onset of nephritis and subsequent initiation of appropriate therapy are associated with improved outcomes, regardless of the histologic subclass [<a href="#rid16">16,18</a>]. This issue was addressed in a study of 91 patients with LN who were followed for a median of six years [<a href="#rid18">18</a>]. There was a much higher rate of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) among patients who had clinically recognized kidney disease for greater than or equal to six months prior to biopsy (47 versus 14 per 1000 patient-years in patients who had an earlier biopsy; hazard ratio [HR] 9.3, 95% CI 1.8-47).</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H6724532"><span class="h1">APPROACH TO TREATMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Immunosuppressive therapy for focal (class III) or diffuse (class IV) lupus nephritis (LN) consists of initial and subsequent phases  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef132621" href="/z/d/graphic/132621.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Initial therapy involves the administration of potent antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs to achieve a clinical and immunologic renal response that will prevent progressive nephron loss and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). The duration of initial therapy varies; it can be as short as three months or as long as one year but averages approximately six months. (See <a class="local">'Initial therapy with mycophenolate or cyclophosphamide'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Once a renal response is achieved, less aggressive subsequent immunosuppressive therapy is given for a prolonged period to prevent relapse and continue to treat the systemic autoimmunity. (See <a class="local">'Subsequent therapy'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Some patients may also have evidence of lupus membranous nephropathy (class III + V or IV + V), but treatment is directed against the active class III or IV component of the disease. General supportive measures are also given to slow nonimmunologic progression of the kidney disease. (See <a class="local">'General supportive measures in all patients'</a> below.)</p><p>Our approach is in general agreement with the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines for glomerulonephritis, American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines for LN, and the joint European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology/European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (EULAR/ERA-EDTA) guidelines [<a href="#rid10">10,21-23</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H32623747"><span class="h2">Initial therapy with mycophenolate or cyclophosphamide</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients with diffuse or focal LN, we suggest initial therapy consisting of glucocorticoids in combination with either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9670" href="/z/d/drug information/9670.html" rel="external">mycophenolate</a> mofetil (MMF) or intravenous (IV) or oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a>. Reasonable alternatives for initial therapy include MMF in combination with either a calcineurin inhibitor (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="130589" href="/z/d/drug information/130589.html" rel="external">voclosporin</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9971" href="/z/d/drug information/9971.html" rel="external">tacrolimus</a>) or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16479" href="/z/d/drug information/16479.html" rel="external">belimumab</a>, or cyclophosphamide in combination with belimumab. We do not use <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> as initial therapy. (See <a class="local">'Combination regimens'</a> below.)</p><p>The efficacy of MMF and <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a> as initial therapy for focal or diffuse LN is supported by randomized trials that are discussed further below. Comparative trials have not established that one is superior to the other. MMF is preferred for patients with concerns about fertility since cyclophosphamide may adversely affect fertility (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7963.html" rel="external">"General principles of the use of cyclophosphamide in rheumatic diseases", section on 'Infertility risk'</a>). Conversely, IV cyclophosphamide may be preferred for patients with preexisting gastrointestinal conditions or who may have difficulty adhering to oral therapy.</p><p>Monotherapy with glucocorticoids is not appropriate. Prior to the introduction of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a> as a therapy for focal or diffuse LN, the majority of patients were treated with glucocorticoid monotherapy, but mortality rates with this approach were high [<a href="#rid24">24</a>]. IV cyclophosphamide in combination with glucocorticoids became standard-of-care therapy for inducing renal response based upon seminal trials performed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that found that combination therapy was superior to glucocorticoids alone in preventing ESKD [<a href="#rid25">25</a>]. These seminal trials are presented in the discussion on cyclophosphamide-based regimens below. (See <a class="local">'Cyclophosphamide-based regimen'</a> below.)</p><p>Subsequently, several trials supported the role of MMF as an effective alternative to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a> for initial therapy of patients with focal or diffuse LN:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>The largest trial (Aspreva Lupus Management Study [ALMS]) that compared initial therapy with MMF or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a> included 370 patients with classes III through V LN (68 percent with class IV). Patients were randomly assigned to MMF (target dose 3 g/day) or IV cyclophosphamide (0.5 to 1 g/m<sup>2</sup> in monthly pulses); all patients received daily glucocorticoids [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. The mean urine protein-to-creatinine ratio was 4.1, and the mean serum creatinine was 1.1 mg/dL (100 micromol/L). At 24 weeks, the renal response (defined as a prespecified reduction in the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio to less than 3 or by at least 50 percent and stabilization or improvement in the serum creatinine) was similar between the two groups (56 percent in the MMF group versus 53 percent in the cyclophosphamide group). Other outcomes, including complete renal response, systemic disease activity, and safety were also similar.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a 2018 meta-analysis which included eight randomized trials comparing IV <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a> with MMF for initial therapy in over 800 patients with focal or diffuse LN, the mortality rate, incidence of ESKD, and relapse during initial therapy were similar between the two groups [<a href="#rid26">26</a>]. MMF may have produced a higher rate of complete responses (risk ratio [RR] 1.17, 95% CI 0.97-1.42), but this was not statistically significant. Major infections were also similar with both drugs, but MMF therapy resulted in less alopecia.</p><p></p><p>While these data support the efficacy of MMF as an alternative to <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a> for initial therapy, longer-term outcome data are available for cyclophosphamide. However, the long-term efficacy of MMF is supported by data from trials evaluating its use for subsequent therapy. (See <a class="local">'Cyclophosphamide-based regimen'</a> below.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3594109834"><span class="h3">Mycophenolate-based regimen</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>If a mycophenolate-based regimen is selected, we prefer the regimen used in the ALMS trial [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Specifically, we give 0.5 g of MMF twice daily for the first week, then 1 g twice daily for the second week, and thereafter attempt to increase the dose to 1.5 g twice daily. However, this target dose may not be tolerated, and many patients may only tolerate a total daily dose of 2 to 2.5 g. For some patients who are unable to tolerate adequate doses of MMF due to gastrointestinal side effects (eg, nausea, abdominal pain, or diarrhea), enteric-coated <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9670" href="/z/d/drug information/9670.html" rel="external">mycophenolate</a> sodium (EC-MPS) can be substituted for MMF (1 g of MMF is equivalent to 720 mg of EC-MPS). We usually continue mycophenolate at these doses for six months.</p><p>We do not routinely obtain blood mycophenolic acid (MPA) levels to monitor therapy in patients with LN since there are no established thresholds for therapeutic efficacy.

In general, the treatment of patients with LN and concomitant TMA should include management of the underlying etiology of TMA as well as treatment of LN  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef132621" href="/z/d/graphic/132621.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>SLE-associated TTP (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/1344.html" rel="external">"Immune TTP: Initial treatment"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Complement-mediated TMA (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/114693.html" rel="external">"Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) with acute kidney injury (AKI) in adults: CM-TMA and ST-HUS"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome nephropathy (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/4682.html" rel="external">"Management of antiphospholipid syndrome"</a>)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1977570680"><span class="h1">PROGNOSIS</span></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2320912760"><span class="h2">Long-term outcomes</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A better long-term prognosis is associated with attaining complete response of active lupus nephritis (LN). Either a complete or partial response is associated with an improved outcome compared with no response. Partial response is associated with a much greater likelihood of a subsequent relapse than complete response and therefore also with a poorer long-term outcome than in those who achieve a complete response. The criteria used to determine a clinical response are discussed above. (See <a class="local">'Goals of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>The importance of attaining a complete response was illustrated in a report from the Lupus Nephritis Collaborative Study Group of 86 patients with severe LN [<a href="#rid1">1,65</a>]. The 43 percent of patients who attained a complete response (ie, an inactive urine sediment, a serum creatinine ≤1.4 mg/dL [124 micromol/L], and protein excretion ≤330 mg/day) had much higher kidney survival rates at five years (94 versus 46 percent) and at 10 years (94 versus 31 percent) compared with those who did not attain a complete response. Improvement was also noted in patient survival (95 versus 60 percent at 10 years). Similar findings have been reported by others [<a href="#rid66">66</a>].</p><p>The value of partial response was also demonstrated in the 10-year study of the same 86 adults with severe LN that evaluated the correlation among clinical outcomes and partial response (a 50 percent reduction in proteinuria to less than 1.5 g/day and stable serum creatinine), complete response, and no response [<a href="#rid65">65</a>]. Compared with no response, partial response was associated with significantly higher rates of kidney (45 versus 19 percent) and patient (76 versus 46 percent) survival. As in the above study, the best outcomes were observed in those who attained complete response (kidney and patient survival of 94 and 96 percent, respectively).</p><p>Features generally predictive of attaining complete response are stable kidney function after four weeks on therapy, lower chronicity index on kidney biopsy, being a White patient, and lower baseline proteinuria and serum creatinine concentration [<a href="#rid67">67</a>]. On the other hand, male sex and earlier development of nephritis from the time of diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus may be associated with a lower likelihood of sustained complete response [<a href="#rid68">68</a>].</p><p>Patients with LN have a higher risk of mortality and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) compared with the general population. In one population-based study that included 72 patients with incident LN between 1976 and 2018, survival was 89 percent at 5 years and 70 percent at 10 years after diagnosis [<a href="#rid69">69</a>]. Compared with the general population, patients with LN had a sixfold higher rate of mortality (standardized mortality ratio 6.33, 95% CI 1.81-9.89). The most common cause of death was infection, followed by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease activity and cardiovascular disease. The cumulative incidence of ESKD was 10 percent at 5 years and 13 percent at 10 years.</p><p>Among patients who progress to ESKD, patient survival with either hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis appears to be similar to that in the general population of patients with ESKD [<a href="#rid70">70-72</a>]. In an analysis of 11,023 patients with ESKD and SLE initiating peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis, there was a similar overall mortality between the two groups of 21 to 22 percent over three years. This was also true for cardiovascular- and infection-related mortality [<a href="#rid73">73</a>]. There is, however, an increased risk of death during the first three months of dialysis due primarily to sepsis and other complications of high-dose immunosuppressive therapy [<a href="#rid71">71</a>]. In addition, peritoneal dialysis is associated with an increased risk of peritonitis and non-catheter-related infection [<a href="#rid74">74,75</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1515030024"><span class="h2">Risk factors for progression</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Even with aggressive therapy, some patients with focal or diffuse LN will have a progressive decline in kidney function leading to ESKD. Clinical risk factors for progression, evident at the time of initial presentation, include an elevated serum creatinine, hypertension, nephrotic-range proteinuria, anemia with a hematocrit below 26 percent, nonadherence to therapy, having noncommercial health insurance (in the United States), and being a Black patient or a Hispanic patient [<a href="#rid16">16,19,76-79</a>]. </p><p>The severity of acute and chronic tubulointerstitial disease and interstitial inflammation, as well as the presence of cellular crescents, also correlate with long-term prognosis in LN, as they do in many other chronic progressive glomerular diseases [<a href="#rid16">16,77,80,81</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7181.html" rel="external">"Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease", section on 'Tubulointerstitial fibrosis'</a>.)</p><p>Risk factors for progression that become evident after initial presentation and during therapy are the frequency and severity of relapses (renal flares) and the degree to which the abnormal features of kidney involvement are controlled (complete or partial response of proteinuria, hematuria, and the severity of azotemia). A complete renal response based upon these clinical criteria may or may not correspond to a histologic complete remission. Persistent isolated C3 hypocomplementemia (without C4 hypocomplementemia) at six months after kidney biopsy has also been associated with a higher risk of ESKD in patients with focal or diffuse LN [<a href="#rid82">82</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1667588238"><span class="h1">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

While there is no consensus definition of a complete response, most definitions include the following elements: a substantial reduction in protein excretion, improvement or stabilization of the serum creatinine, and improvement of the urinary sediment. Of note, a clinical response is not synonymous with histologic "remission." The likelihood of a successful initial outcome is greater if therapy for LN is initiated relatively early in the course of the disease. (See <a class="local">'Goals of therapy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Definitions of response'</a> above and <a class="local">'Importance of prompt therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Initial treatment approach</strong> – Immunosuppressive therapy for focal (class III) or diffuse (class IV) LN consists of initial and subsequent phases. Initial therapy involves the administration of potent antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs to achieve a clinical and immunologic renal response that will prevent progressive nephron loss and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)  (<a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef132621" href="/z/d/graphic/132621.html" rel="external">algorithm 1</a>). Once a renal response is achieved, less aggressive subsequent immunosuppressive therapy is given for a prolonged period to prevent relapse and continue to treat the systemic autoimmunity. (See <a class="local">'Approach to treatment'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Initial therapy</strong> – For patients with diffuse or focal LN, we suggest an initial regimen consisting of glucocorticoids in combination with either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9670" href="/z/d/drug information/9670.html" rel="external">mycophenolate</a> mofetil (MMF) or intravenous (IV) or oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a> (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">Grade 2C</a>). Reasonable alternatives for initial therapy include MMF in combination with either a calcineurin inhibitor (<a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="130589" href="/z/d/drug information/130589.html" rel="external">voclosporin</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9971" href="/z/d/drug information/9971.html" rel="external">tacrolimus</a>) or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="16479" href="/z/d/drug information/16479.html" rel="external">belimumab</a>, or cyclophosphamide in combination with belimumab. We do not use <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9616" href="/z/d/drug information/9616.html" rel="external">rituximab</a> as initial therapy. Data from randomized trials have shown comparable efficacy with MMF or cyclophosphamide as initial agents. (See <a class="local">'Initial therapy with mycophenolate or cyclophosphamide'</a> above and <a class="local">'Combination regimens'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2">Dosing and duration of MMF, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a>, and glucocorticoids as initial therapy are discussed above. (See <a class="local">'Mycophenolate-based regimen'</a> above and <a class="local">'Cyclophosphamide-based regimen'</a> above and <a class="local">'Glucocorticoid dosing and taper'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span><strong>Subsequent therapy</strong> – For most patients who achieve a renal response after initial immunosuppressive therapy, we suggest subsequent therapy with MMF rather than <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9026" href="/z/d/drug information/9026.html" rel="external">azathioprine</a> (<a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_5" rel="external">Grade 2B</a>). Although randomized trials have shown that the mortality and rates of ESKD are similar for MMF and azathioprine, the risk of relapse appears to be higher for azathioprine. However, azathioprine is preferred for patients who want to become pregnant; MMF should be avoided since it has been associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations and spontaneous abortion. Azathioprine is also a reasonable option for patients who are intolerant to MMF or cannot afford the cost of MMF. Low-dose oral <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9809" href="/z/d/drug information/9809.html" rel="external">prednisone</a> (or its equivalent) is continued in most patients receiving subsequent therapy. The dosing and duration of MMF, azathioprine, and low-dose glucocorticoids for subsequent therapy are discussed above. (See <a class="local">'Choice of subsequent therapy'</a> above and <a class="local">'Dosing and duration of subsequent therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Monitoring</strong> – During initial immunosuppressive therapy, we typically schedule follow-up visits every two to four weeks for the first three months. In stable patients, the duration between follow-up visits can then be extended to every two to three months. The goal of these visits is to evaluate the patient's response to therapy (ie, whether a clinical response is achieved) and the toxicity of the regimen (ie, adverse effects, infections due to immunosuppression). Once patients are transitioned from their initial to their subsequent immunosuppressive regimen, we generally perform follow-up visits every three months to determine whether the patient is experiencing a flare or toxicity from therapy. (See <a class="local">'Monitoring the response to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other treatment considerations</strong> – Other treatment considerations in patients with focal or diffuse LN include general supportive measures such as dietary sodium and protein restriction, blood pressure control, minimization of proteinuria with renin-angiotensin system inhibition, and treatment of dyslipidemia. Immunosuppressive therapy with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9308" href="/z/d/drug information/9308.html" rel="external">cyclophosphamide</a>, MMF, and/or high-dose glucocorticoids has both infectious and noninfectious toxicities that warrant additional prophylactic measures.
