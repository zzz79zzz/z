         Physicians have a legal and ethical responsibility to provide adequate information to the patient so that they can process the information and make appropriate decisions [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. An educated patient also benefits the physician, both in terms of cooperation in the planned intervention and in reducing acrimony in case of complications [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. The physician who teaches and responds carefully brings the patient into the medical decision-making process, addresses the patient's concerns, and creates reasonable expectations regarding outcomes. As it is a common procedure, issues surrounding cholecystectomy are used to provide examples of how to apply the concepts in this topic.

         No intervention can be undertaken without the patient's consent, which must be both voluntary and knowing [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. In order for consent to be valid, the patient must be competent. In the setting of informed consent, competence or capacity means the patient has the mental ability to understand problems and decide whether to accept or reject medical treatments that are offered [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3

         Competence is presumed unless there are obvious clinical (eg, severe mental illness) or judicial (eg, a determination of incompetence at a competency hearing) reasons to doubt competency. If a patient is deemed incompetent by a court of law, the duty of informed consent extends to the patient's proxy.

         In instances of temporarily diminished capacity, a physician is obligated to reassess capacity to consent over time [

         To meet the requirements for effective, informed decision-making, a physician must disclose material facts as well as appropriate additional disclosures. These are discussed in detail below.

         Material facts in general include information about events that occur frequently, even if these complications would be considered minor, such as a superficial wound infection or a hematoma. Material facts also include rare events that represent major complications (eg, death, loss of mobility, loss of reproductive function or continence, or the need for a stoma) [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. As an example, in the case of an elective cholecystectomy, the discussion should include the diagnosis (eg, symptomatic stones), proposed treatment (eg, laparoscopic cholecystectomy), alternatives (eg, observation on a restricted diet), risks of cholecystectomy (eg, common duct injury, infection, or bleeding, all of which might require second procedures), and the risks of observation only (eg, stone migration or cholecystitis).
        </p>
        <p>
         The physician must decide what facts about a procedure should be presented and how detailed the discussion with a patient should be. There are no hard and fast rules about percentages of risk or degrees of harm that require discussion. However, the applicable standards may vary from one patient or jurisdiction to another. As an example, in Texas, state regulations delineate specific risks or hazards associated with certain procedures that must be disclosed in each instance [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6,7
         </a>
         ]. (See
         <a class="local">

         below.)

        <p>
         While the law remains unsettled, it seems prudent to include a warning that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) positive patients undergoing surgical procedures incur higher risks for respiratory complications and mortality [
         <a href="#rid8">
          8
         </a>
         ]. Similarly, the risks associated with nosocomial (hospital-acquired) COVID-19 infection may also be worth discussing [

         Physicians must answer truthfully if a patient asks questions about the number of similar procedures they have performed and their success rates [
         <a href="#rid10">
          10,11
         </a>
         ]. Failure to answer honestly may leave a physician open to claims of fraud and misrepresentation, as well as negligent nondisclosure [
         <a href="#rid12">
          12,13
         </a>
         ]. A surgeon should disclose the availability of specialty services provided elsewhere if there is a known difference in the quality or types of care delivered there. There is typically no affirmative duty to investigate other surgeons' caseloads or success rates, something one might have difficulty uncovering.
        </p>
        <p>
         The law mandates disclosure of a physician's financial conflict(s) of interest, since the law presumes that there is the potential for undue influence on that physician's medical judgment [
         <a href="#rid14">
          14
         </a>
         ]. Examples include referral to a laboratory, an ambulatory surgery center, or a radiology service in which the physician has ownership. Patients must be given the opportunity to seek care in an independent facility. There may also be disclosure requirements if the physician has a commercial interest in the use of a patient's cells or in the use of new devices or techniques [
         <a href="#rid15">
          15
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Patients are not entitled to know everything about a provider's personal attributes, even though patients might argue that the information would surely have affected their choice of surgeon [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. Some courts have mandated disclosure of a physician's own alcohol abuse [
         <a href="#rid17">
          17
         </a>
         ] and HIV status [
         <a href="#rid18">
          18,19
         </a>
         ]. Other courts refuse to mandate voluntary disclosure, concluding that those physician-specific facts are not material, and that it is an unwarranted invasion of the physician's privacy [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16

         The surgeon must advise patients of personnel and their respective roles, including residents, students, and equipment or medical device representatives. It is particularly important for patients to know if residents or students will be performing segments of a procedure [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ], though it is generally not necessary to name residents or students individually on the consent form – a generic reference to "residents" and "students" will typically suffice [
         <a href="#rid21">
          21
         </a>
         ]. Some patients object to having part or all of their procedure done by others than the physician they originally chose, and patients retain the right to refuse participation by residents and students. Physicians also have the right to refuse to take care of patients who will not allow residents to participate in elective procedures.

         It is prudent for the physician to inform patients of any additional procedures that may be predictably necessary for a successful outcome or that are recommended to prevent future health problems. Examples might include en bloc resection of adjacent structures in a cancer operation or creation of a stoma at the time of a left colectomy. If one finds something unexpected, like gallstones discovered at the time of a colectomy, it might be most effective to add a cholecystectomy while the patient is anesthetized and the surgeon is working in the abdomen. However, it might be wiser to ask the family in attendance to consent for the patient on the table, rather than simply proceeding with an incidental cholecystectomy.

         The physician can maximize the effectiveness of an informed consent session by communicating in terms patients and their families or other caretakers can understand. Important elements of effective communication are discussed in the following sections.

         The legal principles of informed consent promote patient autonomy, the notion that patients should decide who touches them and how that contact is made. Thus, the physician should be wary of too much pressure, too little information, or too little attention to the patient's need for information, understanding, and comfort [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. As Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Cardozo once wrote, "Every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with their body" [
         <a href="#rid22">
          22
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Physicians must focus on the patient's understanding and consent. One concrete example of respect for autonomy and avoidance of paternalism is the pacing and content of the informed consent conversation between the surgeon and a patient considered to be "frail elderly." The discussion must be held to allow for comprehension and then communication of the patient's wishes back to the surgeon [
         <a href="#rid23">
          23
         </a>
         ]. Including relatives in the discussion may be good practice when patients allow them to join the conversation, but decisions made by family members can never countermand those of a competent adult patient [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24

         The language used to obtain consent must be comprehensible to the patient and cannot be a simple list. In order to protect themselves from uncertainty, some physicians give patients exhaustive lists of every conceivable thing that might go wrong. However, the transmission of important information requires more than an impersonal, boilerplate listing of minutiae [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. Rather, there should be personal transmission of truly relevant data. The physician should present the information that someone in the patient's situation needs to know in order to make a truly educated decision ("If I were in this patient's shoes, what would I want to know?"). (See
         <a class="local">

         Interpreters are necessary for non-English speakers, and a translator skilled in medical terminology (whether present in person or via videoconference) is ideal for the purpose of transmitting accurate information. Translation should not be left to family members, as they may withhold information from a patient in order to protect him or her from hearing bad news. In such cases, incomplete or misleading information may be all the patient receives, and the physician will not realize that information was not effectively or completely communicated [

         The Joint Commission defines health literacy as "the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions" [

         In some cases, the need for consent may be outweighed by the need for urgent intervention and the physician must proceed as expeditiously as the medical situation requires [
         <a href="#rid33">
          33

        <p>
         The duty of informed consent extends to a patient's proxy or surrogate decision maker. If a patient regains capacity, the duty of informed consent returns to the patient and the role of the proxy in informed decision-making is extinguished. This is why reassessment of the patient's capacity is essential. (See

         The physician should date and time the written summary of what was said and to whom, making note of relatives, friends, or support staff such as nurses or interpreters who are present. All elements of the discussion should be reduced to writing: diagnosis, proposed treatment with its risks and benefits, and alternative treatments with their risks and benefits.

         It is not sufficient to state that "the risks and benefits were discussed" without further description of the specifics. The physician should document that the patient understood the concepts as discussed and agreed to proceed. In addition, the physician should document that the patient was provided with appropriate literature, that the patient had the opportunity to ask questions, and that those questions were answered. The standard procedure consent document means little, particularly in its generic form. The real work of obtaining informed consent is documented in office or hospital notes. There is generally no need for a witness to the one-on-one discussion in the office or at the bedside.

         A battery action is an action for a "touching" to which the patient did not agree [

          20,43

         <a href="#rid44">
          44
         </a>
         ]. The rationale in such cases is that a poorly informed patient cannot legally consent in any meaningful way, and thus any nominal agreement is void [

          20

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         Battery actions are infrequent in the medical arena, and, in most jurisdictions, the typical case in which a plaintiff asserts an absence of informed consent is termed "negligent nondisclosure" [

This claim is sometimes made by itself but is more commonly appended to the standard medical malpractice claim that the physician did not perform the procedure according to industry standards.

         Unlike the requirement for expert witnesses in jurisdictions in which the professional standard is applied, there is generally no need for an expert in the patient-centered jurisdictions. An expert may be helpful in presenting the scientific facts about procedures and risks. However, a lay jury is deemed capable of deciding what an ordinary patient would consider relevant in order to consent to a surgical procedure. There are both objective and subjective patient-centered standards:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         <strong>
          Objective
         </strong>
         – The objective standard of care requires that the physician determine what a reasonable patient would find indispensable when evaluating their options and then include these issues in the informed consent dialogue [
         <a href="#rid49">
          49
         </a>
         ]. For elective, cosmetic, or high-risk procedures, the physician's burden of disclosure is even higher because a reasonable patient might be more likely to decline the proposed procedure or to choose another therapeutic option. The patient must show that, had they known the necessary and pertinent facts, they would have refused to proceed. Thus, the physician must disclose those facts that a reasonable patient in a similar situation would need to know in order to make an informed choice [
         <a href="#rid50">
          50

         <strong>
          Subjective
         </strong>
         – The subjective standard for disclosure requires the physician to relay facts that a particular patient deems important in the decision-making process [
         <a href="#rid51">
          51
         </a>
         ]. Proponents assert that the right to self-determination requires that a patient be able to decline a particular treatment even if a reasonable person would consent, and only a subjective standard can fully protect that right [
         <a href="#rid52">
          52
         </a>
         ]. The subjective standard promotes the greatest patient autonomy as compared with the professional standard or objective standard. However, it is difficult for physicians to know what facts are relevant to an individual patient's decision-making and defend against hindsight. As an example, a patient may state that they would not have consented to a procedure with the possibility of a particular poor outcome that was not disclosed during the informed consent dialogue. The patient need only declare their own particular belief that they would have refused, and the jury must then simply decide whether or not the patient's claim is credible [

         <strong>
          Informed consent
         </strong>
         – The physician has a legal and ethical responsibility to provide adequate information to the patient so that they can process the information and make appropriate decisions. No procedure can be undertaken without the patient's agreement. The patient's consent must be voluntary and competent. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Introduction'
         </a>
         above and

         <strong>
          Material facts
         </strong>
         – To meet the requirements for effective, informed decision-making, a physician must disclose material facts relevant to decision-making, including the patient's diagnosis, proposed treatment, risks and benefits of the treatment, alternative treatments along with their risks and benefits, and the risks of refusal. (See
         <a class="local">

         <strong>
          Physician disclosure
         </strong>
         – A physician must answer truthfully, if asked, about the number of similar procedures or cases performed, and disclose success rates. They must disclose, even without inquiry, any financial conflict(s) of interest. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Physician disclosure'

         above.)

         <strong>
          Personnel
         </strong>
         – The physician must advise patients of all personnel involved in their care and their respective roles, including residents, students, and equipment representatives. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Personnel'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Additional procedures
         </strong>
         – It is prudent for the physician to inform patients of any reasonably foreseeable additional procedures that may be necessary for a successful outcome. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Additional procedures'
         </a>

         <strong>
          Effective communication
         </strong>
         – The physician can maximize the effectiveness of an informed consent session by communicating in terms patients and their families or other caretakers can understand. Important elements of effective communication include focusing on the patient, using comprehensible language, offering educational material, and using interpreters when necessary. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Effective communication'

         <strong>
          Documentation
         </strong>
         – Patients may not accurately remember all of the facts disclosed in teaching sessions. Thus, the physician must document the content of informed consent sessions. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Documentation'
         </a>
         above.)

         <strong>
          Failure to obtain consent
         </strong>
         – Failure to provide the necessary, relevant information in a way that truly communicates with the patient may constitute ineffective, and therefore nonexistent, consent. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Failure to obtain consent'
