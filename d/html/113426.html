As there are no effective vaccines to prevent HIV transmission, behavioral and biomedical HIV prevention strategies are needed to reduce HIV acquisition.</p><p>The use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with antiretroviral therapy (ART) for those without HIV has proven to be an effective HIV prevention strategy. Among persons who are adherent to treatment, PrEP can reduce the risk of HIV transmission by greater than 99 percent [<a href="#rid1">1</a>], although rare infections may still occur [<a href="#rid2">2-4</a>]. However, less than one-third of people who meet PrEP indications have ever been prescribed PrEP. Uptake has been particularly limited in certain populations who are at greatest risk for HIV infection (eg, at-risk African Americans, Hispanic/Latin Americans, adolescents, and transgender individuals) [<a href="#rid5">5-7</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the approach to using PrEP in persons who are at risk for acquiring HIV. Other strategies to prevent HIV infection (eg, ART for patients with HIV, post-exposure prophylaxis [PEP], and voluntary male circumcision) are discussed elsewhere.

In six trials where adherence to PrEP was ≥70 percent, the benefit was more pronounced (1 versus 4.1 percent [RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.19-0.39]).</p><p>By contrast, the benefit of PrEP in those with lower risk (eg, heterosexual men who engaged in condomless sex with partners from areas of low general HIV prevalence) is less certain.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2624028885"><span class="h3">Sexual risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We recommend PrEP for the following patient groups:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Persons who have a sexual partner with HIV if the partner has a detectable viral load or if the partner's recent virological status is unknown.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although PrEP can be considered for all individuals without HIV who have a serodiscordant partner, in clinical trials, transmission to an uninfected partner has not been reported if the partner with HIV is confirmed to have a stably suppressed plasma HIV RNA and is adherent to their antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen. In a prospective observational study of serodiscordant couples (ie, one partner has HIV and the other does not) there were no documented intracouple transmission events after more than 1200 couple-years of follow-up when the partner with HIV had a viral load &lt;200 copies/mL [<a href="#rid11">11</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/16612.html" rel="external">"HIV infection: Risk factors and prevention strategies", section on 'Treatment as prevention'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Similarly, if the patient's partner with HIV recently initiated ART, PrEP does not need to be continued indefinitely. PrEP should be continued until the partner with HIV has achieved a stably suppressed viral load (eg, typically by six months after initiating ART) [<a href="#rid12">12,13</a>]. However, PrEP should be continued if there was concern about sustained adherence to antiretroviral medication by the partner living with HIV.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">More detailed information on discontinuing PrEP is discussed below.

In the multinational iPrEx trial, 2470 HIV-seronegative men and 29 transgender women were randomly assigned to either <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8527" href="/z/d/drug information/8527.html" rel="external">tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-emtricitabine</a> (TDF-FTC) or placebo once daily [<a href="#rid15">15</a>]. Participants were followed for a median of 1.2 years, during which time 100 patients acquired HIV (36 in the intervention arm and 64 in the placebo group); this was consistent with a 44 percent reduction in the incidence of HIV with TDF-FTC (95% CI 15-63). The protective efficacy of TDF-FTC increased to ≥96 percent for those with drug levels that were consistent with taking at least four doses per week [<a href="#rid1">1,17</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Although some studies in transgender women have found the efficacy of PrEP to be variable [<a href="#rid18">18,19</a>], the differences appear to be due to the level of adherence. In a study that included 24 transgender men and 24 transgender women on stable sex hormone therapy, TDF-FTC did not affect serum levels of gender-affirming hormones, and all persons achieved protective levels of tenofovir diphosphate [<a href="#rid20">20</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Heterosexually active men from regions with generalized HIV epidemics who have condomless sex with female partners. This includes those who have condomless sex with one or more female partners with known HIV infection or multiple female partners of unknown HIV status.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">According to the World Health Organization (WHO), this refers to geographic regions or populations where the prevalence of HIV is ≥3 percent (eg, several countries in sub-Saharan Africa), though the WHO recommends that individual characteristics and behaviors are also important when considering who might benefit from PrEP use [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. However, other guideline panels have suggested a lower prevalence threshold of ≥2 percent [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In Africa, two large trials demonstrated that TDF-FTC reduced the risk of HIV acquisition in heterosexual men and women by approximately 80 percent compared with placebo [<a href="#rid23">23,24</a>].</p><p></p><p>We also suggest PrEP for certain other populations. These include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Heterosexual cisgender women who have, in the last six months, engaged in condomless sex with male partners who are at high risk of HIV infection (eg, persons who inject drugs, bisexual male partners, partners from areas where there is a high HIV prevalence).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">PrEP should also be offered to those diagnosed with bacterial STIs associated with increased risk for HIV, such as syphilis or gonorrhea. Although PrEP should be discussed with cisgender women diagnosed with chlamydia, we do not routinely offer PrEP to such patients and individualize consideration of PrEP since the co-occurrence of this STI with HIV is less common than for other bacterial STIs.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In resource-limited settings, trials of oral and topical PrEP to prevent HIV acquisition in at-risk cisgender heterosexual women have yielded variable results. In some trials, oral TDF-FTC was found to have no effect on reducing transmission in females, whereas in others, transmission was reduced by approximately 70 percent overall and by more than 90 percent in those who had drug levels consistent with daily use [<a href="#rid23">23,25-28</a>]. These differences in PrEP efficacy estimates appear to be primarily due to the variable levels of adherence in the different studies.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Heterosexual men who have, in the last six months, been diagnosed with a bacterial STI or have engaged in condomless sex with partners from areas of low general HIV prevalence but who are at high risk of HIV infection (eg, sex workers, persons who inject drugs). However, there are limited data in these populations, due in part to limited participation in clinical trials and uptake of PrEP [<a href="#rid29">29</a>].</p><p></p><p>For transgender and nonbinary individuals, the decision to offer PrEP should be determined based on their sexual risk, as described for the populations above, since some groups (eg, transgender women who engage in sex work) are at increased risk for HIV while others are not.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3782434163"><span class="h3">Injection drug use</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We suggest PrEP for people who inject drugs if, within the last six months, they report sharing needles/equipment, even if they have initiated substance use treatment. In a double-blind trial in Thailand, 2413 HIV-seronegative males and females with a history of injection drug use during the previous year were randomly assigned to once-daily therapy with tenofovir or placebo [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. Fifty patients became infected during follow-up (17 in the intervention arm and 33 in the placebo group), which is consistent with a 49 percent reduction in the incidence of HIV with tenofovir (95% CI 9.6-72.2). However, the findings from this study were insufficient to reliably determine the degree of protection from PrEP in persons who inject drugs since the trial only used TDF (rather than TDF-FTC, which is used for PrEP); in addition, the trial was unable to determine the degree of protection from sexual versus needle risk.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1609316209"><span class="h3">Unclear risk</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>PrEP is generally not needed for persons who consistently engage in low-risk behaviors (eg, consistent condom use when engaging in anal or vaginal intercourse, no mucosal exposure to genital secretions) and those who are in mutually monogamous relationships. However, on occasion, a patient may not endorse high-risk behaviors but still request PrEP.</p><p>In these circumstances, clinicians should try to better understand the person's reasons for wanting to use PrEP. We typically provide PrEP if we feel the potential risks and benefits of treatment are fully understood, and there are no underlying behavioral health issues that would impact their decision. Some individuals who engage in behaviors that put them at increased risk for HIV acquisition may not be comfortable disclosing information related to their sexual practices or substance use.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2121493515"><span class="h1">DETERMINING PREFERENCE FOR ORAL VERSUS INJECTABLE THERAPY</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Oral and injectable PrEP are both effective in reducing HIV transmission. The decision to use one strategy over the other depends upon availability and patient preference.</p><p>When both options are available, we review the pros and cons of the different regimens to determine which modality will optimize adherence, as this equates to effectiveness  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef140045" href="/z/d/graphic/140045.html" rel="external">table 3</a>).</p><p>For most patients, we suggest oral therapy with <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8527" href="/z/d/drug information/8527.html" rel="external">tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-emtricitabine</a> (TDF-FTC) pending additional real-world experience with long-acting <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="130319" href="/z/d/drug information/130319.html" rel="external">cabotegravir</a> (cabotegravir LA). Reasons include:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>TDF-FTC is the most studied regimen and is well tolerated.

By contrast, if a patient develops drug resistance while taking TDF-FTC, many of the preferred treatment options can still be used.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients who take <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="130319" href="/z/d/drug information/130319.html" rel="external">cabotegravir</a> LA may still need to take an oral regimen (eg, TDF-FTC or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="107645" href="/z/d/drug information/107645.html" rel="external">tenofovir alafenamide-emtricitabine</a> [TAF-FTC]) for a period of time after discontinuing injectable therapy to reduce the risk of developing INSTI resistance. Cabotegravir LA has a long half-life, and low levels can be detected for at least a year after it is discontinued. Without oral therapy, those who continue to engage in high-risk behaviors would be at increased risk for developing drug-resistant HIV when levels of cabotegravir are suboptimal. (See <a class="local">'Persons with a positive HIV test'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="130319" href="/z/d/drug information/130319.html" rel="external">Cabotegravir</a> LA has not been fully evaluated in persons who inject drugs. In addition, there are only limited data in persons who are pregnant or who desire pregnancy. Although there was no increase in the incidence of adverse birth outcomes among those who became pregnant in the randomized trial that evaluated cabotegravir LA in cisgender women, the number of pregnancies was small [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p></p><p>By contrast, injectable therapy:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Is preferable for those who do not like or may forget to take pills or are unable to store medications (eg, those with housing instability).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>May be reasonable for certain persons at risk for renal or bone disease since TDF-FTC should be avoided and TAF-FTC has not yet been fully studied in all populations (eg, cisgender women). However, clinicians must first assess if the patient is able to take TDF-FTC or TAF-FTC, use condoms consistently, or engage in abstinence for a finite period if <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="130319" href="/z/d/drug information/130319.html" rel="external">cabotegravir</a> LA is discontinued (ie, to provide protection while cabotegravir levels are waning).

Although the findings from these trials suggest that cabotegravir LA is superior to TDF-FTC, this may be due in large part to superior adherence. The trial that compared these agents in 4570 men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women was stopped early after a median follow-up of 1.4 years because there were fewer new infections in those who received cabotegravir LA (13 versus 39, respectively; hazard ratio 34 95% CI 0.18 to 0.62) [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].
