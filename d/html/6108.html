         Gross hematuria is defined by the presence of an increased number of red blood cells (RBCs) in the urine that is visible to the naked eye. Although an uncommon occurrence in children, it is nevertheless a disturbing finding for both the affected child and his/her family.
        </p>
        <p>
         The causes and evaluation of gross hematuria in children will be reviewed here. The evaluation of children with microscopic hematuria is discussed separately. (See

         Gross hematuria is suspected when red or brown urine is present. However, red or brown urine can be due to causes other than blood including the following  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef56337" href="/z/d/graphic/56337.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, the initial step in the evaluation of patients with red urine is to establish whether or not the urine discoloration is due to blood or another substance. This is accomplished by the following two procedures:
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Urinary dipstick test for blood – The reagent strip that detects blood utilizes hydrogen peroxide, which catalyzes a chemical reaction between hemoglobin (or myoglobin) and the chromogen tetramethylbenzidine. If the urinary dipstick test is positive for blood, the likely cause of the red/brown pigmentation is blood, or free hemoglobin or myoglobin. A negative test eliminates these etiologies as the cause of urinary discoloration.
        </p>
        <p>

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Urine centrifugation – If after centrifugation of the urine specimen the sediment is red/brown, then the etiology is most likely blood  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef55923" href="/z/d/graphic/55923.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). If the supernatant is red/brown and the sediment is not discolored, then the red/brown urine is not due to blood but to another substance, such as free hemoglobin or myoglobin. Microscopic examination of the sediment should confirm the presence of red blood cells (RBCs). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7196.html" rel="external">

        </p>
        <p>
         In patients with gross hematuria, the color change does not necessarily reflect the degree of blood loss, since as little as 1 mL of blood per liter of urine can induce a visible color change.

          ETIOLOGY

         <span class="headingEndMark">
          —
         </span>
         The most commonly identified etiologies for gross hematuria in children include urinary tract infection (UTI), irritation of the meatus or perineum, and trauma [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Other less common causes include nephrolithiasis, sickle cell disease/trait, coagulopathy, glomerular disease including postinfectious glomerulonephritis and immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy, malignancies (eg, Wilms tumor and rarely, transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder), and drug-induced hemorrhagic cystitis, such as is seen with
         <a class="drug drug_pediatric" data-topicid="13191" href="/z/d/drug information/13191.html" rel="external">
          cyclophosphamide
         </a>
         [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Post-micturition urethral bleeding, a benign condition, may also be seen in infant boys with resolution by one year of age in most cases [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The relative frequency of the known causes of gross hematuria in children varies depending upon the clinical setting. This is illustrated by several case series of children with gross hematuria who presented to three different clinical settings (ie, a pediatric emergency department [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ], a pediatric urology referral service [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ], or a pediatric nephrology referral service [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]).
        </p>
        <p>
         In a 1977 two-year retrospective review of 150 patients presenting to a tertiary pediatric emergency center with gross hematuria, either documented (n = 39) or suspected (n = 35) UTI was the underlying diagnosis in half of the patients [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>
         ]. Other causes included perineal or urethral irritation (18 percent), trauma (7 percent), acute nephritis (4 percent), coagulopathy (3 percent), and stone (2 percent). In 10 percent of patients, no etiology was found.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a 10-year retrospective review of 342 children who presented with gross hematuria to a pediatric urologic center in the United States between 1994 and 2004 [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4
         </a>
         ], the causes of gross hematuria and their frequency included urethral irritation or trauma (15 percent), UTI (14 percent), underlying congenital anomalies such as vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), posterior urethral valves (PUV), or ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) (13 percent), nephrolithiasis (5 percent), and malignancy (1 percent). In 35 percent of the patients, no cause could be determined. In addition, bladder or urethral abnormalities were seen in 76 of 136 patients who underwent cystoscopy including posterior urethritis (n = 25), cystitis (n = 25), bladder trabeculation (n = 7), and urethral stricture (n = 6).
        </p>
        <p>
         In this urologic case series, there were no cases of glomerular disease, which is most likely due to referral bias. This was illustrated by the third retrospective case series from a pediatric nephrology referral center that demonstrated a greater proportion of cases due to glomerular disease compared with both of the two previous studies [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. In this review, results were based upon 82 of 100 patients with completed evaluation. The following findings were noted:

        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         A glomerular cause was identified in 24 patients (29 percent). The two most common diagnoses were IgA nephropathy (n = 13) and Alport syndrome (n = 6). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/3112.html" rel="external">
          "IgA nephropathy: Clinical features and diagnosis"

         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         Nonglomerular etiology was established in 30 patients (37 percent). The most common diagnoses were hypercalciuria (n = 9), urethral irritation or trauma (n = 8), and hemorrhagic cystitis (n = 7).
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         <span class="glyph">
          ●
         </span>
         No cause was found in the remaining 28 patients (34 percent). In 26 of these patients, the hematuria was attributed to a nonglomerular source.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         In the two referral-based studies, boys were at a higher risk for gross hematuria than girls because of their increased susceptibility to trauma of the urethral meatus [
         <a href="#rid4">
          4,5
         </a>
         ]. However, in the first study, there was no gender difference. The increased prevalence of female patients with gross hematuria due to urinary tract infections seen in the emergency department setting appears to have offset the predominance of boys with recurrent gross hematuria due to trauma, resulting in the reported equal distribution of boys and girls [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1
         </a>

         History of unilateral flank pain that may radiate to the groin suggests obstruction caused by a calculus or blood clot. In comparison, flank pain without radiation but with fever, dysuria, and frequency and/or urgency is suggestive of acute pyelonephritis. (See

         The timing of hematuria during micturition may suggest an etiology. As an example, initial hematuria (onset of urination) usually suggests urethral bleeding; continuous bleeding throughout urination may occur from bleeding in the bladder, ureter or kidneys; and terminal bleeding (at the end of urination) is indicative of bladder disease.

         The color of urine may distinguish glomerular bleeding from extraglomerular bleeding. Glomerulonephritis is associated with brown urine. Bleeding from the lower urinary tract is suggested by pink or red urine and may be accompanied by blood clots. (See

         A history of pharyngitis or impetigo (two or three weeks prior to onset of hematuria) suggests poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, although a recent upper respiratory (one or two days prior to onset of hematuria) infection can be associated with immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy. (See

         Signs or symptoms suggestive of glomerular disease – Manifestations such as proteinuria, RBC casts, edema, and hypertension suggest a glomerular source for the hematuria. The evaluation includes serum creatinine, complete blood count, complement component 3 (C3), complement component 4 (C4), and serum albumin. Other tests to consider based upon the history and the physical examination include antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer and/or streptozyme testing to detect poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, and antinuclear antibody testing to detect lupus nephritis.

         In addition, left renal vein compression between the aorta and proximal superior mesenteric artery, referred to as "nutcracker syndrome," has been suggested as a cause of gross and microscopic hematuria in children that is usually asymptomatic, but may be associated with left flank pain [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13,14
         </a>
         ]. Nutcracker syndrome is detected by Doppler ultrasonographic assessment of left renal vein diameter and peak velocity or computed tomography  (

         ].
        </p>
        <p>
         The frequency of hematuria due to nutcracker syndrome in children appears to be highest in Asia, with the diagnosis rarely entertained in North America. This was illustrated in a Japanese case series of 85 children with hematuria without nephritis, nephrolithiasis, or tumor. Doppler ultrasonographic findings were consistent with a diagnosis of nutcracker syndrome in 21 of 23 children with gross hematuria and 17 of 52 patients with microscopic hematuria [
         <a href="#rid13">
          13

          Confirmation
         </strong>
         – Gross hematuria is suspected when red or brown urine is present. However, red or brown urine may be due to causes other than blood. Thus, gross hematuria must be distinguished from other causes of red/brown urine by a positive urinary dipstick for blood and a red/brown urine sediment  (

          algorithm 1
         </a>
         ). Other causes include free hemoglobin or myoglobin, pigments from drugs (eg,

         ) or foods (eg, beets), or metabolites associated with other clinical conditions (eg, porphyria). (See

          Etiology
         </strong>
         – Urinary tract infection (UTI), irritation to the meatus or perineum, and trauma are the most common causes of gross hematuria in children [
         <a href="#rid1">
          1,2
         </a>
         ]. Other less common causes include nephrolithiasis, sickle cell disease/trait, coagulopathy, glomerular disease including postinfectious glomerulonephritis and immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy, malignancies (eg, Wilms tumor), and drug-induced hemorrhagic cystitis (eg,

          Symptomatic hematuria
         </strong>
         – The majority of symptomatic children who present with gross hematuria have an easily recognizable and apparent cause generally detected by an initial evaluation that includes a complete history, physical examination, and urinalysis  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef68294" href="/z/d/graphic/68294.html" rel="external">
          algorithm 2
         </a>
         ). Further testing is guided by the clinical findings of the initial evaluation. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Symptomatic hematuria'

         above.)

         <strong>
          Asymptomatic hematuria
         </strong>
         – Diagnostic evaluation of asymptomatic patients usually determines an underlying cause of hematuria and includes urinalysis, urine culture, testing family members for hematuria, ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder, and measurements of serum creatinine, serum complement component 3 (C3), and urine calcium/creatinine.
