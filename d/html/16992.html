Lymph nodes that lie outside of the confines of the true pelvis (paraaortic lumbar, common iliac, superficial and deep inguinal, retroperitoneal, and anything more distant) are considered distant metastases.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H686719758"><span class="h2">Metastasis (M)</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Patients are classified as either not having distant metastasis (M0) or distant metastasis present (M1).

Patients with metastasis are subdivided into those with nonregional lymph node involvement (M1a), bone metastasis (M1b), or other metastatic sites with or without bone involvement (M1c).

This information is incorporated into the prognostic stage groups  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110729" href="/z/d/graphic/110729.html" rel="external">table 2</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6939.html" rel="external">"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of prostate cancer", section on 'PSA testing'</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/7568.html" rel="external">"Measurement of prostate-specific antigen"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H686723062"><span class="h2">Histologic grade group</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The histologic grade group is based solely on the architectural features of the prostate cancer cells  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef107132" href="/z/d/graphic/107132.html" rel="external">table 3</a>). (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6924.html" rel="external">"Interpretation of prostate biopsy", section on 'Gleason grading system'</a>.)</p><p>A higher histologic grade group indicates a greater likelihood of having non-organ-confined disease, as well as a worse outcome after treatment of localized disease.</p><p>Notably, biopsy obtained from extraprostatic disease (bone marrow, lymph node) is not assigned a Gleason score. In addition, a Gleason grade group is usually not assigned for prostate tissue exposed to treatment (eg, radiation therapy, androgen deprivation therapy) prior to prostatectomy.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H686719765"><span class="h2">Prognostic stage groups</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The eighth edition (2017) of the AJCC/UICC staging system uses anatomic (TNM) information, along with pretreatment serum PSA and histologic grade group, to define prognostic groups for adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma of the prostate. The specific criteria for stage groups I through IVB are summarized in the table  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef110729" href="/z/d/graphic/110729.html" rel="external">table 2</a>).</p><p>The addition of pretreatment serum PSA level and Gleason score to anatomic TNM staging to create these prognostic groups is based on multiple studies that demonstrate that these parameters are important determinants of outcome in addition to the TNM evaluation [<a href="#rid3">3</a>].</p><p>Even within these groups, there is substantial heterogeneity, which may have important implications for patient management. Additional features of the tumor that may have prognostic significance are the number and percentage of positive core biopsies, the presence of tumor perineural invasion, the presence of lymphovascular invasion, and cribriform architecture/intraductal histology. Although the eighth edition (2017) of the AJCC/UICC staging system does not take these additional factors into account, other prognostic models may incorporate some of these features. The routine use of these features and their incorporation into the staging system await further validation, but they should be considered when evaluating the patient. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6924.html" rel="external">"Interpretation of prostate biopsy"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1427998185"><span class="h1">RISK STRATIFICATION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE STAGING EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As noted above, the clinical staging evaluation (based on digital rectal examination [DRE] by an experienced clinician to assess disease extent), pretreatment serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), histologic grade group in the initial biopsy, and number and extent of cancer involvement in the biopsy cores are used to assign a prognostic stage group in the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system. (See <a class="local">'Staging system'</a> above.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H1077934608"><span class="h2">NCCN risk stratification</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A slightly different way of using this information to stratify males into clinical risk categories has been defined by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118962" href="/z/d/graphic/118962.html" rel="external">table 4</a>) [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. We use this six-tiered system of risk stratification to guide the choice of staging studies. (See <a class="local">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition, this risk stratification system has been utilized in guidelines for treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer from the American Urological Association (AUA)/American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO)/Society of Urologic Oncology (SUO), which have been endorsed by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) [<a href="#rid5">5-7</a>].

Males with very low-, low-, and favorable intermediate-risk disease do not require further imaging with the exception of prostate MRI for those being considered for active surveillance or image-guided local therapy. Imaging for individuals with unfavorable intermediate-risk disease is controversial, and clinical practice is variable.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H686719772"><span class="h1">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The diagnosis of prostate cancer requires a tissue diagnosis, which is generally obtained using a transrectal or transperineal approach. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/8097.html" rel="external">"Prostate biopsy"</a>.)</p><p>Some patients present with a very high prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and staging studies consistent with metastatic disease, and there may be discussion about whether a confirmatory biopsy is needed. We recommend biopsy of either the prostate or a metastatic site in this situation in order to confirm the diagnosis of prostate cancer, exclude other cancer, inform treatment and prognostication, and enable current or future clinical trial eligibility.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H4188838602"><span class="h1">STAGING EVALUATION</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Once a diagnosis of prostate cancer is established through tissue biopsy, the extent of the staging evaluation prior to treatment should be based on multiple factors, including life expectancy, comorbidity, the presence or absence of symptoms, and risk category, which is based on the digital rectal examination (DRE), serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and information from the diagnostic biopsy  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef118962" href="/z/d/graphic/118962.html" rel="external">table 4</a>).

Where prostate MRI is available, the authors and editors of this topic review recommend it for staging low-risk cases to ensure suitability for active surveillance and to guide further biopsy if needed. We also recommend it for males with high-risk disease for staging, particularly of the prostate/seminal vesicles and nodes. Prostate MRI can be done at the discretion of the treating clinician for males with intermediate-risk disease.</p><p>MRI technology (both hardware and software) has evolved considerably over the past two decades. The use of more powerful magnets (where available) has decreased the use of endorectal coil MRI and provides improved image resolution. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/97482.html" rel="external">"The role of magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer", section on 'Staging'</a>.)</p><p>The International Prostate MRI Working Group developed the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) to standardize prostate MRI examination performance and reporting.

The system includes technical standards for scanning hardware and protocols for image acquisition and interpretation. It also provides standardized terminology for reporting and a sector map for all locations within the gland.</p><p>For PI-RADS v2 and v2.1, images should be acquired, if possible, with a 3 Tesla (3 T) magnet, and imaging at &lt;1.5 T is specifically not recommended. Endorectal coil use is not required but is allowed if thought necessary for image quality. Diffusion weighting with high-b-value (ie, ≥1400 seconds/mm<sup>2</sup>) dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging should be routinely included.
