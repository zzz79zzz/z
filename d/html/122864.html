These conditions comprise a continuum of diseases that includes therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML), therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS), and therapy-related MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasms (t-MDS/MPN). Although t-MNs share certain clinical and biological characteristics with AML, MDS, and MDS/MPN that arise de novo (ie, with no prior exposure to DNA-damaging agents), overall, patients with t-MNs typically have worse outcomes than those with the corresponding de novo AML, primary MDS, or MDS/MPN.</p><p>Management and prognosis of t-MNs are discussed here.</p><p>The epidemiology, causes, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of t-MNs and management and prognosis of de novo AML and MDS are discussed separately.

By definition, all patients with a t-MN had an illness that required prior treatment with a DNA-damaging agent. Medical fitness may be reduced by late effects of the prior illness or its treatment, and some patients may have persistence of the original illness. Some patients have only modest, recent, or transient impairment of functional status, while others have substantial comorbid illnesses, cognitive impairment, or other conditions that may affect their ability to tolerate treatment. Effects of the t-MN itself can impair fitness, so achieving disease control may improve fitness; conversely, effects of treatment may lead to a functional decline.</p><p>For some older patients, a comprehensive geriatric consultation may aid in assessing the individual's ability to undergo and tolerate various therapies, as described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/86177.html" rel="external">"Pretreatment evaluation and prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia in older adults"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4530.html" rel="external">"Acute myeloid leukemia: Management of medically unfit adults", section on 'Pretreatment evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Medical fitness should be reassessed periodically.

Patients with favorable cytogenetic and/or molecular features have longer survival than others. Outcomes are also influenced by comorbid medical conditions and effects of prior disease and its therapy.</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Cytogenetic features</strong> – Cytogenetic features  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef111588" href="/d/graphic/111588.html" rel="external">table 5</a>) are the strongest predictors for outcome with t-MNs. Adverse cytogenetic features include abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and/or 7 and complex karyotype; in general, adverse cytogenetic findings are associated with median OS &lt;1 year [<a href="#rid1">1-3,5,6</a>]. A report of 306 patients with a t-MN reported that median OS was greatest in patients with normal karyotypes or recurring balanced rearrangements (approximately 11 months each) and was shortest in patients with abnormalities of both chromosomes 5 and 7 (approximately five months) [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. As examples, a study of 277 patients with t-MN, in which 39 percent had adverse karyotypic features, reported median OS of 14.6 months [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. In contrast, median OS was 6.3 months in a study in which 76 percent of the 47 patients had adverse-risk cytogenetics [<a href="#rid7">7</a>].

A study of 217 patients with therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) reported <em>TP53</em> mutations in 23 percent, and other studies reported similar rates [<a href="#rid8">8-10</a>]. In one study of 95 patients, multivariate analysis demonstrated that mutant <em>TP53</em> was an independent prognostic marker for inferior OS [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. There is a paucity of data regarding the prognostic significance for t-MN of mutations that are routinely evaluated for risk stratification with de novo AML (ie, <em>FLT3</em>-ITD<em>, CEBPA, NPM1</em>), other mutations associated with de novo AML (eg, <em>TET2, PTPN11, IDH1/2, N-RAS</em>), or genes that are commonly mutated in de novo myelodysplastic syndrome (eg, <em>SRSF2, SF3B1, U2AF1, ZRSR2, ASXL1, EZH2, BCOR,</em> or <em>STAG2</em>) [<a href="#rid6">6,11,12</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Other factors:</strong></p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Disease classification – Outcomes are not known to differ based on whether a patient is classified as having therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) versus t-AML, because t-MNs comprise a continuum of diseases. A study of 155 patients with t-MNs reported that survival rates were not associated with the specific morphologic category of t-MN; instead, outcomes were affected on cytogenetic abnormalities [<a href="#rid13">13</a>]. The diagnostic distinction between t-MDS and t-AML is described separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/4506.html" rel="external">"Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms: Epidemiology, causes, evaluation, and diagnosis", section on 'Diagnosis and classification'</a>.) </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Prior therapy – When compared with patients who had previously received chemotherapy, patients with a t-MN after radiation therapy had a higher frequency of favorable cytogenetic abnormalities (65 versus 12 percent), and this was reflected by better survival rates [<a href="#rid14">14</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Prior malignancy – The status of the prior malignancy contributes to outcomes in this population. As an example, analysis of a cohort of 411 patients with t-MDS that excluded deaths not related to t-MN reported that median t-MDS-specific survival was 17 months, while median OS was 10.3 months; the difference appears to reflect deaths associated with the primary malignancies [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3390283506"><span class="h1">GOALS OF CARE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For most patients with a t-MN, achievement of remission is an appropriate goal, as patients who achieve remission typically have prolongation of survival, including the possibility of long-term disease control, and improved quality of life (QOL). Medical fitness and personal values and fears should be considered in establishing the goals of care, but we do not view age per se as a primary determinant of goals.</p><p>Goals of care should be determined by shared decision-making by clinicians and the patient, with input from loved ones. The goals of care will influence management, including the "aggressiveness" of treatment. Goals should be evaluated at the time of diagnosis and periodically reassessed through the course of the disease. The discussion should acknowledge the generally adverse prognosis and recognize that a t-MN will be a life-ending disease for most patients, while emphasizing the potential short- and long-term benefits of treatment.</p><p>We suggest:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For most medically fit patients, the goal is to achieve long-term survival, while alleviating symptoms and improving QOL. (See <a class="local">'Medically fit'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For medically frail patients, the goals are to prolong life, alleviate symptoms, and/or improve QOL. For some patients with extreme debility, advanced age, or severe comorbid conditions, treatment aimed at modifying the disease course may be inadvisable, and supportive care alone (eg, blood transfusions, antibiotics) or other means of providing symptom relief are offered. (See <a class="local">'Medically frail'</a> below.)</p><p></p><p>Mutual understanding between the patient, family members, and practitioners facilitates goal-setting and decisions regarding health care proxies, do-not-resuscitate directives, and end-of-life decisions. It should be recognized that many patients with hematologic malignancies overestimate their long-term prognosis and chance for cure, and don't recall being offered more than one approach to treatment [<a href="#rid16">16,17</a>].</p><p>Assessment of medical fitness is discussed above.

Compared with lower intensity approaches, intensive remission induction therapy offers the most favorable balance of efficacy and toxicity in this setting. Selection of an intensive treatment regimen is discussed below.

Outside of a clinical trial, there is no consensus regarding a preferred approach, and we consider intensive regimens, targeted treatments, or hypomethylating agents to be acceptable options.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Selection of therapy for a patient with an adverse-prognosis t-MN must be individualized and should reflect the individual's personal values, goals, and concerns. As an example, an especially vigorous or younger (eg, &lt;40 years) patient may favor intensive remission induction therapy, followed by transplantation. Other patients may opt for lower intensity approaches or supportive care alone, due to effects of prior disease and treatment, comorbid illness, age, or personal values.

At these visits we perform a complete blood count and differential count and review of the peripheral blood smear. Bone marrow biopsy and aspirate is not routinely performed but may be informative if the peripheral smear demonstrates abnormalities or if unexplained cytopenias develop.
