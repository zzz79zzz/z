         The foreskin (prepuce) is the excess skin that typically extends approximately 1 cm beyond the glans  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57953" href="/z/d/graphic/57953.html" rel="external">

         ). It provides protection to the urethral meatus and glans penis.
        </p>
        <p>
         The normal foreskin begins to develop as an epithelial fold that grows inward from the base of the glans penis at eight to nine weeks gestation with normal completion by 4 to 4.5 months gestation. The squamous epithelial lining of the inner prepuce is contiguous with the glans penis, resulting in the normal initially circumferential adhesions between the inner layer of the prepuce and the glabrous epithelium of the glans penis.

          History

         – History concentrates on evaluating the urinary stream and any symptoms related to voiding with the following questions:

         Is the urinary stream strong?
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         Is the urinary stream straight? If the answer is no, is there any dribbling or spraying noted?
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         <span class="glyph">
          •
         </span>
         Does the foreskin balloon out when voiding?
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent2">
         <span class="glyph">

         Does the infant/child appear comfortable while voiding?
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p class="bulletIndent1">
         If this reveals any issues with the urinary stream (other than simple ballooning), a more in-depth assessment should be performed. If possible, direct observation of the urinary stream can provide information about complications or potential pathologic conditions of the foreskin. In particular, if the child has to strain to void, that may reflect flow obstruction. Although ballooning can be associated with increased risk of infection, it also reflects separation of the foreskin from the glans, which may be a sign of imminent full retraction. Similarly, spraying may also reflect foreskin separation. (See

It may be possible to visualize the urethral meatus with very gentle retraction (ie, retracting until one feels any resistance) of the tip of the foreskin.

         During well-child checks, the penis and foreskin are assessed for anatomic abnormalities (ie, hypospadias) or signs of pathologic conditions (ie, balanoposthitis). While some degree of phimosis is normal during much of childhood and does not require any intervention, paraphimosis (when the foreskin is retracted behind the glans penis and cannot be returned to its normal position  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76100" href="/z/d/graphic/76100.html" rel="external">

         The foreskin should never be forcibly retracted (see
         <a class="local">
          'Counseling on retraction'
         </a>
         below) during bathing. However, as the foreskin naturally becomes more retractable, the foreskin and the area underneath it can be cleaned and dried. After bathing, the retracted foreskin should always be pulled down to its normal position covering the glans penis. Uncircumcised boys should be instructed on retraction of the foreskin, regular cleaning and drying of the glans, and returning the foreskin to its normal position, since they will be performing their own care as they grow. Failure to replace the foreskin may result in paraphimosis which results in venous and lymphatic congestion of the glans  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76100" href="/z/d/graphic/76100.html" rel="external">
          picture 3

         ). (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6482.html" rel="external">

        <p>
         Educating boys and their caregivers about proper care and hygiene of the uncircumcised penis is an essential part of clinical care [
         <a href="#rid5">
          5
         </a>
         ]. Optimal education reduces anxiety and unnecessary referrals to subspecialists and, perhaps, lowers the risk of pathologic phimosis [
         <a href="#rid6">
          6
         </a>
         ]. However, it seems that this is not routinely done; in one study of pediatric urologists, only 66 percent of those surveyed reported routinely advising parents on routine foreskin care [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ].

         Forcible retraction should be avoided, as it can cause tearing of the preputial skin, leading to bleeding, fibrosis, and potentially pathologic phimosis. For uncircumcised children for whom there is concern that the foreskin is not retracting, who have had frequent infections associated with un-retracted foreskin, or who are older than five years old, we suggest gentle retraction (ie, retracting until one feels any resistance) of the foreskin while bathing. Children and families should be advised that once the foreskin can be retracted past the glans, it is important to return it to its original position. Gentle retraction facilitates the breakdown of adhesions between the inner preputial skin and the glans penis. As the adhesions are broken down, the foreskin becomes progressively more retractile.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although age and toilet training status are often used as guidelines for when to start gentle retraction, expert opinions vary. One study of 204 pediatric urologists reported that approximately half (48 percent) used age of the child as a guide for when to start gentle retraction, 19 percent used toilet training status, 8 percent advised retraction when the foreskin was easily reducible, and 5 percent advised starting retraction at birth [
         <a href="#rid2">
          2
         </a>
         ]. Opinions varied even among those who based their advice on the age of the child. Most respondents (61 percent) advise starting retraction between two and five years of age, but 16 percent advise starting by 6 to 11 years, 13 percent advise starting at less than two years, and 10 percent advise starting at 12 years or older.

         ]. Smegma aids in the process of separation between the foreskin and the glans penis. It appears as a yellow-white cheese-like substance under the foreskin. In boys without a fully retractable foreskin, smegma may form white lumps under the foreskin, often referred to as preputial cysts or pearls. Preputial cysts are benign and usually are located around the corona. They are extruded once the foreskin becomes more retractable.

         Phimosis is defined as an inability to retract the foreskin. It is present in almost all newborn males due to adhesions between the inner layer of the prepuce and the glans penis. Progressive foreskin retraction becomes possible over time as the adhesions break down.
        </p>
        <p>
         Separation of the foreskin from the glans penis occurs by desquamation and begins late in gestation, but separation remains incomplete in most male infants at birth. Only approximately 4 percent of males have a completely retractable foreskin at birth, and in more than half of newborn males the foreskin cannot be retracted far enough to visualize the urethral meatus [
         <a href="#rid3">
          3
         </a>
         ]. After birth, penile growth and physiologic erection aid in the desquamation process and the formation of keratinized pearls (smegma) between the layers, which loosens the adhesions and allows retraction of the preputial skin.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the rate of spontaneous resolution is high, the timing is highly variable, so there is no definite age when the foreskin should be completely retractile [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7-9
         </a>
         ]. In general, over 60 percent of boys in fourth grade are able to either fully or partially retract their foreskin so that part of the glans penis is visible [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Approximately 95 percent retract by puberty. School-age boys without a fully retractable foreskin and their parents/caregivers should be counseled that there is normally a wide range of retractability rate, and over time, there is a very high likelihood physiologic phimosis will spontaneously resolve. The clinician should also reinforce proper preputial hygiene.
        </p>
        <p>
         The incidence of a fully retractable foreskin increases with age as the rate of phimosis decreases [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7,8,10
         </a>
         ]. This was illustrated in a study of 2149 Taiwanese school boys, which reported the incidence of the following five categories of preputial anatomy for three different age groups based on grade level; first, fourth, and seventh grade [

         Although phimosis in infants and children is typically benign and reflects normal development of congenital adhesions between the foreskin and glans, pathologic phimosis can occur, predominantly in older children. Pathologic phimosis is defined as a foreskin that is truly nonretractable due to distal scarring of the prepuce. It may occur after preputial fibrosis due to trauma (ie, forcible retraction), infection, and/or inflammation. The reported incidence of pathologic phimosis ranges from 0 to 16 percent [
         <a href="#rid16">
          16
         </a>
         ]. It is important for primary care clinicians to be able to distinguish between benign, physiologic and pathologic phimosis so that unnecessary referrals to pediatric urologists can be avoided for the patient and his family.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pathologic phimosis should be suspected when patients who were previously able to retract the foreskin can no longer do so. Other symptoms of pathologic phimosis may include:

         Pediatric urology consultation is needed in patients with pathologic phimosis, regardless of whether symptoms are present, since it increases the risk of other foreskin complications (ie, paraphimosis, recurrent urinary tract infections, recurrent/severe balanoposthitis, BXO) [

        </p>
        <p>
         We determine the best alternative treatment based on the clinical findings and the patient/family/caregiver’s preference. Surgical options include preputioplasty (surgical release of the scarred tissue), preputial balloon dilation, and various prepuce preserving plastic surgical procedures designed to widen the preputial ring. Among males requiring surgical intervention for foreskin complications, phimosis is the most common cause, reported in 95 percent in one review [

         Balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO) is a chronic atrophic dermatitis of the foreskin and glans penis of unknown etiology. It is the genital analog of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus and is characterized by white atrophic plaques on the glans penis and foreskin [
         <a href="#rid24">
          24

         In one case series from Children's Hospital Boston over a 10-year period from 1992 to 2002, none of the 41 patients (mean age 10.6 years) with pathologically confirmed BXO were diagnosed prior to referral [

         The frenulum of the penis is an elastic band of tissue under the glans penis that connects to the foreskin and helps contract it over the glans. Frenulum breve is a congenital condition in which the frenulum is too short, and thus restricts the movement of the foreskin. This condition is typically more symptomatic during an erection as the short frenulum pulls the glans ventrally with erection, leading to pain. In severe cases, during sexual stimulation the frenulum can rupture, leading to discomfort and bleeding [

          Routine care
         </strong>
         – The foreskin (prepuce) is excess skin that extends beyond and protects the glans penis and urethral meatus  (
         <a class="graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57953" href="/z/d/graphic/57953.html" rel="external">

          figure 1
         </a>
         ). Care of an infant’s uncircumcised penis includes washing with water and nonirritating soap. The foreskin should never be forcibly retracted. However, as the child grows and the foreskin naturally becomes more retractable, the foreskin and the area underneath it can be cleaned and dried. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Normal anatomy and development of the foreskin'

         <strong>
          Physiologic versus pathologic phimosis
         </strong>
         – Phimosis is the inability to retract the foreskin. Phimosis in infants and children is typically benign (ie, physiologic) and reflects normal development of congenital adhesions between the foreskin and glans. Progressive foreskin retraction becomes possible over time as the adhesions break down. Pathologic phimosis is defined as a foreskin that is truly nonretractable due to distal scarring of the prepuce. It typically occurs in older children, who often present with inability to retract the foreskin after previously being able to do so  (

         ). (See

         <strong>
          Management of physiologic phimosis
         </strong>
         – Physiologic phimosis does not typically need specific treatment given the high rate of spontaneous resolution. However, for boys or caregivers who are concerned about not yet having achieved retraction or who have had frequent infections, we suggest treatment with topical corticosteroids and stretching exercises (
         <a class="grade" href="https:///uptodate/show/grade_6" rel="external">
          Grade 2C
         </a>
         ). Stretching exercises entail gently retracting the foreskin to resistance for one minute several times a day; whenever the foreskin is retracted, it should always be replaced to its normal position covering the glans penis. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Management of pathologic phimosis'

         <strong>
          Management of pathologic phimosis
         </strong>
         – Although conservative measures can be attempted, pathologic phimosis characterized by a cicatrix or scarring typically requires surgical intervention. (See

          'Management of pathologic phimosis'

          Benign conditions

         <strong>
          Paraphimosis is a medical emergency
         </strong>
         – Paraphimosis is caused by foreskin entrapment behind the coronal sulcus, which may result in venous and lymphatic congestion of the glans, and ultimately arterial compromise  (
