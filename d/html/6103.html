         Fluid therapy maintains the normal volume and composition of body fluids and, if needed, corrects any existing abnormalities. In children, the most common abnormality requiring fluid therapy is hypovolemia or dehydration, often related to vomiting and diarrhea from gastroenteritis. Clinically, it is useful to divide fluid therapy into repletion therapy and maintenance therapy.

         Volume depletion reduces the effective arterial blood volume (also called effective circulating volume [ECV]), which refers to that part of the arterial volume that perfuses the tissues. If severe hypovolemia is not corrected in a timely fashion, ischemic end-organ damage may occur and, with profound or persistent hypovolemia, shock and death may ensue.

         Repletion therapy in hypovolemic children is based on two steps:

         </span>
         The first step involves emergent correction of severe or marked moderate hypovolemia, ensuring a return of adequate intravascular volume and avoiding tissue damage. This is primarily provided with intravenous (IV) fluids in developed countries, although successful emergent oral rehydration therapy (ORT) has also been documented. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Emergency fluid repletion phase'

          ●
         </span>
         The second step finishes repletion of fluids and electrolyte losses in children initially treated with emergent IV fluid therapy, and is the only fluid therapy required in patients with mild to mildly moderate hypovolemia. The second step can be completed either intravenously or by ORT. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Secondary fluid repletion phase'

         When repleting a hypovolemic child, several questions must be answered:

        </p>
        <p>
         Once the child has been repleted, ongoing maintenance fluid is needed to replace ongoing losses of water and electrolytes, which is discussed separately. (See

         Rapid volume repletion is required in children with severe hypovolemia. Clinical assessment of hypovolemia is based upon physical signs that reflect the status of the effective arterial blood volume and include pulse, blood pressure, and skin turgor (

          table 1
         </a>
         ). If known, changes in weight and urine output from baseline values are also helpful in assessing the degree of volume depletion. (See
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/6142.html" rel="external">

         Although the degree of hypovolemia is a continuum, hypovolemia is divided into clinical categories primarily for management decisions. (See

          Severe hypovolemia
         </strong>
         — Severe hypovolemia (defined as volume depletion ≥10 percent) presents with decreased peripheral perfusion with a capillary refill of greater than three seconds, cool and mottled extremities, lethargy, and, in its worst manifestation, with hypotension or even frank shock (

         With severe hypovolemia with actual or evolving circulatory compromise, emergent intravenous (IV) fluid therapy should begin with rapid infusion of 20 mL/kg of isotonic

          Moderate hypovolemia
         </strong>
         — In patients with more moderate forms of hypovolemia, it remains uncertain whether IV rehydration should be given, and if so, how rapidly. For children with marked moderate hypovolemia (eg, estimated volume depletion &gt;7 percent), especially if they have been unable to take oral fluids, emergent fluid administration may be appropriate. In most cases, a bolus of 10 mL/kg is given over 30 to 60 minutes with reassessment to decide on administration of a repeat IV bolus versus transition to oral therapy. In some cases of moderate hypovolemia, initial oral rehydration therapy may be sufficient to correct moderate dehydration, and no emergent repletion therapy is necessary. (See
         <a class="local">
          'Oral rehydration therapy'

         In a Canadian trial of 226 children with hypovolemia due to gastroenteritis, there was no difference in the status of hydration two hours after initial IV fluid intervention between patients who were rapidly rehydrated (60 mL/kg) versus those who were treated with the standard 20 mL/kg over one hour [

          4
         </a>
         ]. As a result, patients with mild hypovolemia who may not even require IV rehydration may have been included, which may have led to a biased outcome.

         </a>
         (0.9 percent saline solution or normal saline) is the isotonic solution of choice to restore the circulatory volume. Rapid administration of hypotonic or hypertonic crystalloid solutions for emergent volume expansion can result in serious complications, including dysnatremias, cerebral edema, and, in children with marked hyponatremia, cerebral demyelination [
         <a href="#rid5">

         solution. In a clinical trial of 188 children (age range six months to six years), the administration of 5 percent dextrose added to normal saline solution did not lower the rate of hospitalization compared with the standard use of normal saline solution without dextrose [
         <a href="#rid7">
          7
         </a>
         ]. Children who received the dextrose-containing solution had a greater reduction in serum ketone levels, though these levels were still markedly abnormal and there was no difference between the two groups in degree of metabolic acidosis. Until further studies show that the addition of dextrose provides a significant clinical benefit without adverse effect, normal saline without dextrose is the recommended solution for emergent volume resuscitation.

         Volume repletion is based upon calculation and replacement of water and sodium losses. The water deficit is best estimated from the fall in body weight from baseline, which is usually not exactly known. The sodium deficit is equal to the deficit per liter in serum sodium (SNa) multiplied by the volume of distribution of the osmotic effect of sodium, which is the total body water (TBW):

        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         The TBW in most children is approximately 60 percent of body weight. However, the proportion of body weight is higher in smaller children and infants, especially low birth weight premature infants whose TBW is approximately 80 percent of the total mass (
         <a class="graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56512" href="/z/d/graphic/56512.html" rel="external">
          figure 1
         </a>
         ). The TBW(c) would be the difference between TBW(n) and the fluid loss. (See

         So, for a 10 kg child with a 10 percent hypovolemic loss, the following calculations can be made:

         In patients with isonatremic hypovolemia, the above calculation can be simplified because the serum sodium concentration is close to 140 mEq/L for both the normal and current states. In addition, the difference between the two TBW states is the fluid deficit.

         Hyponatremia in hypovolemic children is usually caused by the intake of hypotonic solutions. Some or most of the free water in these solutions cannot be excreted because hypovolemia also enhances the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), thereby increasing renal water reabsorption. In addition, ADH secretion due to other nonosmotic stimuli including pain, nausea and vomiting, stress, and hypoglycemia can be seen in children with hyponatremia and gastroenteritis [

        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Another factor that can promote correction of the hyponatremia is the administration of potassium to a patient who is also hypokalemic. Potassium is the major intracellular solute and is as osmotically active as sodium. Thus, in a hypovolemic patient who also is hypokalemic, the addition of 40 mEq of potassium into each liter of isotonic

          saline
         </a>
         allows for intracellular potassium repletion and movement of intracellular sodium to the extracellular fluid. The resulting increased intracellular osmolality due to potassium repletion also leads to water movement into the cells. Potassium can be added with the establishment of good urinary flow, adequate renal function, and ability to closely monitor serum potassium concentration. (See

         infusion, plasma sodium should be measured and, if seizures are ongoing, the infusion should be repeated. Once the acute CNS symptoms have abated, the ongoing sodium correction should be tailored so that the total daily correction including the hypertonic saline bolus is less than 12 mEq/L [

         The primary problem with symptomatic hyponatremia is evolving cerebral edema, and the risk of morbidity from delayed therapy is greater than the risk of complication from too rapid correction and osmotic demyelination. As a result, aggressive initial correction is indicated for the first three to four hours (or until the symptoms resolve) at a rate not to exceed a rise in serum sodium of 2 mEq/L per hour [
         <a href="#rid22">

         Children with a serum sodium concentration above 155 mEq/L who are corrected too rapidly are at greatest risk of neurologic sequelae, particularly seizures [
         <a href="#rid25">
          25,26
         </a>
         ]. This adverse response to therapy primarily occurs when the hypernatremia is corrected too rapidly at a rate exceeding 0.7 mEq/L per hour [
         <a href="#rid26">
          26
         </a>
         ]. In comparison, no neurologic sequelae appear to occur if the plasma sodium concentration is lowered at a rate of ≤0.5 mEq/L per hour [
         <a href="#rid27">
          27
         </a>
         ]. (See

         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, the goals of therapy in children with hypovolemia and serum sodium above 155 mEq/L are correction of the volume deficit and gradual correction of the hypernatremia at a rate of less than 12 mEq/L per day (less than 0.5 mEq/L per hour). The overall fluid deficit in hypernatremic hypovolemia is a combination of the free water deficit that raised the serum sodium and an isotonic fluid deficit from the abnormal volume losses (which may be large in children with gastroenteritis and minimal in children with diabetes insipidus who have mainly free water loss).
        </p>
        <p>
         Estimation of the free water deficit (essentially the amount of free water that would have to be lost to produce the observed elevation in serum sodium) is based upon the serum sodium and the estimated current TBW (see
         <a class="medical medical_review" href="/z/d/html/2339.html" rel="external">

         Suppose, for example, a 10 kg child (TBW 0.6 times body weight) has a 1 L fluid loss and a serum sodium concentration of 156 mEq/L. The following calculations can be made:

         During the emergent fluid phase, the patient received a 20 mL/kg bolus of normal

         The water deficit is replaced over more than 36 hours so that the serum sodium would be lowered at a rate below 0.5 mEq/L per hour. The serum sodium concentration must be monitored to ensure that the actual decrease is consistent with the therapeutic plan. (See

         If the hypovolemic child requires hospitalization and IV therapy, an alternative method to fluid therapy recommends the use of isotonic

          saline

         for repletion of fluid losses at an initial dose of 20 to 40 mL/kg over two to four hours [
         <a href="#rid28">
          28

         ]. Maintenance fluid rates, again using isotonic saline, would be initiated when the patient became euvolemic.
        </p>
        <p>
         This approach was suggested to prevent hospital-acquired hyponatremia associated with the administration of IV hypotonic fluids in the setting of significant ADH release [
         <a href="#rid29">
          29,30
         </a>
         ]. Such hyponatremia occurs when hypotonic fluid is administered in the presence of ADH, which is released in response to nonosmotic stimuli such as significant hypovolemia, pain, or anxiety [
         <a href="#rid20">
          20
         </a>
         ]. In this clinical setting, the use of isotonic

          saline
         </a>
         would prevent the development of hyponatremia. Administration of isotonic saline also simplifies the treatment regimen by eliminating the need to calculate sodium and water losses. (See

        <p>
         In one study of children admitted with hypovolemia caused by gastroenteritis, patients were assigned randomly to receive either hypotonic or isotonic IV fluid [
         <a href="#rid31">
          31

         ]. The administration of hypotonic solution (0.45 percent

          saline
         </a>
         ) did not alter the mean sodium level of children who were hyponatremic (from 132 to 133 mEq/L), but decreased the mean sodium level of children who were initially normonatremic (from 137 to 135 mEq/L). The use of isotonic solution increased mean serum sodium levels of initial hyponatremic patients (from 132 to 134 mEq/L), but there was no change in mean sodium levels in the initial normonatremic patients (from 137 to 138 mEq/L). The degree of hypovolemia was not assessed at the time of admission nor was a standardized infusion protocol used, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the full ramifications of this study. Moreover, the clinical significance of these small changes in sodium in normonatremic children is unclear.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nonetheless, the use of isotonic

         infusions as the basis for fluid therapy has been recommended as a safe and effective option for hospitalized children with hypovolemia from gastroenteritis.

          Emergency repletion

         – The first step in treatment of hypovolemia is to correct severe volume depletion with intravenously administered isotonic fluids based on the child’s degree of hypovolemia. Clinical assessment of hypovolemia is based on physical signs that reflect the status of the effective arterial blood volume and include pulse, blood pressure, and skin turgor (
