However, in resource-limited areas, where screening programs are not well established, incidence and mortality rates remain disproportionately high [<a href="#rid1">1</a>]. Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in 42 countries, the majority of which are in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeastern Asia. The highest regional incidence and mortality rates are seen in Africa.</p><p>Compared with other gynecologic cancers, cervical cancer most often affects younger individuals, with a mean age at diagnosis of 50 years [<a href="#rid2">2</a>]. Many of these patients with early-stage disease will be cured and have significant additional life expectancy following completion of treatment. Consequently, they will face years of potential treatment-related side effects. They may also have concerns regarding fertility preservation, and, given their younger age, may have more family and work responsibilities than those with other gynecologic cancers, which will impact their survivorship [<a href="#rid3">3</a>]. Patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) are treated with combination chemotherapy and radiation (chemoRT). While this treatment might be curative, these patients will then live years with significant treatment sequelae and will also lose their fertility as well as ovarian function as a result of treatment.</p><p>This topic will review the approach to cervical cancer survivors.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13395690"><span class="h1">OVERVIEW OF PRIMARY TREATMENT</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Following a diagnosis of cervical cancer, all patients undergo a pretreatment staging evaluation to help determine the approach, which can then be stratified on whether the disease is early or locally advanced at presentation. The overwhelming majority of long-term cervical cancer survivors were originally treated for early-stage or locally advanced cervical cancer. In contrast, the median survival of patients diagnosed with metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer is generally less than two years. Therefore, this section will review the treatment of patients with early-stage or locally advanced cervical cancer.</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H962607291"><span class="h2">Early-stage cervical cancer</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Early-stage cervical cancer is defined as disease confined to the cervix measuring ≤4 cm in size (stage IA to IB2  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119447" href="/d/graphic/119447.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef139268" href="/d/graphic/139268.html" rel="external">table 2</a>)). These patients may be appropriately treated with either radical surgery (which may require adjuvant radiation depending on risk factors) or concomitant chemoradiation, which is usually based on the volume of disease, patient characteristics, and surgical judgment [<a href="#rid4">4</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3246.html" rel="external">"Management of early-stage cervical cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H962607326"><span class="h3">Primary treatment</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Various procedures are performed for the management of early-stage cervical cancer that range from fertility-sparing options to hysterectomy. For most of these patients, a radical hysterectomy will have been performed, which entails removal of the parametrial and paravaginal tissue to include a 2 cm margin of normal tissue around the tumor, and excision of the upper one-third of the vagina. In addition to the hysterectomy, most will have undergone removal of the regional retroperitoneal lymph nodes, which may lead to subsequent issues with lymphedema, among other issues (see <a class="local">'Lymphedema'</a> below). The utilization of sentinel node dissection in cervical cancer has been prospectively shown to decrease lymphedema morbidity [<a href="#rid5">5</a>].</p><p>For select patients, an alternative approach to modified radical hysterectomy may have been performed (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3200.html" rel="external">"Fertility-sparing surgery for cervical cancer"</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A cone biopsy may have been sufficient treatment for patients with microscopically identified cervical cancer (stage IA1).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>A radical trachelectomy (removal of the cervix only) may have been performed, particularly if patients were of reproductive age at the time of diagnosis, and desired fertility preservation.</p><p></p><p>In addition, nonsurgical management with radiation therapy (RT) with or without concomitant chemotherapy may have been performed if patients were not surgical candidates for whatever reason at the time of diagnosis. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3246.html" rel="external">"Management of early-stage cervical cancer", section on 'Alternatives in select populations'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H962607382"><span class="h3">Adjuvant therapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>For patients who were treated with primary surgery, risk criteria are often employed to determine appropriate candidates for adjuvant therapy, which usually consists of RT with or without chemotherapy. Therefore, cervical cancer survivors may report additional therapy after surgery consisting of the following:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Adjuvant RT – RT is usually administered to patients if intermediate risk factors were identified at final pathologic analysis of the uterine specimen. Risk is based on the presence of lymphovascular space invasion, depth of cervical stromal involvement, and tumor size [<a href="#rid6">6</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3246.html" rel="external">"Management of early-stage cervical cancer", section on 'Intermediate-risk disease'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Adjuvant chemoradiation – Concomitant chemotherapy plus RT is usually administered to patients following primary surgery if there is evidence of positive surgical margins, pathologic involvement of the pelvic lymph nodes, or invasion into the parametrial tissue. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3246.html" rel="external">"Management of early-stage cervical cancer", section on 'High-risk disease'</a>.)</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H962607417"><span class="h3">Oophoropexy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>In an effort to preserve ovarian function, patients who underwent RT may have undergone ovarian transposition outside of the RT field. This is discussed in detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3294.html" rel="external">"Ovarian transposition before pelvic radiation"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H962607436"><span class="h2">Locally advanced cervical cancer</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>This category includes patients with cervical tumors &gt;4 cm (stage IB3) and patients with disease that has locally spread outside of the true pelvis and/or invades the bladder or rectum (stage II to IVA  (<a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef119447" href="/d/graphic/119447.html" rel="external">table 1</a> and <a class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef139268" href="/d/graphic/139268.html" rel="external">table 2</a>)). For these patients, primary treatment consists of definitive chemoradiation with weekly doses of <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="9271" href="/d/drug information/9271.html" rel="external">cisplatin</a>, which is used to increase tissue sensitivity to the effects of RT. Although not commonly administered, some patients may have received a second agent (eg, <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8464" href="/d/drug information/8464.html" rel="external">fluorouracil</a> or <a class="drug drug_general" data-topicid="8487" href="/d/drug information/8487.html" rel="external">gemcitabine</a>) during RT. These patients are treated with combination RT (both external beam and brachytherapy) as well as radiosensitizing cisplatin. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3187.html" rel="external">"Management of locally advanced cervical cancer"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H962607467"><span class="h3">Adjuvant chemotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>We do not administer systemic chemotherapy for patients completing primary chemoradiation, as there is limited evidence of benefit to justify the additional toxicity risks. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3187.html" rel="external">"Management of locally advanced cervical cancer", section on 'No role for systemic chemotherapy after chemoradiation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H962607486"><span class="h3">Adjuvant hysterectomy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Some patients may have undergone a hysterectomy following chemoradiation, particularly if they had disease features suggesting they were at a higher risk of relapse (eg, initially large cervical lesion &gt;7 cm, lower uterine segment involvement, or those with post-treatment residual disease). However, this is not uniformly performed because there are no prospective data to show that doing so improves survival outcomes. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3187.html" rel="external">"Management of locally advanced cervical cancer", section on 'Role of hysterectomy after chemoradiation'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25937120"><span class="h1">POST-TREATMENT SURVEILLANCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Surveillance after primary curative therapy for cervical cancer is uniformly recommended, although its effectiveness is not well studied. The main goal of surveillance is early detection of those recurrences that might be amenable to potentially curative salvage therapy. This is only considered in patients who have an isolated central pelvic recurrence. While there is no consensus approach to surveillance, a reasonable strategy takes into account the patient's risk for recurrence (see  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3227.html" rel="external">"Invasive cervical cancer: Patterns of recurrence and post-treatment surveillance", section on 'Surveillance strategies'</a>):</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with high-risk disease (advanced stage, treated with primary chemotherapy/radiation therapy (RT) or surgery plus adjuvant therapy) should be followed every three months for the first two years, every six months for years 3 through 5, and then annually.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Patients with low-risk disease (early stage, treated with surgery alone, no adjuvant therapy) can be followed every six months for the first two years, and then annually.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H962607517"><span class="h2">Components of follow-up</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>A careful clinical examination (including review of systems and comprehensive physical examination) is the most important component of the evaluation. The role of annual cervicovaginal cytology after the first two years of surveillance is controversial [<a href="#rid7">7</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3227.html" rel="external">"Invasive cervical cancer: Patterns of recurrence and post-treatment surveillance", section on 'Cervicovaginal cytology'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H962607535"><span class="h2">Role of imaging</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Imaging has a limited role in the follow-up of asymptomatic cervical cancer survivors. Therefore, no imaging should be performed as part of routine surveillance. In patients with locally advanced cervical cancer, a positron emission tomography scan is typically performed at 12 weeks postcompletion of combination chemotherapy and radiation to assess response. While this scan has been shown to be prognostic, routine surveillance scanning is not recommended [<a href="#rid8">8</a>]. We reserve radiologic examination for the work-up of the patient suspected of recurrent or metastatic disease. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3227.html" rel="external">"Invasive cervical cancer: Patterns of recurrence and post-treatment surveillance"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25937135"><span class="h1">PATTERNS OF RECURRENCE</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cervical cancer survivors are at risk for both local (eg, vaginal or pelvic) and distant recurrences, with most recurrences detected within the first two years of follow-up. This topic is discussed in more detail separately. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3227.html" rel="external">"Invasive cervical cancer: Patterns of recurrence and post-treatment surveillance"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H13395723"><span class="h1">SPECIFIC ISSUES</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>There are more data about cervical cancer survivors compared with what has been published about survivors of other gynecologic cancers. These data suggest that the modalities used in definitive treatment can result in significant symptoms experienced by the long-term survivor [<a href="#rid9">9</a>]. What follows are discussions of specific issues addressed in the literature that relate to this population. More general information on cancer survivorship is discussed elsewhere. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/16613.html" rel="external">"Overview of cancer survivorship care for primary care and oncology providers"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3575442863"><span class="h2">Sequelae specific to radical surgery</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>The anatomic dissection encompassed by a radical hysterectomy is directly related to multiple long-term side effects that differ from those of an extrafascial hysterectomy, which is the procedure of choice when the surgical indication is for benign disease or corpus-confined endometrial cancer, because a radical hysterectomy disrupts the autonomic nervous system in the pelvis. The sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves to the bladder and rectum are often disrupted during the radical hysterectomy because they run in the inferior portion of the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments and are most often divided during the division of the parametrium and uterosacral ligaments. As a result, patients may experience bowel and/or bladder dysfunction [<a href="#rid10">10,11</a>] (see <a class="local">'Bladder dysfunction'</a> below and <a class="local">'Bowel dysfunction'</a> below). Sympathetic denervation can lead to bowel and bladder symptoms, including urinary urgency and incontinence, constipation, and incomplete stool evacuation or fecal incontinence. These symptoms can be divided into acute (in the immediate postoperative period) and long-term effects. The pelvic lymphadenectomy performed as part of the standard surgery can lead to lymphedema, and the resection of the upper vagina included in the radical surgery may lead to sexual dysfunction as a result of a shortened vagina. Finally, division of the utero-ovarian ligaments may result in premature ovarian failure due to disruption of the ovarian blood supply.</p><p>Techniques to decrease the postoperative sequelae of radical hysterectomy include the so-called "nerve-sparing" radical hysterectomy, and sentinel node dissection rather than full pelvic lymphadenectomy [<a href="#rid12">12-14</a>]. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/3244.html" rel="external">"Invasive cervical cancer: Staging and evaluation of lymph nodes", section on 'Surgical evaluation of lymph nodes'</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2553409624"><span class="h2">Sequelae associated with chemoradiotherapy</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>As in the case of radical surgery, there are acute (self-limited) and long-term side effects of combination chemotherapy and radiation (chemoRT). While the acute side effects are short-lived and manageable, the cervical cancer survivor may suffer from lifelong side effects that significantly impact quality of life. Similar to radical surgery, these symptoms are most often related to bowel or bladder function, vaginal function, and loss of ovarian function.</p><p>One study that included mostly patients with stage I disease (73 percent) reported that patients who received radiation with or without chemotherapy had significantly worse quality of life (QOL) when adjusting for other covariates than patients who had surgery alone. The radiated patients also reported higher perceived stress, depression, and anxiety as well as more frequent gynecologic problems [<a href="#rid15">15</a>].</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H962607703"><span class="h2">Bladder dysfunction</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Bladder dysfunction is a common long-term concern for cervical cancer survivors, particularly those treated with chemoradiation rather than radical hysterectomy [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. The incidence varies, but over 20 percent appear to be impacted. As an example, in one study, approximately 25 percent of patients reported treatment-related symptoms such as frequent voiding two years after radiotherapy [<a href="#rid17">17</a>]. The types of symptoms vary, but may include [<a href="#rid18">18-20</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Urinary frequency</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Urgency</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Dysuria</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Hematuria</p><p></p><p>Signs of radiation therapy (RT)-related toxicity include [<a href="#rid18">18-20</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Detrusor instability</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Bladder ulceration</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Incontinence due to vesicovaginal fistula</p><p></p><p>It is noteworthy that the prevalence of bladder morbidity related to RT flattens out after two to three years [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. However, some reports suggest that 20 to 50 percent of patients may have treatment-induced bladder symptoms that have a significant effect on QOL over a 20-year period [<a href="#rid22">22</a>].</p><p>While radical hysterectomy commonly results in bladder symptoms in the postoperative recovery course (including bladder hypertonicity and decreased sensation to bladder filling) as a result of the disruption of autonomic nerve fibers that innervate the bladder, it is not clear that these issues persist in long-term survivors. In one study, 30 to 75 percent of patients reported bladder symptoms, including urinary leakage and urgency, frequent urinary tract infections, and overall urinary dysfunction [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. However, another study suggested that urinary symptoms decrease with time and may no longer be distressing two years postoperatively [<a href="#rid23">23</a>].</p><p>In one study, comparative lower urinary tract toxicities associated with RT or radical hysterectomy in 70 patients previously treated for cervical cancer were evaluated using multichannel urodynamic tests. Most patients included in the study were initially diagnosed with advanced disease and were at least three years post-treatment completion without evidence of recurrent disease [<a href="#rid16">16</a>]. Predictably, more advanced-stage patients were in the RT group and more early-stage patients were in the radical hysterectomy group. While RT and surgery resulted in similar rates of lower urinary tract symptoms (77 versus 71 percent, respectively), the incidence and type of specific toxicities appeared to differ:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>For patients treated with radical hysterectomy, a significantly higher proportion complained of straining symptoms compared with those treated with RT (31 versus 9 percent).

As with bladder symptoms due to RT, the symptoms of bowel dysfunction appear to flatten out after two to three years [<a href="#rid21">21</a>]. However, up to 50 percent of patients report bowel symptoms that negatively impact QOL over a 20-year period [<a href="#rid22">22</a>]. The symptoms of RT-related bowel dysfunction include diarrhea, nausea, and emesis [<a href="#rid24">24,26,27</a>]. Fecal urgency and leakage due to pelvic RT impacts from 10 [<a href="#rid21">21</a>] to 27 percent [<a href="#rid28">28</a>] of patients and can be present five years after pelvic RT [<a href="#rid28">28</a>]. Its presence is associated with social isolation and a negative impact on QOL [<a href="#rid21">21</a>].</p><p>Methods to reduce bowel toxicity from radiation therapy include the use of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). IMRT allows minimization of the volume of radiated small intestine. One study reported results following treatment of 71 patients with RT; 46 were treated with IMRT and 25 with conformal RT. After a median follow-up of 18 months, 31 percent of patients had grade 2 bowel toxicity and 12.6 percent had grade 3 or higher bowel toxicity. The authors concluded that restricting small and large bowel dose volume can reduce the incidence of severe late bowel toxicity to less than 5 percent [<a href="#rid29">29</a>]. Another study prospectively considered 60 patients treated with IMRT compared with 62 treated with conventional RT [<a href="#rid30">30</a>]. The IMRT patients experienced lower acute (proctitis, enteritis, cystitis, myelosuppression, and dermatitis) and chronic (enterocolitis and cystitis) toxicities than did those treated with conventional RT. There were no significant differences in overall survival between groups. A small prospective randomized trial of 44 patients has confirmed these results for gastrointestinal toxicity and overall survival [<a href="#rid31">31</a>].</p><p>Patients who underwent a radical hysterectomy are also at risk for bowel symptoms, including constipation, incomplete emptying, and fecal incontinence, which may be due to partial denervation of the bowel [<a href="#rid32">32</a>]. However, while bowel symptoms can be very distressing following surgery [<a href="#rid25">25</a>], some studies suggest that they improve with time and may resolve within two years after surgery [<a href="#rid11">11,23</a>].

This can be complicated by fibrosis around the vaginal cuff as a result of surgery [<a href="#rid23">23,33</a>]. In one study, 25 percent of patients reported distressing symptoms, including decreased lubrication and short vaginal length [<a href="#rid34">34</a>].

Lymphedema can follow both radical hysterectomy, especially if a pelvic node dissection was performed, and RT-containing treatment [<a href="#rid45">45</a>]. Multiple studies demonstrate that up to 25 percent of patients reported lymphedema to be moderately or very distressful five years after radical hysterectomy [<a href="#rid3">3,23,25,46</a>]. Lymphedema also may not improve over time, even after extended follow-up [<a href="#rid24">24</a>].

Unfortunately, providers often underestimate the physical symptoms that their patients are experiencing [<a href="#rid3">3,21</a>]. Much of this underestimation is due to a failure to ask on the part of the provider and a reluctance to report on the part of the patient. Future study needs to focus on accurately measuring QOL physical effects on patients following chemoradiation for locally advanced cervical cancer. Future work is necessary to better characterize and increase awareness of fatigue as a long-term consequence of cervical cancer treatment. (See  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2802.html" rel="external">"Cancer-related fatigue: Prevalence, screening, and clinical assessment"</a> and  <a class="medical medical_review" href="/d/html/2813.html" rel="external">"Cancer-related fatigue: Treatment"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H25937930"><span class="h2">Psychosocial issues</span><span class="headingEndMark"> — </span>Cervical cancer patients report more anxiety, depression, and stress than other gynecologic cancer survivors. Supportive interventions addressing distress in the survivorship period may be helpful in improving QOL. Psychosocial issues that may affect the long-term cervical cancer survivor are discussed briefly below:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Mood disturbances</strong> – Cervical cancer survivors have reported more mood disturbances, specifically anxiety, dysphoria, anger, and confusion, when compared with patients with other gynecologic cancers and patients without cancer [<a href="#rid51">51-54</a>]. Estimates vary based on the study design and questionnaires used, but in one, up to 50 percent of long-term survivors admitted to experiencing psychosocial issues related to their cancer of sufficient severity to warrant an interest in counseling [<a href="#rid55">55</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">One study evaluated the changes in anxiety over time among cervical cancer survivors [<a href="#rid44">44</a>]. While 20 to 25 percent of patients reported baseline severe anxiety, there was a significant improvement in the severity of symptoms at three months and a subsequently documented plateau in symptom severity over the following two years. However, 10 to 15 percent of patients continued to report severe anxiety at two years.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">In contrast, depressive symptoms appear to be a lesser issue than anxiety in long-term survivors [<a href="#rid54">54</a>]. Despite this, cervical cancer survivors may be more likely to display negative mood states, even at five years post-diagnosis [<a href="#rid54">54</a>]. The etiology is unclear, though it may be due to lifestyle factors (eg, smoking, employment, and relationship status).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1">Risk factors for a mood disorder among cervical cancer survivors include [<a href="#rid55">55,56</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Lower educational levels</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Unemployment</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The presence of medical comorbidities</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Age &gt;50 years</p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Lack of social support</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Fear of recurrence</strong> – Fear that a cancer may return contributes to a survivor's feeling of loss of control and unpredictability and can impact not only the patient but also her family and social network [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. In one study, up to 91 percent of patients with cervical cancer admitted to worry about the risk of recurrence [<a href="#rid49">49</a>]. The presence of this fear may aggravate anxiety, as patients worry about symptoms such as vaginal bleeding, discharge, and pain as representing recurrence of cancer [<a href="#rid51">51</a>].</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span><strong>Body image issues</strong> – Lower self-esteem and a poor body image have been reported in several studies [<a href="#rid17">17,25,35,57-60</a>]. This can be a problem particularly for patients who were of reproductive age at the time of diagnosis and for whom childbearing was important [<a href="#rid24">24,57,58</a>].

The estimated number needed to screen for oropharyngeal cancer (282) and anal cancer (1272) was less than the number needed to screen for cervical cancer.</p><p>There are no formal guidelines regarding screening for oropharyngeal cancer in cervical cancer survivors. We recommend a careful review of oral symptoms and examination of the oral cavity by the clinicians following these patients. The review of systems includes questions about difficulty swallowing, unexplained ear or oropharyngeal pain, oral lesions or lumps, hoarseness, or a feeling of a lump in the throat. In all adults, the American Dental Association good practice statement recommends that dentists review the medical, social, and dental history and perform conventional visual and tactile examination intraorally and extraorally at dental visits [<a href="#rid62">62</a>]. The US Food and Drug Administration has not approved any HPV test for detecting HPV in the mouth.</p><p>It is also appropriate to discuss the risk of anal cancer. Patients should be informed about the types of symptoms (eg, anorectal bleeding, pain, or growths) that warrant assessment by a clinician. No formal screening guidelines are available for following asymptomatic patients and variation exists among approaches (eg, frequency of digital anorectal examination, whether to perform anal cytology) [<a href="#rid63">63-65</a>].
